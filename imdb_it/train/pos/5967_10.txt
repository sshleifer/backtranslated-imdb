Sammi, Curr a metal rock god, tried to stop him, they tried to ban him, the attempt to censor his music !! (very similar to the real life Dee Snider, from Twisted Sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osborne) Killed in a fire, Sammi Cure had to play Halloween at his old school for a dance .. Now Eddie Weinbauer, his # 1 fan , and the only one who knew how sammi was, and what he felt (or is it?) Nuke, the DJ at the local radio station (Gene Simmons) has and gives the only copy of Sammi's last record, Eddie .. But when Eddie tries to play the disc backwards, he finds Sammi talking to him from the dead, and tells him what to do to get back to his school bullies who hate him and his music .. Everything works until, Sammi start killing !! A great movie to watch for heavy metal hairband enthusiasts, with a fantastic Fastway soundtrack, and if you don't know what the songs sound like or you know Fastway and don't like them, they changed the voice a little and c ' it's also style for playing like Cinderella, or Ratt. Is the film a real horror movie? Well, it depends on what you call a horror movie, For me a real horror movie is a slasher, with a lot of murders, or just being scary .. This movie is neither, not enough dead, but it can't be called an action, comedy, drama, suspense or thriller, that's why I suppose it should be a horror movie .. So if you want "Rock N 'Roll, Rockin' on mid night steel your soul !!" Than Sammi Curr and Trick or Treat is for you .. I mean "what are you afraid of? It's just Rock 'N' Roll!?!"
