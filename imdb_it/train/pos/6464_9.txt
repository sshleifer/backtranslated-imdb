Wow, I loved this movie! It's about normal life in a small village. About hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Great! These are things that everyone encounters in life. You have to do things with passion. But some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you. There are people who find the opinion of others and what neighbors will think is more important than following their heart. Don't let someone's opinion stop you from realizing your dreams and your passion. I loved the fact that the actors were all normal people, could have been my family. There are no great beauties, but all the people you fall in love with during the film.
