Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare (Yokai daisenso, 2005) a film about "yokai" or traditional Japanese folklore monsters. Alternatively it is known as Big Monster War or Ghosts on Parade. <br /> <br /> The yokai of the first episode include the hooligan hoodlum, kappa water imp, a "living brella", a woman whose jaws can grow extremely gigantic, a woman with a second face on the nape, a dwarf priest with a huge, pumpkin-like wrist, and so on. <br /> <br /> These types of extravagant monsters derive not only from the fairy tradition, but from a type of summer entertainment from the Tokugawa era, comparable to today's haunted Halloween houses, or to the "monsters" of yore but with exclusively fake freaks. Ghosts and monsters of goldfish and dancing single-headed umbrellas were invented to create "chills" during the hot summers. Fatcheek and similar women have been recreated with tricks or illusions, based on monsters depicted in medieval parchments; and if their design for the film is a bit simple and fun, this makes them even more representative of what has historically been recreated for the summer chills. <br /> <br /> These rather endearing monsters must face and destroy an ancient Babylonian vampire demon who came to Japan and disguised as a samurai lord. Although some of the Japanese appearances are a bit silly, and too many of the costumes are definitely more than the masks without even moving their lips while they talk, it's all played a lot in poker and it's very fascinating. It has a beautiful photograph, very similar to that of a CGI movie of the same decade. Seen in the right frame of mind or with the right friends, it is exciting, moving and touching. <br /> <br /> Yoshiyuki Kuroda also directed the famous Wolf and puppy: White Heaven & Hell (1974) and was the special FX director for Daimajin's excellent trilogy. The Yokai Monsters series is not the best of Majin, but the Yokai are still very funny. The first film miike, which is the most child-oriented film of his family films, with GOZU and IZOO consecutively more serious but not too severe for young viewers.
