I loved this movie. I am a Mexican and was offended by it. In fact, I think this film should be shown at police headquarters throughout Mexico. It is sad to know that our police system is rotten like a 3-month corpse. It makes me angry to read in the news as the killers, kidnappers and other slime are freed by paying a laughable fine or living like kings in prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy, the character of Denzel Washington. A bodyguard turned into a vengeful vigilante. Kidnapping is a thriving industry down here (at least in the big cities). Actually I wish the real kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one in which Creasy did his excellent job. It would be so wonderful (sorry, I'm so resentful!). MAN ON FIRE is a compelling film not to be missed. It might be difficult for some of you if you are not used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do it all the time while watching American movies) but the effort will be worth it. Some changes are a bit confusing ... a bit like TRAFFIC, remember? (another brilliant idea of ​​how corrupt Mexico is). The film starts a little slow but the pace starts frantically within the second half. I swear you'll cheer as you watch Denzel Washington send the wrong people. His performance is nothing short of excellent. The ending (no spoilers, OK !!!) is a little sad, but I'm sure you'll like it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best films of the year. A "must have" for a DVD collection! 9 * out of 10
