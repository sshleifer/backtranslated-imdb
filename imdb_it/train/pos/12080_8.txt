Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take a position as secretary with the wealthy Hughes family to convince her boyfriend to leave her. Almost immediately she is drugged and sent to the family estate in Cornwall. When she wakes up, they continue to tell her that she is Marion Hughes, she is mentally ill and keeps it closed ... but why? You'll probably understand why, but you won't mind because that's fun. <br /> <br /> Together with "The Narrow Margin" and "Face Behind the Mask", this is one of the best B photos ever made. (B images were low-cost images made quickly with low budgets and no major stars). It is as long as it should be (only 65 minutes), it is well directed, fast and exciting. Only at the end do I come across the part that I found a little too implausible to buy. <br /> <br /> Foch (a good actress) is OK, but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent (and scary) like the bad guys. Worth catching. A perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a limited budget.
