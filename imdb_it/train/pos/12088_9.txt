Hardcastle and McCormick are an excellent television program. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is predictable very similar to The Dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, The A-Team, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> This show is just a good clean television. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is pretty funny. Often they take each other an episode several times, which adds a lot of humor to the show. It contains several car chases in almost every episode, but who doesn't enjoy a good car chase? Especially with the Coyote! <br /> <br /> I just wish they would do clean television like this today, I highly recommend it!
