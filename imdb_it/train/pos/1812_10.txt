This is one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps even the greatest film of all time. I had forgotten about the film for about 12 years. Until I saw an ADGTH TV add-on and it brought back good memories of me watching it when I was a kid. And when I saw it a few nights ago I became addicted to the movie. I don't usually like animated family movies, but this is special, it's the perfect movie for the whole family. <br /> <br /> The ending of the film always touches my heart and makes me very sad but this is what makes this movie incredible better than all the rubbish coming out of children's movies today. I mean the movie is G rated and it's about 2 dogs that are involved with gambling, there's a lot of smoking, drinking, murder, death and hell depicted in the movie. Which I believe makes the film from good to great. I mean that films today do not bring reality to children and in this film they did. <br /> <br /> RIP Judith Barsi & Dom DeLuise
