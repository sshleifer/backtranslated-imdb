I saw this film for the first time as a child and it is the only time in my life that I remember putting my hands on my face and eyes in total horror in a particular scene. I remembered it again with a discussion with my friends, and readily bought them on video with a lot of hesitations I could add (to my surprise I found it only on the web in the United States when it was made in England!) When I saw my reaction again and to my surprise it was almost the same, of pure terror and fear and my heart never beat so much. This is in my opinion the most SCARIEST movie ever made, Hollywood movies seem tame in comparison and a bit Pony and Trap, excuse the pun. What is surprising, however, is the power of this film and unis when you look at this with a score of my colleagues that I've never heard so many screams, even guys! Even watching the video brings me into the fear of God of that particular scene, and left me with the feeling that I'll never go back alone in the dark !!!!
