Very light spoiler <br /> <br /> This film (despite being only on TV) is absolutely excellent. I didn't pay much attention to differences in appearance or accent, so I can't really comment on it. The acting in this was so good that I had to pinch myself and say "Remember, it's just a movie, this DIDN`T REALLY HAPPENS". As I sat and listened to Harris and Quinn's speeches, I knew that was exactly what John and Paul would have talked about if they had actually had this meeting. John's offensive comments and burns concerned his character (especially in the restaurant!), As well as his depression while Paul was very accommodating and relaxed. Both actors did a great job and I was thrilled to see this movie. It's a wicked experience for all Beatles fans. And prepare for a few surprises!
