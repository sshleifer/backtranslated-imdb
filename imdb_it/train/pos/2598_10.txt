As if the film had no value in itself, this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to its reading. In the summer of 1968 I saw the film in New York; falling into graduate school, I read the book for the first time. The pleasure of reading the novel was my recollection of the film scrupulously detailed. And for better or for worse - and now I've read and taught the novel for over thirty years - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.
