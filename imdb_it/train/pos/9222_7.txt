There have been too few traditional films set in post-colonial Africa, and those that have a mixed group. This, with its altruistic claims to expose slavery in the 1970s, shows the best and worst values ​​in Africa, which are not too different from the values ​​of humanity as a whole. It also has shortcomings, given the undue influence of Western pre-conceptions of Africans and, above all, of Arabs. <br /> <br /> Dr. Anansa Linderby, the beautiful African American wife of British doctor David Linderby, is captured by Arab slave traders, along with a teenage girl Sanufu and a boy. The main slave merchant, Suleiman, is in any case the Arab stage, with its flowery and sometimes humorous rhetoric, and gestures to match - that would not be out of place in "Carry On Follow that Camel" but I am not up to the standard film deserves Peter Ustinov naturally had more than enough skill to deal with some of the shortcomings of the script, and saved what might otherwise have been a sad one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> Continuing the stereotypical theme, all three Arab Suleiman employees are not intelligent and have pedophile tendencies towards the boy, which fortunately are not portrayed on the screen. <br /> <br /> One of David's first points of contact is the local police officer, a pompous and incompetent stereotypical African bureaucrat. David then meets two stereotypical white ex-pats, an Englishman (Walker, played by Rex Harrison) and an American (Sandell, played by William Holden). Sandell is a mercenary with "conventional" views on mixed race relationships, who initially refuses to help unless David makes payment in advance. Won David's love for Anansa and aware of his inability to find love, he agrees to bring David into his helicopter to help Anansa search. They find Suleiman and his prisoners crossing the border and unable to follow them into nearby territory - due to Sandell's hesitation and David's lack of experience with firearms, his helicopter is shot down, but David survives. <br /> <br /> Then we see David presented to Malik (Kabir Bedi), an African who lost his family in Suleiman and is now guided only by revenge. They find the girl Sanufu with a group of Tuaregs and they know they are on the right path to find Suleiman. <br /> <br /> In one of the most heartbreaking scenes he kills a group of slave traders only to discover that he was not the Suleiman group, and he had no choice but to send the prisoners to the Tuaregs they had encountered before. <br /> <br /> Later we find out that the boy who was raped is a sorcerer and, in an excellent scene with supernatural nuances, he uses his knowledge to kill one of Suleiman's henchmen. Anansa on his part - and despite the skepticism of the boy - manages to plan the disappearance of the other two employees of Suleiman. <br /> <br /> At this point, Suleiman and his slaves are in a few days to reach the slave market. /> <br /> Suleiman, now no doubt that Anansa is "trouble", tries to sell it to a dark and rich Arab prince (Omar Sharif) who is corrupt but intelligent. Discovering that Anansa is an American who works for the U.N., the prince decides rather unwisely to continue the negotiation without considering the consequences. The scene in which the two men contract is one of the best in the film. <br /> <br /> At the slave market, the boy is sold to a middle-aged German pedophile, and we can only guess if the boy will still be considered "wunderbar" when his master receives his abilities of sorcerer. <br /> <br /> David and Malik finally face Suleiman and there is a bitter-sweet ending from Malik's point of view. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, David and Anansa are reunited, and Malik, whose life is in ruins, can console himself for having seen the task he set himself. <br /> <br /> the overall plot of the film is excellent but it loses the marks for its stereotypical portrayal of almost all the main characters. Merit must go to all the key players to address many of the shortcomings of scripting.
