I couldn't find anyone to watch DiG! with me because nobody I knew was a fan of both bands. Of course everyone thought that you could enjoy this movie only if you like the music of The Dandy Warhols or Brian Jonestown Massacre, but this is so far from the truth. The only requirement is that you have an interest in music and / or pop culture in general. The way in which the two groups' careers are parallel is a perfect representation of the paths a band can take, and watching the public eat and spit Dandy Warhols is fascinating. I agree with other reviews that mention the fact that it would be nice to receive a last word from Anton himself, since he is clearly depicted as his worst enemy and the bulwark of the band's ability to stay. <br /> <br /> for me it is the respect of the Dandys for the BJM (despite their lack or reciprocity) and for Anton (despite his irregular behavior). The Dandy Warhols respect the art that the group produces even if the group hates everything that the Dandy Warhols now represent (even if this is questionable). The best joke is when the Dandy drummer says "I'll never get them anywhere else" and the guitarist will unconsciously exclaim "I'll still buy their records anyway". For me, this shows how powerful good music can be. <br /> <br /> Definitely see this movie, even if you know nothing about either band. It's more about the themes of rock music and how they develop that makes this film so interesting. It is rare to follow such a close group for so long.
