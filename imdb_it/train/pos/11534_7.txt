Mirage (1990) is a very rare horror / chiller from 1990, published here in the United Kingdom under the label "New World Video". <br /> <br /> It is a horror film set in the desert on a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend, only to be killed one by one by an unknown force driving a threatening black truck !!! This film has some scary scenes, and a bit of blood here and there, but I have to say that the acting was so disgusting, even by low budget standards! But the film was strangely compelling and I liked it, and I never fell asleep or turned off, which is always a good sign! I almost gave this film for 6/10, but since it developed along the way, it had some good moments of cold blood and suspense, it had some beautiful nudity, and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was also a beautiful! I'll give it 7/10.
