Rob Estes, Josie Bisset and a bunch of kids who don't look like any of them. <br /> <br /> Basically, Rob and Josie have a shotgun wedding on a drunken night while vacationing in Las Vegas. Each of them returns home and discovers that their respective children already know about the wedding due to the tabloid's non-fodder. They, Rob and Josie, transfer both their eight children into one or the other house. <br /> <br /> Rob builds furniture, I think, which is close enough to the construction work of Frank Lambert (Patrick Duffy) the very similar Step by Step to justify an eternal mockage. <br /> <br /> Josie is a sort of cookie queen, though she doesn't look like she's making any of the cookies. Not close enough to the hairdresser of Carol Foster (Suzanne Somers) to justify the mockage of similarity, but hilariously absurd enough to justify an atrocity. <br /> <br /> Unlike Step by Step, they were a couple before the holiday and actually knew one another's last names, or so it is assumed that they are serious enough about a relationship to take a trip together. <br /> <br /> However, there are eight children; Moira, Sandy, Jeff, Lily, Daisy, Nathan, Andrew L. and Andrew B. I personally think they should have called young Andrew "Andy". <br /> <br /> There is a lot of positioning products, particularly for Soup at Hand (which is disgusting) and Listerine Pocket Pack. There are also some stupid and meaningless moments. Moreover, it is not a great film to promote happy families. <br /> <br /> But, hey! Rob Estes! This concludes my review of "Step by Step ... on some really bad drugs". Watch it for Rob Estes and his beautiful eyes! There are beautiful pretty eyes!
