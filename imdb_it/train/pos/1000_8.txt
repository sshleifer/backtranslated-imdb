I liked the movie. Some action scenes were very interesting, tense and well done. I especially liked the opening scene that contained a semi-truck. A very tense action scene that seemed well done. <br /> <br /> Some transition scenes were shot in interesting ways like time lapse photography, unusual colors or interesting angles. Even the movie is fun is in different parts. I also liked how the villain is depicted. I would give the film to 8 out of 10.
