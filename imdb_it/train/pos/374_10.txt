Rating "10/10" Master piece <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I heard Spielberg comment that he would redo the film here and there if he had a chance. Well, Mr. Spielberg, I think nothing is perfect, but this film - along with that of Schindler's List - is the best. Even Oprah does well in this! <br /> <br /> What struck me most was the realism of the plot and the drama. Things like these have happened and are still happening in the world.
