I'm a fan of animal films. If you can make a plot and put animals as main actors, you usually conquer me. Homeward Bound did just that. They took a plot as old as time and turned it around again. It was a complete success. It is a very archetypal film. You have the wob of the group (shadow) which is wise and logical, you have the lovable but impetuous and treacherous hope, and the little girl who thinks she should be pampered and praised. These three personalities bounce off one another very well. I also like how Chance and Sassy have made such dynamic characters, and they haven't been late. Most people say it can't be good because it's too much for a children's movie. What they are forgetting, however, is that it is supposed to be a children's movie, and that doesn't detract from the acual film. This is a good movie to watch when you're bored and you just want to watch a movie. It's a Disney movie without cartoons, a budding film with a better plot. I would, without doubt, advise you to look at it.
