I found this exciting film from the beginning - like in a Spielberg movie - and I found the plot interesting because I was trying to figure out what the current situation was. <br /> <br /> Right from the start - before the opening credits - the action starts, bringing with it the immediate suspense. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are very nice. (I have a hard time appreciating any of the Baldwins, due to Alec's extra-curricular political activities, but William was not bad in this film.) <br /> <br /> There were several unexpected twists, which have contributed to the fun. <br /> <br /> There were, unfortunately, many places where there was an annoying high-pitched sound in the soundtrack - something like 19K Hz. I suspect the microphone is detecting video monitors on the set.
