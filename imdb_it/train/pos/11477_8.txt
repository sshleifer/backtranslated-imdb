In my honest opinion, everyone should see this movie at least once. He really put things in perspective while watching him. Even though it was invented, this film is about something that could happen to your children. <br /> <br /> Shows how easily two children can hide both their hatred for their school and their plans to murder innocent students. This film would not work in any other format. They removed the camera by hand, perfectly. <br /> <br /> It reminds us of April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and then themselves. It also reminds us of the media storm that followed. Everyone wanted to see the Rampart video and everyone wanted to see the Basement tapes. <br /> <br /> This film is an imaginary version of our dreams that come true. We will see the boy behind the monster. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing about this movie is that it was not good on the market, and few people know it existed. If he had had a single preview of a single hit movie, everyone would go to see what it was, Zero Day. <br /> <br /> I think this is the best film adaptation of a school shoot-out of the few who really tried it. The shooting itself takes only about ten minutes of the hour and a half of film, because it focuses mainly on Cal and Andre, and what they did up to that point. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie yet, go get it and watch it. I guarantee you that when it's over, you'll be speechless.
