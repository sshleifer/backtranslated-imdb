Despite the other comments listed here, this is probably the best Dirty Harry movie made; a film that reflects - for better or for worse - the socio-political sentiments of the country during the Reagan glory years of the early 1980s. It's also a kickass action movie. <br /> <br /> Inaugurated with a female liberal judge who turns a murder case upside down due to lack of tangible evidence and then directly enters the coffee shop meeting with several unfortunate thugs (the scene that suggests the famous "Go ahead , make my day ")," Sudden Impact "is a non-stop roller coaster of an action movie. The first time you catch your breath is when the annoying inspector Callahan is sent away to a nearby town to investigate the background of a murdered hood. From there it only gets better with a group of grotesque thugs for Callahan to face along with a sherriff with a mysterious past. Superb direction and photography and an exhilarating script help make this movie one of the best of the 80s.
