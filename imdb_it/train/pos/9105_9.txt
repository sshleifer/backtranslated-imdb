Women have never been so attractive and pathetic as in the Salazar Piedras movie. Although the editing of an editor here and there may help the film, it is exciting and fun with an intense sign from the latest films by Pedro Almodovar. 5 different women are facing their male partners and their families. Starting with several stories that will meet as the plot progresses, Salazar portrays his female characters in the same neurotic and borderline behavior familiar to Almodovar. A kleptomaniac woman of high society with smaller fattening shoes, a burlesque lady who takes care of her disabled daughter, a drug addict dancer obsessed by her ex boyfriend and a taxi driver who takes care of the deceased husband's disturbed children, all in touring the streets of Madrid in well-designed scenes. Using some of Almodovar's family actresses, the director manages to give depth to all the characters who share the film and to create sincere sympathies with each of them in his first film. Women control the plot, and men are destined to be left to each other in the end ... Surprisingly good for a first film, and worth the time in any standard. It is clear that Salazar has hesitated in some necessary guidelines for the actresses, but an impressive gesture is shown on the screen, in particular by Monica Cervera, who starred in her previous short film. <br /> <br /> A must for all Almodovar fans and pleasing everyone.
