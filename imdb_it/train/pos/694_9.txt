An Insomniac's Nightmare is the story of a man's dive into madness. Having chronic insomnia, Jack is tormented by hallucinations; causing him to try to determine what is real and what is not. <br /> <br /> We discover interesting things about Jack towards the end and we think that when the film is finished we will have a "happily ever after" the end of Hollywood. Mistaken. This is New York City, the place where nobody sleeps. <br /> <br /> Tess Nanavati (writer and director) has a good film in "A nightmare of nightmare". A talented director and writer (she made this film immediately after her maturity), has real potential and will be one to watch in the future. <br /> <br /> While watching this short film I was constantly uncomfortable; between the music, a gloomy scenery and the realistic representation of a sleepless Dominic Monaghan (like Jack), I wanted desperately to turn it off sometimes just to escape from it.
