I had the pleasure of seeing this beautiful film last night, with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director who follows the vision. I suspect the first commentator never lost a parent or someone very close to them in death. I had a lot of losses like this and this movie told me about it. One of the main themes is the way we do not deal with issues / problems / stories with our loved ones until it is too late - they are too incapable or dead before that happens. Talk to your loved ones, listen and record their stories, tell the people you love, solve the differences. I loved the message that there are no mistakes. I love the portrait of the director of the relationship between the two daughters - as one of the six brothers, it is clear to me that he understood how complex these relationships are. His story as a filmmaker also comes through loud and clear - what a beautiful film! The casting is exceptional - a film not to be missed!
