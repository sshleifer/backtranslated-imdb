I love horses and I admire hand-drawn animation, so I expected nothing short of wonder from the new animated image of Dreamworks Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron. I guess you can say that I was a little disappointed. You have a wonderful animation and at first it seems a perfect story. A story absolutely nothing but a horse in nature. Animals do not sing nice songs or even speak - an important advantage. Unfortunately, the film has an unusual narrative by Matt Damon; a cheesy soundtrack by Bryan Adams; and enough action scenes to compare with a Jerry Bruckheimer production. If the directors had simply remained with simplicity, we would have a masterpiece here. This is not a great movie, but it is good entertainment for small children. I would recommend this film to families because it has the heart in the right place and it is the only thing out there right now that is not offensive to small children. Not bad, but could have been much better. However, very nice graphics.
