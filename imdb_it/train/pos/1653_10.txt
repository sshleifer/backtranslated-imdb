I agree with all those who say that this series was the best of the "spy" genre. My husband and I were fascinated when he first aired in the United States and watched every episode. I tried at that moment to buy the series (I fully recorded it) but WGBH told me it wasn't available. I even thought of writing to Ian Holm to see if he could have a copy! Like others, I bought and read the Deighton series (partly to understand the complicated plot). If the original version will be available on DVD, I will be among the first in line to make a copy. Ian Holm's portrait of the vulnerable but brave Bernard Samson was surprising. (It's always great).
