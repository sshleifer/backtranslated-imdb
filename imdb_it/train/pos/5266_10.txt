Well, some people would say that this particular movie smells ... but hey! It's not fair, it's not right at ... The film may not have the best special effects, and it may not have the best actors (Except for the exuberance of the Barbarian Bros.) Despite the minor fact, I can honestly say that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and I've seen!
