Originally screened in America in 1972, "The Night Stalker" became the most voted for T.V. film in history. Based on the unpublished novel by Jeff Rice, he told how a fearless investigative reporter named Carl Kolchak (the late Darren McGavin) discovered the existence of a vampire in modern Las Vegas. When he arrived on British television four years later, he didn't have the same impact, but my friends talked about it at school Monday morning, as did me. We all agree that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen. <br /> <br /> I didn't know about the existence of "The Night Strangler" until it appeared almost a decade later. I.T.V., which screened the films "Kolchak", had apparently decided to broadcast the spin-off series; they felt that "Barnaby Jones" with Buddy Ebsen was more like a tie, and in any case the spectators could confuse "Kolchak" with "Kojak"! For years my only source of information about the show was an article in the Fangoria magazine. I couldn't even buy Jeff Rice novels. <br /> <br /> Then something wonderful happened. In 1990, B.B.C.-2 released the show as part of a Friday night series dedicated to the supernatural called "Mystery Train", hosted by Richard O'Brian. 'Kolchak' found himself next to "The Brain Eaters" and "Earth Vs.The Spider". The opening credits were cut, eliminating Kolchak's whistle and the credits ... well, there were none. <br /> <br /> The first projected episode was "Werewolf". I can't say I was very impressed, but I was stuck with it, and I'm glad I did! <br /> <br /> I really wish I had seen it in 1974. My twelve year old would have loved it. Disturbing, funny, exciting, it's no wonder he infused the imagination of Chris Carter. <br /> <br /> The main resource of the show was, of course, McGavin. Unlike the recent Kolchak, the original was a figure of every man, dressed in an eccentric way, rather conservative. It was for the supernatural what "Columbo" was for crime. Even the late Simon Oakland was as good as the caprice of Kolchak, the boss Tony Vincenzo. The screenplays overflowed with a wonderful dry spirit. I found myself enjoying the program more because of the humor content than the horror. When the twenty episodes ended, I felt deprived. <br /> <br /> 'The X-Files' arrived a few years later and filled the void - but only in part. I wanted Kolchak and Vincenzo back. I'm glad the show was never revived. Without Oakland it would not have been the same. <br /> <br /> I have rice books now and read them several times. I was very surprised when Stephen King announced the first album (in his book 'Danse Macabre') because it's as good as anything he wrote. <br /> <br /> Okay, so some of the monsters were hardly up-to-date, but then? The new 'Kolchak' has totally missed the point of the original. What you don't see is sometimes scarier than what you do ... <br /> <br /> Best Episode - Worst episode of "Horror In The Heights" - "The Sentry"
