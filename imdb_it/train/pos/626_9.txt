The power of dreaming is a wonderful thing. There is a saying: "Not all dreamers realize, but all students dream". Exploring our imagination we shape our future. Or build empires. Perhaps overcome our fears, limits and obstacles. Get wisdom and benefits for humanity. Or (simply) find our way to true love and happiness. Freud could express these things in symbols. The language of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Tristan ventures into an English village called Wall. Go through a break in the wall. A portal In search of something that will demonstrate his love for Victoria (Sienna Miller). Victoria doesn't take it very seriously. He then undertakes to bring back a shooting star. <br /> <br /> Stormhold is the world off the wall. He discovers that the fallen star took the form of a beautiful girl, Yvaine (Claire Danes). To complicate matters, three evil witches want to take Yvaine. If they can eat his heart, they will fill their youth. (One of the witches is played by Michelle Pfeiffer, who makes fabulous changes in appearance and fashion from young people.) The "good boy" they meet on their way is Captain Shakespeare (Robert de Niro). It has a rough, pirate-like façade, but below is a sweet queen of the wardrobe. Meanwhile Stormhold's heirs are engaged in a pitched battle to inherit the kingdom. Ricky Gervais is an added extra. A buffalo merchant who launches standard Gervais type gags well. Tristan's purity of spirit arouses Yvaine's love, so there's a little triangle that goes. Until reaching maturity to discern pedestal divas from real women. <br /> <br /> Stardust is a complete and large-scale fantasy that honors its myriad of stars. Completely positive, and written with a clarity that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis than a coven full of Harry Potter games. Production values ​​rival Hollywood, and the plot is free from racial stereotypes, misogyny, religions or class programs rather than modeling and perverting so many large-scale fantasies. <br /> <br /> It is not that Stardust is free of defects. Plot and dialogue have many predictable elements and the quality of fairy tales can be too musty for some public. But if you want an excuse to let your heart fly, this movie could very well give it. <br /> <br /> As a boy, I remember listening to the Moody Blues albums (which they practiced in a house not far from where I lived) with wonder. They made records with names like "In Search of the Lost Chord" and wrote lyrics like "Thinking is the best way to travel". I will fill my head with books of magic and mystery, from Timothy Leary to Aleister Crowley. Model dreams. Learn to make them real. Nowadays people could talk about NLP or positive thinking. Adults who remember how to dream with the strength of youth but with the vision and application of maturity. Do you still like that feeling? <br /> <br /> We advise you not to wait for Stardust on DVD. Watch it on the biggest movie screen you can find. And Dolby Digital Surround Sound if you can get it. The actors seem to have a ball. Maybe you will too.
