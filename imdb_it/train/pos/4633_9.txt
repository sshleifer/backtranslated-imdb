Here is another beauty in the series of beautiful films directed by Eytan Fox. The film presents the story of star lovers (one Israeli, one Palestinian) in modern Tel Aviv. The effectiveness of the film derives not only from its representation of ethnic conflict, but also from personal and political conflicts within ethnic groups. For example, there is a significant moment when one of the secondary characters, openly gay, is visited in the hospital by his boy who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family, and suddenly we see a wave of discomfort embarrassing wash across the room. Clearly the young man is not as open as he seems, and the family does not accept what he would like them to be, while the boyfriend is confused and rejected. A good deal of complexity is contained in a fleeting moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is a master at efficiently packaging emotional and psychological complexity in short sequences. The film is also effective in the impartial way of presenting the mutual brutalities that Israelis and Palestinians inflict on each other. If you are not heartless, you cry for the last third of the film. Although the plot is melodramatic, it has been written and interpreted so intelligently that it reminds us how good the good melodrama can be.
