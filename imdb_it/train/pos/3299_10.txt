A great film that requires an acquired taste. If you're in action, wham bam movies and hate serious love stories, then it's not for you. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a good intelligent movie from time to time, I highly recommend doing it. Easily the best Bollywood film produced in this century. <br /> <br /> The only other Indian film I would give the 10/10 is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then he comes second to this masterpiece.
