I love the TV show. He was hooked the first time I saw him. I would like to be there to act with them. Touch reality when you love someone and are thinking that you want to spend the rest of your life with, then to a round of events you meet someone else and that person is more than who you want to be with. You are in a situation where you had to choose one or the other. Someone will get hurt, there is no way to stop it. Making a decision is difficult, but you want to continue to be unhappy when you could have been. Why go ahead and live a life that you thought you wanted or thought you were doing the right thing and both of you are unhappy. That other person won't wait for a life waiting, they have a life a well. In the end, making the decision you really want will be better. Getting the best out of what you have is a good thing. Money, cars, houses, etc ... don't make you happy, have the only person you really want to be with whom to share it.
