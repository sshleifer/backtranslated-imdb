Luckily I saw him on a plane to Singapore recently (I thought I would get lost at the Cinemalaya filmfest). Paris, je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 minutes each) of 20 directors who show love in various pockets of contemporary Paris. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite segments is "Parc Monceau" by Alfonso Cuarn (Great Expectations, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), which was made in a continuous shot and features Nick Nolte. <br /> <br /> The Coen brothers "Tuileries" with Steve Buscemi as a tourist in the metro was hilarious! Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe in "Place des Victoires" were haunting. <br /> <br /> For Maggie Gyllenhaal as an American actress / addict in the "Quartier des Enfants Rouges" to have interpreted the anticipation and the pain in such a short period of Elijah Wood as a victim of a vampire in the Madeleine 'was rather surreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell played a cute couple in Wes Craven's Pre-Lachaise. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman was beautiful as usual the girlfriend actress of a visually impaired French guy in "Faubourg Saint-Denis". But despite the many interpretations of the young love, a more mature performance of Gena Rowlands in "Quartier Latin" was equally undisputed. <br /> <br /> This film is perfect for those with ADHD because each sequence is guided and carefully thought out. <br /> <br /> There are also a number of memorable quotes. One in particular is that of a cheating husband who eventually leaves his mistress to be with his dying wife in his last days: "By pretending to be a man in love, he has become a man in love."
