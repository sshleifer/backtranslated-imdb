This film reminded me that some old black and white movies are definitely worth the look. <br /> <br /> Initially I had some reservations, however from the beginning of the film until the end I was fascinated. I was very impressed by the mix of drama, suspense and comedy. <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) is HILARIOUS and kept me in touch all the time. <br /> <br /> Definitely add movies to your movie night for some relief from the sometimes depressing and "too" powerful or overly "funny" movies of today.
