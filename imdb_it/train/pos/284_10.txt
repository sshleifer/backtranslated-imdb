the one and only season has just aired here in Australia and I thought it was absolutely brilliant! I love it! all the narrative lines are so good! and it's a much more realistic view of the lives of teenagers and family members today. yet he still maintained strong family values ​​of being together and being there for one another. their problems were real and really attracted you to the show. the show basically concerns this family called "the days" and their lives. the family consisted of Abby Day (mother), Jack Day (father), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (external son) and Nathan Day (brilliant boy son). every episode one day in their lives, with the perspective of coopers on everything around them. I loved Cooper his intuition through the show was simply great. he was by far my favorite character. he ended up with so many things he could have continued with, I'm really sad that another season hasn't been made. it was a great show I will miss.
