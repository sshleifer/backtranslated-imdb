Well, I saw "They all laughed" when it came out in Europe around 1982 and had kept a vague but dear memory of it. I saw it again on tape, almost twenty years later ... Bogdanovich has a sincere tenderness in his characters and a kind sympathy that is hard not to even hear. Excellent comedians and actors, good lines everywhere and for everyone and also a good editing. I laughed and smiled all the time. Just like all of us at times. Go get it.
