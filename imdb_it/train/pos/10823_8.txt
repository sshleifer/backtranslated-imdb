I've always liked Johnny Concho and I want this film to be released on VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra offers one of the most unusual performances of his career in this one. <br /> <br /> When we meet Frank for the first time in the title role, he is the brother of a notorious gunslinger who is out of town at the moment. The brother strikes terror in the heart of the city and Frank takes the opportunity to intimidate the inhabitants in his shadow. Only Phyllis Kirk has some feelings for him. She is the daughter of shopkeeper Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. <br /> <br /> Two other armed men arrive at William Conrad and Christopher Dark and discovers that Conrad killed Sinatra's brother and that he is coming to his city to take command. Umiliano Sinatra and unload him outside the city. Kirk follows him. <br /> <br /> During the night Sinatra turns from a punk into a coward and becomes a man in search of a kind of backbone. It's a well-performed performance, almost like his Oscar-nominated role in The Man with a Golden Arm. Too bad for some reason this has not been seen for years. <br /> <br /> Two other noteworthy performances are Keenan Wynn as a former gunslinger who became a preacher helping Sinatra find what she needs to defend Conrad and Dark. And then there's Conrad in what I believe is his starring role on the screen. He is a villain of incredible malevolence, pure embodiment of evil who walks and talks on the silver screen. <br /> <br /> However what I like about Johnny Concho is the unforgettable climax, in which Conrad and Dark are treated. Let's just say that I believe that Johnny Concho is MGM's answer to High Noon and a primer for what you do when evil causes a break in every order and law.
