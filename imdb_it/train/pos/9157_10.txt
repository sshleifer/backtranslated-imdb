Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I ran into this film version in the late 90s I was ecstatic! This is the best and most complete version of the book on the film! This version is a little long to sit in one sitting, but it's worth it. Timothy Dalton is incredible as Rochester. I was pleased that they played a normal-looking actress (Zelah Clark) like Jane and not a charming person. I love the sets and the location. For anyone who is a true Jane Eyre fan, this is the version to watch !!! For those of you who are interested, I just found this version on DVD. I saw my VHS copy almost to break so I was thrilled to find it on DVD.
