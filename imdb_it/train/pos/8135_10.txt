I am shocked. Shocked and dismayed that the 428 of you IMDB users who voted before me didn't give this movie a rating higher than 7. 7 ?! ?? - this is a C!. If I could give FOBH at 20, I would do it willingly. This film is at the top of the pantheon of modern comedy, alongside Half Baked and Mallrats, as one of the most entertaining movies of all time. If you know all about rap music, you absolutely have to see it !! If you know nothing about rap music, learn something! And then look at this! Comparisons with "Spinal Tap" fail to appreciate the inspired genius of this unique film. If you liked Bob Roberts, you'll like it. Watch it and vote for 10!
