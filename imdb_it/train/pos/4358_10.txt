Ok, this film probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted for "10" to help compensate for the misleading evaluation of the handful of bozo that gave this movie zero or 1-star reviews. Each of the segments of this anthology shows great potential and promises for talented filmmakers ... three of whom have achieved considerable success in successful Hollywood productions. Performances range from impressive to completely impressive, with notable turns by Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Kove could be a great melodrama as the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarre stroboscopic lamp, and Lance August seems intentionally confused as an unsuspecting laboratory victim. But overall, he has good laughs and really scary moments. Definitely worth seeing, so judge for yourself!
