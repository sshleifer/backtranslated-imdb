Being an Austrian myself, this was a sharp blow to the face. Fortunately I do not live anywhere near the place where this film takes place, but unfortunately it depicts all that the rest of Austria hates about the Viennese people (or people close to that region). And it is very easy to read that this is exactly the intention of the director: let your head sink into your hands and say "Oh my God, how can THAT be possible!". No, not with me, the scene of the uncensored swinger club (in my opinion) absolutely exaggerated is not necessary, I watch porn, of course, but in this context I was rather disgusted than put in the right context. <br /> <br /> This film tells a story of how defenseless people suffering from lack of education or bad company try to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons. A girl who is treated like a whore by her super jealous boyfriend (and who keeps coming back), a teacher who discovers her masochism bringing into play the life of her super-cruel "lover", an old couple who has a cycle almost mathematical daily (she is the "official substitute" of his ex-wife), a couple who has just divorced and has the ex-husband suffer under the acts of his ex-wife, obviously having a relationship with his masseuse and finally a hitchhiking crazy who asks his drivers the most unusual questions and stretches their nerves just to be super-annoying. <br /> <br /> After seeing it, you feel almost nothing. You're not even shocked, sad, depressed or you want to do something ... Maybe that's why I gave 7 points, made me react in a way I never reacted before. Whether what is good or bad depends on you!
