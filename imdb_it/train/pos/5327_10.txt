As an informed fan, I recommend this film as true to the facts and well acted. When I was 11, living in Istanbul, I heard some friends talking about a new musical sensation that made the girls scream. I thought hmmmm, if girls like them, they must be shit. My only records to date were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers and Ricky Nelson. Shortly afterwards, while I was on vacation with my family in a military cafÃ© in Ismir, I heard a song (which I later learned "Love Me Do") and was struck by the difference between this and every song I had ever heard until then. When I listened to my older brother's "Meet the Beatles" album, I was hooked for life. Having read the definitive book of their beginning (by Davis) I was surprised that this film followed the facts very well with the exception of excluding most of the sex and part of the drug use (it was the use of methadrina / dexadrina). >
