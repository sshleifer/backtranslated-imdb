This very strange film is unlike anything made in the West at the time. With its tumultuous emotions and the network of visions, dreams and surprising images, its effect is both beautiful and disturbing. The actors are choreographed more like dance than acting. It contains the only sequence of dreams that I know that really looks like a real nightmare (I'm sorry, Dali fan).
