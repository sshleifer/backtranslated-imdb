I actually like the original, and this movie has its ups and downs. Here are some: <br /> <br /> Ups: most of the original cast is back. <br /> <br /> Down: I didn't like the voice of Timon's Ma. I know he made a voice in The Simpsons, but that show is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> Ups: We will see Simba as a "teenager". <br /> <br /> Downs: They wasted it on a slug-slurping competition between Timon and Simba. Ups: It was Rafiki who spoke to Timon about "Hakuna Matata". <br /> <br /> Downs: how did Pumbaa find out? <br /> <br /> Ups: Songs again. (some of the original songs were there, but they were just background music). <br /> <br /> Downs: But stupid songs. (a.k.a the Timon solo.) <br /> <br /> In general, this is a pretty good movie. I would recommend it for fans of the original. But if you don't like the original, chances are you won't like this. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10
