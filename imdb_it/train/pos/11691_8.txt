Great movie when I saw it. I have to say one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it 8 times in the theater and took the DVD. When I got older and saw it again I realized that the film is average. Compared to films known as "comedians", this is nothing. I mean, rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole passage with the racial stuff breaks some of the barriers which is great. Even the thought of how the film goes is a nice way of thinking. It is as if most thought of a movie, but also a bit of a twist which is a nice touch. I like the film overall so I give it a ... <br /> <br /> Still a good 7/10 for me.
