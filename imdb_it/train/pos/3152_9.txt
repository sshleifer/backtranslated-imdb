This show was absolutely fantastic, and I can't wait to see it. All the characters were fun and fantastic in their own way, every episode provided laughter without interruption, and it was completely funny and different from many other shows. Everyone was absolutely crazy and incredibly funny, you couldn't help but love this show . There were some episodes of dead weight, but That '70s Show always managed to create a sort of nice atmosphere, which it didn't really do. It doesn't matter. This was one of the best shows ever to be shown, and I will see this show whenever I can, because it never gets old, it never becomes fun and does not become disinterested.
