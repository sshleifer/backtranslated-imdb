An excellent idea: 11 stories on September 11th. 11 directors from different countries with different results. Ken Loach speaks of an immigrant (as usual) is simply brilliant (as usual). The French also did a great job, while the Burkina Faso film was a nice surprise. However, the Israeli film was a bit boring, and the Mexican boy, well, he should have stopped directing and working in a Mexican restaurant. 8/10
