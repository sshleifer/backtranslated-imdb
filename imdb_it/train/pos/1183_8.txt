A man readjusts himself to life after 45 years of marriage. He must also solve the problem of the billionaire cow, Tulip, who refuses to be milked. That is, until he visualizes his wife who was the one who milked Tulip. <br /> <br /> Tulip is based on a true story told in the family of Griffith, of his grandparents' generation. The film is a nostalgic look at an endangered lifestyle, in which people still felt a sense of mutual responsibility, set in the lush green Victorian countryside (the Australian state, not the era). <br /> <br /> The writer and director Griffiths evidently has further ambitions in both areas, and this award-winning fifteen-minute short is a good start for his reel.
