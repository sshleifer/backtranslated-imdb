Enhanced furniture suits that can wipe out entire armies - Check! Weapons that hardly need to be targeted and still destroy everything - Check! Angels-based mobile suits - Check! <br /> <br /> OK - it's a Gundam series. This, Gundam Wing, has a good character development, real world complexity, interesting ideas and a bit of eye candy. <br /> <br /> With characters, initially weak Relena Dorlan (later Peacecraft, then back to Dorlan) becomes stronger and more independent (although he is still absolutely obsessed with Heero Yuy, the main character of the series). The aforementioned Heero, initially a cold and hard butcher, becomes more and more human, while remaining in the character. And seeing the lost Millardo Peacecraft (which is the Zechs Marquise guerrilla) floating between OZ, freelance, and the White Fang command shows how some people can really lose themselves in their creations. <br /> <br /> The complexity of even the political and military situation is quite good - it reflects the way the real world works. However, in 49 half-hour episodes, it becomes a bit of a liability as this complexity is not used to its full potential. <br /> <br /> Ideas at the center of the series - the need for struggle, the desire for peace, etc. they are the ones that resound even today. In retrospect, the series was ahead of its time, what with "The War on Terrorism" and all the rest. But his exploration of these ideas, the monologues, particularly those of Treize Kushrenada, is an incredible dramatic piece, which forms some of the best scripts in the series. <br /> <br /> But sometimes even writing well is sometimes extremely poor, which causes a dramatic loss of some of its edge. <br /> <br /> In terms of eye candy, which is what this has in bucketloads, everything from mobile suits to battleship Libra (No not the tampons you idiot!) is a well designed and explodes in large orange balls (which is bad, because better animation would have had better explosions). But who cares ?! The stuff explodes, and that's all that matters. <br /> <br /> In short, the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss a few episodes, you've lost a lot. Poor writing can let you crash, and sometimes the animation makes you go "WTF?!?!" But this is offset by its classic animation style, its size, the sparks of an incredible dialogue and its more mature exploration that is expected of such Japanese animations.
