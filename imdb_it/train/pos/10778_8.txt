Now this show looks like most of the other shows of this type since the mid-90s, but the only thing is that it's different, they use a lot of comedy and action in this and maybe some drama as well. Personally, I thought it was a good show, I can't understand why they would erase it. The good thing is that the fans of this show are still alive from 1997 to today. <br /> <br /> My hopes are that WB will take the show back or even make a movie, which I know will be impossible to do, but hey doesn't hurt to dream, does it? <br /> <br /> However, I would recommend you if you hadn't seen it to find the DVD of all 13 episodes, because the characters are fantastic, the plots are good, the comedy is good and the whole show it's just great.
