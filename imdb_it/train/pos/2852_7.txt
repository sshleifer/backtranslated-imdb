This film has a very simple but clever premise - an unemployed person who tries to steal from a minimarket, and the store attendant catches him red-handed ... the thief escapes with the store clerk immediately after him. All the while, the store clerk is in trouble with a low-ranking Yakuza chinpira (gangster). Along the chase for the thief, they catch the attention of the Yakuza who is looking for the convenience store attendant. The story then goes into a high gear in the form of Tom & Jerry (cat and mouse), but is added with the dog chasing the cat. The entire 2nd act of D.A.N.G.A.N. Runner (can be translated into English as "PINBALL RUNNERS") is the chase, and the pursuit continues to the point that at the end of the 2nd act, the ass forgets why it is running away, and the Yakuza does not wear Remember which of the 2 guys are chasing, nor remember why they are running away from him. <br /> <br /> Similar to SABU POSTMAN BLUES 'next film, most of the film is simply all the hunt and action, with much physical comedy and dark humor injected to keep the audience busy. What is missing is the finale, to which the hunt is interrupted when the three men run out, and in one of the most chaotic Mexican confrontations that you will see on the film that almost seems that Sabu is paying tribute to Tony Scott TRUE ROMANCE (written by Quentin Tarantino ).
