Since the Godfather saga was the vision of the mafia from the executive suite, this series is a complex history of the mafia from the point of view of the worker. If you've never seen this show, you're ready for a prolonged treatment. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but it is never free and it is necessary to contrast Tony Soprano, the thinking man's gangster, with the reality of life to which he was born and, frankly, he would never have even known. how so many of his associates are finished. Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist, then beat a man with a pan in a fit of rage, and while dismembering and disposing of his body with his grandson, take a break, sit down and watch TV while eating peanut butter out of the jar, and give that nephew advice about his upcoming wedding as if they had just finished a Sunday afternoon watching NFL football. Even Carmella, his wife, when offered the possibility of a way out, he discovers that he really prefers life with Tony and the advantages that derive from it and looking in any other way at his indiscretions compared to life alone. If you've followed the whole thing, you know how it ends. If you didn't, trust me, you've never seen a TV series like this.
