This is rather a stupid little whodunnit disguised as a dramatic / biographical film. <br /> <br /> However the only reason I wanted to see it in the first place was because I was curious to know what the great Henry Fonda was like at its peak. I was not disappointed - it produces a really warm and charismatic performance. <br /> <br /> I can also honestly say that I have never been really bored at any stage of the film, so a strong *** 1/2 of *****
