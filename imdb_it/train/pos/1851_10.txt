I saw this movie in August at the 27th Annual National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, it's the first public screening. THE FILM IS GREAT !!! Derek Luke is as wonderful as Antwone Fisher. This young actor has a very bright future. The real Antwone Fisher did a great job writing the film and Denzel's direction is right. Watch it opening the weekend. You will not be disappointed.
