The only other film besides Soylent Green that looks so hopeless is On the Beach. Both films deal with the consequences for species and the planet from man-made cataclysms. On the Beach with nuclear war and Soylent Green with the planet's environmental poisoning. <br /> <br /> Perhaps there is cause for optimism because since 2007 we have not reached any of the worlds described in those films and we now had to. New York City still has about 8 million people not the 22 million within the millennium as described in Soylent Green. Environmentalists always regard this film as the consequence of global warming. For myself it also shows the ethics Right to Life. Obviously there is not even a family planning in this world. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston is a New York police detective who lives with roommate Edward G. Robinson, who is old enough to remember Earth before the disaster struck. There was a murder committed, Joseph Cotten a manager of Soylent Corporation, a multinational concern that invented a food product, a kind of wafer in so many colors to feed the world population. The latest product is Soylent Green. <br /> <br /> The investigation found that Charlton Heston got his man, but it also leads to terrifying truths about the Soylent Corporation and the future of humanity. While Heston ultimately shouts that Soylent Green is made of people, that we have become a race of cannibals, the terrifying thing is that there are no alternatives. We have exhausted the planet and we must eat our dead to survive. <br /> <br /> This was the farewell performance of Edward G. Robinson and in his memoirs Heston spoke movingly of Robinson even though they had different political opinions. A few weeks after Robinson concluded that final scene of his death on screen with consenting euthanasia, he died in real life. Not many did, but Heston knew that Robinson was finished and that there was no acting in the final death scene between them. <br /> <br /> Even if the calendar had expired, this does not mean that the world envisioned by Soylent Green may not occur. We hope to have not only the intelligence, but also the sense of shared responsibility to prevent this from happening.
