Well, for starters, this was actually Clausen's most elegant film to date. <br /> <br /> Man has always had a sense for the characters with a slice of humor for them, but I think that in this film he adds an unparalleled dimension to everything he has done before. His work has - in very black and white words - accepted by the broad public but not so critical, and we have always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a distinct way of letting the public know what does he need to say. <br /> <br /> In "Villa Paranoia, however, for the first time, surprises with an invisible wisdom and a respect for minorities. Not only ethnic people but also normal people tend to forget: set in Jutland - in the "country" - he faces the eternal problem of the lack of love, but in a narrow and sometimes brutal way that keeps you searching and keeps you focused, he can play ab ****** d! A real b * **** d, who wants the right thing but has no idea how to get there, and so people suffer. Bitterly. <br /> <br /> I have to say it's one of the best movies I've seen this year and I am very much awaited for your neighbor.
