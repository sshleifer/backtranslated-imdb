Simple, meaningful and offers an emotional punch. I regularly go through boring short films and it's always nice to meet something that has a simple and enlightened message, without pretense or self-indulgent direction. <br /> <br /> A boy at school must attend a lesson when his friend plays truant and receives the most important lesson of his life, only to discover that when there are not enough copies to go around he must share with the school bully. <br /> <br /> Unlike most short films with children or actors that these children possess and are credible. The soundtrack perfectly integrates the emotion of the piece and the final punch of the film works well.
