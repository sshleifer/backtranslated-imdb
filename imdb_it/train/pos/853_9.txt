"The Matador" plays Pierce Brosnan as a burned assassin. It is James Bond who has gone to bloom, with clothes that are too tight, gaudy, gold chains and a bad haircut. Our fighting killer, Julian Noble, is in Mexico, trying to regain his courage. Being in the same hotel is a nice and unlucky businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), who also tries to regain his balance. Danny is desperate to close a deal and return to his wife in Denver (Hope Davis) with good news. <br /> <br /> Noble and Wright unexpectedly become friends. Wright convinces Noble to reveal certain techniques, which he demonstrates during a bullfight. Noble is finally targeted by his employers and shows up in Denver. <br /> <br /> Writer and director Richard Shepard did Q&A after this delightful film at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard was also unlucky. After suffering the loss of his agent and the rejection of recent screenplays, he decided to write a story that no one would buy and create a character that nobody would want to interpret. Then he called Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan regains his balance in this film. (There's life after Bond!) He has a wonderful talent for self-mock comedy. Not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Stay for the credits to read what the filmmakers say about bullfighting. I look forward to more Richard Shepard projects.
