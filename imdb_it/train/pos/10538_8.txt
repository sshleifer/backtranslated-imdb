I work in a movie store and, as such, I'm always looking for an excellent movie. I decided to take a look at Nothing as it in our Canadian section and tried to support the film industry in my country. I had a surprise. The film features David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a very funny story that seems to deepen so much of our minds and relationships ... without working so hard. It is constantly comedy through the interaction of the two characters, as well as some funny exchanges ("We can't be dead, we have the cable!"). What else can I say without noticing that it is worth it, even if it is abandoned within the first half hour.
