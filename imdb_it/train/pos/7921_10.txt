It's just fun, watch it !!! <br /> <br /> OK they want 10 lines so there: This is a parody of the werewolf movies of the 50s / 70s. A lot of satire, some politicians. It looks like a Clouseau film (probably because of Alan Arkin), but with less slap. If you like movies Naked Guns you will like this too (again less slapstick in this). <br /> <br /> In reality, humor ranges from slight sexual allusions (inevitable in a teenage comedy) to a truly touching socio-political satire. The transformation of the Moon High School from the 50s to the 70s is really fun. The sequence with the changing presidential portraits is brilliant! OK maybe not brilliant but still hilarious. There are tons of cracks (istariche) starting from the paranoia of the cold war of the 50s and inflation of the late 70s. Anyway, watch the movie if you get the chance!
