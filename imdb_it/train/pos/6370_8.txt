To my surprise, I really enjoyed the last Disney animation episode. The film had its lows, but overall I felt that the story was strong and that the characters were easily identifiable. It was also nice to see a Disney animated film that was not a musical. I was almost pushed to the limit with Tarzan. Fortunately, they gave the music some rest. Another interesting feature of the film is that the comedy was not completely ignored (a la Hercules), rather thin, so it made the children laugh without the adults feeling dizzy or just stupid. <br /> <br /> A disappointment was the animation. With all the great animated films happening outside of the Disney studios, you'd think they would have moved and recovered a little. There is something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the story of Atlantis! Overall the film was fun and definitely worth a visit to the multiplex. <br /> <br />
