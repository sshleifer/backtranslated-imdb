Aardman does it again. Next to Pixar, Aardman Animation proves again and again how animation is done correctly. <br /> <br /> I had a great time watching the first episode of Creature Comforts. I thought it translated well for the American public. My only concern is that most of the audience won't have the subtle humor in this show. <br /> <br /> Having been a fan of the BBC version and short film, I knew what I was for when I sat down to watch this. The animators did a great job combining the prerecorded voices with a perfect animal. Watch the first episode with the Goat, who plays out of tune, and the dogs on the street who continue to call themselves "dawg". <br /> <br /> Is this for everyone? Not by a long shot. In fact, I'd be happy to see the show last for an entire season. But as I said before, the public won't make it.
