Presented at the San Francisco International Film Festival with the title 'Come Undone' on April 25th, 26th and 27th 2001. The director of photography uses techniques that add to storytelling. Even with the autumn / winter backgrounds for the "present" and the spring summer for the "flashbacks" there may be some difficulty in following the continuity. <br /> <br /> Whether the protagonist is gay, the actors portray the budding relationship in terms of real life; from physical violence to others to their passionate love making. The story draws you a little slowly into the characters at the beginning. But as the end approaches, you really care where these guys are next summer! You too would like a sequel to discover it.
