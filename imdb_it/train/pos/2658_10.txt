Kubrick again shows his extraordinary ability to create a perfect environment for a film. Mainly through cinematography, but also using a brilliant score, it creates a chilling and threatening tone that resides on the entire film and literally makes me feel the spine from the beginning. It is really this impeccable environment that makes The Shining the masterpiece that it is, in my eyes. Obviously it doesn't hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. A frighteningly authentic portrait of a mad mind. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be kind, but it's easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant. He also presents the actor with the greatest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
