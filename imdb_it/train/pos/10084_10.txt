This spectacular film is one of the most incredible films I've ever seen. It shows a China I had never seen or imagined, and I believe it shows China in the 1930s in the most REAL light ever seen in a movie. It's absolutely shocking in so many situations, seeing how hard life was for the characters, yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful. You really see the depths and heights of human existence in this film. The actors are all perfect, so much so that you really seem to have entered a different world. <br /> <br /> I simply can't recommend this movie well enough. It could change you forever once you saw it.
