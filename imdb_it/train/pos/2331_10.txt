At first I was strangely out that the main character of a TV show could bring the dead back to life, but then I thought I'd give it a chance. Guess what? I love "Pushing Daisies" and I can't wait for Wednesday night to watch it, then for the next week I'll watch it a couple of times on my DVR. The colorful characters, the witty jokes, the frantic dialogues and the new unique situations attract me and fascinate me from the beginning to the end. The relationship between Ned and Chuck Charles is interesting to watch as they work their romantic relationship on the fact that they can't have physical contact. Even the character of Detective Emerson Cod has continued to grow in complexity. And Olive Snook! Crispy Jiminy! It makes me collapse! The narrator's voice is fun to listen to and cinematography gives me the impression that I'm watching a movie instead of a TV show. I have recommended to my family and friends to turn on "Pushing Daisies" and they too are hooked !!! The show is worth waiting a week for a new episode and if you haven't seen "P.D.", I highly recommend watching it!
