This could be the most underrated movie of its kind. I don't remember seeing any advertisements or advertisements for this, which could be the reason why it didn't go very well at the box office. However, Frailty is an excellent and truly original horror film. I rank it among the top 10 favorite horror films on my list. <br /> <br /> The film begins with snapshots of photos and news articles that tell us about a killer who calls himself "the hand of God". And then a man enters a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother. Two of them leave together to go to a place where the victims are buried who could help solve the case. During that journey, the man begins to tell the story of his brother and we go back to the time when the events started. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers who live with their strict and religious father who, one day, claims to have received a divine message from God asking him to kill demons that appear to be normal human beings. He receives from God a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his children to help him carry out this divine mission. <br /> <br /> This is an absolutely horrible and suspenseful film that will keep you at the edge of your seat. The tension runs high, innocent people (or demons?) Are killed and religious experiences are challenged. In the end he has not one, but a few very clever twists. If you like this genre, I highly recommend Frailty for you. I own the DVD and it's one of my favorite horror thrillers ever.
