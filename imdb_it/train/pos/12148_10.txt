This film has a lot of comedy, not dark and Gordon Liu shines in this. Show his comic side and it was really strange to see him beaten. His training is "unorthodox" and who would have thought that tying a knot could be so lethal? Lots of great acrobatics and choreography. Very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wang in the mix and you have a fantastic final showdown! Don't joke with Manchu thugs; they are ruthless!
