The Young Victoria is a beautiful film and presented Queen Victoria in a different light to what everyone thinks of her. The films sweep away Queen Victoria's "I don't like" impression and show she was a cheerful young woman. <br /> <br /> As I love history, especially Victorian history, you can imagine my reaction when I saw this advertised film for the first time, I was so excited and counted the days until it came to the movies . I was a little worried that it wouldn't be historically accurate, but it was and I loved it. I discovered new facts about Queen Victoria that I didn't know before and was very interested in me. <br /> <br /> Queen Victoria in many lights was one of our greatest monarchs of all time, and this film paints a picture of her true personality and how her life was. She was treated so badly by her mother advisor Sir John Conroy, because he wanted Britain to have a regency. This is what inspired Victoria to be a fantastic Queen, that was it! The love story between her and Albert was so deep and this was done very well by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend, both brilliant! The Young Victoria is a love story felt in the heart but at the same time a great look at an important part of British history ... I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... no doubt!
