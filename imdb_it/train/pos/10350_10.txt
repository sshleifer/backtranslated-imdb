I think they were telling the truth all the time ... I can't trust anything in nature ... Their family went through hell. Those poor kids too young to understand what was going on around them. But still having to face the rumors. In addition to dealing with the loss of their little sister. I don't think the case went on so long. It seems that the jury could not see the truth, even if he bit them on the ass. I feel for this family, and if I could let them know I hate what happened to them, me. I have no idea what they went through, I can't even imagine. After watching this movie, I was in tears and had to check my baby in bed ... I think everyone should watch it.
