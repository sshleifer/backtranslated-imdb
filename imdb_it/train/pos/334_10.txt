It is very simple to qualify that film: "A PURE MASTERPIECE". This opinion is formulated for the following reasons: the performance of the actors, seem to be citizens of that era, 1100 BC They perfectly personalize the characters. A second reason is that the poem expressed by Homere in his poem is well represented by production. Among other things, the narrations made by the choir give a particular atmosphere that makes us part of the artistic surrender. Third reason: the restoration of the furnishings is absolutely perfect, in the Mediterranean regions, where the action of the poem occurred. And above all, the emotion is on the rendezvous. I repeat my appreciation: "A PURE MASTERPIECE".
