This is one of the best bond games I have ever played because: <br /> <br /> The missions are a lot of fun to play, they have a lot of action in them can be really difficult sometimes which makes it even more fun the the weapons you use are really good. The machines in this game are really good, driving missions are fun to do. This James Bond game has a nice story. The voice on the actors in this game is very good and it's nice that the brosnan is in this game and the way the characters appear is really good because they look like what they look like in real life, which is very nice. The graphics of this game are also pretty good. <br /> <br /> Overall score ********* out of **********
