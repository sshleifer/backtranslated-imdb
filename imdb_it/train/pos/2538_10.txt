There are so many positive things to say about this "B" movie. <br /> <br /> "B" perhaps in connections, but not in commission. This is the best of its kind I've ever seen. A Universal Level A effort. The screenplay is well done, imaginative and without fault. Writings: original story by Howard Higgin and story by Douglas Hodges, John Colton (screenplay). Director Lambert Hillyer has managed the complex story and settings of the story very well. Don't skimp on loads of extras and places. I loved Beulah Bondy (the mother of Jimmy Stewarts in "It's A Wonderful Life".) The female lead, Frances Drake is a beauty and has managed her part with grace and pathos for her husband Karloff, just as Lugosi was correctly underestimated. I remember seeing it. As I said, there were so many good things: the African discovery of Radium "X", the melting of stone statues ((a bit reminiscent of the Ten Little Indians in And Then There Were None (Agatha Christie) (the version of Barry Fitzgerald)), the glow of Karlof in the dark, Karloff's mother played by Violet Kemble Cooper with elegance, and thanks to all these virtues, I found myself believing in the science that portrayed a good piece of art .
