On rare occasions a film arrives that has the power to expand the mind, warm the heart and touch the soul itself. "LOU" is a film of the genre. I received "LOU" from my wife who took it from a neighbor who does business in the cinema. He looked at me for the second time. We were both fascinated. She's like it's the first time. <br /> <br /> "LOU" is a magical piece designed to refer to the moment when all your dramas began. He does it while it's inexorably fun. Bret Carr's acting and rhythm as a director won't let you look away from the screen. Cultivate a character who disarms with a bedbug rabbit like stammering innocence, but warmly brought with such underrated sincerity that you forget you're watching a movie. When the epiphany strikes during the brilliant climax, I saw my wife in tears for the second time. <br /> <br /> As a life coach, it facilitates individual growth and transformation, and this film is a "must see" for life coaches and anyone looking for their own personal growth and transformation. It's a brilliant and creative masterpiece with the power to change lives!
