My grandmother bought me this movie when I was 5 (I always loved scary movies) and even then I enjoyed it. The atmosphere is fantastic and the story is original and fun. I particularly like the scenes where the camper is under attack in the desert. The rocks are actually convincing for such a low budget film. The acting is above average for these types of films and the music is disturbing. This is definitely an uder gem. I recommend it to anyone who loves these strange films from the late seventies to the early eighties like "Alice, Sweet Alice", "Poor Pretty Eddie", "Nightmare", "Hospital Massacre" and "Return of the Aliens, the Deadly "Spawn". Definitely a classic !!
