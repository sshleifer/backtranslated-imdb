I want CÃ©line and Jessie to go further in their relationship, I want to tell them that they are made for each other, that in a lot of moments in the movie we want them to die for each other. Their story is what we have always wanted and probably most of us have never reached. It's about love but not stupid things like in "notting hills" or in that kind of movie. This is life and I believed in them, I believed they were falling ... This was so intelligent and moving. I just finished seeing him a minute ago and I'm still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> I must say that I was becoming misanthropic and felt like love was just a fake, a concept, but with this film I realized that maybe somewhere, somehow and some when, something could really happen. <br /> <br /> I am French and I didn't know very well July Delpy despite Kieslowski "three colors: white" ... Now I have to see another one works because it looks like an angel and has a perfect acting. <br /> <br /> I saw "before sunset" (the Paris sequel) a few days before I saw "before dawn" and they don't care. They are both masterpieces. proves that it is not necessary to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings. I'm sorry for my English that I'm trying to do better. <br /> <br /> Franck in France
