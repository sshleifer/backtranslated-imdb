I just saw The Drugs Years on VH1 and I love it. I think it reflects the history of drugs very well and, above all, IT HAS A STRONG MESSAGE AT ALL GENERATIONS. There are woods, there are the deaths of Joplin, Hendrix and Jim Morrison, there are many examples of drug use and drug abuse. It completely covers the time line and the evolution of drug use in America, both in good and bad terms. In my opinion this documentary is well done and I would like to congratulate its creators because this is exactly what is needed to play on TV these days. I'm waiting for the DVD release. You should definitely see it !!! This movie is amazing-- GREAT TIME!
