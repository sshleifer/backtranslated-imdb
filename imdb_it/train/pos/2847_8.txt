As is known, the anthology films do not get along very well with the American public (I think they prefer a standard plot). New York, I Love You, is the second phase of a series of anthological films that deal with cities and people who live and love in them. The first was "Paris, J'Taime", which I really enjoyed. The film consisted of several segments, each written and / or directed by a different director (most of which was French, but there is a very entertaining segment directed by Joel & Ethan Coen). Like "Paris", this is also an anthology, directed by several directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakher Kapur, etc.), and also as "Paris" with New Yorkers, and because they love the city in they live. It features a first-rate cast, with the likes of Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawki, and even veteran characters such as James Caan, Cloris Leachman, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some of the stories really do fly, and some don't (although I suppose it depends on individual tastes --- I won't ruin it for anyone else by revealing which ones worked for me and which didn't). The word is that the next item in the series will be Shanghai, China (Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece is out of the question?). Mainly spoken in English, but has Yiddish and Russian bits with English subtitles. Rated 'R'by the MPAA for strong language and sexual content
