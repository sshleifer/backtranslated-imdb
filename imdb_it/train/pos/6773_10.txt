I captured this movie on T.V. last night and you know Danny Masterson was a pretty good actor in the movie, and it's great to see him in something other than the 70s. The film is not evaluated, but in my opinion I would rate it (R) only for the nudity and abundance of adult content. But all in all I loved it, I thought Dirt's Wisecracks were pretty funny. It's just a guy who has no job, girlfriend or money and eventually gets a job as a private investigator (more than a messenger actually.) He gets the murder of a rock star and rock star friend is one People who really need to help him. I give it .... *** 3 stars.
