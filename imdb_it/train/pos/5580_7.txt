The young beautiful Eva (Hedy Lamarr) marries an older man (Zvonimir Rogoz). Unfortunately he cannot satisfy her sexually and ignores her. Frustrated, she returns home and plans to divorce. Then, one day, it is very thin, diving into a lake in the woods. His horse gallops with his clothes ... and she runs after it! Meet Adam young and very handsome (Aribert Mog). They make love and she realizes that he is the man she wants. <br /> <br /> ENTER SPOILER !!!! Of course, since it was made in 1933, it must be punished for its sin, thus leading to a tragic ending. END OF THE END SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> This people was horrified in 1933 but it is quite domesticated by today's standards. Lamarr's naked swim shows nothing and when she runs after the completely naked horse, she is shown in a long shot or is covered by branches and the like. There are only a few small strokes of her breast. Also, when she has sex with Mog, nothing is shown but her face, but you see her reach an orgasm. These scenes were considered rather extreme in their time and were completely cut off from the American version. Today they are back. This movie would have been easy with PG-13 now. <br /> <br /> The episodes of shock aside from that are ok. It is beautifully filmed and there is no dialogue. Except for the soundtrack, this could be a silent image. Fortunately all the actors are good - Lamarr and Mog in particular and are so attractive to leave them breathless looking at them. Even the sequence in which they make love is easily one of the most beautiful and recited sequences I've ever seen in a movie. The scenes with sexual symbolism (there are some) are unfortunately quite obvious today. Actually I started giggling during one! <br /> <br /> So, excellent direction, beautiful images, attractive actors, good acting all around - but I wasn't exactly thrilled. I found the film moving slowly (the beautiful images don't take a picture for me), a bit boring, obvious, static and has a negative ending. I can live with the ending but I do not excuse the other problems I had with it. Even the final sequence is REALLY strange - and out of place. So I admire this film more than anything else. It was well done and I would recommend it, but with caution. Many people seem to love this movie so they are in the minority. Use your judgment.
