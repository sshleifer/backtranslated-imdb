This is a film about deep and unexpressed human relationships. <br /> <br /> Eventually they become spoken, but there is the possibility of changing something about the situation. <br /> <br /> Originally made in Shanghai in 1948 and without any propaganda, the film introduces us to the Dai family. There is still some weight in the history surrounding the family. History usually carries weight in Chinese literature and in serious cinema. <br /> <br /> A young married couple - Liyan, an invalid, and his wife Yuwen live in a once-grand family complex that is partially ruined. <br /> <br /> A brilliant contrast is Liyan's younger sister who can't remember the family's past, but accepts everything quite naturally. His spirit is as brilliant as the other two are reserved. <br /> <br /> In this seemingly stable world an unexpected visitor arrives ... <br /> <br /> I ended up feeling rather sad - but definitely a top movie.
