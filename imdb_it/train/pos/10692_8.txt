Beautiful, funny, simple story, excellent Nicole Kidman (I almost always like the movies she's in). This was a good "vehicle" for someone skilled in comedy and drama since there are elements of both. A romantic comedy wrapped in two criminal stories, big lines of closure. Chaplin, very good here, was also good at another good but unpopular romantic comedy ("Truth about Cats & Dogs"). Perhaps they are too implausible. Ebert hasn't even published a review for this. The great "screwball" comedies were of course totally unlikely ("Bringing up Baby", etc.). If you've seen an implausible comedy, have you seen them all? Or perhaps people have been ready since the 1930s. Strange. Birthday Girl is a movie I have enjoyed many times. Nicole Kidman could be the "killer app" for home videos.
