this film was pretty horrible Vipul Shah's last film was good, even though it's a good story and it's being handled exceptionally well. Aatish Kapadia who adapted this film from another Gujarati comedy "Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu" made a good plan slowly 2 and a half hours to see there are a lot of flaws in this film, but he is still an entertainer. The songs are a bit trite and do not work well, but are still good overall, not a movie that would look with enthusiasm is still a story to consider and it's great if you're the kind of pretty good movie relationship with a lot of flaws and humor that you don't it is really necessary even a little
