I remember seeing him for the first time when I was 9 years old. I wanted to be one of the "barbarian brothers". This film is still great. An original aspect was that the fighting scenes were very short. Realizing that the "barbarian brothers" were so good that they ended up there and that the enemies went away quickly! Plus, you have chases, a cage fight, a dragon, and even a bar fight! <br /> <br /> Yes, acting is bad, which is why it is not a dozen, the plot has also received much criticism. I think it's quite original. Not many films of its kind have the same original narrative lines or colored dialogues. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
