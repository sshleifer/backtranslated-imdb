Since I saw it for the first time, "Piedras" is one of my favorites and one of the few photos I could actually see over and over again. The great script describes the life of a group of women (all in some way interconnected) with deep understanding and sensitivity. Ramón Salazar made a compelling film in his directorial debut and proves to be an efficient actor director. <br /> <br /> Not all performances are excellent, though. Among all the main women, they range from the average (Najwa Nimri) to the very good (Vicky Peña), but the standing ovation should be directed to the newcomer Mónica Cervera, who convincingly plays the late daughter of Antonia San Juan. Enrique Alcides is irresistibly charming as the nurse of the girl, and there are beautiful curves from Andrés Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo and the director himself, Ramón Salazar. <br /> <br /> "Piedras" is wonderfully written and filmed, when I saw him so moved that I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. I highly recommend it.
