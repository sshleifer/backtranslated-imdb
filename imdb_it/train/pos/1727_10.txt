The Wooden Horse is a very clever film about a very smart and successful escape plan developed by British prisoners of war during the Second World War. It is superbly interpreted with an ironic sense of humor, particularly the lines expressed by Leo Genn's sour tongue. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks in Mary Poppins) are as wonderful as the two heroes. The direction is tense and fast moving. Highly recommended.
