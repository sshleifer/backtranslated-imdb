Guy Kibbee gives the viewer a lot of laughter. Like most candidates, it knows almost nothing. Warren William, a very underrated actor, is very good at giving instructions to Kibbee; that is, he teaches him to say something that means nothing to the voting public. A campaign based on no comment, "I'll take it under advice" and "Maybe yes, but then again, maybe not", is the almost perfect way to win an election. In short, the more stupid the candidate is, the better the chance he or she will win. After all, the public can identify with a similar person. As for the film, it's very comedy.
