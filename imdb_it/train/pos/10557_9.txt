I just saw this at the 2003 Vancouver International Film Festival and it was fun to die for and a bit surreal. It takes place in Toronto, where these two losers live in this ruined house in the middle of a highway system. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are simply as big as the two losers who want the world to go. The acting, the dialogue and the writing are very good and the whole film seems perfect for such a low budget film. The director / writer Vincenzo Natali was present at this screening, and he seemed so smart and down to earth. This guy is so inventive with these fantastic stories that work so well within small budgets that drive the big Hollywood shit crazy!
