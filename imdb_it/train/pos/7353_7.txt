This film could be one of the most underrated films in Bollywood history. This 1994 blockbuster has all had good performances, music and direction. I remember being in Allahabad when this movie was running and somewhere in March, at Holi, the people there were playing his song "Ooe Amma" with their loudspeakers at maximum volume. If someone who likes to watch Some Like It Hot and drool over Marilyn Monroe should see this movie.Thumbs Up to Govinda. Like many of you know that this movie was shot in South India and after Sholay it could be one of the very few blockbusters to hit Silver Screen. With movies like these Indian comedies he could never be dead.
