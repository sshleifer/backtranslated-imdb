Another demonstration of the genius of Kurosawa, his first color film is a darkly surreal look in the tragic lives of the slum dwellers of Tokyo, essentially a series of intertwined cartoons that portray different groups of people who live a dangerous existence in a tough and unpleasant post-war slum. Moving from comedy to tragedy and vice versa, this film shows how people face the worst kind of life in their own way, mainly retreating into themselves and living in the fantastic worlds of their own head, emotionally withdrawing from those around them or drowning in alcohol. Mixing the realism of kitchen sinks with Kabuki theatricality, Kurosawa cleverly plays with the emotions of his audience, drawing tears and laughter with equal skill. A wonderful and draining experience.
