The choice to make this SNL skit in a film was conceived much better than other recent ones. The humor involved in the character is not the annoying humor, and is also driven by the character enough to be stretched for an hour or two. Strangely, the sexual content seemed to avoid it, but this may have been because the constraints of live television have taught me not to expect it. I suppose I was thinking more about "Leisure Suit Larry" than the producers ... <br /> <br /> It's definitely not a PG-13 movie, which will probably never make it reach the heights of its most successful predecessors, but even better premise and writing than its most gloomy ones. <br /> <br /> I liked it, but I doubt it will be a great success ... (which is sad, since Tim Meadows tends not to make characters that annoys me with the frequency with which other SNL students tend to)
