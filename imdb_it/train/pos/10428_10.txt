A fantastic film that, in theory, should be boring, but it has incredible subtlety and acting that I've always desperately wanted to find. Instead of relying on clich√©s and excessively dramatized moments, the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments. The main characters are not perfect and therefore relating to them as people you could know is easy. The film is not trying to provoke laughter, nor to push an ideal to the public, but simply showing us the possibility of true love in all circumstances. <br /> <br /> Now I'm restless, waiting for the weekend, so I can see the sequel. A moving, provocative, amusing look at the love I think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with Casablanca and Breakfast at Tiffany's. It will also soften the most difficult heart.
