When I heard that this film was directed by Ang Lee, I made sure to see it. This Taiwanese director became famous a few years ago with "The Wedding Banquet" and "Eat Drink Man Woman" before moving on to "Sense and Sensibility" and "The Ice Storm". Now, he turns his attention to another American icon - the Civil War. <br /> <br /> This story takes place in Missouri, a state of the Union with sympathies of the South. These never officially joined the Confederate army. Instead, they formed outlaw bands, called "bushwhackers", grew their hair long, and sometimes confiscated the Union uniforms they wore with their normal clothes. <br /> <br /> The film describes their moral dilemma, the dramatic drama of the times and their alleged heroic missions of killing the warehouse workers and farmers who helped the Union. There are no stars in this film, unless you consider the singer "Jewel", well interpreted as a young confederate widow like a star. <br /> <br /> Tobey Macquire is interpreted as a young German boy who is mocked for his legacy because the Germans were supposed to be Union sympathizers. This young man is an excellent actor, full of young youth in front whose performance includes his wonder and his subtle achievements when he is exposed to the horror of war. Jeffrey Wright is a freed slave who travels with bushwhackers because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom. It gives an excellent and sober performance. <br /> <br /> Some actors perform in wood, especially in long conversations about morality. And their costumes are too new. And the theme of the "southern gentleman" of ways, hat and kindness to women turns out to be a bit too much - especially since they make a point to kill all the men who pull from their women's arms, then burn shops and houses. <br /> <br /> Although I don't think this will go down as one of Lee Ang's "big" movies, I found myself fascinated by it, despite the slow parts and its excessive length of 140 minutes. I was interested in what was happening next and felt empathy for each of the characters that everyone realized real and imperfect human beings caught in the forces of history. <br /> <br /> Not so much the action of the usual movie war, but still recommended, especially for Civil War fans. <br /> <br />
