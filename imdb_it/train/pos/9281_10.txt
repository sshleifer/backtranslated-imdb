I don't know how and where Iranian filmmakers draw inspiration in a story like this. In fact, it is a very simple storyline that many directors could invent --- but may not be able to project it on a film like Jafar Panahi did. <br /> <br /> The film is like two worlds that run at the same time, one connected to the other - the soccer game and the battle between the sexes that take place behind the walls of the stadium. <br /> <br /> It makes you feel like you're in the movie and you're one of the characters, and as you watch the movie, like you want to take a look at the soccer game too. You will feel exactly the same excitement and feelings of those female actors in the film. It's as compelling as if you wanted to see the ending, you'll want to find out the verdict, you'll die from the desire to see what will happen to the girls. <br /> <br /> I like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainees. It's like venus VS mars, it really shows the difference in the way men and women think and in the women's struggle to get equal rights and opportunities, especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran. <br /> <br /> This is Jafar Panahi's second film I've seen (the first is Crimson Gold) and I'm looking forward to seeing more. <br /> <br /> I am already passionate about Iranian films and this is a must see!
