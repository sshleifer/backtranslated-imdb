The acting in this film was superb. As a rock lover, I found very few mistakes. As a human being, he touched my heart and my soul. To watch the actors, you would think that they are the real characters. Laura Dern, my favorite actress, left nothing to her performance. The young actors who played the Rocket Boys showed talent beyond their years, especially the young Homer. Homer's father inspired that eternal love / hate relationship between a father and a son so that it seemed real. If you don't get a lump in your throat or you shed a tear when the first successful rocket goes up or when father and son come to terms, then check your pulse (you may be dead).
