As the summary of a line says, two films left me an observation when I left the theater. One was "Stir of Echoes" with Kevin Bacon, and the second was "Vanilla Sky". <br /> <br /> It is one of those movies that you sit in the theater place and stop thinking about anyone around you, stop asking me what the end of the movie will be and leave the movie quickly where you want ... Go from the cinema it was a bit strange, like the feeling you get when you're sick and you can't think of anything. One of those films that you become one with the boy, and you feel that nothing else surrounds you with things from the movie. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain. The actors are fantastic, the soundtrack is excellent, and everything in the film is 9+. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the best films I've ever seen, and the film that made the best and most shocking awakening my life and my purpose in this world.
