Anna Christie (1931) <br /> <br /> In her own terms, this version of Anna Christie from Garbo, taken a year later in German with a completely new cast, is simply toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions). Garbo is, if anything, more imposing (or more beautiful as a presence on the screen) and his acting is more sober. And he frankly seems more at ease, probably for many reasons, but we can assume that he was no longer making his first talking image, so he had adapted quickly. <br /> <br /> Without always comparing one film to another, this Anna Christie is always the same as O'Neill who plays with too many words. His themes of a woman who wants love without losing her independence are here, but she still looks strangely old-fashioned. Some scenes are missing: the Coney Island section is shortened and not so good, but overall it is a direct echo of the first film. The director, Jacques Feyder (Belgian-French), is simply redoing what has already been done, which I assume must be a frustrating experience. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see both films in succession because they are locked in exactly the same way (not just the sets, but the shots, they are all the same). There is an occasional scene raised by the previous film - some of the storms, understandably, but also a brief scene in which Marie Dressler (from the English version) is walking with her friend on a table over a canal, drunk as can be. But they are just shapes and when the next scene shows their faces, we see the German actors take their parts. Surely Dressler is not replaced, but for me the German father is more credible and honest in his performance. <br /> <br /> Clearly the themes - immigration, rebel fathers, daughters who turn to prostitution, and the problems of finding true love - have strong currents then, especially with European discussions (Garbo, appropriately, plays a young woman Swedish woman).
