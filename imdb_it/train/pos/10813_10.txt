I turned it on to see the incredible Ethel Waters, whose autobiography I'm reading now. I have to admit that my jaw dropped when the notes of pork chops and watermelon started, but people can't watch this movie as a stereotyped or racist piece. It's basically a short film made by blacks, for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite segregated and the stereotypes for the people involved were the jokes of their time, the old exaggerated tendencies for humor. We see modern black films doing the same thing, but with new trends (stereotypes), "ho" and "hood" and so on. I think if you look back in eighty years, you would see that today's films will be just as racist. What viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of Waters and little Sammy Davis Jr., who taps his contemporary, Shirley Temple, and looks extraordinarily the same as that of an adult. Everyone involved in this film has clearly had a great time doing it. Why not appreciate it for what it is instead of what you think it should have been?
