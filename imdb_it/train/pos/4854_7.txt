Cuddle up with this on a dark and stormy night and prepare to be alternately amused, irritated and scared. The old squeaky texture on a ghost train that is said to cross the lonely English countryside in the middle of the night can be far-fetched, but it's a lot of fun. There are some wonderful old clich√©s like "THE INCIDENT" that the locals can remember but won't talk about. But above all the film is a vehicle for comedian Arthur Askey to show his particular brand of vaudeville-style humor among the scary pieces. Askey's trivial humor is not very fashionable these days but if you just let it wash over you, it can be fun. This is probably the best of Askey's movies.
