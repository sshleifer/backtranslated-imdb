This is a film by Jackie Chan above average, due to the fantastic ending and humor, however, apart from that, it is nothing special. All the characters are fantastic, and the movie is fun, besides Jackie Chan it's just great at that! Jackie and Wai-Man Chan had a fantastic chemistry together, and they're both very funny !, and I thought the main opponent was really threatening! However, dubbing was just terrible! The character's development is above average for this kind of thing !, and the main fight is just great !, plus some of the bumps that Jackie takes in this one are tough! There is a lot of silly and silly humor in this, but it amused me, and the ending is fun! Moreover, all the characters are quite nice. It's quite cheap but generally very well done, and even if it doesn't have the amount of fighting you would expect from a Jackie Chan movie, it's enough to keep an eye on you, and one of my favorite moments in this movie is when Jackie (Dragon ) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger), are playing with a rifle and off! This is a film by Jackie Chan above average, due to the fantastic ending and humor, however, apart from the fact that it is nothing exceptional, it is still worth seeing! The management is good. Jackie Chan does a good job here with the camera's solid work, fantastic angles and keeping the movie at a fast pace for the most part. The acting is very good! Jackie Chan is unbelievable as always, and he is fantastic here, he is extremely nice, hilarious, as usual he does some crazy stunts, he had a fantastic chemistry with Wai-Man Chan, he kicked that ass and played this wonderful arrogant character , it was great! , I just wanted to stop dubbing it! (Jackie rules !!!!!). Wai-Man Chan is as fun as Jackie's best friend, I loved it, he's also a great martial artist. The rest of the cast is OK, I think. Overall worth watching! *** out of 5
