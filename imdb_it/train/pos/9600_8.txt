This film is a touching story of an adventure taken by Darius Weems, a 15-year-old boy. Darius has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a still untreatable disease that took his brother's life at the age of nineteen and is the number one killer of children in the United States. He and some close friends cross the country in Los Angeles with the aim of personalizing his wheelchair on MTV, Pimp My Ride, one of his favorite programs. The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and never left. The band heads west for a journey that all its participants will never forget. Darius climbs for the first time on a boat, rides in a balloon, swims in the ocean and visits places he has always wanted to see such as the Grand Canyon and New Orleans. The filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection to the material. They don't make money from the $ 20 DVD sales. $ 17 goes towards the search for the disease and $ 3 goes to make more copies. The film has won over 25 festival awards and I agree with the quote given to the Variety film, "Certain to stir hearts".
