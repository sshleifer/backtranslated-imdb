This is a really fun movie, especially the second, third and fourth time you watch it. It's a nice short film, and I strongly suggest you watch it more than once, you'll have it "again" more the second time. <br /> <br /> It's like the spinal tap tip but the rap version. It has a lot of attitude in it that can be a bad thing in rap-influenced movies, but it's just a bit total and it's not a problem because of the irony it creates. <br /> <br /> A lot of important pieces, one of those types of movies that you will find to quote lines with your friends, and will arouse laughter. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is the "guerrilla in the middle" section. Great video, fantastic!
