The vote is only a 5 because it is a film that could have better used acting and directing (or at least music!). However, for Walt Whitman's results, he deserves a 10. A previous manifesto calls the cheese film, however, I think it's a simple case of not seeing the forest for the trees. The directors were apparently more interested in getting the story out than having a Hollywood feature. And that's why I applaud them - the fact that it's non-mainstream also reflects Whitman's life. This film is more documentary than for the sake of acting. Being fascinated by a story like this, when you rarely hear about these types of stories that shape today's mental health, is the most important thing. I found a very pleasant aspect of the story.
