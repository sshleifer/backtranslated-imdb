It takes a very special kind of person to make a film so miserable, seductive, disgusting and repulsive, but to do it in a way that also makes it brilliant and the quintessence of personal cinematic liberation. Crispin Glover, in all his antics and "out there" predispositions, really did something unique. In a world that has become starkly partisan, this film seems to escape the standard lines of creativity and art and indeed upsets everyone. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the film takes on a rather distant paradigm (if a model really exists) and initially models it with the likes of Shirley Temple in front of a swastika and naked women who love a man with cerebral palsy. It's a pretty shocking thing, but if you've had the opportunity for question and answer sessions after the screenings, a bag of worms clearly opens up leaving you wondering if it's art or the lowest common denominator. In both cases, you feel the tremor that this film will eventually cause. He will never be accepted, not even by the alleged authors of the world who speak boringly about the human condition. You might not like it, but it's certainly something worth watching.
