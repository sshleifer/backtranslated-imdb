The American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna to take the plane to the United States. On the train he met a French girl Celine. Even if they first met, they talked like good friends. When the train stopped in Vienna, Jesse asked Celine to accompany him for a tour in Vienna. Then the romantic story took place. <br /> <br /> At first they were cautious. The funniest scene was listening to the CD in the music store. They exchanged a look, even though their eyes did not touch. After a thorough conversation, their relationship came closer. Then I saw the most romantic scene that pretended to call their respective friend. Their deep mutual love was expressed completely by words. <br /> <br /> Love is a strange thing. When you really want it, it won't come as you would like. Love needs mutual understanding. Without it, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is the most important for love. <br /> <br /> The script and the excellent performances resulted in a huge success of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the best love films. 9/10
