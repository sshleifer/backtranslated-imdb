Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority ruled by South Africa in much the same way that Gandhi tried to resist the colonialism of the British empire in India. Richard Attenborough's film Cry Freedom is not about Biko or Apartheid as much as about Donald Woods, the editor of the liberal white newspaper who risked his life trying to tell Biko's story. The film has a bewildering point of view after Biko died in prison for tortuous behavior at the hands of the South African "police". Woods, played by Kevin Kline, must choose whether to do the right thing and escape the country to publish books on Biko or allow his wife, played by Penelope Wilton, to push him to forget the books. In that case, Biko dies in vain. What begins as a friendship that changes lives between Biko and Woods degenerates into a standard with the numbers that escape the border after Biko's death. Denzel Washington, an Oscar nominee, is only good in his fourth film as Biko, but there is something wrong with a film that tries to describe the struggles of Apartheid by focusing more on the trials of a white family for more than half of the movie. Attenborough would have served his argument better by focusing on Biko's rise to prominence instead of starting where Biko befriended Woods. Perhaps a black actor in a starring role in a 2-and-a-half hour film wasn't exactly in favor of the big box office, but the film was still a huge box office flop. Apart from film politics, the film still entertains and sends a message or two, even if sanitized by PG. *** of 4 stars.
