Twelve Monkeys is a crazy and action-packed film starring Bruce Willis who plays James Cole, a man who is sent back in time to gather information on the devastating plague that occurred in November 1996. Unfortunately, he too is sent back until to the year 1990 where everyone believes they are crazy. <br /> <br /> This film is thrilling and has great performances by Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Twelve monkeys is one of the greatest travel films of the time that I believe anyone can enjoy. Terry Gilliam has created a true masterpiece <br /> <br /> 10/10
