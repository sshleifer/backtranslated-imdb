One of my favorite shows in the 70s. While I remember that it aired Friday (or maybe Saturday) in the Nine Network (?) Here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great together. <br /> <br /> Each episode usually culminated with Kolchack having to engage in hand-to-hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent. To their credit, the writers have made a concerted effort to keep the usual circle of vampires and ghosts as far away as possible. <br /> <br /> I remember an episode in which the opponent was the spirit of an ancient Indian chief who "came back" as a massive electric current that started killing people in a city hospital. The final clash saw Kolchack try to short-circuit the "beast of power" amid an explosion of sparks and flames. Oh well ... you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea. <br /> <br /> McGavin has always loaded a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this has been one of his best. <br /> <br /> Definitely deserves a place in the TV "Hall of Fame". To quote Tony Vincenzo .... "Kolchack you're on ON" ... Or, in the case of the Hall of Fame, "IN it"!
