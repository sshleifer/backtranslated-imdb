Finally, the Danish character lets Buddy have the horrible truth. "Leave me alone, kiss the men if you want," he shouts hypocritically in front of everyone, thus destroying the man who has been in love with her for so long ... Beautiful girl This could be the right place to reconsider everyone's gigantic charm that Danes pours into this character. A great reason to feel sympathy for her that she lies in bed and dies, but hey, remember, there are no mistakes, except, perhaps, to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Wait a minute, this irony is wanted! This is actually a masterpiece of ironic spirit, yes! But somehow I doubt it's what the creators of this film had in mind, unfortunately ... Maybe there are some mistakes, after all.
