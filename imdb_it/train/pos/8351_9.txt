I remember going on a trip to Spain at the age of 25, and having taken a ride from two small Italian scammers on the run. They were doing a lot outside the law, but on the other side they carried a small portrait of Jesus in their pocket to protect themselves ... Righteous and unjust, good and bad, criminal and correct where here in a new combination, outside the categories that I knew. 'Les Valseuses' gives me, even if a film and not real life, an image close to my experience: the intensity of every moment as soon as you exit "everyone behind" and go for the moment, whatever happens to you, it is another mental state and also a "dangerous" form of life, because, as we all know, there are people who are not ready for this and willing to haunt you for "stealing" and so on ... This film touches "values", is a story about "what is right and wrong": morality. It is the resurrection of the individual who fights against "false morality" and conformism ... There is danger to the end, because, to what extent you can go with your "freedom" and overcome your moral boundaries and that of other people? What to do with people who are willing to hurt you, put you in jail or even shoot you for the things you do, like "steal" some gas from a multinational oil company for your fifth car? Les Valseuses awakens these questions in me, because morality, in contradiction with the usual "media message", is rather complex ...
