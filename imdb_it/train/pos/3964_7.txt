I found The FBI Story very amusing and appropriately optimistic about my vision of the New Year holidays. His drama and action-packed episodes were electrifying. Hardesty's character was well designed and admirable. Overall, photography, script and direction were absolutely noteworthy. Rather than take the film to be a repugnant piece of propaganda, as some might, I liked it as a well-mounted portrait of the need for ingenious minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime. Once again, the depiction of a family that holds together even under the pressure of the husband's commitment to his (arguably) important work, I have not found the representation of a twee, but an ideal and exemplary.
