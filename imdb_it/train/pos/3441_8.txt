This film is incredibly realistic and I think it's a great justice for the crime that many people don't understand due to lack of experience. The many people who think they can understand what goes through the mind of a victim are arrogant. As a victim, I think Dawson did a fantastic job in his role as Maya. I agree that this is an incredibly brave film. This looks at rape from a different point of view, more realistic than any other film I've ever seen on the subject. The end has lasted a while, but I know that many victims imagine this kind of justice, since the probability of an attacker being sent to prison for the crime is about 1%. It's nice to see a movie that comes close to the reality that most would have dared.
