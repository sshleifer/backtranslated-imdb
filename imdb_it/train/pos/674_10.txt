While for most people watching the film, this will be of little interest, but among the many hundreds of films that deal with magic and the occult in one form or another, this is probably the best in many ways. <br /> <br /> From Golem to The Craft the subject seems to be of infinite interest to the film industry. Most films that touch it somehow do so in a childish way (for example "Witchboard", a real piece of total garbage in every way) or taking transcendental elements as economic excuses for special effects or for villians (" Sorcerer "). More frequently the subject emerges in a hysterical religious context (in the various films oriented to Revelation, the antichrist is inevitably a supporter of a sort of new age practice). Rarely, a film seems to show at least an experience of passage with magic as it is practiced in real life, but the presentation of the occult in such films can at most be described as allegorical and not literal, or symbolic, or ... only not really well. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie again after many years tonight. I had already seen it on VHS; it's a dark and moody piece, and after watching it on DVD, I'd say if you're going to watch this movie, watch it on DVD, don't watch it on VHS. <br /> <br /> darkness and bad temper are oppressive on VHS but on DVD the film takes on a very different tone. I think Weir pushed the dark aspects intentionally by style, but when the film is converted to the lower color medium of VHS this goes beyond the limit. The DVD brings the film back to life and I saw it differently. <br /> <br /> However, seeing it as if for the first time, I realized that the treatment of magic is extremely good in this film. It's hard to get into all the reasons why, I'm not interested in taking the time to do it. <br /> <br /> For anyone curious, however, if you want to see what it's like in real life, this movie is really perfect on countless levels. <br /> <br /> And for all those who are not, you have lost a lot of time reading up to this point.
