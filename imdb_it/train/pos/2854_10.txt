Much has already been said in this film and I would like to join those who have praised it. It is a unique film of its kind that uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster movies without making a mess. At points you laugh out loud, in other places you feel for the characters whose mistakes and failures you look at. Sabu's genius can be shown in relation to some sequences in the film. One is one in which all three chasing men have an erotic dream of a young woman who has just passed by on the street. This sequence is well done and illustrates the characters of all three runners very well. It is erotic and fun at the same time. Another example of Sabu's genius is the part of the film in which the runners get tired. First of all one of them, the typical loser among the three boys, hallucinating that the woman who left him for someone else is back again and you see them dancing with each other and in the next shot to dance with himself which is deeply moving. All runners arrive at this point where they think they have something in return that they have lost or are back on track. And in one part of the film they stop chasing each other, running in a row, laughing. Here is all the beauty and the ridiculousness of what we call the life that Sabu manages to show throughout the film. His characters fail (do they do it in the end?) But he doesn't rob them of their dignity. "Monday" and "Postman Blues" that do justice to Sabu's claim to be a genius. Go look at them! <br /> <br />
