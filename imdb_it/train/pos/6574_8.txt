It might be difficult for some people to enter, to be used to Hollywood production styles. The direction is not inspired, apparently simply a revival of the stage set-up, and the audio quality is bad here and there (the rustling of people's clothes occasionally competes with their voices, etc.). <br /> <br /> My friends and I started looking without knowing what to expect, and the first scene almost put us off. It looked very seasoned and cheese. Then we caught the tone of the content and we really started having fun. <br /> <br /> It's very funny, despite a little bit of malice. Definitely give a chance if you appreciate great dialogue. Besides, Helena Bonham Carter is adorable, of course.
