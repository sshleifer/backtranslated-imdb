This is a really funny, airy, light romantic comedy. You can't go wrong with the nice elegance of Meg Ryan combined with the genius of Albert Einstein. Normally, I'm not a fan of invented stories completely made up of real people, now dead and unable to defend themselves, but I think the late Einstein laughed a little at this. <br /> <br /> They are the 50s ... Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. The story revolves around a spooky young mathematician, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who is ready to marry a stupid idiot, a behavioral researcher named James, just because she has the brain she's looking for in the father of her future child. However, it is love at first sight when his car breaks down and meets a mechanic by the name of Ed (Tim Robbins). Since she doesn't think Ed is smart enough, her uncle, none other than Albert Einstein, interprets the match, assisted in his efforts to three mischievous cronies, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert has to make Ed look smart, so he creates a charade that portrays him as a physicist ... naturally with funny results. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau is his usual hilarious self, and he pulls out Einstein's character quite effectively. With his three professional friends, Kurt, Nathan and Boris, lots of laughter ensues. The real Einstein had a genuine human side and this film takes a further (outrageous) step forward. If you suspend all the logic, you can almost imagine that this stupid story is happening! <br /> <br /> It may not be a rocket science (despite its main character), but it is a wonderful sweet and refreshing movie. One of the best in the comedy novel genre.
