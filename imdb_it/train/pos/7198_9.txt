This is a really nice movie and one that I enjoyed watching several times. Michael Caine is fantastic as always. Michael Caine has received a certain reputation for taking part in any film, no matter what its quality or lack of it, but it makes a good turn in interpreting Sidney. From the beginning it is so well written. Who would have thought that Ira Levin, who wrote such gruesome things as The boys of Brazil and Rosemary's Baby, could write something witty. Let's face it - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones ... how are you going to go wrong with a cast of this genre directed by Sidney Lumet. <br /> <br /> I'm really reticent to go because if someone were to give something on this film it would be a crime. Watch it and worship it.
