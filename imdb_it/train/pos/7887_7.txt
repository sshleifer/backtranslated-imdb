If you are a passionate Freddy fan, then you might not like it. This seems to be a parody of the nightmare series. There's not much to see here. The only reason he stands up is the backstory on Freddy. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is always great in the Nightmare movies are the scenes of death. But the scenes of death were very disgusting in this. The visual effects were fantastic and the acting was OK but the background was excellent. Basically, Freddy's story ends in this. <br /> <br /> I read negative reviews for this, but I really enjoyed it despite its many flaws: <br /> <br /> 1. A nightmare on Elm Street. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3. A nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 4. A nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. A nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend it if you like series. This was Freddy's completely explained but that's all there is. Next on my list Wes Cravens New Nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
