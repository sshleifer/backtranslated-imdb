One reviewer notes that it doesn't seem to matter what Welles says or does, it moves you. I agree. It was and remains a unique force in the film. More than a triple threat that he could act, write and direct, he had a genius particularly suited to the film. It can be considered whether he would have been a painter at a previous age. This film definitely reinforces this impression. A musician, a theater actor, a Shakespeare heir? hard to say, but I am very grateful that his time with the film and caught him in a movie. I like the accent. I like the face, the size, the style, the mind and the games. I love all his films and I wish there were more. I particularly like how other actors interacted with him in a film. Many were never better or at least somewhat different with him because he was or firmly there. Even towards the end, when his beauty was ruined, perhaps by his own intentions, it was impossible to ignore him and he did all the scenes he was in. Rita was a beautiful blonde - a Lana Turner resembled but perhaps even more beautiful and even then the eye goes to Welles and wishes him for another minute, another film, another hour in his company. This is why we all want to be able to meet the lost scraps of his films because we know, we all know, that there is no part of him that is not worthy of our time. Watch it and be grateful for the opportunity.
