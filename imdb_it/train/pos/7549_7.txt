A young cat tries to steal the soul from its brothers from death but gets only half and then has to go on an adventure to get the other half ... or maybe not. Frankly, I'm not sure what happens in this film that is full of very strange, very surreal images, some of which could be disturbing to parents (ie, cats that cut away part of a pig that is traveling with them and frying them like all three of them eat bacon. <br /> <br /> This is a very strange film that some have compared to Hello Kitty in acid, I think it's more like Hello Kitty made by Dali. (Surely this is more alive than Destiny, which was based directly on his work). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a very interesting film that will test your perceptions of things, then watch this movie. Just be ready for some very images strange that will be burned in your memory forever. <br /> <br />
