At first I didn't think Ben Affleck could really pull off a fun Christmas movie, boy was I wrong, my daughter invited me to see it with her and I wasn't disappointed at all. James Gandolfini was fun, I really liked Christina Appelagate and even Catherine O 'Hara was good, the plot is what really sold me, I mean, too much with the family, at the table for people who barely see but one or two times a year, and probably don't get along anyway, you really need alcohol as much as your system can bear to face Christmas, so I thought the premise was good there, buying the family for $ 250,000 was a little exaggerated, but it turned out to be very useful for me, because it was a revolt to the end, showing the class struggle of the different families. has many fun moments, including embarrassing things on the computer for a teenager. all in all I loved this movie and I'll watch it again next Christmas or sooner if my daughter wants it too.
