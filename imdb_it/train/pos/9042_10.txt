I think I read this somewhere: Joe Johnston (director of the film and also one of the guys who founded Industrial Light and Magic for the work on the first Star Wars movie) and one of his producers or something was throwing a tantrum for a title for the film, "Rocket Boys" (I think) was missing something. <br /> <br /> One day they were messing with a PC program that forms words from other words (for example: you type a word or a series of words and mix the letters and form other words) I think the term technician is an "anagram" <br /> <br /> However, they have typed "Rocket Boys" and surely the one that returns is "October Sky". They were shocked to say the least. The title summarizes everything in the film since the film revolves around Sputnik. At first Homer Jr did not like the idea, but he warmed up to it after the "printed cover novel" came out and took off.
