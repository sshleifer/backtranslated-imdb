Page 3 is certainly a compelling and engaging eye opener that very skilfully exposes the hypocritical lifestyle of the Mumbai elite. From fake kisses to plastered smiles, it leaves no stone unturned in revealing the shocking lives of the rich and the famous. Backstabbing, gossip, corruption and scandal lurk in every dark corner of the world of pageantry and glam. Humanity and generosity are analogous to an oasis in the desert in this world where social Darwinism is the prevailing mentality. Everyone is constantly looking for more money, more fame and a higher reputation, pushing them to do the most shameful things imaginable, from movie signing contracts to a funeral to child molestation. Everything is possible in this metropolis where there is such a wide gap between social classes. The public sees the ugliness of both these classes through the eyes of the protagonist. Observe the suffocating atmosphere and the mind-boggling frenzy in which the socialists live. Bollywood, business tycoons, politicians and underworld are all intertwined in a completely twisted chaos! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a beautiful track as is the lively Kuan Main Doob Jaongi. Outstanding film with excellent character development!
