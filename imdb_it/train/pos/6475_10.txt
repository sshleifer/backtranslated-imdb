There are only 2 episodes in a 5-part drama, but I can already say that this is one of the best things I've ever seen. This is on TV, silver screen or even in real life. <br /> <br /> As a writer, it's so beautiful that it's almost demoralizing! As a spectator, it's so funny that I'm bored that the episodes last more than fifteen days instead of Monday to Friday. It is clear that all these negative aspects are actually positive. <br /> <br /> I am a modern guy who had previously turned into a television series. Compared to films, television dramas always seemed dated, rather docile and, in general, boring! "Five Days" really brought television drama in the 21st century, so for me, at least, it's changing the mind. Go see it.
