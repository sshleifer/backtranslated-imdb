The Man in the White Suit is one of those delicious comedies that Ealing's studios did so well in the 40s and 50s. The plot of this follows a man who invents a cloth that does not get dirty or break. Of course, this is a huge step forward in the textile world. However, things are not so simple as the fabric will threaten the lives of many people, including fabric manufacturers, fabric workforce and even an old lady who washes every week. The man in the white suit is a film about scientific progress and the way they don't always help; as the old woman says at one point in the film, "Why can't you leave the scientists alone?" <br /> <br /> Like so many Ealing comedies, this is the protagonist of Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor; he has the ability to illuminate the screen with his presence (and does so in this film, literally), but he also manages to portray his characters in a realistic and credible way. It is appropriately creepy in this film, and captures the right atmosphere for his character; an intelligent and ambitious scientist, but a little naive. Along with Guinness, The Man in the White Suit also includes Joan Greenwood, the deep-voiced actress who starred alongside Guinness in simply divine "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and Michael Gough, a man who would continue to play the role of Alfred in the Batman films. The acting in the film is not always excellent, but it is always decent, and is suitable for the film. <br /> <br /> The man in white is an intelligent, stimulating and witty comedy with a moral. Comedy is not always obvious, and it does not always work, but the film does not want to be a film that causes belly laughs, so it is forgivable. I recommend this film, in practice, to anyone who is a fan of films.
