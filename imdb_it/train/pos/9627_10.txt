This is by far the funniest short made by the two cartoon geniuses. From the moment they enter, to the moment when Hardy falls from the roof, this makes me laugh hysterically. I strongly suggest that all Laurel and Hardy fans should see this short. I also recommend all the Ghost Series. If you're looking for laughter, watch this movie and you'll be happy.
