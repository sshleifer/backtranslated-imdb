For anyone who has judged others at the first meeting, here is the perfect tutorial on character depth. The grumpy old lady has a sweet and thoughtful heart and needs new friends. The fickle, insecure, "corny" woman who makes inappropriate and uncomfortable comments - sees deeply in your soul and has pure love for everyone. The cold, primitive, correct and neglected wife has a passion that boils that could boil at any time - given the right setting. Perfect beauty - rich, sweet, festive, haunted by crowds - wants peace, tranquility and love without possessiveness. <br /> <br /> Taking the time to look beyond the surface, you'll find treasures in everyday life, from less predictable sources. All you need is patience and a touch of enchantment.
