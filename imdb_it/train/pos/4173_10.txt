A kind of old-style road movie in the province of Slowenian in late summer. At first you see someone in underwear sewing black cloth pants, and when the same young man in black pants leaves the house with two suitcases, you see that the part of the pants is missing on a mourning flag (it seems that his father died) . In the train he meets a young lady, and almost without words, but with many small gestures, a wonderful love story begins. It is a film that is a bit surreal, very poetic and a bit bizarre, with many strange characters and strange incidents. Beautiful photos with love for beautiful details.
