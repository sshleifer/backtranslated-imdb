This game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be the biggest success. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought it was a good game, but then Nightfire came around and it was better, but now there's a new kind of James Bond game. This time it's a third person shooter and there are more than 12 missions, the game's graphics are out of this house. He also has all the great actors and actresses in this game like Pierce Bronsan as well as James Bond, William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo, and Judi Dench as M (forgive me if you spell badly). This game would be the biggest James Bond game around. <br /> <br /> I would give a 10/10
