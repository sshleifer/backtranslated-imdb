The superb star of Gerard Philipe, who died too young, leaps from the screen in this witty, funny, subtly arrogant comedy with a lot of sword fencing and backward antics. Fascinating in its way of telling, impossible to resist. A sweet romantic comedy with a very young Gina Lollobrigida as the love interest. A film that you will remember with great affection.
