I saw this film earlier today and was amazed by the accuracy of the dialogue for the main characters. It didn't look like a movie - it felt more like a documentary (the part I liked best). The protagonists of this film seemed to me as real as those of fifteen years I know. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very funny film for those who love independent films.
