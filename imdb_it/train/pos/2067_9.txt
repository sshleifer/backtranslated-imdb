While it is universally recognized that Fearful Symmetry has been heavily influenced by the Kolchak episode They have been, are, will be, if this makes it a rip-off or a tribute it is a completely controversial point. As a big fan of both series, I endorse this belief, although less charitable may not. James Whitmore was brave to take on the task of directing such a difficult episode, the invisible elephants and gorilla dresses seem a recipe for disaster, but he pulls it out in style, the teaser is a real gem. Lance Guest does a great job of creating a believable character from Kyle Lang and Jack Rader rebels against the threat of Ed Meecham. Forget the dubious originality of Fearful Symmetry and enjoy it simply as a deeply satisfying X File.
