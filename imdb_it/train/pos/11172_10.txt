Personally, I love this movie and this novel (I read the book first and decided to watch the film). First of all, the plot is truly original and unique. Even acting is great and I love the cast. Judd Crandall (plays Fred Gwynne) adapts perfectly to his role and really sells it to you. There are also some trivial lines launched there (Idk if they should be trivial), but in reality they lighten the atmosphere and provide a good laugh. The atmosphere of Maine is really a perfect place to film this movie and attracts you throughout the film. Not only will you love it but you will want to see it again and again, I recommend it 100% to any horror fan !!
