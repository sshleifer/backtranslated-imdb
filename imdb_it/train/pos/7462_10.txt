Note: These comments are for people who have seen the film. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a brilliant, complex and exciting film that precisely explores what the tag-line says: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Perhaps the film's plot can be focused for viewers of confused films if viewed from a different angle. <br /> <br /> Considering the following: <br /> <br /> Now, I have not painstakingly gone through the film scene by scene, so I will have to further examine my statements, (and welcome your thoughts) but try to see if the film doesn't fit: where exactly is the questionable "junction"? <br /> <br /> Now, I'm not talking about the junction as it is explained by the 'technical' LE, since that same sequence could be interpreted as a rationalization within the mind / dream / state of David Aames, but the real junction between reality and dream. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the reality of the car accident, the way it is filmed (no explosion, for example) is a probable junction point, and every particular sequence that contains an existential feeling dream / coma / non-reality - whether it is shown on the screen before or after the crash - is actually a part of Aames's personal journey towards self-realization within his own mind. <br /> <br /> In this respect, therefore, we remain with two very fine questions (if you know more, let me know): Aames is actually disfigured and where does he wake up? <br /> <br /> If you don't feel completely involved in the exact sequence of details in the plot, or in what particular point your dreams are scattered everywhere, this film becomes a fascinating exploration of a human being on a journey to research of himself and this means in today's pop culture society. <br /> <br />
