Canadian director Vincenzo Natali has conquered the art circuit with the intriguing and surprisingly clever Cube, which is my favorite SF movie of the 90s. He framed the basic idea of ​​a group of strangers trapped in a giant cube-shaped maze, shot entirely on a set, and took this idea in fascinating directions. <br /> <br /> I have been looking forward to the follow-up to Natali, and although it took me five years to edit another project, I am pleased to say that it was worth the wait. Cypher is a fascinating exploration of a man's role in the world, and as through a completely logical chain of events, he finds himself in a situation beyond his control. <br /> <br /> I don't want to reveal too much the plot, because one of Cypher's joys is the different roads that lead us down. It's so refreshing these days to see a science fiction movie that has more than one idea in mind. Cypher is such a film. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), one of the blandest people who has ever walked the planet, is hired by the DigiCorp company. They send him to different parts of America to record several seminars. Because of its loss, they are incredibly boring. Covering topics as trivial as shaving cream and cheese. <br /> <br /> While Morgan is waiting for a seminar, he runs into Rita Foster (an impeccable cast Lucy Liu), the definition of an ice maiden. She gives him the green light, but there is something for her that she finds irresistible. It is not too surprising considering the dry marriage in which it is found. <br /> <br /> When Rita shows up at another of Morgan's seminars, she tells him that her life is not the one that appears. And I'm not saying anything else about the plot. Doing this would reduce the impact the rest of the film has on us, as well as the winding path that is so fun to follow. <br /> <br /> As for Cube, Natali shows a certain talent for apparently ordinary understanding of people, taking them out of the familiar, and basically seeing what will happen when they are projected into the unknown. And Cypher follows similar models. But it's not a carbon copy of Cube. He has his inspiration. <br /> <br /> Cypher is a film that has more in common with plot thrillers and paranoia stories. One of the great things about Cypher is how these themes creep into the story without your knowledge. When Morgan realizes that his false identity is a much bigger piece of a puzzle, for us it's as much of a shock as it is for him. <br /> <br /> One thing that distinguishes Cypher from Cube is how much more polished it is. Where Cube has been confined to a minimalist environment and a tight budget with a cast of strangers, Cypher is also on a low budget, but Natali economises it as much as possible, allowing it to widen the horizon and launch Morgan on an incredible journey through the maze of one's identity. <br /> <br /> Natali's direction is exceptional, with a skillful hand on the reins. There are some incredible angles of shooting from above, like the enormity of the DigiCorp building like a vast and sturdy office building in conjunction with the insignificant speck that is Morgan outside. All the color seems to have been erased from the photo, which perfectly complicates the tone of the film like a modern film noir. <br /> <br /> Acting is uniformly excellent throughout. Jeremy Northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to question his identity. His performance is excellent because it is so modulated. It literally seems to transform right before our eyes. From a whining clinician, without a spine, to a confident man who will do everything to preserve his new identity. <br /> <br /> David Hewlett has a pleasant appearance that has had such an impact in Cube. He resides in a secret silo that seems to have been borrowed from Men in Black. His scene is one of the best because it is a carefully calculated exercise in suspense and paranoia. He is a supposed expert in identifying double agents, and is a fantastic piece of writing, brilliantly played by Hewlett. All he has to do is look at Morgan, and we are drawn into his complex mental game. <br /> <br /> But it's Lucy Liu who is the scene thief here. Too often it is cast in films where its potential is not fully exploited. But in Cypher, she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove. Rita is a detached and guarded femme fatale who lives with taste. He revived me every time he appeared because she was always in control and could reduce a room to silence with the power of her cold stare alone. <br /> <br /> Things come to a very gratifying conclusion, which does not end on an ambiguous note like Cube did. But Morgan deserves his happy ending. After he was put in the middle of the ringtone like this, I rooted for him in the final scene. It's a perfect final moment because it looks like a ray of sunshine after the sad 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Cypher is successful on all fronts. Engaging, shocking, always fun, that's all Total Recall wanted to be, but it wasn't. And it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix. <br /> <br /> A nice sequel to Natali. And now I'm a passionate fan of man. Superb stuff!
