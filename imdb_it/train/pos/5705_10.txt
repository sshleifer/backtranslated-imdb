A wonderful first musical film by Ren√© Clair, funny and witty like his silent "The Italian Straw Hat". Using sound in an expressive way and not just for dialogue and effects, Clair influenced the first musicals in America (the scene of A Night at the Opera's work is strongly influenced by Le Million, for example). It should (but will not be) seen by all cinephiles, and the Criterion DVD is exactly up to expectations. There are not a lot of extras, but most of the extra DVDs I've seen are useless and the Clair disk interview on disk is one I've never seen before. Download it while it's still around.
