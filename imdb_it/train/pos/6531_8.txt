I really enjoyed this movie ... it was nice. I liked it, but if you didn't, it's your fault. Emma Roberts played a good Nancy Drew, even if it's not quite like books. Old fashion clothes are weird when you see them in modern times, but she looks good on them. For me, rich girls didn't have clothes that made them rich. I mean, it looks like they had all the clothes - blindfolded - in a garage sale and decided to put them all together. All the clothes were in bad taste, especially when they wore moccasins in their regular clothes. I don't want to make the film look bad, because it certainly wasn't! Just go to the theater and watch it !!! You will like it!
