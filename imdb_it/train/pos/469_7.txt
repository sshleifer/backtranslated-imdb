The plot was quite interesting, but the characters were rather flat and sometimes too extreme in their thoughts / behavior. More extreme than necessary. Also, I think something went wrong with the cast. John Turtorro doesn't really satisfy me by playing a semi-autistic chess player, not to mention the Italian player. Even the reasons were not outlined. <br /> <br />
