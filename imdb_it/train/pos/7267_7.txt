Curly Sue is a 6 year old girl with an abundance of hair and a vagrant life. She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), try to survive in the streets being little scammers of the time. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of a car in an expensive garage, while Curly will shout about lawsuits and traction to the intended victim. It happens to be a very sophisticated lawyer named Gray (Kelly Lynch) who is appropriately horrified by what he did. Not only do the scammers make some money, they spend the night in Gray's luxurious apartment. Even then, Gray feels he owes her much more, so all three are together for a spell. Gray knows only the lucrative legal activity and nothing about life. Who could have taught her better than Bill and Curly, those experienced real life experts? But all good things must end and there is no life for a legal expert and a couple of scammers. Or is there? This is a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected. Curly is certainly as fun as Shirley Temple but much more angular, of course. Belushi gives a rare moving performance as the negative side of his luck cone and Lynch is as luminous as the haughty but tender lawyer. John Hughes, as a writer and director, shows us his magic touch once again, as the script is lively and unpredictable. Just look at Curly and Bill take Gray out for a night, with no money, and see the humorous results. Do you like the happy endings, long promised and finally delivered, with a few moments of uncertainty in the middle? This is your custom movie.
