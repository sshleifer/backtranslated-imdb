"The Intruder (The Intrus)" is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life. <br /> <br /> Grizzled Michel Subor interprets "Louis Trebor" as Jason Bourne as an old man with a hidden past, who simply lives in an isolated cabin in the woods for reasons that are rightly paranoid (but attracts beautiful young women who can be useful to him). We learn more about him through dreams, flashbacks and a journey that can take place chronologically or not, as well as through his abrupt interactions with family, lovers, business associates and a surprising nemesis. Like "The Limey", the film resonates with parental / child regrets and a suspect past revealed through clips from an old film with a young actor's own (here the adventure film by Paul Gégauff "The Reflux" of 1965) . <br /> <br /> In a complete contrast of moods, we meet his son Sidney (Grégoire Colin) who must be the sexiest home husband in the world, as gently and seductively does home repairs and cares of a child, a child and every need of his working wife Surely the director / co-author Claire Denis must have created it as a female fantasy if there had ever been a lesson for the other directors on the filming of the preliminaries. There is a further extended scene in which he searches for his father in the woods while carrying his angelic child with him in a bag. It is all that his father is not and has every relationship his father is unable to sustain; no wonder he thinks his father is "crazy". I spent the rest of the film fearing that something bad would happen to him as the true nature of his alienated father's heart gradually developed before our eyes. <br /> <br /> The film is a puzzle, but Subor is ruthlessly fascinating as we watch it cross countries and negotiate nefarious affairs, and the narrative voice for Denis's "Beau Travail" was still boring. We must understand from skylines and incidental signage that he is traveling to Geneva, Korea and the South Pacific. The time that passes is indicated by the changing seasons and the scars that are created and cared for. There are many images of water for cleaning and distancing. <br /> <br /> Continuing his fascination with the morphing of colonialism in globalization, in addition to playing a bit on the stereotypes of the Mysterious Orient and Russian criminals, Denis incorporated elements of Robert Louis Stevenson, Paul Gauguin and Marlon Brando's Tahiti idilli and a 40-page memorial by the French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, the last for the title and the plot of the heart-transplant used for an ironic theme of limited immortality that has consequences. <br /> <br /> While "Louis" thinks he has managed to be above boundaries, rules and morals, there is some fun in the last act since the locals don't know what to do with him and they try to help him solve his quixotic odyssey, even if he finds himself again in isolation. <br /> <br /> Several people in the audience were frustrated by the elliptical, but extraordinarily beautiful, way of telling stories. Unconventional fiction raises many questions about the plot in detail.
