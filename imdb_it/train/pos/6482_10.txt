I had just reached the age of thirteen when I first saw this series and I'm watching it again, on DVD, more than thirty years later. The photos on the headlines never left me. It has influenced my vision of the world and of the peoples it contains. My parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me, and we discussed the program later. He gave me the love for studying history and the highest score I got in our school's public exams! <br /> <br /> The voice and delivery of Sir Laurence Olivier is timeless and perfect. I have the feeling that the people who lived through it felt that this is their version of the history of the Second World War. I can't imagine getting bored watching it. Perhaps such a Cold War series could now be contemplated, though those who could replace Sir Laurence are hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> Buy it!
