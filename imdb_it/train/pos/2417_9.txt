"Going Berserk" is actually one of the most fun Candy movies I've ever seen, period. Sure, it's a low budget, but it's a non-stop tour de force. There are tons of memorable quotes. For example, when his future father-in-law asks him how much he earns, Candy says, "Oh, I pulled down between thirty and eleven thousand dollars a year, sir." Oh sure, it's Candy's delivery that sells it. Only classic things. Eugene Levy also turns into a hilarious performance as a sleazy director. A clip of his horrible low-budget film "Kung Fu U" will make you roll. <br /> <br /> So if you are a Candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem, I can't recommend this movie enough.
