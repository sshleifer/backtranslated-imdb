If this film had been made a few years later, I would have scored a point or two because the sound quality was rather poor. Sometimes the film seemed to be a silent film during the intermediate scenes (normal ambient sounds are missing). But since it was 1931 and a French film, this is completely forgivable. All the more so as this occurs also in subsequent French films - at that time the sound difficulties should have been completely resolved (as in L'Atalante of 1934). <br /> <br /> Ok, apart from a few minor problems, this is a nice movie about a missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it. And during the search there are a lot of little songs you can't do without pleasure. A beautiful film all in all.
