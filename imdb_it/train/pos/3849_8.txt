This last Dutch-speaking Verhooven film made me laugh well. As a film lover in search of all the little details and cross-references, in every film I can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece will delight all the senses. I haven't read the book by Gerard Reves, on which the film is based, but I still believe I have a sincere photo of a somewhat presumptuous poet / writer who gets his (in a sense - it doesn't hurt here). An anti-hero surrounded by characters who have their ambiguous intentions, like him. All this in a superbly packed cinematography, Paul Verhopven manages to transform the "gesellich places (?)" Otherwise pretty nice in a film-noir setting, awesome work!
