A great movie! Slow: YES. <br /> <br /> ... but original, deeply atmospheric, dark and terrifying, perfectly SURREAL (looks like a nightmare). <br /> <br /> I would compare it to David Lynch (Eraserhead Style, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet), maybe mixed with a bit of Barton Fink and Naked Lunch (Insects!). Also a bit of Jodorowsky (Fando y Lis) .... <br /> <br /> Add a bit of Night on Earth, Angel Heart and some Begotten, Pi, (would it be wrong to talk about Tetsuo? ) Jacob's Ladder, The Forbidden and Salome by Barker - which should be at least the concept of a dark night ... NUIT NOIRE. <br /> <br /> If you are out for an avantegardistic and / or surreal cinema (as I am) you will like this. If you expect something different from an action-packed movie with an average storyline, try your luck with something else. <br /> <br /> The final words: The plot is very, very strange and unusual and it is probably the # 1 reason that most people who do not like this film hate it.
