Friend, if anyone expected a great zombie movie after reading that title, then you're retarded and you deserve to be disappointed. For me, I was expecting a cheap zombie cheeseball movie - and that's exactly what I got. I was not disappointed at all. I thought it was a fantastic movie. The zombies were exactly as they should be, because all the zombies had just turned, so they are just dead zombies. Obviously they did it because it would have been quite expensive if they had made full-on zombie FX rotten. I understand everything, I have no idea how anyone could seriously catch this movie. It's called "HOOD OF THE LIVING DEAD" for the love of God! Would you like to watch "Redneck Zombies" and ANY Uwe Boll movies and actually WAIT that it's great? Obviously not! So, because there are some idiots on IMDb whining like school girls about this movie, I'll never understand. Oh and yes, there are worse movies out there, so stop saying that this was the worst you've ever seen, because you know you're full of it! Have you ever seen "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "House of the Dead" ???? THOSE are some of the worst I've ever seen. If you can't see that it's just a low-budget zombie movie, obviously made by zombie movie fans, then something is wrong with you. I just enjoyed it. Congratulations from me and I would also like to see a sequel.
