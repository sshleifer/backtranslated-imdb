I saw this movie for the first time when it came out. I was about 9 years old. old and I found this movie very funny and very scary and unlike any other movie I had seen so far. <br /> <br /> PLOT BASIC: An expedition is sent from Earth to the fourth planet of Altair, a great mainsequence star in the constellation Aquilae to find out what happened to a colony of settlers that landed twenty years before and from then she hadn't felt any more. <br /> <br /> THEME: An inferior civilization (ours) comes into contact with the remains of a very advanced alien civilization, the Krell - 200,000 years removed. The "seed" of the destruction of one civilization is passed to another, unknowingly at the beginning. The theme of this film is very good against evil. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time with my brother when it was originally released. I was just a boy and the tiger scenes really scared me as well as the battle scenes with the invisible creature force. I was also amazed at how real things were in the film. <br /> <br /> What really captures my attention as an adult is the truth of the "forbidden knowledge" film and how relevant it will be when we do (if ever) come into contact with an advanced (highly developed) civilization. than we ourselves are currently. Advanced technology and responsibility seem to go hand in hand. We must do the work for ourselves to acquire the knowledge and wisdom of how to use advanced technology. This is, in my opinion, the great moral of the film. <br /> <br /> I learned in graduate school that "knowledge is power" is at best, in fact, it is not correct! Knowledge is "potential" power depending on how it is applied (... if it is applied completely). [It's not what you know, but how you use what you know!] <br /> <br /> the impact of this movie could be realized sometime in the future of Mankind. This is knowledge in and of itself is not enough, we must, MUST have the wisdom that depends on knowledge to truly control our destiny OR we will end up like Krell in the film - just softened. <br /> A thousand thanks to those who responded to previous versions of this article with comments and corrections, they are all very much appreciated !! I hope you are as entertained by this story as I have been for the last 40 years .... <br /> <br /> Rating: 10 out 10 stars
