I really enjoyed watching this movie. like most people who have looked at it. I wasn't sure I understood. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and made a lot of funny movies; For example, act of sister. <br /> <br /> however this was not a real comedy. it's a drama with comic moments. so if you're looking for a laugh with laughter, keep looking. <br /> <br /> this film is about a black family moving from a nice neighborhood in the city to a middle-high class neighborhood. I would say more but I think it would ruin the film. this film is not only about racial relations between whites and blacks, but also relations with the black community. I think it's worth it. if you are not really interested in seeing another film on race relations, this film is not for you
