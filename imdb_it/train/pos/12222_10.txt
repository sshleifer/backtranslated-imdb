I thought this film was wonderfully plotted to make me confused and my cousin looking at me with it. To tell the truth I think the young kevin dillon was hot.hahahaha ... but I also thought that the girl was stupid to get along the cop and that was wrong what he had told her before his death "I was inside you ". I think that's what you get for doing what you did with him and how will he tell you he's too young when you never care how old the other girls were? now I don't think I can ever trust a cop like that. But to tell the truth it was quite obvious that it was him even if he wanted to become a policeman, I would still be suspicious of him in both ways. And that was funny when she sprayed him in the eyes in the shop. It was still stupid to go back to the store alone and so was the cop who died HELLO !! it's called back-up. Sometimes these films make me crazy when people act stupid and do stupid things. But that's what I think is a thought for the film.
