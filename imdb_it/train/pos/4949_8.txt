10 ITEMS O LESS is one of those images "under the radar" that is imbued with the simplicity that most independent films have: honest and ad hoc performances by its two protagonists: Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega who create a rather complementary duo unlikely. The nice thing is that this film seems unlikely despite its "road movie" roots. Like the anonymous Morgan Freeman character, psychologically (not physically), she arrives where she meets this carefree check-out girl who has an unhealthy relationship with her current supervisor (who also happens to look after her with her unfaithful husband played by Bobby Cannavale in a small role) is somehow left to us to witness more than deduce and their jokes - two people on opposite sides of the society's coin - are deceptively simple. So in a nutshell, while there are no bum! Moments of shocking revelations, this film is an eccentric little mood mood that probably got lost due to the indie shuffle released in 2006 but that deserves to be seen, even if only for its honesty.
