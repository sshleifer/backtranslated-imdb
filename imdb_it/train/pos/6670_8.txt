There are many problems with Mystery Men. First of all there are too many different characters for all of them who must have complex or even interesting personalities. The special effects distract from the story and are not that special. Paul Reubens is wasted in a pathetic and youthful role as a character who merely farts and speaks in an imperceptible accent. <br /> <br /> Now on the decent parts. William H Macy, three heavenly words, and his interpretation as a shovel is perfect. The Sphinx is an exceptionally funny character who is just mysterious and limits himself to pouring out the traditional mystic proverbs. Ben Stiller is also very funny, showing a weak character who tries to be part of the great superhero championships. All the characters do, and this is an area that I found particularly ironic. This is because all the actors are independent film actors who try to make it in the big Hollywood championships. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the reason I thought it had failed at the box office is that America doesn't get it irony. <br /> <br /> All in all, I loved the movie, but I think it would have worked better if we had more effort to edit the script than to have unnecessary CGI effects and landscapes.
