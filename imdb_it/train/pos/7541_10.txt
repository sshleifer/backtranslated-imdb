This Showtime movie really deserves a viewer rating far better than a 4.5; I gave a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars. After reading the viewers' comments, I was surprised how many people expected this film to be a comedy. Yes, I see that IMDb lists it as Comedy / Drama in General. This is certainly misleading, isn't it? Fortunately, I saw the movie before connecting to this site, so I didn't have that expectation. In fact, based on the synopsis of what I heard, I expected it to be just a drama. I wonder if disappointing this not being a funny movie caused so many low votes. <br /> <br /> Another factor that may have caused low ratings is that this film is very character-driven. "Driving Miss Daisy" is an example of another character-based movie that comes to mind. Someone's previous comment complained of a boring test. The work scenes of Tom (Danny Glover) seemed to distract from the actual plot of the film. That is, how he was planning his family's ascending social ascent - or his personal troops, if you will. However, they served to establish credibility and justification as his right to move to Greenwich and move "up" to the world. <br /> <br /> Tom's obsession became a compulsion. He showed that he would stop at nothing to blend into the white quarter. His disappointment when another black person moved next door was not due to the color of his skin. It was because of all that the intruder represented; all that Tom had left behind. In essence, Tom had become an Oreo cookie: black on the outside but white on the inside. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of this film are among the most powerful written, directed and performed (by Whoopi Goldberg) I have never had the pleasure of testifying. I realized that the highlight of the film was not the obvious event that happened next door (I don't want to give it away). The climax is verbal and Whoopi delivers it. I'm still not sure if it's the conversation when he tells Tom about Tom-Two college or when he releases it, all in the middle of the night and Tom wakes up. However, the epilogue is great. You know that life on that road will never be the same. <br /> <br /> My favorite type of character-driven film: people go through problems, a little pain, dance, grow, change and life goes on. As a member of the public, I could learn something or be inspired.
