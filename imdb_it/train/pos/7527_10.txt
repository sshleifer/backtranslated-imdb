More a snapshot of the most famous pinup of all time than the typical biographical film dragged, this fun and fabulous film has the look and atmosphere of the era with an excellent soundtrack and everything you would want in a film independent. I think the tendency would be to portray Bettie Page as a kind of sexual fox, like a Jayne Mansfield. But if you really looked carefully at Bettie's poses, she always seemed happy. It's not a "would you like to have with me" a haughty look, nor "I'm just doing this because my acting career didn't work". It looks like a porn star. And so, the women involved in this film (three female producers, a writer / director, a female co-writer and the adorable Gretchen Mol, who I'm sure helped shape this role with her own sugary influence) really do captured the idea of ​​a sweet girl, a little naive, from the south, who really enjoyed taking a picture and hoping that good old JC is not too angry with her. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol has a high-performance career (she might even have the most perfect breast ever), of which I am happy, because she had the curse. Several years ago, he made the cover of Vanity Fair when no one really knew who he was, giving her the name of the next It-girl. And let's be honest, it was a bit presumptuous. I mean, unfortunately, it never came to the state of Gwyneth, though not for lack of talent. Making some poor film choices when you're a beautiful blonde in the fickle Hollywood makes you forget I'm scared. If this doesn't bring her back to A-list, well, I'll be the uncle of a monkey. <br /> <br /> Intensely private, Bettie herself hasn't seen the movie yet. Bettie left the party high and fell in love with her old flame, Jesus. Whatever floats your boat, honey. You were a helluva woman. I hope you're happy wherever you are. <br /> <br /> Congratulations Mary Harron, you made our cult idol.
