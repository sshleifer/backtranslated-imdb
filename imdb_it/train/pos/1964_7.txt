I cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers. They are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past. I'd like to see a comment from someone who had never seen Basic Instinct 1, maybe someone very young? I left the cinema happy not to have been influenced by IMDb reviewers. 14 hours later I'm still trying to find flaws in the plot but I can't think of anything serious. My advice to everyone is to see it alone and decide for yourself. <br /> <br /> A similar model to Basic Instinct 1 follows, but the plot is less confusing. He still left me wondering in the end, but in a more satisfying way. Sharon Stone is as sexy and evil as before and is wearing her 48 years extremely well; this remains its defining role. David Morrisey was satisfying even though he is not Michael Douglas. I was particularly pleased with David Thewlis as a police detective.
