This short film that inspired the upcoming feature film - Spatula Madness - is a hilarious piece that contrasts with similar cartoons that generate more writers. The short film interprets Edward the Spatula who, after being fired from his job, joins the fight against evil spoons. This premise allows some fun content to start with, but is barely present for the rest of the function. The 15 minute run time of this film is absorbed by a comedy with a bizarre and a small musical number. Unfortunately there isn't much else under it. The plot set doesn't really have time to show. But surely it follows the plot better than many high-budget Hollywood movies. This film deserves to be watched at least a couple of times. Take it for what it is, and don't expect a deep story.
