There have been countless films spoken by animals in the past, most of which present the mouths of digitally animated animals to adapt almost to dubbing, or are ridiculously amateur. "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is neither. <br /> <br /> This film does not need the infantile addition of moving canine lips or feline limb gestures. He has the ability to make you believe that animals speak authentically to each other, and you can feel rather emotionally attached to them (as should all great boy and dog movies). <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound is the epitome of all animal games for the whole family and boasts a beautiful photograph, an inspired soundtrack (from the genius of Bruce Broughton) and an impressive cast ... <br /> <br /> Michael J. Fox ... Chance <br /> <br /> Sally Field ... Sassy <br /> <br /> Don Ameche ... Shadow <br /> <br /> Frank Welker (Voice of God) ... Miscellaneous <br /> <br /> It is a modernized version of the classic children's novel "The Incredible Journey", which was transformed into a semi-documentary film of Disney a long time ago, in the 1963. The sequel (Lost in San Fransisco) is not nearly a good movie, but extends the adventure of my friends to favorite hairy feet, and it's a fun urban twist on the theme of the grand-outdoor adventure. Do you want to entertain your children with a mini-epic witty, cute, touching, without the idiotic and often completely ridiculous comedy of modern children's cinema? Parents, buy all three movies for your kids - now! Thank you, Disney, for bringing a tear to my eyes every time I look at this classic from the 90s!
