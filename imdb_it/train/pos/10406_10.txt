Abu, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD, helps King Ahmed to regain his kingdom from an evil sorcerer. <br /> <br /> While Europe was going to war and some important sections of the world were on fire, Sir Alexander Korda's London Films unveiled this lavish escape from the legends of The Arabian Nights. Full of swords and witchcraft, in 1940 he gave the public a short break from the titles. It's also a nice piece of film, with good acting and a smart script. <br /> <br /> Conrad Veidt gets top marks and deserves it, playing the evil wizard Jaffar. His saturnine face with his piercing eyes reminds of the macabre roles he has interpreted with such taste during silent days. Here is a villain that is worth watching. Like the boy Thief, Sabu is perfectly chosen for this, his third film. Although he is not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in action and action. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast does a good job. John Justin is as energetic and sensitive as the unenlightened king who must know the realities of life the hard way; Sabu gets a significant part of the action (when it's not turned into a dog) but Justin is properly athletic when needed. The beautiful June Duprez is endangered by the Princess of Basra, coveted by two very different men. Appearing late in the movie, the massive Rex Ingram shakes things up like a genius with an attitude. <br /> <br /> Allan Jeayes uses his beautiful voice to the advantage of the Narrator. Miles Malleson has another eccentric role as the child Sultan of Basra, always focused on his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the script and dialogue of the film). Morted Morton Selten portrays the benevolent king of legend. Mary Morris, later an exceptional theatrical actress, plays the dual role of Jaffar's accomplice and the six-armed silver dancer. <br /> <br /> The film was started in Britain, but the difficulties of the war led Korda to move to southern California, which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast. The art direction, in the vibrant Technicolor, is very attractive, especially the fairy-tale architecture in blue, white and pink. <br /> <br /> ****************** ******* <br /> <br /> Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924, Sabu was employed in the Maharaja of the Mysore stables when he was discovered by Korda's company and placed in front of the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best and he found himself working in Hollywood when they were completed. After a distinguished military service in World War II, he resumed his film career, but remained endlessly confined for years to ethnic roles in unidentified minor films, NARCISO NERO (1947), being the only major exception. His final film, A TIGER WALKS (1964) by Walt Disney was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963, only 39 years old.
