What could be better in this: some small inventive and genuinely creepy effects that will be felt even under the skin of the most hardcore horror fans. He does not rely on the refined soundtrack for his "gotcha" moments. Even if you've seen it all, there are still some things in this movie that will blow your mind. <br /> <br /> What could have been better? The acting was sometimes flat and unconvincing. It had a "shot-on-video" quality in some places (although, mostly, it reached the atmosphere it was looking for), and the camera work is full of useless first plans of meaningless actions. Even if the effects are really gruesome, I think they might have gone to the well too many times with some of them. The finale seemed hasty and flew over what could have been moments of greater impact. The viewer is left to imagine many things for himself, not as a challenge from the directors, but because they missed him. <br /> <br /> Again, a good little independent horror film that is easily more passages above average. It is worth the rental.
