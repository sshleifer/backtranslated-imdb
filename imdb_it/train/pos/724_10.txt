The film is simply fun ... perhaps more fun for those of us who were young and fans of "The Ramones" in the period in which the film was made. I've watched the movie over and over again, alone and with friends, and it's still fresh and fun. At the risk of being too serious, the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless, and high school students who are bored with the hard work of some classes are just as timeless. <br /> <br /> And, the film has some gems of lines / scenes ..... references to how our "permanent record" in high school will follow us through life. (I assure you that I have been out of school for, uhhh, some years and is not following me) ..... the famous "static" line ("I'm getting a little static" ..... "Not as much as you will have, "as the principal approaches Togar) ... the member of the school board that is so decrepit is attended by nurses ... the monitors of the Nazi Hall love the" search of the body "...... Principal Togar announces "I'll give you the final solution" and burn the Ramones records (note: the records were the ones that preceded the CDs) .... and of course Joey Ramone noted, "Things have certainly changed since we were kicked out of high school ", followed by Togar asking" Do your parents know you are Ramones? "<br /> <br /> Just a tip ... don't look for where the stars are right now ..... Joey Ramone is sadly young. Dey Young, who was a great hottie in the film, today reminds us that we all grow old .... PJ Soles' career has never progressed as we would have expected ......... Marla Rosenfield, like the other students, apparently he appeared only in this film (one of my male friends dies on her every time we watch the film), even though her performance was more than adequate and she should have brought her younger film roles. And does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steele? <br /> <br /> So look and have fun ..... don't think .... just have FUN!
