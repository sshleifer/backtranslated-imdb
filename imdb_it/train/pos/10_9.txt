I'm a male, not given to movies for women, but this is really a special story well done. I don't have a personal love for Jane Fonda as a person, but she does one hell of a good job, while DeNiro is his usual excellent self. Everything is so well done: acting, directing, images, settings, photography, casting. If you can enjoy a story of real people and true love, this is a winner.
