It is not necessary to read this review. <br /> <br /> A previous pninson review by Seattle has already identified all the major shortcomings of this production. I can only amplify his basic arguments. <br /> <br /> Bleak House was a relatively recent Dickens novel and is much darker than his previous work. This is taken too literally by the director, Ross Devenish, who heaps too much darkness and fog. When Ada, Rick and Esther appear, half an hour in the opening episode, it's a relief just to be in the light of day for the first time. In some of the darker scenes it was difficult to see what was actually on my TV screen. I saw it all in one day, starting mid-afternoon. When the light of day has faded, this has become less of a problem, but I have a good TV and I have never encountered this problem before. <br /> <br /> The pace is very deliberate (ie slow). I'm sure this was intensional, but it's exaggerated. There are numerous shots of people trudging through the manure and darkness of Victorian London that are held longer than necessary to establish the atmosphere and atmosphere. A good editor could probably take several minutes for each fifty-minute episode, without losing a line of dialogue, just by lightly shredding each of these scenes. <br /> <br /> I don't want to go overboard with these two problems. You soon adapt to the appearance and rhythm of this production. The most important problem is that it does not always tell the story very effectively. Dickens's previous novels are as long as Bleak House, but they are not so complicatedly designed. For example, I recently re-read Nicholas Nickleby because it intrigued me to see how Douglas McGrath filled an 800-page book in his two-hour movie. The answer is simple: the book is full of padding. McGrath has cut large parts of the novel while retaining all the essential elements of the story. This would not be possible with Bleak House. <br /> <br /> This production needs its seven hours. Probably, it needs even more, because many elements of its twisted plot are not sufficiently clear, or well managed, as they should be. Some random examples will illustrate the problems. <br /> <br /> The waitress, Rosa, appears out of nowhere with no background, so Lady Dedlock's attachment to her is largely groundless. <br /> <br /> The acquiescence of Sergeant George in Tulkinhorn the request for a Horton handwriting sample is somewhat altered. <br /> <br /> It has not been made clear enough that Esther is really in love with Woodcourt when she agrees to marry John Jarndyce. Nor is it clear that they have agreed not to announce their engagement, or why. <br /> <br /> The secret marriage of Ada and Rick has been omitted. In one episode they are simply lovers, in the next people are suddenly referring to them as husband and wife. <br /> <br /> Ms. Rouncewell is introduced only at an advanced stage of the story and Sargeant George's departure from her family is left unexplained - as is the means by which she was discovered. <br /> <br /> Tulkinhorn's dedication to maintaining the honor and respectability of the Dedlock family is underestimated, so the reason for persecuting Lady Dedlock is darker than it needs to be. <br /> <br /> The involvement of brick makers with Tom and (later) Lady Dedlock is quite opaque. <br /> <br /> It is not obvious that Guppy renews his offer to Ester because his smallpox scars have almost disappeared. <br /> <br /> This is only a selection: there are others. They are not important problems and the main thrust of the story is quite clear. Nevertheless, they are minor irritations that diminish his power: you shouldn't have to deal with small dots in the plot. However, there are more important structural problems that weaken the story in its later stages. <br /> <br /> The entire activity of Tulkinhorn's murder is somehow thrown away. Bucket immediately identifies Hortense as suspect, which undermines the suspense of Sergeant George's situation and the importance of finding Mrs Rouncewell. It also decreases the impact of the sub-plot in which suspicion is launched on Lady Dedlock and weakens the scene in which Hortense is exposed in front of Sir Lester. <br /> <br /> A more serious problem is that the murder, her investigation and the subsequent search for Lady Dedlock, dominate the story for over an hour, during which we completely lose sight of the other main plot : the legal case and its effect on Rick. His missed finances, his fights of Vholes and Skimpole, Ada's despair, his declining health and so on, are all put on hold for an entire episode. This could be the way Dickens wrote the book (I haven't read it for years), but a good script should keep the different threads of the plot going forward together. <br /> <br /> Finally, the role of Smallweed in history has so diminished that it is almost superfluous. His discovery of the new will, which triggers the final phase of the story, is also thrown away. It happens outside the screen. <br /> <br /> In spite of everything, it's still an excellent production. Many of the performances are exceptional. The individual scenes are beautifully realized. His accumulative sense of tragedy is very powerful. I would still recommend it as a superb adaptation of a great book, had it not been for the 2005 production. In fact, I probably wouldn't be fully aware of its flaws if I hadn't seen how Andrew Davies did better. I have been critical of Davies' adaptations of Jane Austen, but I must admit that he really knows how to tame Dickens's books. <br /> <br /> This is an impressive and compelling drama and is worth seven hours for anyone. Nevertheless, its probable destiny is to be considered primarily as a cross-reference to the almost final version of 2005.
