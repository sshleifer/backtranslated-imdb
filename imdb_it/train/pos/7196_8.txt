As the serials go "Zorro's Fighting Legion" is one of the best action serials of the 1930s. Made at a time when the studios could still field a large cast, this has a wall-to-wall action in its 12 chapters. <br /> <br /> In 1824 the president of the newly formed Republic of Mexico Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) is trying to put his new country on a solid financial foundation. To this end, it has agreed that the rich gold shipments will be forwarded to the capital by the local mine of San Mendolita. <br /> <br /> Members of the local plot to steal expeditions on behalf of Don-del-Oro to golden armored god, who with the help of the local Yaqui tribe hopes to establish himself as ruler of Mexico. Opposite him is Don Francisco (Guy D'Ennery) who forms a legion of locals to help Juarez. When Don Franciso is assassinated by the men of Don-del-Oro, a foreigner, the Scotsman Don Diego (Reed Hadley) arrives in the city. Diego aka Zorro takes over the legion with the help of his friends Ramon (William Corson) and Juan (Budd Buster). The symbolic heroine of the piece is Ramon's sister, Volita (Sheila D'Arcy). Both Diego and Ramon have a place on the local council. It soon becomes clear that some of the other members of the Council are in league with Don-del-Oro. First there is the prime minister (Leander de Cordova), the head of the militia Manuel (John Merton), the head of justice Pablo (C. Montague Shaw) and Gonzolez (Edmund Cobb). Zorro suspects that one of these men is Don-del-Oro, but which one? <br /> <br /> What follows are several hair leaks from Zorro and his confederates of the followers of Don-del-Oro. We have the ever-present rope bridge that collapses, the deep chasm between two cliffs above which only Zorro can jump to safety, and the usual assortment of explosions, fires, carts and carts that break or climb over the cliff. Hats off here to the beautiful team of Republic stuntmen led by the legendary Yakima Canutt and the Yrigoyen, Bill and Joe. Canutt performs his typical stunt by jumping on a team of runaway horses and then falling under the coach he repeated in other films including John Ford's "Stagecoach" in the same year. <br /> <br /> However, Zorro finally unmasks the false god Don-del-Oro and restores peace in the valley before riding into the sunset in Chapter 12. <br /> <br /> There are also in the cast Jim Pierce, Curley Dresden and Charlie King as Don-del-Oro, so men and if you look closely you can spot the pieces of the future serial star and Lone Ranger Clayton Moore and the stuntman Canutt in bits. "Big" Jim Pierce by the way, could be better remembered for playing Tarzan in 1927 "Tarzan and the Golden Liom" (1927) and for his marriage to Joan Burroughs, the daughter of Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> Completely enjoyable.
