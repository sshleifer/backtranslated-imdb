I was able to see him at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my boyfriend. We were both very impressed by the complexity of the plot and found that he moved emotionally. He was very well directed with strong images. The visual effects were surprising, especially for a short time. He had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic: this film is about a girl who is visited by an offer of demons to help her situation with her violent father. There is also a surprise shot at the end that caught me off guard. This is based on the Gothic touch. I'd like to see it as a complete film. - Carrie
