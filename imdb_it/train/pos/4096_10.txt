Maybe it's me and my perverse ways, or the fact that I tend to have a very sick mind, but I rented this movie randomly a very strange night and to my surprise, I liked it. <br /> <br /> Yes, I read the synopsis on the back of the DVD box and read that it had been banned for 25 years and I figured I was ready for everything it would offer. I was clearly deceived after seeing ... well ... everything in short. I can understand why it was banned, not only for sex scenes so explicit, but for bestiality. <br /> <br /> Of course, since it is based freely on the classic tale of Beauty and the Beast, one of my favorite favorites, it tells the story of a girl's sexual awakening in the dream of a duchess chased by any beast- the-hell-that-thing-like-like with a huge erection and a significant amount of ejaculation. Of course, the beast gets what he wants and the duchess decides she likes and continues to play in the woods. <br /> <br /> But that's not all. Oh, there's so much more! <br /> <br /> Not only do we see interspecial sex, but there are also wet horses, the baby-sitter who lowers and gets dirty with the slave when she doesn't turn the bed to take it ... er .. satisfaction and the girl daydreaming is masturbating with rose petals. <br /> <br /> Creative and fun, but it took some time before my father spoke to me again after I looked at him after going to bed ... I was 15 years old. A tip when watching this movie: make sure you're the only one who knows you have it and watch it with the curtains closed. It may be fun, but I doubt there are other porn movies like this.
