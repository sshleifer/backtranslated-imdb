Wow. Something of a surprise. Although imperfect, it is much better than I expected. <br /> <br /> The brand new Arcturus ocean liner with around 3,000 passengers is in the last days of his sixteen-day journey on Jupiter. Without warning, the Cerebral (central computer) of the ship issues an emergency alarm and orders everyone to evacuate. <br /> <br /> Soon, there are only a handful of people including one of the ship's astrogators (Penny), the captain (Cary) and the shipping line director (Kenyon). <br /> <br /> It turns out that the alarm was false and that the principal Cerebral is acting incorrectly <br /> <br />. The remaining passengers and crew must escape the ship and <br /> <br /> avoid personal conflicts to survive. <br /> <br /> The film starts very well. The opening spot is a very nice touch. There are obvious parallels with 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Historic Titanic Sinking. The film slows down sometimes and has pacing problems <br /> <br />, but is generally well done and well acted.
