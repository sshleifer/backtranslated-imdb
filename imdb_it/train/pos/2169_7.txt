OK, first of all, ignore the review of the last person. They admit to falling asleep through it so it's no wonder they didn't understand what was happening !!! As a thriller / horror, this film is not bad, it is certainly very watchable. From the first scenes you have a general idea about what will be the cause of all the madness that follows, and in the end you have shown that everything has been clarified. <br /> <br /> I liked movies, sometimes it was rather eerie and, like old movies, it was passable. Great to watch late at night! I give him a generous 7 out of 10.
