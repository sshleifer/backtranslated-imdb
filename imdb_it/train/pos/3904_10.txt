In my opinion, this is the best stand-up show I've ever seen. I became an instant Eddie fan after seeing Dress to Kill, but I have to say that I think this is his best job. I would say, though, if you ever have the chance to go see it live. It's worth it! <br /> <br /> Most of the time after seeing a routine of getting up a couple of times, the lines start to age. But I have to say, I've seen this show so many times that I literally memorized the whole thing (which, yes, I realize it's rather sad) but every joke still makes me laugh. This is really a pleasant sight. <br /> <br /> Dress to Kill will never grow old for me. I own it and look at it anytime I need a good laugh.
