House of Games is a wonderful multi-level movie. It's a subtle mystery and a shocking thriller. He is blessed by the wonderful performances of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna and by a strong and strong cast of supportive players, and introduces Ricky Jay, extraordinary cardinal, magician and historian of magic. His dialogue, written by David Mamet, is spoken as in a game of manners and gives the film (in which reality is often in question) an extra dimension of unreality. <br /> <br /> At first glance, House of Games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and scammers, diametrically different from The Sting, which has been played only for glamor and yuk. At this level he is admirably successful. <br /> <br /> However, you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of a woman's odyssey from the complacent professional skills to incredible strength and self-fulfillment. The only film I know that deals with the issue of the emergence of personal strength in a woman so worthy is the underestimated private Benjamin. Unfortunately this very pleasant film spreads its attention, jumping between different themes and taking advantage of the beautiful performance of Goldie Hawn to chase some easy laughs. House of Games keeps to its business. As Poe once said of a good story, he leads inexorably to its conclusion. <br /> <br /> There is another set of film-on-women, embodied by Thelma and Louise, a great commercial money maker with a contemptible budget that women are doomed, whether or not they make their own inner forces. What a tripe. <br /> <br /> As usual you should see this movie in a cinema. It should be natural for film festivals. Name it for someone near you if you can. <br /> <br /> I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23 year old daughter. Better that he should see it on a TV that for nothing.
