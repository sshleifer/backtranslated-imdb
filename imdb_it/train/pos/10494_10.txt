Excellent vision of a mature woman, who is about to lose everything (even the pruner has a mortgage). The way in which she is involved in this special "business", the innocence and the true love that exists among the people of a small city, mixes perfectly to give us as a result a fresh, light and fun comedy. I couldn't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a pharmacy. <br /> <br /> I love European films, and with films like this, my opinion grows stronger. A film that I recommend even with my eyes closed, in this same genre, is Waking Ned Devine. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace, a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as I did. You will love it.
