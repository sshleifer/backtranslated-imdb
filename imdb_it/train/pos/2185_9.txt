Poor Basil Rathbone, a selfish composer who lost his muse. He's been pretending for some time, buying his lyrics and his music from various sources. The problem is that two of the sources (music by Bing Crosby) and (words of Mary Martin) meet and fall in love. And then they find out what they are doing. There are complications, but in the end everything has been solved. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin sing terrifyingly. Mary had signed a Paramount contract and at the same time doubled as a regular at Crosby's Kraft Music Hall Show. For reasons I don't understand, the cinema audience didn't take them, so she returned to Broadway and made One Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed there. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone in one of the few times when he acted in comedy does it very well. His ego is constantly deflated by comrade Oscar Levant and again I'm surprised they haven't made more films together. <br /> <br /> As in most Crosby Paramount vehicles, there are no big production numbers, but I agree the previous reviewer on the title track was made as an impromptu jam session in a bench pawns. Good job everyone. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly original plot and great entertainment.
