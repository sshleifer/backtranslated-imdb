"Twelve monkeys" has all the elements to become Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. An exceptional script, a sustained rhythm, intelligent dialogues, sometimes ironic. Besides, he had a good nose on the cast. "Twelve monkeys" is also the first film in which Bruce Willis stands out from the type of character he played in his previous films. Here, an exhausted and hopeless character you could nickname a prisoner took the place of a fearless and invincible hero (as in the case of "Die hard"). No matter how you try, it's a prisoner of time. The film also contains a very electrifying ending. It has real dramatic power. But this fantastic film is also a reflection on man, the dangers he fears (especially those that could cause the end of the world and here, these are viruses that can create diseases). No matter how long it takes, "twelve monkeys" will be valued at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the 1990s.
