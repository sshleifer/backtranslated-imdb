I was educated on Doc Savage and I was petrified by the green death as a child, but even then I found it very funny. I have made countless friends and colleagues to watch this film and I was very amused by the diversity of the reactions, given that most of the time they think I am strange but you are there. "I don't know what Doc is, but it always gets girls" must be the definitive line when you look at its sad group of men. This film is a classic parody of the whole superhero genre, and it was long before it was time, not to be taken seriously, to move to Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a God. It is a pity that this film was not released on DVD in the UK. I don't think it should be rebuilt and bastardized, as I said it's a classic, it can't be done without Ron (like Italian work without Mini and Michael Caine). I give it 10/10.
