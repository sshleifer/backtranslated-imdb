The film begins with a group of dead men peeping out in individual cells, waiting for their inevitable encounter with death represented by the electric chair. <br /> <br /> So our "hero", who is called Tenshu, is brought to the chair, he is zapped, and then ... he is still "alive". AHA! He is given a choice by some kind of creepy military that seem really fantastic: or we dig you up until we make sure you're dead or you can walk through this door and take whatever fate may be in front of you. "Our hero says yes to option 2, and then the real story begins. <br /> <br /> He wakes up in a different kind of cell (very high-tech and very large), where he finds another fellow Cell, who has also managed to survive the electric boogie-ride, a voice in the speakers tells them that they are free to do whatever they want, as long as it happens in that room. what else can? <br /> <br /> What these two men do not know is that they have been put together, so that they can awaken the inner impulse to kill inside them, basically unknown scientists in the background make them out until they decide they should kill each other. Does it look strange? In fact, but there is a greater purpose to all this. This is the part that should not be revealed, and therefore it will remain unrevealed. <br /> <br /> But fear not, it is the unknown that attracts the viewer to look more of this pseudo-action movie, before I have a completely different approach, the question: how long can you bear to be with a man who is a SOB and kill him for freedom? <br /> <br /> The first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest, it creeps in without you really knowing it. Then it becomes a rollercoaster ride with WILD Matrix action scenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic from which the film is based. <br /> <br /> The film is really very special, so special that normal cinemas won't see it under normal circumstances. However, the story is fascinating, the music is fantastic and the actors do their part (some more than others) to make the film truly unique. <br /> <br /> If you were to be so lucky that your movie or video store has it, look at it and enjoy the fact that not everyone tries to make mainstream films to earn huge amounts of money. <br /> <br />
