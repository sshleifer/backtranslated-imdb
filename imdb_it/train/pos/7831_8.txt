Fritz Lang's medieval German saga continues in Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (1924). Kriemhild (Margarete Schoen) wants to avenge his murdered husband, Siegfried. His brother is too weak to carry the murder, Hagen, to justice. Kriemhild marries Etzel, the Hun King (Rudolf Klein-Rogge). He gives birth to a child and invites his brothers to a party. Etzel and the other Huns should kill Hagen, but he is protected by his brothers. We see a huge battle of life and death begins, and she sets the whole place on fire. Finally Hagen is dead, and so is Kriemhild. These films deal with big themes, such as revenge and imperishable love. Of course, we saw some of the best films made of these topics later, but this was one of the first.
