I love this movie! The animation is fantastic (for a Pok√©mon movie), the cgi looks so great. I love music in the film. So large have they kept Japanese music. <br /> <br /> As for the story: it's great. He has a great feeling of friendship. Celebi is a very cute and powerful pokemon. Ash is really great in this movie, and I like his friendship with Sam. The only thing I didn't like was the appearance of Suicune, he suddenly appears, helps Ash and Co a little and leaves. They could have played their part in the slightly bigger movie. <br /> <br /> But overall, a fantastic movie! I look forward to owning the US version on DVD!
