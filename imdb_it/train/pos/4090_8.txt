This movie is simply amazing! I was expecting something very different from the movie I saw. However, she is very perceptive in showing the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its link with animal behavior. Allow me to warn those among the readers of this article who are easily offended by overly sexual content, since the explicit sexual nature of this film seems like a kind of high-level pornography. It also presents a scene that is very close to rape. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I highly recommend seeing this rare work of "sexual art". By the way, every minute of the photo breathes the sexual spirit of the seventies. We must not forget how times have changed! <br /> <br /> Go see it! It's worth spending money and time!
