"Holly" is a film focused on problems, but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental. In his heart is a film based on the characters, which would not be so successful without the portraits of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the soul lost with consciousness gradually waking up, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), the young Vietnamese girl strong will but in the end too matched. From locations and lively photographs to effective editing, everything is clear and well done. The contemporary classical score may initially take a little back seat, but it is a first-rate composition and emphasizes the admirable restriction that is evident everywhere. This film, which raises many problems but provides few clear answers, eventually manages to raise awareness and arouse compassion for Holly and the many who share her situation. Congratulations to those who managed to make it.
