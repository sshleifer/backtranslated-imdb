This is the kind of image that John Lassiter would do today, were it not for the progress of CGI. And this is just to say that he too would have been forgotten, if technology hadn't made things sexy and engaging since 1983. _Twice ..._ has the same wit, imagination and sense of real excitement that you might find in a stroke Pixar, executed only with the restrictions of the medium c. 1983. Innovative animation techniques are combined with an exceptional script and excellent vocal reproduction to produce a film that appeals on many levels. It should be said in the same breath with _Spiritited Away_ and _Toy Story_.
