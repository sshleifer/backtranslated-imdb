I recommend this movie to everyone. Not just for Luciano Ligabue rocker fans, but for all movie fans. Because he is sincere, moving, funny and true. Because Ligabue is a born narrator and a lover of cinema, and every plot of his film is made with love and care. Because his characters are loved and ask to be loved. Because most Italian debut films are bad and this, made by a stranger, is a real joy to watch and listen to. Because Stefano Accorsi is wonderful and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza, who was, like Freccia, handsome, talented and good and lost his life because of heroin, which Ligabue shows as he is, without charm and ugly, without indulging in easy moralizing . Because it is a film that speaks to our heart, to our ears, to our souls. And because I lived the FM radio experience and it was exactly like that. Thanks, Luciano!
