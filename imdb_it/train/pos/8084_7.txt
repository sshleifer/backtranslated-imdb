<br /> <br /> I just bought this movie on DVD and saw it for the first time the other night. I've been a fan of Tolkien's work for about 4 years, since I finished high school. I didn't grow up in this movie ... maybe my mother kept me away from this movie. It is definitely not for children. Not that it's bad in a graphical sense, but that the themes are good for most 10-year-old heads. Overall, the entertainment was excellent considering it was made in 1978/1979. I thought that the story followed the book quite well in a broad sense. But I am annoyed by the fact that Bashki did not just add another 40 minutes or so and turn to the parts of the Return of the King. I was annoyed by his abrupt end, and then when I felt the return of the King sucked, they bothered me even more. Too bad it wasn't a great animated film. He may have picked up a higher grade on my part. I give him a 7. I can only hope that Peter Jackson does justice to the books with the new live action LOTR.
