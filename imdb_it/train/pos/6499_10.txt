After all these years, I consider this series the best example of documentary production of World War II. Interviews with numerous participants from all countries set it apart from any other project. It would be nice to see a contemporary documentarist (Ken Burns?) Tackle this topic and try to gather information from veterans before they are all gone. With modern technology to improve old archive footage and a lot of information that has been unearthed since 1974 when The World At War was produced, an updated version of this series would be welcome. The History Channel has made some beautiful shows that cover many aspects of the Second World War, but an expansive series like World At War has not been successfully attempted by the original. If you are interested in this you should not miss this series. Display is required.
