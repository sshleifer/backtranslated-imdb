There are enough sad stories about women and their oppression by religious, political and social media. Not to diminish the films and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights, as well as wage inequality and social exclusion, all in the name of Allah or God or some other ridiculous justification, but sometimes it is useful to take another approach and throw some light on the subject. <br /> <br /> The setting is the 2006 game between Iran and Bahrain to qualify for the World Cup. The passions are high and many women try to dress up as men to enter the game. <br /> <br /> The women who were captured (played by Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shayesteh Irani, Ayda Sadeqi, Golnaz Farmani and Mahnaz Zabihi) and detained on charges provided a funny and enlightening look at the habits of this country and, most likely, of all Muslim countries. Their interaction with the Iranian soldiers who were guarding and transporting them, both the towns and the villagers, and the father who sought his daughter provided us with some hilarious moments as we thought about why they had such unwritten rules. <br /> <br /> It is mainly a paternalistic society that feels that it must save its women from the rough behavior of its men. Rather than educating the male population, they deny privileges and rights to women. Seeing the changes in responsible soldiers and the reflection of Iranian society, it is no surprise that this film does not play in any way I ran. But Jafar Panahi has a winner in his hands for those who can see it.
