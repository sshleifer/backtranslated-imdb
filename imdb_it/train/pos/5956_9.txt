Yes, this is a very low budget movie. So acting is not a winning material and sometimes the action is slow because the directors shoot longer sequences and not a million instants which are then modified in a film. This film compensates for the one with an exceptional script that takes vampirism seriously, explains it and develops a complete plot. Apart from the history of vampires, we get detailed genetic information, legal and law enforcement actions, martial arts actions, philosophical reflections and good metal music. My compliments go to Dylan O'Leary, the main director / screenwriter / actor. It is beyond me how this man could fulfill all these roles and do them so well. I think you appreciate this movie, you have to be expert in all kinds of themes to see that the writer has done a lot of research and knows all these things. There are also some great video cameras, interesting camera angles and a vampire attack underwater - something I've never seen before, but that pays tribute to the attack of underwater zombies in Fulci's Zombie. The casting is good, as the sexy female is really sexy. Even the main vampire looks perfect for the role. The woman victim seems vulnerable. My only complaint is that for a low budget horror movie, there should have been more nudity. If you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story, this movie is for you. I look forward to seeing Mr. O'Leary's future projects.
