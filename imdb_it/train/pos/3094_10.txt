This is the best and most original show seen over the years. The more I look at it, the more I fall in love with it. The cast is excellent, the writing is fantastic. Personally, I like every character. However, there is a favorite character for everyone because there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds just like in real life. I believe that the ABC has done a bad service to the writers, the actors and the potential audience of this show, to cancel so quickly and not to publicize it enough, or to give it a real possibility to get a sequel. There are so few shows that I watch more since most of the TV is horrible. In my opinion this show was right there with my favorite Grays Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact I think the same audience for brothers and sisters would love this show if they knew it too. Because the losing shows always get so much more time and the winning shows with great potential are always downloaded immediately. I'm so fed up with reality shows that I don't watch any of them. It was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then hire excellent actors, this show has many promises. The recent episode was the best ever, as everyone started to really get into their parts and make the show so real. Please watch this show on the ABC video and let the ABC know you want to have this show. PLEASE SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
