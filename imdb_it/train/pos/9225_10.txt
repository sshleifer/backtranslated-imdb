The beauty of Bo Derek and the revolutionary direction of John Derek make this film useful. <br /> <br /> Bo, who looks prettier than ever, is a recently widowed woman who is living with her "dead" husband (Anthony Quinn). He has a plan. Bo must procure the body of a young man so that his ghost of a husband can transform his transformation from spectrum to bodily life. Can you find a suitable candidate? How will he do it so Tony can do his thing? <br /> <br /> With the attributes of Bo, the unique director of John, the film presence of Quinn and, thanks to John, a very cute and exotic aspect of the whole film, this film is a pleasant sight.
