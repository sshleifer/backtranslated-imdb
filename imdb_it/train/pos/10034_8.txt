I had few problems with this film, and I heard a lot of criticism in saying that it is too long and overrated. True, it's more than three hours long, but I was stunned by the fact that you pass so quickly. I don't think it's overrated, I think IMDb's ranking is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with wonderful costumes and excellent effects, and James Cameron's direction rarely escapes fire. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is as adorable as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he finds himself in. The story is very rich in details, and it's hot on the character development, obvious with the love story that is very moving when it has to be, even if it's a bit slow in the first movie. The last hour is extremely compelling, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes have been very moving. James Horner's soundtrack was adorable, although I was never a big fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5 / 10. Bethany Cox.
