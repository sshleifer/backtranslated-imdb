I thought it was a great movie. It would have been nice to have seen a little more in the film about the two sisters, knowing that they liked the same boy before he was killed. I am sure that if the film had been made this way there would have been a very different ending, which is why this made this move such a beautiful film. Show that it doesn't matter what happens in your life with your brothers that you can always find it and that if they are two sisters who care for a boy (the same boy) who work through pain and pain, they make things look better and easier to train between the 2 of them. It's nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing in someone's life that you can still make it come even closer after its end. I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I still do it now when it arrives. I seem to be looking at it every time it arrives. It would have been nice if there had been a part 2 for this movie, maybe having the older sister to come and have her baby, this would have really made a great ending to the story since he died, so he would keep him alive even though is dead.
