This film is very beautiful! Acting is fine, with Corbin Bernsen's excellent casting as the perfectionist dentist who goes mad and tortures his patients. At first he sees his wife with the poolman and then goes mad. He also takes revenge on his wife and the poolman, in addition to the patients he tortures. Even the most special effects are beautiful, although some are really fake (like a perforated tongue, which was put on an outdoor night, and is still red in the morning). But the torture scenes are absolutely well done. Although this film has the weak point, it is very slow; between heavy parts are sometimes only extremely boring parts. But for the real horror / thriller-fan this is a must-watch!
