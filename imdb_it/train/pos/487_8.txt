A film of extraordinary brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story, the Luzhin Defense traces the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and character. <br /> <br /> Give John Turturro what is probably his most beautiful role to date (thank God they didn't give it to Ralph Fiennes, who would have killed him). Similarly, Emily Watson shows the richness of her experience (from her excellent background on the stage). To reach the tortured chess master (Turturro) his character must show intelligence and love for the woman. Watson does not portray the sexuality of the beauty contest, but brings to his part an seductive self-awareness. <br /> <br /> In a chance meeting between Natalia (Watson) and Luzhin, she casually prevents him from losing a chess piece that fell through a hole in his clothes - a specially made piece that we realize more ahead in the film, it has come to symbolize its hopes and aspirations. Later, as their love affair develops, she subtly sympathizes with chess dancing (Luzhin has learned to dance but never with a companion); she encourages him to drive it with "bold and brilliant moves" and by doing so allows him to relax sufficiently to then play at his best (and even realize himself as his lover). <br /> <br /> This is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and, in doing so, finds his deepest fulfillment, emotionally and intellectually (or so we are led to believe - certainly, by the times, Natalia is something of a liberated woman rather than someone who is preparing to become a stereotypical wife and mother. <br /> <br /> The Italian sets are fantastic, the complexity of the characters and the skill with which the Dialogue opens them up is a delight for the intelligent cinema viewer, yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream success, and more deservedly Chess is just the photogenic background to the development of an emotional and emotional film, although the game is treated with sufficient respect to convince almost a chess player that the characters existed, despite a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classical author, the final epilogue is however surprising highly uplifting.
