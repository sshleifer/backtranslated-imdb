This is really a big hit with Hal Roach. This is due to two main reasons: the smallest children in the short are among the nicest in the film and the plot has so many fun and well written elements. <br /> <br /> As for the smallest of the Little Rascals, I honestly can't think of a prettier kid than Spanky at the age of four. Although he was a rather chubby and unattractive boy in recent years, he was simply precious here. And, by placing the tiny kid in charge of baby-sitting for even smaller children, it wasn't just fun, but again it was the cute factor. <br /> <br /> After the older children blackmail Spanky into doing this horrible job as a babysitter, all sorts of fun chaos breaks out. The gags are quite effective and well made for the time - with an involuntary phone call involving a murder and a final scene in which Spanky FINALLY gains control of the smallest ones that are the most memorable. I haven't seen these shorts in many decades and I'm glad I gave this a chance.
