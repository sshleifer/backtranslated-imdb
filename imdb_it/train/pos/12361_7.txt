Bellocchio refers to this as a mainly political film, a description of the revolutionary movement in Italy, but it seems more like a metaphor for reality. Well, almost everything in the film seems like a metaphor. The revolutionaries, of whom we see and of which we learn very little, could also be mafiosi. Out with the old and the new. <br /> <br /> Andrea's Papa, a psychoanalyst, seems to represent the usual traditional values ​​of the bourgeoisie - morally honest, unperturbed, clean and orderly, carefully ritualized. > <br /> Giullia, the girlfriend of a revolutionary, seems to represent what can happen to someone who is in great need of support, but is not able to gather the kind of devotion that such a commitment requires. (I'm guessing here.) Andrea, the teenage boy, seems to be the only guy in the movie who isn't somehow upset "upatz". He is respectful of his father but also disobedient. She adores Giullia, or so we assume, even if she is not old enough to have learned to manage her reflexes optimally, but he leaves her to go to school and complete the final exams. His course among these contradictory lifestyles could be described as "media". He is the man in the middle, who knows the meaning of gradualism, who can keep calm while his are screaming. <br /> <br /> Most of this is summarized during the oral part of his finals when asked to translate and comment on an extract from "Antigone", which contrasts the traditional authority of the gods with the notion of secularity and free will. <br /> <br /> This brings us - in no particular course that I am aware of - to Marushka Detmars. I am reminded of a New York cartoon a few years ago. Two hippos have their necks deep in the river, they stare at a gazelle that drinks from the shore and one hippopotamus says to the other: "I hate her". She is a good actress. (Let me touch it.) But so are everyone else in the film. He brings with him, in his words and his ways, the rich gleam of true madness. And everything also comes from the actress, not from the assistant director. Detmars is not crazy as Catherine DeNeuve was crazy in "Repulsion". The walls do not turn into rubber and the hands grow. Instead, we see it animated - sometimes TOO animated. And it gives us shock when his mood suddenly changes and becomes threatening in the way a looming storm is threatening. <br /> <br /> A critic described it as sultry, but probably not the word he was looking for. She is irresistibly beautiful with her soft brown hair, her wide white smile ready, her impulsive giggles. And his eyes are like the eyes in the paintings on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs. The sexy parts are rather erotic, not so much because one of them is explicit, but because we have learned to know the characters involved. (It is more interesting to spy on the honeymoon couple next door than to go to a leather movie.) Actually there isn't much sex. There is only one scene of simulated relationships, but the director lets him play in what appears to be real time. At least in real time for a boy of eighteen. <br /> <br /> Even the young man who plays Andrea is fine, which is a necessary thing, because the film depends almost entirely on him and Giullia. They have to wear it and they do it. If it weren't for their performances, I'm not sure this would be a movie as interesting or as admirable as it is. It could easily have been turned into a rather slow and boring love story. <br /> <br /> It's worth it.
