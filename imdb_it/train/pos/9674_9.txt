I didn't give this movie a perfect score to be honest in comparison to great classics like "Citizen Kane" and "Seven Samaurai". However, this film is so wonderful, it's a real shame to have achieved such mediocre scores for the IMDb voter. However, the voter of IMDb relies on genius, and "Paulie" does not qualify for it. <br /> <br /> The only acting criticism I could suggest is that Hallie Kate Eisenberg did not portray the perfect stuttering child. I'm sorry, but I ask a 6-year-old to get out of Dustin Hoffman while the Rainman is asking for the impossible in making a movie. <br /> <br /> Overcoming that little complaint, the film has the best of many movies: buddy road-trip, con-games, hero as a friendly animal party (bird party?), Disney-like humor for young and old, etc. What's wrong? Tony Shaloub wears his role as a comfortable pair of jeans. It is normal for him, apparently. ("I'm Russian ... I like long stories.) I don't like mangos, but it almost makes me want to go out and buy one. Watch the movie and that will make sense. <br /> <br /> Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin make very appropriate appearances in the film, roles that fit perfectly with what we all know, I have always found Jay Mohr a bit slippery and even his role on the screen fits well The only surprise for me was discovering that Jay was also the voice of Paulie. In the end, that also works well, puts Parrot and anti-Parrot together as a team and creates a spell of its own. <br /> <br /> If you're trying to find a a film for you and for children that is neither offensive nor boring, "Paulie" is a perfect candidate, but I will admit that a happy moment colors my "Paulie" review, he was traveling during a big heat wave, the The car's air conditioning is dead, half of the restaurants were cooled (like our hotel) and I said, "we watch a movie where there is air conditioning itioning. "So we did. So for 100 minutes we were refreshed, had fun and we had a great experience. When I saw him recently on a VCR in less emotional circumstances, I realized how good this movie was. <Br / > <br /> It is a sleeping film that you will not regret watching.
