As someone who has never been keen on sports, it seems like it would be difficult for me to get into football (or as we Americans call inexplicably, football) - he said "Bend It Like Beckham". But I have to say that this was a good movie! The Anglo-Indian Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and his friend WASP Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) love playing football (yes, I will say it in English and internationally) and I love footballer David Beckham. But Jesminder's traditional Sikh parents don't approve (his mother offers a description of football at the beginning of the film). Ok, maybe it was a bit of a clich√© in that sense, but you have to love this movie! And if like me, you go to this film without knowing the definition of "curve" in football ... don't worry, the film explains it (I had never heard of David Beckham before this film). And we all know that Keira Knightley has had a great success: a few months after "BILB" was released in the United States, she played in the "Pirates of the Caribbean: the curse of the black pearl" joy.
