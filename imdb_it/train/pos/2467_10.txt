Why didn't this pick up a bag full of Oscar? It is an extraordinary interpretation of a piece often filmed / performed. The images are breathtaking (especially on the big screen ... the pan & scan really kills the wonderful cinematography and the scenery of this film). Each frame is a painting. Astounding. The game is almost completely intact, and Branagh's passion for this is evident from the opening titles. No Zefferelli here, just a great narrative as only the film can, but rarely does it. Jacobi is particularly perfect as the homicidal uncle of Hamlet: he does not interpret it as a wicked, mustache, but a fascinating politician, who allows us to understand why only Hamlet suspects incorrect play. Branagh also fills the subtlety of the line between Hamlet's fake / true madness and the fiery revenge within him. And the many cameos come off pretty well, all from Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Depardeu and Charlton Heston, discreet if you get sucked into Branagh's vision like me. A fascinating piece.
