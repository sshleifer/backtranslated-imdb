The frustrated middle-aged district attorney George Maxwell (a beautiful display by George E. Carey, who also produced this photo) can no longer stand his bare and cold wife Edith (a wicked Anne Bellamy). Worse still, poor George is further joined by a newborn baby and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter (the dishonest brunette Sheri Jackson). George has an adulterous adolescence with the adorable and seductive hippy babysitter Candy Wilson (delightfully played with the sexy aplomb of the beautiful blonde knockout Patricia Wymer). The complications arise when George finds himself blackmailed by the bitter Julia Freeman (a poisonous turn of Kathy Williams), who wants George to burst his psychotic biker boyfriend Laurence Mackey (a scary Robert Tessier, who wears a full head of hair here ) from prison. Director Tom Laughlin (yes, the same guy who played Billy Jack!) And screenwriter James McLarty fill the splendid plot of a movie with a winning and very funny surplus of delicious female nudity, unrestrained soft-core sex and raw violence. Furthermore, they carefully put all the wild and uninhibited sensitivity of the youth culture of the 1960s and relate the plot to a close 75-minute duration, thus ensuring that this film does not remain its welcome. One of the highlights is the moment when Candy invites her groovy friends over the Maxwell home for an impromptu bash in the basement complete with pipe smoke, crying rock music and, of course, hot naked dancing chicks. Robert O. Ragland's funky score hits the knotty point. The stern black and white cinematography of Stanton Fox adds a gritty touch to the delirium of squalor. Above all, this film is a wonderful showcase for the completely charming and fresh-faced pixie, Patricia Wymer, who lights up the screen with her sweet and sparkling personality and her captivating beauty. A total trash treatment.
