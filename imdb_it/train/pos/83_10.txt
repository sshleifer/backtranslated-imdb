A few years ago I added a comment to the IMDB on the TV series "The Real McCoys". I said then and I repeat now it has been a fascinating show, fun and funny, well acted with wonderful characterizations. <br /> <br /> I recently saw four old PLUS the Reunion 2000 episodes on DVD with Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan and Tony Martinez. As another writer mentioned here, it is curious that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) have not been mentioned, but perhaps they can be traced by SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> The reunion the show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show. Part of the internal information we didn't receive was whether Kathy Nolan regretted leaving the show in an unpleasant contractual dispute, which left Luke a "widow" in the last year, which was not very good. Nolan went on to make a bombshell of a play called "Broadside", on women nurses in the Pacific in World War II. Take it? Side? No, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Unlike the squalid, salacious and violent TRASH on TV now that it is undermining our values, "The Real McCoys" is entertained with decent values ​​and excellent human beings. And I thank all the people involved, including the creator, Irving Pinkus, for bringing him to my family. We never got lost.
