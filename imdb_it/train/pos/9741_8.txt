I was pleasantly surprised to see that How to Lose Friends and Alienate People was nowhere near as crude as the trailer had led me to expect. I quickly became absorbed in the unfolding of the narrative and was absorbed everywhere. The rhythm of the funniest visual content was, I thought, perfect. (I mean, I had the impression of witnessing Pegg's attempts to restore much lost "real time" control, so to speak.) At other times there was time to share the main protagonists' thoughts (ie Pegg's and Dunst) on how events were influencing them and what had brought them to where they were now. All the characters were well expressed, to some extent interesting in and of themselves, and generally quite nice. (Any apparent ruthless ambition shown tended to be mitigated by a correspondingly good resistance). A funny film, written in an intelligent way, brilliantly directed and superbly performed that I would highly recommend.
