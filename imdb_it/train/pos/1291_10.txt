This is a good movie. Something fun to see that money is booming, especially from a child's point of view. Take it for what it is, a little funny film about a child's dream come true, and what a child with $ 1 million dollars could do. I don't like it, don't look at it. They make films for observers, not people who have nothing better to do than complain about their lives.
