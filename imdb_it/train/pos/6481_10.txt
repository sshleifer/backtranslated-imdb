I saw this series when I was a kid and I loved the detail that ended it and I never forgot it. In the end I bought the DVD collection and just as I remembered it. This is just how a doco, impartial and factual should be. The footage is incredible and the interviews are fantastic. The only other series I have found equal to this is 'Die Deutschen Panzer'. <br /> <br /> I just want Hollywood to sit down and watch this series, so they could make great war movies. > <br /> Note. Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, Letters from Iwo Jima, Flags of Our Fathers and When Trumpets Fade are some that I would recommend
