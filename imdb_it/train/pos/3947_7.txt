Based on a true story of how a man ahead of his time - the great nineteenth-century American poet and humanist Walt Whitman - made a significant contribution to how Western medicine treats people with psychological problems. <br /> <br /> Interested in treating people with psychological problems, he began to associate with psychiatric workers and patients. After seeing the psychological methods of the time (inhuman and cruel ignorant methods), Walt rejected those methods and treated patients with compassion and dignity, encouraging other people to do the same. the inhabitants of psychiatry are full of drama, good humor and wisdom. :)
