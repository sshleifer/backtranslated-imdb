Hak hap (black mask) is what I'd like to call a ballet with fists and explosions. Of course, the plot was tried and listened to before (a biologically engineered soldier who is part of an elite superhuman force who decides to feel that killing and brute force are not the ways to solve everything and become a pacifist, and a librarian, but when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote that will keep them alive by hiring the police - his best friend is a cop - he becomes the black mask.) the style the film wants, a lot visual, it works and at least it's fun for me. I love martial arts movies that are spectacular. People who fly lighter than air and recover a fraction of a second after the impact, keep the pace and action unabated. But this is exactly what this film is right, a showcase of Jet Li that does what it does best, and this is a spectacular show of its abilities, which to say the least are top notch. As with most martial arts movies of fast wing action. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, who for the first time show up here in the United States, these films have a low storyline and are able to accomplish extraordinary feats. But I have to say, even with the big holes left in the plot (like when we see him safely in his apartment when only one scene before had 20 men who are not more than 15 feet from him with the sign of escape? The scene comes only to him cut in the apartment ....... ohh well I suspect I believe), the film remains interesting for me. Only in the last 20 minutes does it seem that the film has had the feeling of being a little shorter. But all around a high-paced action movie.
