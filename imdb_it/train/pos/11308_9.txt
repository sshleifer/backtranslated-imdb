TCM keeps me up all the time ... they continue to invent films I have never heard of ... Meaning ... now Obsession ... a very first Visconti film !! ... wow ... the Italian version of The Postman always sounds twice ... brilliant !! beautifully recited and directed ... Never heard of either of them being excellent, Clara Calamai, like Giovanna, and above all, Massimo Girotti like Gino ... what a sensual man !! more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943 !!! His look was ahead of his time ... many male stars of the 50s were probably inspired by him ... he should have been a big world star !! Is the film much better than the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange version and less polished than the MGM version (which I really like) with John Garfield and Lana Turner remembering that white dress? who can forget .... This Italian version is different ... more realistic and with a very different ending ... look at it ... I'll buy it !!
