I remember this series so well. It was excellent - characters so strong and engaging, elegant and sexy ... and so different from everything else on offer at the time - and now ... I'm sure it also inspired the excellent Canadian drama "Traders". <br /> <br /> Both season 1 and season 2 are available on DVD region 2 in the UK. It is a joy to see the series again. <br /> <br /> Season 1 is 13 episodes and season 2 appears to be 10 episodes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems to be over after 2 seasons. <br /> <br /> This series was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can buy it on Amazon.co.uk
