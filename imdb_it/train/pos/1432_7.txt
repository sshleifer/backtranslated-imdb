I couldn't wait to see this film because it was advertised as a must-have for people who love nature films. The film shows different climates and the animals associated with them, starting at the North Pole and descending towards the south while the film progresses. The film of this film is often a stunning beauty and many times I wondered why they could have taken some of the shots underwater or in the sky. However beautiful, much of the video I had already seen in the TV series 'Planet Earth', narrated by David Attenborough. I have found that the narration of the planet Earth of Attenborough is much better than the narration of the Earth. 'Earth' is an easier film. Skip most of the scientific details that Attenborough covers in its 'Planet Earth' series. For example, the Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale, because there are few predators. Planet Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery, because water is low in oxygen and does not contain enough nutrients to support very large animals, such as large sharks, etc. For me, this is an important difference. This, along with the far superior voice of Attanborough, makes Planet Earth a far better documentary than Earth. However, I think the Earth is worth watching for the good movie and the fact that it is easier to understand makes it interesting for children too.
