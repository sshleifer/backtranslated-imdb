Many of the classic films of the late 1960s have not maintained their ability to disturb and confront the public. "In Cold Blood" has not lost an ounce of his power. It is exceptionally well done, but it forces the viewer to think. Some have complained not only of the film, but of Truman Capote's "non-fiction novel" source, according to which the central message is indistinct. It may be true, but this is certainly a case where the lack of ambiguity does not detract from the film. It's refreshing, especially considering today's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas, to see a movie with a convinced political voice that isn't afraid to force the audience to consider its point of view. To be honest, I'm not sure I agree with the central message of the film, but I still admire its audacity. <br /> <br /> Even if you don't agree with the anti-capital message, there is a lot to admire the film. The acting of the two protagonists is fantastic. Scott Wilson (still one of the most underrated actors of all time) is chilling as the nihilistic leader, one who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Even Robert Blake is chilling as the most submissive of the two and the one with the conscience. His character obviously has a voice of reason, but he is terrified of going against Wilson (there is a good amount of homoerotic subtext from his character). Cinematography is fantastic, elegant but gritty and really gives the impression that the viewer is watching a documentary. Add another classic score from Quincey Jones and you have a masterpiece. (9/10)
