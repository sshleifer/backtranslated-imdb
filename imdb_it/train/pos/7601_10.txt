Lost is one of a kind ... it's so fascinating and full of suspense, thrill and excitement at the same time. I've never seen TV series like this before. He is full of chills in the jungle and has a good script. The actors have emulated life on an island so naturally that I feel lost on the island as I watch it. It is an excellent work narrated in a very intelligent form. The series is like a film that describes the life of the survivors lost on a desert island. I'm tempted to watch one episode after another and I highly recommend this series for all TV show lovers. Watch it to see the magic of being lost in the void.
