I'm a big Simon Pegg fan and I've seen many of his films so far and none of them stopped making me laugh. Nor did How to lose friends and Alienate People. <br /> <br /> This film is essentially about a man who is good at pissing people off. However, he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that could only make him famous. But in the end it ends up making them, the culture of life. <br /> <br /> The film is well tinted with humor, romance, good acting and even a bit of lap dance. It's one of those movies where you might be happy when it ends.
