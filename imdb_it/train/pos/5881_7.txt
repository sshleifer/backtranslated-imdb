This film was a fantastic comedy. There were many comedians like Akshay Kumar, Rajpal Yadav, Paresh Raval and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> Rimi Sen was good at playing the wife of Akshay Kumars and so were all the hostesses. Hot as Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Mr cool like Sam (John Abraham) are two fashion photographers who like the same girl Maggie (Neha Dupia).
