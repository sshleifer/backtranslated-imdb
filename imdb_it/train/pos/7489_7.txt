This film has many strengths. He has one of the best horror casts outside the Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney circle: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye, plus the lead character Melvyn Douglas. It has all the right ingredients: bats, a castle with many stone staircases, a mad scientist, citizens waving torches and hunting vampires, an "Igor" character, a beautiful girl, even an awkward haired Burgomeister. The work with the soft-focus camera is moody and imaginative. There is also some well-spaced comic relief in the script. <br /> <br /> But it's not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural about "Kleinschloss" ("little castle"). The plot revolves around the generic mad scientist (played by Atwill) who appreciates his work more than human lives. <br /> <br /> It is not a high level material, due to a resolution of the plot and the plot an embarrassing dialogue for Dwight Frye. But it's worth a look if you like the first black and white horror images.
