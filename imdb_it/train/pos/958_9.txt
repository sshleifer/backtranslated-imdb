Wow! Lately I've seen so many low budget movies, but that's great. The very realistic portrait of police life in a city on the East German coast is a stark contrast to other films or criminal series. I loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevailing police clich√©s. This film is as realistic as a documentation and as fun as a drama at the same time. A perfect compromise!
