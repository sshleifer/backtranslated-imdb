I went to this movie thinking it would be a bad movie. I came out surprised and very amused. Eva was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. He had surprising comic timing. The jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two bars in between. The plot was enough to tie everything together, a woman (Eva) dies on the day of her marriage and returns to haunt the woman who is going out with her future husband, her incredible sounds but actually works quite well. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Overall it's a cinema clock worth seeing, if you don't get it on DVD when it comes out.
