Claire Denis has repeatedly shown that the film does not need to tell a story, that it is enough to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make them what they want. <br /> <br /> Ostensibly the idea in the context of a non-linear film, the oldest man living on the French-Swiss border, a man devoted to his dogs, who still has a lover, but whose status cardiac threatens his life more and more. He has a son with a small family who meets him infrequently, but when he discovers he needs a heart transplant he chooses to go to Tahiti for Japan to get a heart transplant on the black market and rekindle a long lost relationship with a child he had formed a Tahitian woman years ago. <br /> <br /> What Denis does with this scheme of a story is to use his camera to explore the solitude of the soul, the vastness of nature, the interaction of man with people vs animals, etc. . Very often the "film" doesn't make sense, but it's because we try too hard to connect all the points presented in front of us into beautiful images. Life is a bit like this: we look, we see, we observe, we integrate, we process and we make it what we want. <br /> <br /> In using this form of filmmaking (just as he did in the strangely beautiful 'Beau Travail') Claire Denis developed a signature technique. Whether the viewer finds the reward of the finished product has much to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information. This is an interesting and visually appealing movie, but many viewers will find a speech too long on very little. Maybe watching it again will change it. Grady Harp
