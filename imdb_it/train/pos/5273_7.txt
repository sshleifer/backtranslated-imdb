This was directed by Ruggero Deodato, a true icon for many horror fans after directing the famous and famous Cannibal Holocaust. However, don't expect to find such a reputation in the film reviewed here as it proves incredibly docile in comparison and sounds more like a Conan-inspired trip for a young audience. <br /> <br /> Such a description could immediately put off most fans of the entire Conan inspired by the Sword & Sorcery genre but before turning up on this, it must be said, this movie is so funny! <br /> <br /> It is played mainly for laughs and presents two HUGE and very nice heroes in the form of David and Peter Paul aka. the Barbarian brothers who seem to have a ball with their characters. <br /> <br /> B-Movie's favorite Richard Lynch presents himself as the main villain in the piece and it's also nice to see the roles of Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, women are incredible to look at and adequately dressed in a gaunt fashion throughout the film (a basic ingredient and much appreciated in the genre!) <br /> <br /> I can say, this is simply a fun and carefree grip like that and I highly recommend it!
