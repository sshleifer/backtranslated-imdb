An excellent example of "cowboy noir", as it has been defined, in which the unemployed Michael (Nicolas Cage) loses a job because he insists on being honest (he has an ass). With nothing else he can do, he decides that for once he will lie. When he enters a bar, and the owner Wayne (the late, great JT Walsh) mistakes him for a hitman that Wayne hired in his sexy young wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle in excellent shape), Michael plays together and accepts the money of Waynes. * Then * goes to Suzanne and informs her of her husbands' intentions, and accepts * her * money to get rid of Wayne! If that's not complicated enough, the real killer, "Lyle of Dallas" (Dennis Hopper, in a perfect role for him) shows up and Michael is even more in trouble than before. <br /> <br /> "Red Rock West" gets a lot from the locations. Director John Dahl, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Rick, was clever in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small city that could have seen better days and where residents could be involved in any way of schemes. It is also a fun idea of ​​the kind of problems an honest person could enter if they decide to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation. It's a remarkably dark and compelling story with an assortment of main characters who, if they're not corrupt, have been at least as morally compromised as Michael. The lighting of the cinematographer Marc Reshovsky is superb in his mood; even the climax set in a cemetery gives good morbidity to the whole affair. Even if the script is not particularly "logical or credible", the film has a good way of intriguing the viewer and simply drawing it right inside. <br /> <br /> Cage does a good job in the head, but his co-stars have a great past sinking their teeth into their meaty and greedy characters. Hopper, Boyle and Walsh are fun to watch around here. Timothy Carhart and Dan Shor are doing well as Walshs' deputies (in a particularly interesting twist, Walsh is also the local sheriff), and there is a fun cameo role for country & western star Dwight Yoakam, who plays the film also with good tune credits. <br /> <br /> It's quite a good film to try. It moves forward at an impressive rate, and if nothing else is certainly never boring. <br /> <br /> 8/10
