I've seen hundreds of silent films. Some will always be classics (like Nosferatu, Metropolis, The General and Wings) but among these, my favorite is this film (it may not be the best, but a favorite, yes). In fact, when I consulted on IMDb, I noticed that I immediately started laughing alone because the film was so damn cute and well done. Marion Davies showed with this film that he was really very talented and was not ONLY William Randolph Hearst's lover. <br /> <br /> The story involves a Georgia hick who comes to Hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star! His experiences and interesting cameos of the stars of the time make it a real pleasure for movie lovers and not to be missed!
