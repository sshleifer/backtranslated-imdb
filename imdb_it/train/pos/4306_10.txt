The mere fact that I still think of the film a decade later is what really talks about the film. For me this validates the Grand Canyon as a film that will touch you one way or another. I truly believe that before the movie Crash there was the Grand Canyon. The main difference between the two films in my opinion is the timing of their release. I am not going to discuss which one is the best, but I will contend that they share the same message. I'd like to hear someone who has an opinion on this. I will start a comment that you can find on http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You could also find me there to post other topics about the movies we could share, because I have a real love for cinema.
