I didn't have much expectations in the film, but I thought it was great. Pierce Brosnan is exceptional in a very different role. He downloaded the right Armani clothes for a ridiculous look and pays proving to be an excellent actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear challenge each other, and become for one of the best pairings of friends in a long time. The humor is dark, the performances of Brosnan, Kinnear and Hope Davis are fantastic, mix this with a touching element in the history of friendship, and you have a great film. This is probably one of the best friends comedians for a long time. This is a film that clearly shows that we can expect great things in the post-Bond era of Brosnan's career.
