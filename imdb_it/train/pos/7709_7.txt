I know this film should like me, and I do it for the most part, but as others have mentioned, it's a little long in the tooth. I also found the furious hormones of the crew of all males to be a bit annoying. It is surprising that they did not start panting and howling at the moons. I must also say that, on the whole, the film leaves me cold. It is a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film. The positive side is that the effects are fantastic (in addition to the cartoon monster), as are the effects, props, costumes and of course Robbie. If the robot wasn't in this movie, I don't think it would be as popular as it was / is. The second part of the film catches fire when we begin to investigate the forgotten "Krell" gadgets. How many times have I seen this movie, the Krell still lets me scratch my head to see who or what they were. Based on what was being produced at that time, in addition to "This Island Earth", Forbidden Planet is miles above the average science fiction films of the time. Being filmed in color also adds to its enjoyment. Certainly a classic in its own right, flaws and everything, and deservedly.
