For a long time it seemed that all the good Canadian actors had headed south of the border and (I guess) all the second-rank ones filled the best positions and left the feces for sexual comedies. <br /> <br /> This film was a real surprise: despite the extravagant plots typical of farces, the actors seemed to try to put something in their characters and what we, the spectator, got was almost a real one. own suspension of belief. When the music video extras attacked the evicted police, you almost believed it was possible. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of some of the best sex farces (Canadian or not) you should definitely try this up. And the big surprise, this sexual farce is also loaded with some very good nudity.
