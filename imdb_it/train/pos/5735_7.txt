This is a short series animated by David Lynch (as they say at the beginning), and follows the misadventures of a backwoods, who wears a big man, with a wife who has a stress disorder and an annoying son. Both of these elements are repeatedly repeated in the short episodes and there is no real plot to see. It's easier if you think of this as an exceptionally strange, slightly macabre Looney Tunes, with much more gore, profanity, bloody violence and occasional moments of hilarity. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD along with Eraserhead, having previously seen Eraserhead. Don't look at this series if you want an artistic masterpiece, that's all but. In fact, it seems almost an assertion against these things, since its raw style spits in front of any kind of animation convention that can be seen. As Lynch says, "If this is fun, it's fun just because we see the absurdity of it all."
