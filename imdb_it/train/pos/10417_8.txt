"The Thief of Baghdad" is impressive in the form of the evil wizard Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). Plan lies and spells to get the kingdom from its rightful ruler, young King Ahmad, and a beautiful princess from his father ... <br /> <br /> He eventually falls victim, as do all tyrants (in books and legends) to the love and the common man he ignored, here embodied by the little thief (Sabu). <br /> <br /> The armies of good and evil, black and white, are superbly crafted in both visual and literary terms ... <br /> <br /> The script is poetic, simple and very beautiful .. The costumes of the magician and his men rise and fall like the wings of black birds, suddenly attacking in the night to inflict destruction and create terror ... <br /> <br /> The radiant hero wears white turbans and dress, and her princess is dressed in pink and pale blue ... <br /> <br /> For spectacular scenes she combined everything that had happened before, while through her use of color, she brought to life a world as it had not seemed possible before ... <br /> <br /> With flying carpet and flying white horse, with a giant genius (excellently interpreted by Rex Ingram), with evil wizards and Sabu's good acting and Veidt, "The Baghdad Thief" captures the quality and true atmosphere of the Thousand and One Nights ... <br /> <br /> The version of the 1940 remains the most beautiful fairy tale on the screen!
