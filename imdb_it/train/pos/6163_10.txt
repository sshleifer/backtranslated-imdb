This is one of the few films in which I consider filmmaking to be an improvement on the original book. The story is clear, accessible, fun and interesting and the musical numbers are undoubtedly exceptional. I loved the cyclical version of "The Old House Guard" and the charming "Portobello Road", a great combination of early animations + real-world techniques that, although dated, do not detract from the charm of the piece. The background of World War II worked well and was not omitted when the film started, something that often happens in "evacuated" stories. <br /> <br /> A film that is often too undervalued, does not produce fun for people of all ages. The performances of the actors are exceptionally well done and the whole text is well linked and well designed. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face!
