Yes, Giorgio, it's a good film. A bit of romance, great music, a beautiful setting, comedy (a great struggle for food) and a little taste of sweet and sour are the ingredients of Yes, Giorgio. Every movie lover would like this movie. Those who require huge special effects should look elsewhere. Most of us need a little getaway from time to time, and how much better to do this than with a feast for the eyes, ears and heart? A must see!
