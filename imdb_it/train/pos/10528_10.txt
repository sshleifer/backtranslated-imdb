I was so impressed by the film version of Doug McGrath of the Jane Austen novel "Emma", and I loved the soundtrack of Rachel Portman so much, that when I went to the video store one day and discovered that the two had joined for "Nicholas Nickleby" I immediately rented it without any consideration. <br /> <br /> I read the book, and for fans too critical of this adaptation of Jane Austen, I don't know what else McGrath could have done to capture more perfectly the spirit and main elements of the plot of the work of Miss Austen, especially considering the limitations of a two-hour movie (which some have complained about being too long!). And as for Gwen Paltrow's accent, I must confess that I wasn't very familiar with her when I first saw her at the theater, and at the time I was absolutely convinced she was an English actress! <br /> <br /> I am taken aback by those who have criticized the film for its lush scenery. This is one of the things I like and I look forward to seeing vintage pieces set in the English countryside. The film's beautiful backgrounds contribute decisively to its charm and success. If your idea of ​​escaping is something darker, then maybe you should rent something like "Death Wish III!" <br /> <br /> The settings of the English country are as attractive and fascinating as the cast, and combine with the history and soundtrack for entertainment that you never tire of repeating the views. McGrath is a marvel in choreographing the interaction of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that presents itself in this story. <br /> <br /> This refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how much fun a movie can be less sex, violence or even an evil antagonist. The story is often fun, engaging, and sometimes quite touching. <br /> <br /> I have seen many adaptations of the competent Jane Austen book, but this is without a doubt my favorite.
