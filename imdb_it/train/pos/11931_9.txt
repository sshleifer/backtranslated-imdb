This was a first-rate film with a first-rate cast. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and in particular Christopher Lloyed are well founded in this fascinating film about the angels of real life who help the Angels baseball team. You never know, it could happen. I loved the role of Lloyd in this. It was fun. The story is about turning your life around, as the child's belief in Angels helped turn angry, hardened and embittered Glover manager to see the best of people. The film was well made and also to see the best of people and reach your dreams. It was fun, fascinating, moving and sad, all very well done. You will like it (or you will love it). I guarantee. <br /> <br /> *** up ****
