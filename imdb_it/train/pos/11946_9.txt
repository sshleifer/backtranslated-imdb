*** 1/2 Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane, Romola Garia. Directed by Woody Allen. Immediately after his work with Johansson in "Match Point" the two return for "Scoop", a crazy and funny Corky comic ride. When a student journalist (Johansson) discovers a new scoop from a deceased reporter (McShane) when he enters the materializer of a lame wizard (Allen). The scoop is the new Tarot Card killer in London that could be preppy Peter Lyman (Jackman); while Sondra and Sid play the role of detective, Sondra falls in love with the beauty that would be a murderer. Allen has finally reached a point, not as good as "Match Point" but definitely more fun. I laughed a lot more than I expected, one of the years must see
