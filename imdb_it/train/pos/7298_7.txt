It is a mad scientist who creates a half shark - half man criticized on an unexplored island, then calls all his old workmates and academics to come and see his creation (evil laughter) but actually wants his shark kill them! A lot of bad GCIs, crazy plot elements and sweating girls in tight shirts follow. <br /> <br /> These monster movies all follow a similar formula, but this puts things together with a bit of humor (I guarantee the people who did this had the languages ​​firmly planted on the cheek), not to talk about sexy girls. But let's talk about those sexy girls - several sexy girls, in tight-fitting shirts that sweat profusely. One is in his underwear at the beginning, another at the end. Thank you, thank you, creators of bad movies! The plot is full of silly things, a boy gets into a jeep, slams it against a tree, then offers to fly everyone off the island by helicopter. Yes, um, well, how do we think about it for a while? we will reply. The sharkman is hilarious - or a terrible CGI or an equally comic boy in a rubber suit. The mad scientist performs well; he is bad, this is his motivation, he does not apologize. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you want a stupid, fun B movie, this should do the job.
