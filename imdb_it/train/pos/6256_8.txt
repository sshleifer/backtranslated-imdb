I could anticipate myself here, but even if the film itself was a technical masterpiece for its time, I saw it piece by piece on the TCM last night, the question came to me: why did they do it? putting their lives at risk, many of them died during the journey, because they would have taken such a life-threatening journey, only to find food for their animals (!) once they reached the "land of milk and honey" why don't you stay there? Would you endanger your life, and that of your entire community, just to find food for a cattle farm? As dangerous as it is, to do it alone for this purpose, shows the innate simplicity of these types of people. Risk death for a cow ?? Better them than me!
