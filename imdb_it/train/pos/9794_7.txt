I thought the film could be a little more complex, perhaps in a psychological sense, but the action and the vocal acting were first rate. The animation was heavy CG in many scenes, but very good. This is one of the Batman Returns / Forever movies, which includes Wayne's novels and conflicts and the reasons for dating. The 007 fans would love it, and so would the females, a great musical theme! Wayne has been very well portrayed in this film, and Penquin has returned to his true form, with no mutant genes in him this time! I liked the fact that Robin wasn't used too much, Tim Drake was just a good computer nerd, a bit of an indigo child or a mind of the future. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast consisted of a few star soap operas, decent talents and characters designed to resemble the voice actors as well. Kelly Ripa was hilarious in this film. <br /> <br /> I consider this under Phantasm, Return of the Joker and Batman vs. Dracula, but I liked the smarter script than I liked Subzero. 7/10
