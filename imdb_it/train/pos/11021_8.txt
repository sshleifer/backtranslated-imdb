After the success of Die Hard and its sequels, it is no surprise that in the 1990s, an excess of "Die Hard on a ....." film is set against the wrong guy, wrong place, wrong time concept. This is what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on a mountain just in time to save Sly 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot' Stallone's career. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger is a great dream for the fussy, especially for those experienced in mountaineering, base jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. All in all it is full of excuses to reject the film as a pile of garbage. Stallone even managed to get out - acted as a horse! However, if you forget all the absurdities, it is actually a very amiable and undeniably fun fun that gives you a lot of chills and, unintentionally, a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> You must love John Lithgows by snickering wickedness, his ticking every group of baddies, and above all, the permanently tormented and unlucky turncoat agent, Rex Linn as Travers. <br /> <br /> It could be from Henry in "Portrait of a Serial Killer" "but Michael Rooker is noteworthy for a well-deserved performance as Hal, insists on constantly screaming in painful disbelief at his captors" that man not never hurts anyone "And while it certainly can't be, Frank really looks like Ralph Waite the character is grinning as she falls to his death. <br /> <br /> Even the mention must go to the actor" London's Burning "Craig Fairbrass in the role of the ugly British boy, who comes from a chiseller while using Hal as a human kick, Yes, you can't help but enjoy that bit, Hal needed a nice kick. <br /> <br /> So forget your best judgment, who cares if 'that could never happen', lower acting expectations, turn up the volume and have fun! And if you're looking for Qaulen, he's the one wearing the helicopter.
