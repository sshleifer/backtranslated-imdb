James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan interpret the colleagues from a souvenir shop in Budapest who do not appreciate each other, not knowing that they are really nice pen pals who have yet to meet. <br /> <br /> A very charming romantic comedy, interpreted in a very engaging way by the two nice stars and a supportive cast very eager to please. The story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence (I don't know how to explain it) that today's films don't have. This can obviously be compared to the recent You've Got Mail, and the original victories in every way. <br /> <br /> This vision is mandatory every Christmas, I can't think of a better way to start a Christmas feel than this little gem.
