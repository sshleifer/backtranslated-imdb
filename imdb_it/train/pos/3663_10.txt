Perhaps the last film you'd expect comes from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (who wrote the novel on which this film is based). It's a neorealist fantasy, a kind of oxymoron, really. An old woman discovers a baby in her cabbage hole and lifts it like her son. After a few years, the child is a boy (called Toto) and the adoptive mother is dying. He goes to an orphanage and, when he turns 18, leaves. Immediately, he finds out that he has no home. Tot√≤ is optimistic, and will not let anything make him fall. A man steals his suitcase, and instead of getting angry about it, Toto becomes his friend and goes and stays with him in a small slum. Toto takes a certain initiative and organizes the many homeless who live in the area and build a better slum. Soon, the landowner is trying to sell this plot of land, and the slum citizens have to protect themselves. After many attempts, the owner mounts a police force to get rid of the homeless. At this point, the film becomes a fantasy in every respect (before that it was more comedy / fantastic melodrama in the style of Charlie Chaplin). This stuff is so strange and shocking that it's probably better for others to see it for themselves. It's quite surprising and a lot of fun. There are objections that you could raise about the Miracle plot in Milan, surely. Fellini and Visconti were much criticized when they started to move away from Neorealism. I think I read that this was widely criticized at the time of its release. At this point, though, it's so funny - I loved it so much. It could be my favorite of Vittorio de Sica's films, even though Umberto D and The Bicycle Thieves arrive very, very close. 10/10.
