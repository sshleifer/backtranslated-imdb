Soapdish could be considered one of the most undervalued films ever made. <br /> <br /> A stellar and altruistic cast who understood exactly where the film and the roles they played were exactly. While everyone hammered it, there was not a single improvement. Kline showed wit and great physical comedy, Goldberg and Downey knew how to carry on a fun conversation while someone else was talking, I could just move on. <br /> <br /> Don't pass this movie by!
