If the scientists behaved in such a way that H.G. Wells was confident that they would do it in the future, the story would not have gone exactly as it was in Things To Come. Almost 80 years had passed since Wells wrote The Shape Of Things To Come on which this film is based and no closer to the world he described than before, somewhat more distant. <br /> <br /> Although well known actors like Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson and Cedric Hardwicke are in the cast, they are more caricatures than real characters. It is the main weakness of the film, it is dedicated to the philosophy of science of Wells, it will solve all the problems and the rest of us is a fool backwards. <br /> <br /> Massey's characters, two generations of the same family, have an extremely optimistic view. Cedric Hardwicke is a skeptic who feels that the man is running too far. And Ralph Richardson is a warlord born of the destruction of another Thirty Years War fought with modern weapons. About the fact that the atomic bomb was not invented, poison gas was considered a weapon that almost destroys humanity. <br /> <br /> According to Wells, science and conquest can never mix. Scientists as a group are too far above the political world to engage in these things. In Wells' life, scientists certainly fled from the right-wing fascist governments of Hitler and Mussolini. Those same people, however, to defeat them, subordinated themselves to the Allies and shaped the atomic weapons they inaugurated in the modern era. If they behaved as Wells would have liked, someone like Albert Einstein would lead a junta of scientists who would establish a new order after World War II. <br /> <br /> Wells was wrong both in time and in development. Apparently he never imagined the computer and atomic power. Computer programmers are much more likely to be our rulers in a new and courageous world than scientists at the moment. Still things to come, aided by the direction of William Cameron Menzies and the scenes created offer an interesting look into the mind of H.G. Wells, certainly a respected thinker of his time even though he didn't really understand the form of Things To Come.
