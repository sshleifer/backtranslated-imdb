Looking at this first DeMille work, I was once again reinforced by the fact that the first DeMille is far superior to the late DeMille. His attention to the use of light within the scenes is remarkable. His rhythm is very good, allowing much to tell in the space of an hour or so. It is a pity that it was not as intuitive about the style of his subsequent sound films as it seemed to be in his silent films. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie in which I had seen Cleo Ridgely. It was remarkable, quite contained and yet transmitted a wide spectrum of emotions. <br /> <br /> The ending is wonderful.
