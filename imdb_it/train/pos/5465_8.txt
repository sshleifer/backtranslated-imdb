This is a hard-boiled Warner Brothers film starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck. A consummate teacher in portraying fashionable Machiavellian, a technique perfected eleven years later in Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity", Stanwyck plays Lily Powers, the consummate daughter of a violent speakeasy owner in a suffocating steel city. She has been made cynical and insensitive for years to be offered as a sexual favor to her father's clients. Once his father dies in a distillery explosion, he jumps a freight train to New York and literally falls asleep on a bank's corporate ladder. <br /> <br /> This would seem absurd if it were not for Stanwyck's ardor to work here. With his cross-eyed eyes and amoral seduction methods, it's easy to see why men become addicted to his aggressive carnality. One of the young people who seduces along the way is a fresh-faced John Wayne like all things, an accountant named Jimmy McCoy. The melodrama gets heavy with the last third of the film with a murder-suicide, a silent job in Paris to keep Lily quiet and the new bank president who is so dependent on Lily that appropriates funds from the company to keep her in luxury . A sticky finish is somewhat disappointing, but not before Stanwyck fades the screen. The film has curious touches like the friendship between Lily and an African American woman named Chico and the German immigrant who teaches Lily about Nietzsche's philosophy on the importance of avoiding sentimentality.
