A well-projected summary of a real event! Well, actually, I wasn't there, but I think this is how it could have been. I think there are two typically American points of view evident in the film: "comunistofobia" and parallels with Adolf Hitler. These should be obvious to most independent observers. However, Boothe does a great performance, and so do many other famous actors. The last twenty minutes of the film are unbearable - and I'm serious! Anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal. (That's why it's so terrible - everything happened, and it probably looked like that). But really, did that last scene on the air station really take place?
