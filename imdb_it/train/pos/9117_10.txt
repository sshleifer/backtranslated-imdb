This film provides us with an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to get involved in the busy occupation of doing nothing. We, as a people of African descent, must ourselves make a change in this cycle of "all speeches and non-actions" and start realizing in order to make a change, there must be less talk and more action. It is a powerful affirmation of the divisions of our people on small problems, and our failure to recognize the broader picture and the need to unite to make a difference ... Despite the reference to the black community, all viewers can learn something from the message that this film tries to portray.
