Peter M. Cohen has a winning satire on the game of mating, turned and upside down. The critical hit of the film in mainstream media publications such as "offensive" and "vulgar" serves only to emphasize its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated dissection of people's passions and sexual activities. It is in the tradition of what I call satire based on reality, following in the footsteps of "In The Company of Men", "Chasing Amy", "Your Friends and Neighbors" and "Two Girls and a Guy". Cohen's dialogue is exhilarating and I was continually intrigued by the way he perfectly captured the actual rhythm of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber and Jonathan Abrahams are three distinguished, relentless sex-obsessed predators who, together with their recently married friend (played superbly by Judah Domke) are turned upside down on their terms by a female predator (Amanda Peet). Beneath the satirical surface is a more satisfying romantic comedy than most sugar-coated studio products.
