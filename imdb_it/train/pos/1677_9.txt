La Coda Dello Scorpione (a.k.a. Case of the Scorpion's Tail) was the follow-up of the director Sergio Martino for the wonderful yellow Strange defect of Mrs. Wardh. This is the quintessential yellow, with all the aspects that fans of the genre have learned to know and love. Twisted plot, beautiful girls, black gloves, sharp blades and a little blood come together to make a joke of Italian exploitation. <br /> <br /> A group of favorites in yellow, both in front of and behind the camera, works to make this one of the best non-Silver. There is the aforementioned Martino who adds his touches to the direction, the great mystery Ernesto Gastaldi as the writer, Bruno Nicolai who creates the music, and a host of yellow stars and stars, like George Hilton, the actor Luigi Pistilli, and the seductive Anita Strindberg. br /> <br /> With all this talent behind, does Scorpio offer? You bet. The film works on many different levels. It's an exciting mysterious murder, a tense and violent horror film and a suspenseful thriller. All in all one of the best yellows around. <br /> <br /> Martino certainly knows what fans want when it comes to thrillers. In some parts of the film, he almost seems to channel Argento in his approach. For example, there is a direct repechage of the scene in Bird With the Crystal Plumage in which the killer tries to break through the door, which far exceeds the Silver stroke. <br /> <br /> Are there any problems with the shot? Hmmm ... only the minor ones. First, all the scenes that do not follow the murders or the budding love story between the two leads begin to get boring. But just before falling asleep, the killer will jump out of nowhere and you'll immediately return to the dark of things. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, towards the end, the curves become a bit too bizarre. I mean, for what purpose did the pins really work? If you don't pay much attention to the dialogue, you could easily get lost with the braided and interwoven texture. <br /> <br /> But apart from these minor quibbles, La Coda Dello Scorpione is a tense, full of suspense, class and all around fun movies for yellow fans. Look for it!
