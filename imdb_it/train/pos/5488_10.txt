A case of being in the right place at the right time. What a fascinating film. It's easy to see why Chavez is so popular with his people. He does things. He is accessible. And it's also easy to see why the West hates him so much. He has control over his country's resources and returns profits to people. Especially the poor. And it's easy to see how TV stations can portray misleading images to put them into practice. Just like the war in Iraq or the war on terror. Or those missing WMD. Or what about the axis of evil. People need to wake up. And get different points of view. Stop the neo-cons that govern the world. Go watch this movie with an open mind. And think of yourself. Then I suggest you see Aaron Russo: America: freedom for fascism. The American people are not the problem. It's the government.
