A depressed and lonely French boy Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim) on vacation in the summer, meets and falls in love with Cedric (the magnificent Stephane Rideau). Quiet and slow this is a very frustrating film. On the one hand, I was absorbed and really felt for the two boys. On the other hand I was getting bored: the film continues to flash from the past to the present without a nursery rhyme or reason. He is very confused and useless. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> Also there are a lot of holes in the plot - Mathieu, at some point, does something that takes him to the hospital. What is it - we are never told! Then he breaks up with Cedric and tells everyone else that he lives with him. Why? We were not told Then he inexplicably connects with another at the end. Why? No explanation. It is clear that Cedric loves Mathieu and Mathieu lives in the same city so ... However, it is a tribute to the film that you are really interested in the characters. If only things were explained! <br /> <br /> Elkaim as Mathieu is not good. He is tall, handsome and has a beautiful body - but he cannot act. His idea of ​​acting is sitting around with an empty expression on his face - all the time. Rideau, on the other hand, is great. He is VERY handsome, he has a very nice body and he is a real actor. He also has incredible sexual magnetism on him. There is a full frontal male nudity, lots of kisses and a fairly explicit sex scene in the film that is great - most films avoid showing male-male love scenes. This doesn't work and helps to see how the characters care and feel about each other. <br /> <br /> So, a frustrating movie that is worth seeing - especially for Rideau's nude scenes - that is, if you like good-looking young men! <br /> <br />
