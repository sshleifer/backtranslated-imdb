# 3 in John Travolta's blockbuster trilogy. Dance in disco, rock 'n' roll and country. He heads to Houston to find work and love. Gilley is the hot spot, and it's time for the mechanical bull. Not to be outdone, I led the bull to a Nashville club. I recently saw this movie almost forgotten on television and remembered how beautiful and how beautiful 1980 was. I wore a black cowboy hat that year just like Travolta. Debra Winger was in her prime. She is gorgeous in her red shirt. There is a lot of charisma. Bud and Sissy look like the ideal couple even if they are trailer stuff. They are divided only because it is good to go back to living together. Urban Cowboy has an incredible soundtrack. Let's listen to Lyin 'Eyes from The Eagles and Lookin' For Love from Johnny Lee.
