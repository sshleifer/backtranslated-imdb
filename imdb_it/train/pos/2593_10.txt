It comes out of the left field and REALLY is not what you expect. But I love it. The most memorable cinematic experiences come from being surprised, if you ask me. If you have not been informed of the mysterious "thing" that makes these brothers so strange ... a surprise awaits you. <br /> <br /> The cast is fantastic, but does not extend so much that it is palpable The special effects come out of nowhere (seriously, it's like a strangely dark romantic comedy until they do - then WOW) and they are great. The general cinematography is easy on the eyes, the editing and the sound are of excellent quality and the distorted plot takes place without clich√©s. While none of these aspects individually makes it a hit, "what the hell?" the ALONE factor makes it a true cinematic treasure. <br /> <br /> People who criticize this film make no sense. It's one of those often overlooked films of the 90s you've never heard of, or that you love so much that you jump to the mention of the title. <br /> <br /> I'm in this last group.
