This is a great movie for all fans of Hong Kong action movies. Beyond its small plot, its weak drama and comedy antics, the film is full of combat action with guns and martial arts. It made me have fun from beginning to end. I thought Shannon Lee was great in the movie. <br /> <br /> Having an action director like Corey Yuen is what keeps the Hong Kong action going strong. This modern action movie is highly recommended !!
