A fascinating romantic comedy. The plot is a bit too complicated - I tried to synthesize it three times and I can't. Suffice it to say that it is worth seeing. The film is fun, beautiful - the plot is totally unrealistic but it works. Everyone in the movie is so beautiful and everything looks so beautiful - it creates a sweet and romantic feeling through the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is exceptional - Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd are in top form and have fun every second. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are fine, but they're fine. If you are a sucker of good, sweet sentimental films (like me), take this. Even Downey looks good in his underwear! <br /> <br /> Extra bonus - the title song sung by Johnny Mathis and another great song "After All" sung by Cher and Peter Cetera.
