I love this movie so much, I never get sick of watching it. The only sentence I can't stand is when Riff calls himself a teenage lobotomy, but other than that, everything else is perfect. I've never been a fan of PJ Soles and it didn't help to know that he didn't even know who the Ramones were until he shot this movie, but most of the time I can ignore his little dog face. Most of the people who watch this one and more times are Ramones fans and really .. that's the only reason I like it so much. I never tire of seeing DeeDee ruin her Pizza or Joey lines ruining the teacher's name over and over again, haha. One of the best parts of the film is to see them sing, you want to dance, in high school halls. I love it. The special edition DVD has a good retrospective, surprisingly PJ Soles is not on it. Maybe he was working on another project * laughs * Anyway, great movie, even better if you're a Ramones fan.
