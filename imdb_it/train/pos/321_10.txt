I don't know how or why this movie has a poor rating on IMDb. This film, accompanied by "I am Curious: Blue" is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The only thing that will disappoint you in this film is if you don't like the process of the film, don't do it like psychology or if you were expecting hardcore pornographic ramifications. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie you would like to see to relax; it's a movie you want to see like any other masterpiece, with time, attention and care. <br /> <br /> ****** SUMMARIES, YOU CAN INCLUDE A SPOILER OR TWO ******* <br /> <br /> The main thing about this movie is that it mixes the whole movie , inside a film, but it does so in a way that sometimes you forget that the fictions are not real. <br /> <br /> The film is like many films in one: <br /> <br /> 1. A political documentary on the social system in Sweden at the moment. Which in many ways are still relevant for today. Interviews made by a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2. A story about a director, Vilgot Sjoman, who is making a film ... it has to do with a relationship with his star in the film and how he should never have been involved with the people he was supposed to work with. <br /> <br /> 3. The film that Vilgot is making. This is a young woman named Lena (IE. # 2), who is young and very politically active, making a documentary (IE. # 1). It is also an age that goes for his sexuality and his freedom. <br /> <br /> The magnificence and brilliance of "I am Curious: Yellow / Blue" is how these three elements are cut together. In one moment you are watching an interview on politics, and the other one is looking at what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes, but he does it so well that he sometimes forgets that it is the narrative. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the dynamic between "Yellow" and "Blue", which if you see one, you have to see the other. "Blue" is not a sequel at all. I will try to explain it to the best because, as far as I know, no other film has done it even though it is a great technique. <br /> <br /> Think of "Yellow" as a living being, to real events in 14 scenes. A complete story. <br /> <br /> Think of "Blue" as all things IN the 14 scenes in "Yellow" that you have not seen, is a complete story on its own. <br /> <br /> Essentially they are parallel films ... the same story, told in two different ways. <br /> <br /> It wasn't until I saw the first 30 minutes of "Blue" that I fully understood "Yellow" <br /> <br /> I hope it was useful for people who were discouraged from various influences, because this film changed the way I watched the film. <br /> <br /> Thanks for your time.
