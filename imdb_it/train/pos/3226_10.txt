I don't remember that this movie brought a movie out here. I only saw him when he arrived on the cable. The film is about the dehumanization of children in killing machines. In particular, a person, the way he is replaced and downloaded (literally) in a community out of the world where he finds himself unable to adapt to come to terms with who he really is and what he feels. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that many people expected this to be Rambo in space, and would have been happy if it had been. <br /> <br /> I'm certainly glad it wasn't - Kurt does a great job of portraying an emotional cripple. The scene in which he finds himself out of the complex proves it, even if the decision for two slow-mo replays decreases from the moment. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic SF movie like Bladerunner, Alien, Silent running, Logan or THX1138 were, but unfortunately it is the closest I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It changes credibly in the film, it doesn't crack Arnie, it hasn't become Snake Plissken and there is no definitive happy ending. <br /> <br /> That's why this movie didn't work well. He did not follow the formula, and among an American audience of 18-25 years, that is unforgivable as he was was not what they expected to see. <br /> <br /> Fear and discipline. Always <br /> br>
