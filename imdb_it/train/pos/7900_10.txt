I admit, the first time I saw Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, I didn't think it was really memorable from every point of view. But now, after seeing him for the seventh time, I admit he has grown a lot on me. The characters of Sissy, Ms Jellybean and Countess have become very appealing. And the love story between Sissy and Jellybean looks very sweet. Although the plot is very weak, I think the satirical humor is more than compensated. Then there is the kick-ass soundtrack that characterizes the K.D. extraordinarily talented. Lang (who reminds me a little of Patsy Cline) at his best. I can't think of any movie that has "grown on me" after a bad first impression, at least as much as Cowgirls.
