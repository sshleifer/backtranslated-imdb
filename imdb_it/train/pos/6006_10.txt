When I saw him as a child, he answered all my questions and dispelled any fear or misconception I had. It is easy to look at because it is animated, which makes it non-threatening. It has no aspects of moral prejudice or "preaching", so no one should object to it. It is a pleasant film that simply gives the facts of menstruation in a reassuring, "concrete" way. I hope to show it to my daughter.
