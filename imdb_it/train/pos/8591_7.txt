This was a pretty decent movie. This movie is nice to sit and watch and have fun. Just a typical Hollywood movie. This film will never win an Oscar or anything and it certainly doesn't deserve it, but I thought it was pretty good. It's a bit like the show 24 but it's set in movie format. If you like the fact that we have to stop the terrorist from killing the president's kind of movie, then you'll like this movie. I personally think the plot was done too much, but The Sentinel adds an extra touch to the mole in the Secret Service. All in all, this film will not leave your jaw on the floor or change your life, but who says that every single movie has to be this way to be good?
