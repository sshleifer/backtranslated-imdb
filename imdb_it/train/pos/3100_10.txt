At the end of the first hour my jaw was comfortably nestled between my feet. The film never, and I never mean, lets it act. It could be a delicate action but it is action. Once again every cast member fits perfectly. The explosions were realistic, the hunting scenes were feasible and the fighting was incredible. Matt Damon will be Jason Bourne forever. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is that every Bourne film improves and is no exception. The action, the stakes, the plot. How they do it I'll never know. I congratulate the man who wrote the screen on each of these films. Because if he hadn't done a great job with the first movie, we wouldn't have had this to talk about. <br /> <br /> So don't go and see it in theaters, go live in theaters if it's still out where you live, but if it's not December 11th, Bourne comes home to you!
