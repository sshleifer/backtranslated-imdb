This is still the point of reference for judging all the Golden Age whodunnits and, taking into account the limited technology and dubious ethical standards of the authorities (on the screen), it is very good against all generations of similar attempts since then on film and TV. Fast and furious with a lot of wipes from Warner Bros, and luckily there is no time for a love interest that gallops, bringing with it the splendid cast to the violent end. I never understood why the district attorney had to drag Vance everywhere, I always thought they were tied to the desk. Palettes like detective but above all Girardot like the doctor are deliciously eccentric and not PC - when he looks at the second victim of a murder, he sniffs that there were too many people in the world anyway. Obviously William Powell plays Philo Vance (and Michael Curtiz as director) which makes the film what it is - when Powell ever made a mess? <br /> <br /> The army of policemen at the crime scene did not do a really good job of finding the second body and the unconscious dog made them! The best part is where Vance tells us the whole sequence of events surrounding the murders: series of obscene models are combined with fantastic roaming camera angles to produce a very modern and surprising touch with what happened before. The only problem is, as usual, the conclusion cannot correspond to the global deductive processes displayed in all and a somewhat forced ending is invoked; some of Chan, Moto and many others could of course also be concluded in this way. But because it happens so fast and it is ... a little doubtfully morally does not diminish my opinion on the status of KMC as a classic! <br /> <br /> All the footprints I've seen of KMC are (in the worst case) like looking in a goldfish bowl, so if you're interested in seeing it endure until you're sucked.
