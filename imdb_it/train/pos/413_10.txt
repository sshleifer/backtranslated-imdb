Of course, this film is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment. Most of DeMille's images, particularly the later epics, are slow and falling, but the action here moves to a clip. History is basically a series of peaks with very few moments of tranquility. The action takes us from an Indian raid on a cabin; one of the best parts of the film with excellent Jean Arthur as he tried to appease the native war paintings. This is followed by her and Cooper being taken to the battlefield and tortured. Later a prolonged battle with the Cheyenne arrives. Everything is ridiculous but fun and entertaining from beginning to end. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this age and here he shines.
