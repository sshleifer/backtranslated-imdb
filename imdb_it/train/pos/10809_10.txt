Russell, my favorite, is wonderful in this movie. But more than that, the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and pain. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected. The film makes the viewer understand that the tolerance of other humans provides the way to save humanity. Fabulous love story between Lachlin and Lil. I repeat their scenes over and over again. Anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people. All the characters are expressed and portrayed in an excellent way.
