Why doesn't Dynamo have pants ?! Where they went?? It has never been explained. That's why this film was so fantastic. Starsky also gave his children AIDS !!!! Great acting too. Richard Dawson deserved to win the award for best supporting actor! A I D S My favorite phrase in the film was "That hit spot" A I D S. This film was for "birds". I tried to give this film the "stinkeye", but it continued to play. What am I doing wrong ??? !!!! I thought "HATEBOAT" was funnnny lol;) I'd like this for a show. Because Dynamo didn't wear pants. I know his arm was skewered but ... What happens with those crazy futuristic networks. Why didn't that family feud Ray Combs take a net? He could have used one. AIDSSSSS
