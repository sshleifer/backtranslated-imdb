This is an absolutely fascinating film, one of my favorite romantic comedies. It's extremely fun and the cast is wonderful. Although Laurence Olivier is mostly associated with his Shakespearean work, he shows in this film that he is not at all limited to playing only in classical theater. He manages the passage from the cynical divorce lawyer, who tries to avoid the women and their treacherous ways, to the in love puppy that falls for Lady X played by Merle Oberon without effort. The dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere is lovely. Ralph Richardson was also a pleasure to see him. I highly recommend it.
