I think this film is absolutely beautiful. And I'm not just referring to the breathtaking scenery. These are two unhappy English housewives who decide to rent an Italian castle to take a break from their not so happy home lives. In the end four women totalize the place together, all with different personalities and different reasons to be there. In this magically beautiful place everyone finds the peace they desire and, interestingly, that peace comes from inner reflections and resolutions, much more than without. I also find it wonderful thanks to the relationships that develop with kindness and understanding. Acting is a joy to look at in itself. I particularly like the characters of Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
