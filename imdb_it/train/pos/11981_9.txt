"FULL HOUSE", in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure I've never seen all the episodes, but I still liked it. One of my favorite episodes is where Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin) get married. If you want to know how it made it so fun, you should have seen it yourself. It was a two-player game, so you should have seen both sides. Another of my favorite episodes is where Jesse, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen) find themselves locked in a service station on Michelle's birthday. You should also have seen it yourself if you want to know how and why it happened. I also have many others that I like. Everyone always gave a good performance, the design of the production was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, even though it can now be seen in syndication, I strongly advise you to take it in case it goes on air forever.
