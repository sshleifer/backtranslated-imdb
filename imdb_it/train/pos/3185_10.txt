captivating story ........ has voted ten against all averages for my age and sex ... not all that comedy (compared to a film almost wet) although quite funny. he's not a fan of musicals so it's probably a little too much for me, but they give you time to have a drink or a drink without losing anything important. maybe a fifties version of when harry met sally? Ahab not not really, but if it's in your top ten like mine, you'll like this movie. in reality it leaves you with only a warm feeling of confusion, reminding you what the love story could be and should be, something you shoot from. my summary describes it best in very few words ..... quite fascinating
