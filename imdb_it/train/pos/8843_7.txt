The humor implicit in the complete proverb of the title derives from the Sunday School saying that it would be better to advise preparing yourself before you died for the devil's examination, that is, so to hell with it no matter when you died. There is no percentage to try to beat the devil. The characters apparently did not pay attention to the Sunday School and find themselves forced to crisis management, avoiding crisis avoidance. But even an experienced CEO would have difficulty managing these crises. Throwing the dice is much more unpredictable than flipping a coin; when people are involved, the list of possible results becomes even longer than the long list of Sidney Lumet's unforgettable films. Until now, Hawke may not have been an unforgettable actor, but here perhaps he had an eye on billing among other Lumet All Stars like Steiger and Pacino.
