A pleasant surprise! I expected a further downgrade along the line: The Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for a film so overwhelmed. Perhaps this is why so few have approved this new type of Bruckheimer food. Smart dialogues instead of catchy jokes, decent background / motivation instead of shake-n-bake stereotypes and when the chase has arrived, you really thirst for it. Fanboys waiting for an Armageddon rollercoaster: stay away. This is one for the smartest action fans. It didn't even bother me that Jolie looked so small.
