Everyone should see this movie because each of us is broken in some way and can help us realize 1) My life is not as bad as I thought and 2) How important it is to adopt a child in need. There are so many out there. Thinking that the film was based on a real person made us think deeply about life and how the world is and always will be. Corrupt, but that corruption must not reach your home. We all have a choice! I highly recommend this ... and while you're at it, I'd like to include "The Color Purple" and "Woman, Thou Art Loosed" by TD Jakes. <br /> <br /> These are all films that are based on life and give us a glimpse of life.
