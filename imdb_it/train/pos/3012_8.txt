This is one of those movies you would never have seen before, so you could see it again "for the first time". Van Dine's books still bring pleasure - but they are called excessively flourished by many. This film is by far the best film adaptation of his works. William Powell is William Powell - say no more. The plot is complicated. The story moves too fast, because you want it to last. To enjoy.
