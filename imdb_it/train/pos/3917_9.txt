I saw this film for the first time when it was released in the United States in 1984. I've seen it many, many times since. What strikes me about the film is the incorporation of the art of proof into the lives of the characters and vice versa. Throughout the film the two are intertwined and sometimes you are never too sure if you look at the lives of the characters or a scene from a test. This continues until the climax of the film. All these years later my friends and I still love to discuss if "Carmen" is really stabbed at the end. From the reactions of the other characters, to the stylized murder, it is open to debate. The passion of dance, the quality of acting, the love of art and the splendor of performances come together to create a superb film that, once again, blends and distorts the line between life and art.
