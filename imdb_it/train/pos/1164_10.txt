I saw this movie when it came out. It was an official selection for the Temecula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for the best photo. <br /> <br /> Justine Priestley is as sexy as the psychotic, but complex Amanda. This is not your normal psycho film. Lots of interesting and original slants on the genre. A sort of "fatal attraction" for the younger set with some great blues music mixed in because the object of Amanda's affection is married to an emerging blues singer who has less time for her husband while his career takes off. <br /> <br />
