In some ways, this film manages to be invigorating, bittersweet and moving at the same time. Stars like Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) bring history to life. The story itself is inspiring. We see a desperate life, from top to bottom through the most innocent eyes imaginable: a bird. <br /> <br /> Paulie begins his life as a parrot given to a little girl (played by Hallie Eisenberg, also known as the Pepsi girl) with an impediment of pronunciation. As he learns to speak correctly, Paulie does too. However, unlike most birds, it can talk and understand everything that is said. The military father does not love the bird, so he is sent to a pawnshop and bought by an artist in old age, Ivy. She teaches him good manners, etc., While traversing the country to find Paulie's owner. The film continues with several twists, until Paulie ends up in a laboratory where he is hidden in a basement and found by a Russian caretaker, who is touched by the bird's story. the plot is in line with the simple and metaphorical theme that language is a gift and a curse. I would like to say that the soundtrack is stunning. A beautiful mixture of flute, digital base and horns enhance the film to the point of pure ecstasy. The wide camera angles and the breathtaking scenery make the story even more beautiful. And, as a final remark, the puppet is absolutely credible. (Unlike Star Wars, where Yoda resembles a Muppet) This film is one of my favorite films, with the added observation that my wonderful four-year-old parakeet died recently. Overall, I give this film **** on four stars, two thumbs up and a big hug.
