This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen-- it has it all ... a really moving script, excellent actors that make subtlety a beautiful art to look at, a really elegant love story (it's a shame that that kind of romance both alone no longer seems to exist), beautiful songs and lyrics (especially the final song), an artistic score, and costumes and sets that make you want to live in them. The ending was just a disappointment as I expected a spectacular film to have a brilliant ending - but it was even more wonderful than most movies out there. Surely check this movie over and over again. There are many details that you miss the first time you deserve a second look.
