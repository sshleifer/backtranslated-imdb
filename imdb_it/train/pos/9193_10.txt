He is very faithful to the original manga of the same name, alias (Tramps Like Us in the U.S), but can still be appreciated even if you haven't read the manga. It's a different kind of tail, showing a strong and independent woman who hurts like everyone else. However, due to her outward strength, she fears to show her inner feelings and then let those around her hurt her with their candid comments. The only one who can really understand her and who can be at ease is her new pet ... human ... Momo. If you want something different from the normal boring stuff with some wonderful actors J-Dorama (Japanese Drama), then this is definitely the series to look at ... and read!
