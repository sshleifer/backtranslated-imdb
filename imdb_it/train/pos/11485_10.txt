Zero Day leads you to think, even to rethink why two boys / young men would do what they did - commit mutual suicide through the slaughter of their classmates. It captures what must be beyond a bizarre way of being for two humans who have decided to withdraw from the common civilization to define their own / mutual world through coupled destruction. <br /> <br /> It is not a perfect film but given what time / money the director and actors had - it's a remarkable product. In terms of explanation of the motives and actions of the two young suicides / killers it is better than "Elephant" - in terms of a film that comes under our "rationalist" skin, it's a far better film than anything you're likely see <br /> <br /> Flawed but honest with terrible honesty.
