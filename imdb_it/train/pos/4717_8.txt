How can someone not love this movie? I think it's a hilarious parody of all the old gangster movies; if you've never seen them, look at this instead. Michael Keaton has a ball in this role like anything goes. A boy manipulates the English language every time he speaks and Griffin Dunn plays a clever D.A. But my favorite role must be Joe Piscopo. It has all the best lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale, Ray Walston are in this star-studded movie that gangster streetlights are much more fun than "Mafia" for the criminal underground.
