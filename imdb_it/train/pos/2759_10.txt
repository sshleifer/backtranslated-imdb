The number of times I have had tears in my eyes when I watch a movie are few. And there's only one time I've really cried and that's when I saw this movie. This film has some kliches but I don't really care. I also cry as I write this and it's been a while since I saw it. It is fully functional and all production values ​​are good, but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message. We all know it in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is LOVE in all its forms. It is only when we love that we are truly alive. I know how sentimental I feel and I promise that I'm not usually like that. I'm pretty cynical. This film has aroused in me stronger feelings of sadness and happiness than any other film and it will probably always be the first film I recommend to others to see.
