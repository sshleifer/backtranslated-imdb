Between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people are expected to die prematurely because of AIDS. The expected toll is higher in sub-Saharan Africa, where 55 million additional deaths can be expected. Beyond the sad statistics, there are personal stories we rarely hear about. Christophe Honor√© describes one of the most moving in Close to Leo, a film produced for French television as part of a series dedicated to the problems of young people. Although it is fictitious, it is a situation that is unfortunately too common - the effect of a diagnosis of HIV on a close-knit and close-knit family. <br /> <br /> When twenty-year-old Leo (Pierre Mignard) tells his parents and two teenage brothers, Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley) and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann) who has AIDS, the family is devastated. Concerned about his youth, they decide not to divulge the information of his younger brother, 12-year-old Marcel (Yannis Lespert), but he hears the conversation and begins to sulk and act erratically. When Leo goes to Paris for treatment, he brings Marcel with him but the boy faces Leo and asks to know the truth. Leo tells him he is sick and Marcel is sad but accepts. When he takes Marcel to meet some former gay friends, however, the tension between them is felt on the surface, paving the way for a compelling conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although I felt uncomfortable with scenes in bed involving physical contact between the brothers, I feel that the sincerity of Close to Leo and the brilliant interpretations of Lespert and Mignard are more than an advantage for the weight scale. Seeing the events revealed from the young boy's point of view gives the film an authenticity that reminded me of the Quebecois film Leolo and Truffaut's The 400 Blows. Unlike some American films that dance around the anxiety of AIDS, Close to Leo tells a harsh truth, but it does so in a tender and wonderfully real way.
