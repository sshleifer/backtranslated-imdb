Why should you watch this? There are certainly no reasons why you shouldn't watch it! Superbly and amused, directed by Albert and David Maysles, Gray Gardens was originally intended to be a East Hampton gentrification film, but it was revealed to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric life of the two Edith Bouvier Beales, the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Their life was certainly fun (Edith spent most of her day in bed singing operas, Edie performing pirouettes and majorette dances with their numerous cats, one was named Ted Z. Kennedy) The film is interesting because it's both funny how sad - Edith died shortly after the film was released (in February 1977) at the age of 82 after enjoying the fame she and Edie received after the film (she danced and sang in a nightclub Edie Beale Jr was born in 1925 and still lives in Miami Beach. This film is both compelling and fascinating.
