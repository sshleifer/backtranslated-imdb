Ok, like many other films of this genre, come out from a SNL scene. But Tim Meadows does a pretty fantastic job of creating a 3-minute one-dimensional character in a moderately valid comic movie character. Give up the jokes of a funny and constantly threatened shootout with a good frequency, Billy Dee Williams is present even though his Lando days are long overdue, and the whole scene is shot quite well. True, it's not great art, but if you went into Wayne's world in search of Gone With the Wind, you did something wrong. Pleasant for what it is .......
