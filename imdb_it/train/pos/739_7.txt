I've been a fan of Jodie Foster since we were both children, from his Disney years. I loved his tomboy antics in movies like Candleshoe. <br /> <br /> "Foxes" was a great departure from all this. <br /> <br /> Where other young female actors of that era have turned to sexual people childish disguised as comedy ("Little Darlings", someone?), Jodie went for a depressing and tragic story of teenagers dragged to their end from the powerful fascination of temptation and dependence. <br /> <br /> This was not Disney. This was not Porky's. This was not "Halloweed". This was a dark and powerful story of the destruction of young lives. Unfortunately this is a story that still takes place daily throughout the country, this film could be reproduced (with a current soundtrack) and still be entirely relevant. <br /> <br /> It is not the best film ever made, it is tired in some parts, not all performances are particularly exceptional. But Jodie Foster continued to show his ribs like a real adult actor (a trend that started when he was very young in Taxi Driver). <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 Barky
