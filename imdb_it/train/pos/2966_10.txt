BASEketball is great! It's fun and so damn funny that you'll get your pants wet laughing. I've seen it so many times I've stopped counting. But each time it becomes more fun. <br /> <br /> Trust me on this ... BASEketball is an infallible success and I loved it and will continue to love it. I hope one day there will be a special edition DVD !!! <br /> <br /> Ten inches up !!!
