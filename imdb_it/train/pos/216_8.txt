question: how to steal a scene from the stereotype expert Walther Mathau in full, furious and brilliant Grumpy Old Man mode? answer: silently, impassive, and with perfect timing like George Burns does. <br /> <br /> I don't know anything about Vaudeville, but this remains a favorite movie, the two protagonists are hilarious, the script is funny, the direction and rhythm very well. Richard Benjamin is very funny as a normal man - try to get Burns through the window, etc. Even the small parts are fantastic. <br /> <br /> There are so many fun scenes, Mathau messing up the commercial, Burns repeating his answers as if he were senile ... <br /> <br /> A delight. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrrr!
