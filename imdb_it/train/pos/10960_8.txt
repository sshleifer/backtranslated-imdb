I can't really remember who recommended it, but they said it was one of their favorite movies. It is certainly a strange one - like the rubber that controls a car accident. <br /> <br /> Someone said that truth is stranger than fiction, and the truth here is something to see. I really can't understand how a fictional story of this documentary could be published this year. How can you improve on this? Jackie Kennedy's aunt and cousin are taken out of New York society and hide in the Hampton. In the process they become inmates and what is best described as "crazy cat women". They would have remained hidden if the city had not moved to condemn the property for the dirt and the subsequent rescue of Jackie. This film was made after that rescue. During all, you couldn't help but think, "how bad was he before?" It's a look at high society from the dark side, and it's absolutely fascinating.
