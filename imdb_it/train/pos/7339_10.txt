Since I heard about Ralph Bakshi's version of "The Lord of the Rings", I asked myself: what the hell is "rotoscope" animation? !!! Well ... I finally found out ... I saw this movie about three years ago having no idea who Ralph Bakshi is ... And I liked it ... very ... Very good plot ... also has a little character development that is fantastic for a cartoon ... See if you get bored with contemporary animation .... Don't get me wrong ... I'm not saying it's just a nice cartoon ... It's also a good movie. ..
