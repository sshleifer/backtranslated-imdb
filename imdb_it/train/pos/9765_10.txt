I saw this cheerful little film at the age of 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on CBS. I didn't know he was in a theater. To classify it from a child's point of view, I would give it 4 out of 5 stars, because being a kid at the time, it seemed a bit "girlish". <br /> <br /> The climatic scene in which Gazooks tickled the lights of the day by everyone was a little creepy at the time, but you're too big for this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> When I rediscovered a Blockbuster video in 1995, I had to revisit it! I still enjoyed it despite the fact that it looked a bit "old". I don't know where the other reviewer here got the idea that it wasn't on VHS. <br /> <br /> It's out there. It could also be on DVD, at least I hope so. I want to share it with my kids one day! 10 stars here, it's still a great movie for children. (end) <br /> <br /> 09/08/2009: Finally found a VHS copy !! Woo-hoo!
