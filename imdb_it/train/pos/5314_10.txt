For the first time I saw this film at the sundance film festival this year and, being a teenager, I found the film very attractive. these guys are out of the ordinary and very unexpected to be in a film of this stature, but with the right dialogue and garbage they have made the film a complete success. I liked this movie more than the others, but I highly recommend releasing and watching this movie. it's a mixture of witty comments and hilarious reality. capturing the essence of high school, the high school record is at the top of my list of favorites and I hope it has the chance to be distributed in theaters. I really thank all the guys who worked hard to make this film, it helped me to cry my eyes in laughter.
