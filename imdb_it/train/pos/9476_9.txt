For Romance's sake, as a married man. The following two films are recommended. <br /> <br /> 1. Brief Encounter by David Lean (1945), United Kingdom <br /> <br /> Well, when a woman goes to a train station, something can happen. And it happened! How he wished to be there, in a small tavern waiting for the man of his dreams. But she was married ... the man was a stranger to the fantastic woman <br /> <br /> 2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun of Fei Mu (1948), China <br /> <br /> Well, when a woman he goes to the market to buy fish, food and medicine, passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, there is much to think about, the melancholy of his life, his sick husband in self-pity and the lack of a future ... Just when a jubilant young man arrived, something happened ... the doctor was a high-school honey of the fantastic woman <br /> <br /> In both films, from great directors from the United Kingdom and China, the passion and moderation was so intense, but in the end the intimate sensations had not developed into any physical contact. This leaves you with an excellent aftertaste, smelling it intensely without biting it.
