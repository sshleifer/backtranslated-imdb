This is the kind of film you want to see with a glass of wine, a fire lit and feet up. It does not require so much brain energy to follow, so it is very good after a long day. I would say it is very unrealistic - if you expect something serious, don't worry, but it's very funny. Just the thought that a businessman would go so far as to agree to live in a slum for a while, and then really enjoy it ... I would definitely recommend it.
