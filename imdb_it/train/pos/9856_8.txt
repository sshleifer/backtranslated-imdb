(spoiler ??) <br /> <br /> I wasn't sure what to think of the movie. Not too much of a children's movie. Surely it should be looked at with a parent because it includes death and death. But I was surprised that I enjoyed it a little. <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed with the 81 minutes we spent. (even less without the credits) And the trailer makes you think that the rodent is a main creature. But alas, they torture him. Until the end of the film. Those two moans have moored the 2-star movie. But I recommend the film. Also for a sequel. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 Show: 7/10 Reproducible: 7/10
