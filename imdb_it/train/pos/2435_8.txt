I never thought an old cartoon could bring tears to my eyes! When I first bought Casper & Friends: Spooking About Africa, I really wanted to see Casper's first comic book called The Friendly Ghost (1945), but when I saw the next cartoon, There's Good Boos To-Night (1948), It made me break down! I couldn't believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing Casper's fox killed! I've never seen anything like it in the other Casper cartoons! This is the saddest of all! It was so depressing, I couldn't see it again. It's like watching Lassie die at the end of a movie. I know it's a classic, but it's too much for us old cartoon fans to handle like me! If I wanted to watch something old and classic, I prefer to look at something cheerful and fun! But when I think of this Casper cartoon, I think of my cats!
