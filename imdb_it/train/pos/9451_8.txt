"Deliverance" by John Boorman concerns four suburban inhabitants of Atlanta who take a ride along the rapid waters of the Cahulawassee ?? The river is about to disappear due to the construction of dams and the flooding of the last wild lands ?? <br /> <br /> The four friends emphasize different characters: a manly sport fan who has never been insured in his life since there is no specific risk (Burt Reynolds); a passionate family man and a guitarist (Ronny Cox); an overweight bachelor insurance salesman (Ned Beatty); and a quiet, caring married man with a son who loves to smoke a pipe (Jon Voight). <br /> <br /> What follows are the nightmarish explorations of men against nature's hostile violence? Is it also an ideal code of moral principle on civilized men who fall prey to the dark laws of the desert? <br /> <br /> Superbly filmed, does this exciting adventure for adults definitely contain some really exciting scenes?
