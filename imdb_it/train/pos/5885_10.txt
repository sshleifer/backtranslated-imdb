This film almost surprised me. I didn't have very high expectations but I was wrong. Mary & Rhoda was a lot of fun and well written. They didn't spend too much time stirring the past, so they weren't relying on the success of the old television program to bring the film. Overall it was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly sitcom and I think I could agree with her.
