This film is the best film ever. I can't remember the last time a movie made me cry. With a tear in my eyes, I admire this movie. It has all the elements that a good film must have: excellent dialogues, music, acting, plot / plot. A story of friendship, courage, kindness and loyalty between a street performance famous for The King of the Masks and a child sold as a boy in the Serbian bazaar. The little girl liked being her niece and the king of masks liked a nephew. They were not conventional in reality. Every scene they were together was priceless. The camera work is flawless and grabs you. The acting is inspired. Xu Zhu was excellent as the king of masks. Renying Zhou "Doggie" looks nice and played his character very well. Zhigang Zhao as Liang Sao Lang was great. He played his kind and kindhearted character extremely well. If you have this movie, try it once, watch it.
