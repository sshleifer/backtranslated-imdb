This film starts hilarious from the 15th mark, and continues throughout the film. I can't remember a scene where I didn't turn to look at the people laughing with me. he is the perfect actor for this role because of his appearance and his way of dressing. <br /> <br /> The comic parts were fantastic to watch from actors not very big or popular. As you can see, people like this movie which is currently rated 7.9 on IMDb. I think it should be in 250. Let's say that this is how I didn't see this fun of a movie after the American pie or the original holiday. see it if you want a laugh. I give this movie 2 of the highest thumbs up I've ever given since I heard about IMDb, a great movie site.
