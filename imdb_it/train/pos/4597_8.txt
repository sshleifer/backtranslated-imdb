Having achieved fame with Master Drunken, Jackie Chan was again in the spotlight with Project A in 1983, an extremely entertaining pirate film that restored him as one of the biggest stars. When Police Story was released two years later, the extraordinary clamor that surrounded Jackie was reaching its peak, and the crowd thronged to see this frantic mixture of impressive acrobatics, brutal fight scenes and questionable comedies. He broke numerous box office records and inspired a 50% increase in police recruits, but, seen 20 years later, is that a good thing? <br /> <br /> As an action movie, Police Story insists without question. There are several terrifying fighting scenes, some stunts that recall the best of Chan Buster Keaton's hero, and a captivating, albeit violent confrontation. Even Jackie's performance is very strong, and while the frequent incursions into the tiring comedy mitigate the impact of the film a little, his charisma crosses it. Also, in presenting our hero as a borderline psychopath whose carelessness puts others in danger, Jackie made a risky venture ... even if no one seems to have noticed! Praising Police Story as a mere critic of battles "Good vs. Evil" has undermined the ambiguity of the film's tone, and while The Brothers Karamazov is difficult, in describing this uncertainty the film represented a remarkable and commendable shift from conventional ideas. > <br /> In short, this remains a "popcorn" * quality movie (although you can empty your stomach while numerous criminals are pushed against or deposited in shop windows in the final scene of the film) - a powerful and noisy action movie that aligns to the best of its period.
