This film is an extremely funny and moving story about an orphanage in financial difficulties. When the director goes on vacation, his father agrees to take temporary action to handle things. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best job Leslie Nielson ever did. His idea in the film of renting children is immediately innovative and his sales techniques will surely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The child in this film is so sweet and charming that I know I will never forget her. Just make sure you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> Such family entertainment is so rare these days. If you go for photos a little sweetened with a happy ending, go for this! I could see it over and over again, and I often do it! My only complaint about this film is that it is so difficult to find a copy.
