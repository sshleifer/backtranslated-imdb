This is a strange film about an archaeologist who studies the culture of the ancient Hohokam Indians. He takes a mummy (really fake) from a burial cave and takes it home to study it. Well, very soon he starts acting weird and talks to this mom. And a little later his son becomes possessed by the spirit of the mummy. Even the strangest events occur when the spirit tries to destroy the woman's family. In reality this is REALLY VERY VERY general and will make you fall asleep the first couple of times you try to watch it. But if you keep doing it, you can simply get to the end. <br /> <br /> Haha! What is mom's secret? Is the spirit of the mummy angry because he was removed from the cave? You may not be able to ascertain the motivation of the spirit, but if you like the reckless low-budget pranks (and the hairstyles of the 70s!) This will have a certain comforting charm. <br /> <br /> The way I have The story described is much clearer than the confusing and boring one in which the film tells the story. Can a boring movie really be fascinating? Well ... somehow this reaches him. Perhaps this is a good movie at heart, but performed in a rather awkward way. I do not know. What I do know is that I liked it quite a bit, despite its dullness. <br /> <br /> "Spider Baby" fans will be interested to know that this film uses a couple of musical cues from that movie (including an instrumental version of the theme). <br /> <br /> Characterized by a frightening and fairly well made sequence that shows boulders and rocks lurking on their own and that eventually attack some people in a camper. Other scenes in the film are simply spectral or bizarre; but this scene is actually pretty scary. <br /> <br /> See this! It's strange and worth your time. You may also want one on your shelf.
