The late, great Robert Bloch (author of PSYCHO, for those of you who weren't paying attention) wrote this terror story and it was absolutely one of the scariest movies I've ever seen as a child. (I had to walk MILES just to watch a movie, and it was usually dark when I was leaving the theater, seeing a horror movie was always unnerving, but particularly when it was well executed like this.) When I had the opportunity to watch this video some years ago on videocassette (which should always be the last resort), I was surprised how good it was. Take the terror test: watch it at night, alone, and then tell me it's not scary ...
