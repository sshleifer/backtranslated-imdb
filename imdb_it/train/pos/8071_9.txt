This film addresses the Irish rebellion in the 1920s and more specifically the life of a man after he informs a friend about the generosity on his head and the subsequent consequences. Watching the film, I had the impression that you could take the script and with just a few small updates, do it again and, unfortunately, it would still fit into contemporary events. But the remake would not be as good. A magnificent performance by Victor McLaglen (for which he deservedly earned the Oscar) and a beautiful ensemble cast that includes most, if not all of the actors with Hollywood bands at the time, most of actors recognizable characters or established at the time or simply starting. A very good film is worth watching. Highly recommended.
