It is not the same as the other dance films. Some normal people found themselves dancing. Unlike Hollywood dance films, the characters in this film are not hot or beautiful young people. I'm someone you can see every day in your offices. They are a little depressed about their lives and eventually find themselves and their dreams from dancing. This touches me deeply.
