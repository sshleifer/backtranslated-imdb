If I watch a porn movie, I prefer it to have a plot and a descent dialogue. Behind Bedroom Doors is one of the few I've met with these attributes. <br /> <br /> The new girl next door escapes from the human nature of the neighbor and the weaknesses in which seduction and sex are involved. Chelsea Blue, (I mean Brooke LaVelle) is the actress chosen to play the role of the seducing blackmailer and plays the part beautifully. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress. The film gets a total of 10 just because it's inside. His partner in the film, Monique Alexander, is definitely pretty. The two should do more work together. In this film, however, Monique, who plays Gigi, doesn't have much to do or say. It's too bad. It seems that you have more talent to share. I like the girl who was the (possible) wife of the next district attorney. I forgot her name, but she's pretty and not a bad actress. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to figure out what some people are so excited about. It is obvious that some parts of her have bought a fee. Which is fine, but has it finished? Sorry, come on! I'm afraid his performance here would have dropped the rating, except that Chelsea's talent and beauty prevail over any downside. Overall, this film is a good movie.
