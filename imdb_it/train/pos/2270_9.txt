The film is a bit "thin" after reading the book, but it is still one of the greatest films ever made. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte is really "vonneguty". It does a great job of expressing the feelings of the book in the film. Not many films attract the feel of the book as Mother Night does.
