'Gray Gardens' (1975) is the bizarre documentary of the Maysles brothers of the erotia and cousin of Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis who lives like pigs in a 28-room villa in East Hampton, Long Island. witty and dry and her daughter, "Little Edie" Beale, 56, (emotionally about 13) a still beautiful woman who once had a promising future, lives in isolation from the rest of the world except for their numerous cats and raccoons in the attic. They have fun arguing all day, listening to the radio or singing to each other (they don't even have a television). Their fall from society is surprising to learn and the viewer is attracted by these two very special people, though of course, dysfunctional One of the best documentaries ever made and still today a cult classic.
