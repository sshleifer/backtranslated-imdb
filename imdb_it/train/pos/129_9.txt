With a sensational cinematography and a Kafkaesque nonsense, this film brought me from the simple but fascinating opening scene. The film is very similar to a dream and I think it may be why people hate it or love it. The characters are superficially drawn and the story itself is light and perhaps a bit useless. But these are flaws in the film but conscious choices. The film works is not trying to function as a story, but rather is a deconstruction of the war movies of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> I would have trouble arguing that there was a lot of real substance in the film, but the film is such a cinematic wonder that I was completely blown away. This is one of the most beautiful films of all time, and there is a vivid imagination in his style. I can completely understand why people will hate him, but I give him 9/10.
