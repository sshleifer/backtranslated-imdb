Hunky Geordie Robson Green is Owen Springer, a young doctor who moves to Manchester to be close to his father. Along the way, he falls in love with Anna, a 20-year-old woman, who appears to be the wife of his new boss, Richard Crane. Despite the warnings of his new colleagues, Owen continues to take Anna for himself, going as far as Anna's sabotage and Richard's marriage. This is a romantic drama with many humorous nuances and a quick spirit. The actors are superb: Green from "The Student Prince" and "Touching Evil" smolders on the screen like the cunning but warm Owen; Annis's fame of "Dune" is lively and shows a good correspondence with Green; The kitchen, from "To Play The King" is the right threat from Richard, whose comedy steps and snobbery underline his masterful and constructive hatred for Owen. This is a perfect love triangle, and despite the weaknesses and errors of our three characters, you come better to know and observe them.
