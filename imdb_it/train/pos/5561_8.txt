Ok, needless to say, this film will do nothing but attract a certain audience; ie stoners and like-minded people. <br /> <br /> Having said that, if you are one of these people mentioned, this film is a MUST. In fact, I think it should be mandatory for head shops to sell a copy to anyone who buys their first bong. What the Holy Grail of Monty Python is for geeks and nerds, so is this movie for potheads. I saw this film for the first time about 10 years ago, and I keep breaking up every time I look at it. The jokes perfectly illuminate the lifestyle of the pothead, much better than the knockoffs of the last days like the Half-Baked attempt by. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, so to speak; the film is more a collection of various scenes; while the protagonist films roam Los Angeles in their legendary haze. Despite this, the film has an excellent sense of rhythm and does not drag at all. Many people mention Up In Smoke as the best work of C & C, but I should say that Next Movie is superior. <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood for an hour and a half of laughter, light up, tune in and let your mind wander =) <br /> <br /> Oh and FREE TOMMY CHONG!
