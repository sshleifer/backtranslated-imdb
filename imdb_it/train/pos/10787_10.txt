So when I was little I took this movie as a present and my sister and I loved it. we would always look at it when our friends approached, we would sleep in our pajamas and watch magical mountain games and grandfather's magic toys. I am 21 years old and I still love this film, some old friends and recently I found myself watching it, we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated Profster when we were little. A friend actually bought this movie and his grandfather's magic toys for his 2-year-old daughter because he wants to convey our love for this movie. This is really a film that you can make your children look and feel safe, without violence, without bad words, just a lot of great songs and important lessons.
