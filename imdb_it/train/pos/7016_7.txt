Even if I understand the bad things that someone has to say about this film, I still found it absolutely incredible. It will touch you and, unless your critic is looking for profound problems and setbacks in each film, or just isn't touched by anything, it's worth seeing. Don't enter the movie expecting anything, just a box of tissues and an open mind. It's beautiful and the acting is brilliant. I think Will Smith, despite having once again played another depressed individual, is surprising. I believe that a good actor is someone who can really represent the feelings and emotions we all have in our worst / best experiences in order to reach you and make you feel something. And that's exactly what this film does. Give him a chance.
