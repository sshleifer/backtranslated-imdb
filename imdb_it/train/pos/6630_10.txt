This is an important film. Challenge the viewer and encourage you to pay attention. There is much to love here. The director seems interested in dismantling some of the more tired film conventions. Unlike many recent American cinemas, this film is interested in what it means to make a film in the first place. The DVD includes a lot of bonus features, and there are two comments that explain the film to viewers still puzzled after an initial view. When the film was screened at Sundance, it made more than a few members of the audience uncomfortable and angry. This is a Sunday morning coffee movie, not a Friday night movie. For the dedicated viewer, it's a treasure.
