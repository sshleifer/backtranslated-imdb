This film was released by Roger Corman, so you know that filmmakers didn't have much money to work with. <br /> <br /> Although some viewers may lose the subtleties in this film due to the typical "obsessed" killer-like marketing approach, there are unique differences in this film. <br /> <br /> AMANDA , as interpreted by the talented and talented Justine Priestley, he is a complex character, some people like these films precisely because violence may seem random, but here the ramifications of past abuses (treated in a realistic but good taste) are what form AMANDA's psychosis Surprisingly, Amanda eventually redeems herself with an act of love, in which most of these films turn into the typical, all the struggle for death and the evil character dies just like evil, in the end , to begin with. <br /> <br /> A few edges in this image, but I have to give it 7 out of 10 stars based on its concern and yes, originality compared to the usual - especially on a budget.
