If you like Jamie Foxx, (Alvin Sanders), "Date From Hell", 01, you will love his acting like a guy who never gets a break in life and ends up joking with, (Jumbo Size) and at the same time a lot of gold bars. Alvin Sanders has a lot of FBI eyes that look at him and ends up being hit by a brick in the jaw, and David Morse, (Edgar Clenteen), "Hack" '02 TV series, decides to reset poor Alvin and use it as so called Fish Hook to attract criminals. There are lots of laughs, dramas, cold-blooded killings and excellent movie locations and lots of expensive machines sent to Junk Yard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were exceptional actors in this film and it was great fun throughout the film.
