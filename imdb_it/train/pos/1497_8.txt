This film is a very entertaining horror film (along the lines of Tales from the Crypt) written by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho). It's fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast. The film should also be requested for Doctor Who fans as Jon Pertwee (the third doctor) has a fun role as a rude and hateful horror star!
