I just came out and can't believe what a brilliant documentary is. You rarely leave a cinema with such amazement and amazement. Lately movies have become so overwhelmed that the thrill of discovering something really special and unique rarely happens. Amores Perros did this to me when it came out and this movie is doing me now. I knew nothing of this before entering and what a surprise. If you listen to the concept, you may have the feeling that this is one of those touching films on an incredible triumph covered by top music and trying to make us fully convinced of what a great story tells but then not let us in. Fortunately this is not that movie. People tell the story! This is a great job in capturing every moment of their involvement as we enter their world and feel every second with them. There is far beyond the climb that makes everything that goes through much more tense. Touching the Void was also an excellent document on mountain climbing and showed intensity in an engaging way, but this film is much more than a human story. I saw it today but I'm going to say this is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.
