I purchased the DVD set on a recommendation from Amazon.com based on my other interests. They hit the nail in the head with this. I remember watching the show when he was on TV, but I always wondered what had happened to him. Ten years later, it's like looking at everything again for the first time. Lucas Black as Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as sheriff Lucas Buck are great together, even if they are somewhat rivals. Almost representative of good (Caleb) and evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I never really understood exactly what Lucas should have been, but let it be enough to say that he has some special powers that I don't believe were granted by something holy. He can make phones ring, write or even change a person's emotions. Nevertheless, there are some episodes in which he actually becomes the good guy despite everything. All in all, this is an excellent series that, like so many others I can think of (I.E. Point Pleasant, Threshold, Nowhere Man and SeaQuest DSV, just to name a few) have been deleted long before their time. Steven King's The Dead Zone (Sunday's USA Network) seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to do it. There is nothing left to watch on TV. This is because everything about Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and must be immediately taken out of the TV. So, in the meantime, I will continue to buy DVD sets and watch the shows that should still be on TV, but have been downloaded from TV by religious fanatics to watch "quality" shows like Family Guy and American Dad and The Simpsons (what a bunch of shit it is).
