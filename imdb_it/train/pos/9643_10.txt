This film has it all. Emotion, power, affection, the adorable dance on the naked beach of Stephane Rideau ... Exposes the need for a true inner communion and external communication in every relationship. Just because Cedric and Mathieu are a couple that happens to be gay does not mean that there is not enough vision for anyone. I would probably classify it as a gay movie, but that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people and by homosexual and bisexual people. Mathieu's inability to manage his emotions discloses how our society does not encourage us to act differently, and this is what creates the discord between him and Cedric. This is definitely a must-see !!!!
