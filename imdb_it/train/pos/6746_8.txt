This is a great example of a fairly simple Film Noir story that is handled exceptionally well - thanks to the excellent direction of Otto Preminger and some beautiful recitations. Dana Andrews is a hot-headed detective who too often uses fists instead of brains. Shortly after the film begins, Andrews is scolded for this and is warned that if he continues like this he will be out of order. A little later, while investigating a crime, he is attacked by a suspect and Andrews is forced to fight to protect himself. This time NOT use too much force but the aggressor is killed. Andrews panics and thinks they won't believe him, so he tries to cover up the death - even if an innocent man is ultimately blamed for the crime. <br /> <br /> There is much more to the film than this ... - including a plot involving a slimy criminal (Gary Merrill) and a love interest for Andrews (Gene Tierney). All in all, this is one of the best examples of its kind - with a great dialogue, excellent lighting and a simple but very effective story. This is how Noir was meant to be.
