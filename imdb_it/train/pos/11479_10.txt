This film was excellent, a little scary, but excellent. For those of you who have heard of aquilegia and know the story, it gives you an idea of ​​what and why these guys did what they did. In the back of your mind you know that people think of this stuff, but you never realize how serious it is, and this movie makes you understand. It's really so beautiful. It also makes you think twice before making fun of someone who is safe. I read a book on the Columbus massacre and it made me think, this film makes me worry and scares me to death. On the flip side of the coin is how to kill someone who drives for serial killers. Recently I received a threat and blew it without thinking, but after this movie I think you should take everything seriously. Some people are crazy and you never really know who they are, so take it seriously and don't underestimate someone.
