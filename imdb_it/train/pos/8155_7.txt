I'm too old to know (or worry) exactly what the difference is between rap and hip-hop. And, being Canadian, it's likely he never saw MTV, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> But I thought this movie was a lot of fun when I saw it, a little bright satire. Hip-hop culture is so pervasive these days that it's hard not to keep hearing about it over and over again. (If only we could say the same about bagpipe music.) I had most of the lines (at least I think I did). Sure, it's derived from Spinal Tap, but there are many goals that could withstand a Tap treatment. Not only carpenters, they are sacred.
