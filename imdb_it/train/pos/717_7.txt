big Ramones fan. I like ramones, and I suppose if you hate them, then, besides being an avid Bush supporter, you might not like this classic. <br /> <br /> It is immensely better than the zaffy john hughes teen movies and the one scattered in the 80s. infinitely better than the American Pie's that plague us now. <br /> <br /> There are other great high school films: Switchblade Sisters, Fast Times ..., Class of '84, Three O'Clock High, and the cheesy but compelling (doesn't seem possible) River's Edge. But RnRHS will always be my favorite because it's the funniest and funniest, plus you can get up and dance with it. <br /> <br /> I love you, Riff Randell. <br /> <br /> 10/10
