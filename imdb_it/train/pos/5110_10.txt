I was about 11 years old and discovered that I live 0.48 miles from my uncle's house. Uncle's house is on Westway Dr, Deer Park, TX. have added homes since the film was made. I don't know the street number but you can go looking for it. now i'm 21 and i like watching this movie. Spencer's bar is no longer theirs. Pasadena ISD wants to build a school of their own. I drove to the house last week, the house still looks beautiful. My father and my uncle used to go to the street where the house is and watch the actors entering and leaving the house trying to make the film. where john crosses the cracks of the railway they have made 225 higher. when I hear about John having fun with his son, I start thinking about when he made urban cowboys, who were 26 or 25 at the time.
