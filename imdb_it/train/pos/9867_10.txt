I first saw the Ice Age in Subiaco cinemas when it came out, back in '02. At the time I was only 13, but even then I liked it. There was a kind of heat. <br /> <br /> We've had it on video for a number of years and no matter how many times you look at it, it never gets boring. This is due to the unique element that makes it different from all other 3D animations made at that time - the characters do not have a particular "home" they leave. They are nomads, and this is really refreshing and uplifting to look at. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, every single character on the surface seems to be only able to stand each other, but they are really all good friends. Moreover, all the characters have their charm (even the bad ones). Sid the sloth is fascinating in its annoying way, too affectionate and naive. Manny is adorable in his depressed and reclusive character, and so on. <br /> <br /> Another important point of the film is the beauty of animation. All the rooms and characters were originally modeled from clay, giving the film an artistic touch. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that adds to the feel of the film is that the genre means very little. There are practically no female characters, but you don't really realize it until after watching it a few times and even then it doesn't have much effect on the way you watch the movie. Because of this, there is not even mention of a nuclear family that would be really pathetic in a context like the ice age. <br /> <br /> All in all, the Ice Age is a great movie and shows how much effort was put into 3D animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out.
