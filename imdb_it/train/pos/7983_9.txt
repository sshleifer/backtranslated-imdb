It is difficult to overcome this film in many ways. Everything works very well here; casting, acting, screenwriting and cinematography are all top notch. For the viewer, it is a moving and violent story of human love and redemption. For the film critic, there is a lot of acute technique and technical merit. There are some tactical errors and, as has been discussed in the tables, the ending lacks realism if one is strictly formal with the CIA agent's training angle. However, I considered the most moving ending due to the fact that rather than pursuing the pragmatic approach of the CIA agent, Creasy basically praises his soul towards the Ultimate without considering the consequences. Like Jesus himself, Creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice, whether he actually has a pragmatic sense or not. However, I appreciated the fact that Creasy despises conventional bourgeois morality and merely plugs the bad guys one by one in her methodical search for justice, which in reality translates into redemption both for itself and for the innocent. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is worth watching this movie if you are attracted to the genre. An excellent soundtrack, a great script, an impeccable casting and solid performance across the board make this film top-100 (or better).
