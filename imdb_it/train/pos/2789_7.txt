Fold it as if Beckham were chock-full of intriguing scenes, but it has a predictable overall trait line. This is a girl named Jess who is trying to reach her long life to become a famous soccer player and finally has the chance to offer a position in a local team. there are so many limits and limits that it faces that they hold it, but it is still determined and strives. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good light film and wants to be inspired by what people can get. The choices of the songs are really good, "shut up my son, go ahead ... to your destination and make boundaries and complications." However I hope it was helpful to your needs in a review. Fold it like a great Beckham movie
