This is one of those that feel good, the Saturday afternoon movies. It's right up there with other retro films like Flight of the Navigator. Just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up. And it's fun to see how 20 years have changed stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson. Not to mention Joquin Phoenix. <br /> <br /> Personally I really like movies like this from time to time. Nothing too deep or too scary. Just a nice plot. And I never knew Mr. Phoenix if I hadn't read the credits recently. He was really a child when he made this film. Kelly Preston was also the young budding actress. She and Lea did a great job in this movie. I agree it's not an Oscar-winning movie. But it's really worth watching. Especially if you have children in the range, say, 8 to 11 years. Or those who are interested in the space program.
