I think many people have just written this as another one of Tom Cruise's strange films (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut) but Vanilla Sky is definitely his movie. Many people said it was strange; it wasn't. It was different and confusing but not strange. Strange is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. Truman's show is different. Confusing is The Matrix or The Game. And unlike Kubrick, this film has a conclusion. Everything makes sense - perhaps not immediately, perhaps even today, but it will make sense. Vanilla Sky is confused because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. This is the point. It is here that the so-called "strangeness" that has driven critics away has arrived. If they had taken the trouble to "open [their] eyes" like the Spanish film of 1997, they could have seen it. And if this isn't enough reason to see it, go see it for music. Cameron Crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; he uses it to set the "feeling" - that known element which lacks many movies. With tracks like "Good Vibrations" by The Beach Boys that play the dramatic and emotional climax of the film, it creates an unusual, but surprisingly, "right" feeling. A wonderful film, in the script, in the music, in the acting and in the images, Vanilla Sky is unfortunately a vaguely superficial film that critics criticize for appearing intelligent. Excellent: A +
