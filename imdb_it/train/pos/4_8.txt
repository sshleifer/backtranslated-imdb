FUTZ is the only show preserved by the New York experimental theater movement in the 1960s (the origins of Off Off Broadway). Although it is not for everyone, it is a genuinely brilliant story, obscurely entertaining, and even more often disturbing about love, sex, personal freedom and revenge, a serious moral story even more relevant now at a time when Congress wants to put out reads gay marriage ruining our Constitution. History is not about being gay, but about love and sex that do not conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hatred. On the surface, it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like every great fairy tale, it's not really about animals, but about something bigger - stifling conformity in America. <br /> <br /> The theatrical version has gained international acclaim in its original production, has toured the United States and Europe, and with others of its kind has influenced almost all the theaters that followed it. Fortunately, we kept the show more or less as originally conceived, with the original cast and original director, Tom O'Horgan (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway). <br /> <br /> This is not a mainstream studio film, easy to take, this is an aggressive, disquieting, glorious, deeply emotional, incredibly imaginative storytelling piece you will never forget. And it could just change the way you see the world ...
