Fans of Giallo are looking for this rare film. It is well written and full of all kinds of the usual still lifes that populate these films. I don't want to give anything, so I won't say anything about the plot. The whole film creates a very bizarre atmosphere, and you don't know what to expect or who to suspect. Recommended! The only place I saw to get this film in English is from the European Trash Cinema, for $ 15.
