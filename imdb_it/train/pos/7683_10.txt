I LOVED GOOD TIMES with the rest of many of you. I love reading INTELLIGENT comments and INSIGHTFUL. The writers of THIS show were fantastic and the actors were beyond TALENT. To answer Strawberry22 (the most accurate comment of the other top and positive commentary) ... What happened is that James was killed in an accident (I think I remember it was a trucking or a car accident) and it was the saddest episode (when it was broadcast for the first time and I was a tiny thing ... it was so sad for me ..). <br /> <br /> Florida and children actually get out of projects and even become close with Willona (Wilnona) and that's how the last show ended. <br /> <br /> ALL children have realized their dreams and found opportunities in each of their dreams. It was a wonderful ending and I cried because I was happy for them and the show seemed so realistic that I really believed in their destiny. I hope this kind of ending sounds real to many. <br /> <br /> A great show and many other great shows followed including Benson and The Jeffersons. This was a fantastic time for African American television and the best writers were fantastic at the time. TV LAND is great for memories and I love it because I can't stand the stuff we're looking at today. SOMEONE ... quickly reports the 70s and 80s ... your smart viewers are a moribund race out here and we need better material. <br /> <br /> Love, an original TV LAND sitcom addict from the 70s and 80s (while singing in "ALL in the Family" ... those were the days ......
