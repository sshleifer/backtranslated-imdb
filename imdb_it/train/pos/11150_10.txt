I sat down to watch "Midnight Cowboy" thinking it would be another overrated 60s / 70s movie. Some of my favorite films come from the 70s, in the same style as "Midnight Cowboy" ("Taxi Driver", "Mean Streets", "Panic in Needle Park", etc.) But there are many, many overrated as well, who have earned a solid reputation among critics for being innovative - unfortunately most of them don't hold up well today. I feel so on "Easy Rider". (Although, also, it's one of my favorites.) <br /> <br /> So, I didn't expect much from "Midnight Cowboy", but I got far behind. It's a touching story, well done and told with the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman, like Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo, gives one of his best - he's a little funny sometimes (he looks like a cartoon character when he talks - maybe because of the Lenny / "Simpson" connection), but Hoffman is completely convincing . Half of the film's budget went towards his salary while he was becoming a major star in Hollywood. In front of him is Jon Voight, runner-up, Joe Buck, the "cowboy" who travels north to the Big Apple hoping to become a prostitute. Soon his naive ways get him into trouble and mate with a crippled scam artist named "Ratso" - who offers to become Joe's "manager" for a certain percentage of profits. <br /> <br /> The film is quite long at two hours, but it never seems very long. Some films tend to drag, especially some of the films made in the '70s because (as was said in "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls") the directors were the protagonists of the films in the' 70s and occasionally got a little too much infatuated with their material, going too far in examining characters / scenes / etc. they are not important Almost the only scene I heard was a little too long and useless was the drug party - it makes the film extremely obsolete (similar to the odyssey of the drug in "Easy Rider") and it really damages its flow because it is not necessary. /> <br /> In addition to this, "Midnight Cowboy" is an almost flawless film. I was pleasantly surprised. It has its flaws (flashbacks are a bit sticky and never used as they might have been, for example) and some scenes are a bit uncomfortable (like the gay movie sequence) but if you can manage the content "Midnight Cowboy "is a truly exceptional film, an intransigent examination of life on the streets between the late 1960s and the early 1970s. It is a depressing film, yes, and according to today's standards it may seem a bit obsolete and heavy on the liberal perspective of "life is horrible, etc." ... but I still love him and in particular the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long, long time. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. One of the best films of the 70s. (He was technically released in late 1969, but I would still classify it as a movie from the 70s. He also won the Oscar for best film, having been the first - and only - category X film to do so. R on appeal. ) <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5
