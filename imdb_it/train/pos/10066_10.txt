King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is an incredibly beautiful and deeply moving film. Winner of 16 awards from around the world, this film based on a true story is centered on Wang Bianlian, a 1930s Chinese street artist who is aging but does not have the heir to pass on his art of changing face to 'Opera. He has a unique talent for quickly changing masks in performance, and nobody knows how he does it. He has a burning desire to have a nephew, as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir. Then we go out into the street and see that people sell their children because they can't afford to take care of them: some even beg to bring their daughters for free, because daughters aren't worth much in this society. The story of Wang Bianlian goes on from there. <br /> <br /> The film was so amazingly beautiful, the acting was amazing, and the issues were so heavy and well addressed. There is gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place, nobody wants a child. It is also interesting to note that the famous opera actor, who always plays a woman and is known as the living Bodhisattva, is a man who dresses as a woman, and while he is famous and respected, he considers himself something low, a half woman . As we move forward in the film, we address the issues of the human slave trade and its demand and therefore the lack of a possible solution to this, the brutality and corruption of the military and police, and the powerlessness and lack of power that every individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Wang Bianlian, presents another beautiful performance.
