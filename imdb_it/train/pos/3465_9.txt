I sat down to watch this movie with a lot of trepidation and little hope. I didn't think it would be possible for this film to live up to its subject. But absolutely, and then some. First of all, I must say that Jared Harris did an extraordinary job like John Lennon. Sometimes it seemed that Harris was channeling Lennon. The resemblance was often disturbing, and he clearly studied Lennon's mannerisms and vocal inflections. Aiden Quinn was quite as good as McCartney, who also had a striking resemblance to Macca, although he occasionally stumbled on his Scouse accent. <br /> <br /> This narrative work was well written and well directed. It was pure fantasy, of course, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur peeking through a keyhole at this meeting. The rooftop scene was particularly moving, as McCartney had told Lennon what he had never heard as a child - that was worthy and important, and it could never be his fault that he had been abandoned by his parents. I also liked the scene in the park where the two dance with an absolute abandonment to the reggae group! <br /> <br /> My only complaint would be this: I'm not so sure that John was as caustic as he portrayed in the film at this stage of his life. He had settled quite well in his domestic situation, and was actually known to be quite friendly when approached by fans. Only a few years later, he was very friendly when he was first approached by his murderer for an autograph on the day he was murdered. <br /> <br /> Mostly this film has served to arouse those feelings about what John might have lived a little longer. I'm pretty sure the Beatles would come back together at some point. And I'm pretty sure that Lennon and McCartney would still be friends today. <br /> <br /> Well done, VH1. I will watch it again and again. <br /> <br />
