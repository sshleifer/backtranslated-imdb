Full House is a great family show. However, after seeing a few episodes over and over again I realized that they are incredibly boring and seem to take a lot of shelter from the outside world. Yes, there is a lot of comedy, but there are times when it's incredibly bad. It's not like I hate it, but I just don't look at them again and again because they get old fast. Probably the best season is the first one. <br /> <br /> Full House talks about widower Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and his three daughters D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). When Danny's wife dies, he needs help. Thus, his best friend Joey (Dave Coulier) and the uncle of the girls Jesse (John Stamos) move in with them. Once they live there together, they discover that they cannot live without each other. <br /> <br /> Full House reminds you how important the family is and that you can always go home.
