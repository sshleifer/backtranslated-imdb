At first I discovered Linda Feferman's Seven Minutes in Heaven when I was 14 and worked in a video store and loved it. I recently watched the movie again and realized that it's a lost treasure. The film stars Jennifer Connelly, almost twenty years before she could win an Oscar for Beautiful Mind, like Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays his best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The film is definitely a sweeter, nicer and softer version of Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful from the 1980s, which is exactly why it's so beautiful. He's honest, not forced like those movies, and parents will love watching this movie with children. <br /> <br /> When Natalie's dad leaves home for a business trip, Jeff convinces her that he should move because his home life sucks. With the support of Natalie's friend, Polly, exquisitely played by Maddie Corman, she leaves him. But this film is not about putting children in situations and seeing what they can get away with. The three protagonists are so natural and the script, surprisingly so honest, that what goes through their performances is heartbreaking. These characters really care about each other. It is a fantastic film to show to children who are reaching pre-adolescent adolescence. <br /> <br />
