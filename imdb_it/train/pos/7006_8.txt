Obsessed with a secret, Ben Thomas (Will Smith) seeks redemption by radically transforming the lives of seven people he doesn't know. Once his plan is set, nothing will be able to stop him. At least that's what he thinks. But Ben had not planned to fall in love with one of these people and it is he who will eventually transform it. Will Smith is back again with director Gabriele Muccino, after the inspirational film "The Pursuit of Happiness". "Seven Pounds" is another life-changing cinematic experience that not only reminds you of their previous collaboration, in tears, but inspires you with joy at the end. Will Smith, he too is the producer again with some of the others. These films are very realistic, representing the life of a common man and his struggles through life. Seven pounds may have taken some time to get its momentum, but only after half an hour of the film, the film is ready to dominate your heart. In addition, this film has turning points that revolve around you, which let viewers guess. The director Gabriele Muccino is once again the winner, with his emotional but stimulating message. It makes all the characters in the film very real, that people would really find themselves somewhere in the film. Together with the director, Will Smith is yet another winner, with his superb acting skills. Once again, the director and actor duo works like a charm. Furthermore, there are other talented actors in the film who have done their part quite well. Rosario Dawson, beauty with the brain, is what she can be called. She is beautiful and does her part very well. Barry Pepper gives great support to the film and Woody Harrelson does the same, although Woody didn't have much time on screen (it would have been nice if he had more). You will not easily forget this movie. Watch this movie and change your life. First-class cinema!
