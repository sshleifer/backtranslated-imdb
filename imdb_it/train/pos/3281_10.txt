Who would have thought that such a dark little film could be so disturbing and moving? I'm really impressed It's a pity that more people haven't seen it. As always, I loved Hans Zimmer's score. And what a directorial debut of Bernard Rose! Yet I wonder if I should call it a horror movie. It could easily be argued that it is also a fantasy or a drama. Well, regardless, I love the interpretative potential it has. Everything and all Anna's dreams (played by Charlotte Burke) represent a real conflict in her life ... the house itself, the tree, Marco, the lighthouse, etc. There are many details that make the film so beautiful for repeated views. I hope to meet another small film full of emotions and psychological significance like this soon.
