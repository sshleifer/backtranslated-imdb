This is by far one of the best-made films and has not left me disappointed at all. The soundtrack and the work with the finely captured portable video camera were exquisite. There is always the possibility that one film does not maintain its own beliefs and another, but I felt that the rhythm of this image and timing were excellent. Dakota Fanning is quickly becoming a staple in the film that requires a child with an old soul personality and has never let me down with his talent. As for Mr. Washington and of course Christopher Walken, both overcome the challenge of showing the darker sides of humanity trying to move towards the light.
