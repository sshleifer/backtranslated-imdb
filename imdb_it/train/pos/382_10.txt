One of the best movies ever made! Because it has only a score of 7.6 it is a mystery. This film is a window on the world of black experience in America. Visualization for all whites and all children over 10 years should be mandatory. I recommend watching it with "The Long Walk Home" as a complement. If you think Whoopi Goldberg's work involves "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollywood Squares", think again. Don't miss this movie, which should have won the Oscar. (And read the book too!)
