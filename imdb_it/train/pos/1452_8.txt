Being a transplanted New Yorker, I could be more critical than most by looking at the town hall. But I must say that before reaching the story itself I was fascinated by the location locations and the political atmosphere of New York that director Harold Becker created. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a reference to Woerner's Restaurant in Brooklyn, where the political leader Frank Anselmo loves to eat. There was or was a Woerner restaurant on Remsen Street in downtown Brooklyn when I lived in New York in 1996. It was indeed particularly favored by Borough politicians even though they had a couple of other hangouts. <br /> <br /> No surprise because the script was co-signed by Nicholas Pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories. He knows the atmosphere well and knows how those two worlds intersect as they do in this film. <br /> <br /> A detective played by Nestor Serrano makes an unofficial meeting with a relative of the Mafia boss Anthony Franciosa and things explode and three people end up dying, including an innocent 6-year-old whose father he was taking to school. History becomes alive and is eventually reached within the Municipality itself. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino plays mayor John Pappas and John Cusack is his deputy mayor a transplanted state governor, a state that has a tradition of stately corruption. He is the outsider here and in an attempt to do damage control, Cusack finds more than he has contracted, <br /> <br /> Danny Aiello plays Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo and for those of you not to New York, his character is based on the late Borough, president of Queens, Donald Manes, also a victim of scandal. It is very much the kind of Brooklyn politician I knew during the day of friendship with organized crime and the favors done for them, Aiello in. <br /> <br /> City Hall was the cinema farewell for Anthony Franciosa, one of the most undervalued and undervalued talents on the screen ever. No one looks at anyone else every time he is on stage. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino's best time is when at the funeral of the young son killed, he takes control of the process and turns it into a political triumph for himself. His is a complex part, he is a good enough man, but one caught up in the corruption needed to get to a place like New York. <br /> <br /> For those who want to learn about political life in the Big Apple, the City Hall is highly recommended.
