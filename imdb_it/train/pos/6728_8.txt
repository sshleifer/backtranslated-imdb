I came across this film on cable and was completely conquered. The story of a group of surfers riding big waves, monstrously huge waves, waves that will make any rational person run away in terror is the one that manages to be spectacular and make people understand why people spend their lives hunted down. There is nothing special about the film, apart from the fact that it brings together very interesting people who are in love with what they do and let them talk. Of course, there are surf scenes, but what makes this film so special is the people. Here are a lot of guys who are so excited about what they do that they go through for the people they watch. Halfway through this movie you will want to go out and learn to surf. Few documentaries have ever managed to hide the passion these people have and the film's ability to make us feel what makes this movie a great film. Watch it.
