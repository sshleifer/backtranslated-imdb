Is it a good idea to use live animals for department store windows? <br /> <br /> No, and that's why .... <br /> <br /> In "Hare Conditioned" the sale of Bugs is helping to promote is over and the store manager (Nelson) is moving to a new department: taxidermy. Of course, Bugs and fun items begin. <br /> <br /> using almost every department in the store (children's clothing, sports, shoes, costumes, women's nightgowns - don't ask). Bug arrives at the top of every turn, even referring to the manager as "The Great GilderSNEEZE". Even if trapped within the confines of an elevator, Bugs makes the best of the situation. <br /> <br /> Director Jones is always at the top of his pictorial game, as are Blanc (like Bugs, natch) and Nelson (the manager - who plays like a Gildersleeves radio pillar - go ask your grandparents ). <br /> <br /> And a wise advice: when confronted with a blurred-looking woman who wants to try on bath slippers, always check her ears. <br /> <br /> Ten stars for "Hare Conditioner", the best argument yet for animal labor laws.
