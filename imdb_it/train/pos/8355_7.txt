The film has a distinct (though brutal and brutal) humanity for all its borderline depravity - the zippy / lyrical score highlights the comic side of their misadventures, and even when they are more tense (like terrifying the woman on the train), a semi-pitiful vulnerability never lurks far (Dewaere sucks her breast like a child). Blier cuts away from the scene in which Depardieu could be about to rape Dewaere, so we are never sure how explicitly he reads the manifestly homoerotic aspect of their relationship - in both cases, that incident is the beginning of their relative humanization (so the film could certainly be read as pro-gay, although it could probably be read as pro-whatever you want). The film has many questionable scenes and points of sexual politics and is probably best taken as a general comic on the weaknesses of both genders, mocking the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty, and hitting numerous points of possible depth based on the fact that if you fire enough shots, some of them are destined to hit.
