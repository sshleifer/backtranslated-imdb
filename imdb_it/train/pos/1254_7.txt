Ed Harris' work in this film lives up to its usual standard of excellence, meaning it steals the screen from anyone who shares it, and this includes the formidable Sean Connery. The film, which is more than a little honest, comes alive only in the scenes in which Harris is questioned by the lawyer of another inmate. It's breathtaking, a master class in artistic control. <br /> <br /> The other cast members are all skilled and Connery is reliable, as is Fishbourne, but the story itself doesn't suck. The plot depends largely on the premise that a black prisoner will always be abused and forced by white law enforcement. This is the engine that drives the story, right or wrong, and makes one feel cheated in the end. <br /> <br /> However, it's worth watching to see Harris in action.
