It's never the most successful television project ever made by John Cleese, "Strange Case" has the feeling of a first draft that was launched in production before any revision could be made. There are some silly ideas in all and even some smart ones, but the story as a whole is unfortunately not added to much. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a blast, however, as Dr. Watson, bit bionic and all. "Good God."
