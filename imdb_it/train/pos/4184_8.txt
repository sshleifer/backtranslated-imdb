Some war films are successful where others are not, and this can be assessed from a variety of angles. The humanistic corner, the one in which you can feel the raw emotions (the terror of being under attack, the camaraderie among the soldiers, the arduous tests that people face inside them when they fight, etc.). They are always films that I find irresistible . Movies like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are just two examples of films that perceive a connection with the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> This film is also successful on that level. It's about "The Highest Honor" and that honor is doing the right thing. These 23 soldiers have done the right thing, they have had honor and are recognized in a way totally incompatible with Western thought, but it is, to the end, a true story of honor. Unforgettable movie. Based on the true story.
