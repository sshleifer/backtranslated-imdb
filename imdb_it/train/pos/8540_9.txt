It's funny how your life can change in a second ... To participate in "The Waterdance" for the first time was an unforgettable experience, the way you have to get used to a new way of life can seem scary, and notice that there are other people who go from a similar situation that can help you move forward. <br /> <br /> The performances of Eric Stoltz and above all of Helen Hunt (oh man!, Helen is the purest and most graceful woman on earth ...) are wonderful, Wesley Snipes surprises even in one of your last roles serious. A simple and at the same time profound film that does not leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted: enjoy every moment of your life ... <br /> <br /> Really for a film like that the hour is not frequented !! ! (sorry, it's a Brazilian expression ...).
