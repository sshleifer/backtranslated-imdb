Disney (and the wonderful PIXAR people of course) offer a pleasant and humorous story combined with the best of computer animation. I admit that perhaps the "faces" of the insects were a little more static than those of "Antz" and had only four legs (in "Antz" you are ...). But the backgrounds were superb and the animation was breathtaking. But this is a lesson: it was not the computer that made such a success: it was the man behind the machine, who added the beautiful twists and turns, which I lost in "Antz". Some highlights were obviously the "bloopers" at the end (so keep looking at them in the end, it's worth it!), Which were very funny and original. The "Filmed on location" line was designed for the most attentive spectators.
