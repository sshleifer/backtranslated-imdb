Spectacular horror movie that will give you the creeps once you've settled in. The atmosphere is very disturbing and elegant, the score is chilling, but the best thing about the film is its performances. It is rare that you are ashamed of the performances and the solid acting of this film plays an important role in the fear factor. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting and catches your attention from the first minutes. Even if the woman in black doesn't have much time on the screen, she makes the necessary appearances to relax the audience in some brilliant scenes. The dialogues are very descriptive and make your imagination work and in that moment it becomes really scary. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance, watch this at the theater it's a totally different but scary experience like this movie. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Ghost movies ever and is directed for people who want to be afraid.
