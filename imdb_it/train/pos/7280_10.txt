to look at him as a child. Although I probably find him terrible now, he was kind - ghostly stuff because I was only seven. I also remember working on a Saturday afternoon puzzle while watching it, so I wasn't paying much attention. However, the scene with the rolling boulders has been burned in my mind ever since. I asked many people if they saw this movie, but without success. 12 years ago, a person said that, perhaps, he had seen it, but he thought it was just a dream; an imaginative piffle like the wind. It's not a dream, my friend. Don't dream now. Once again, I haven't seen it since, but I'm looking forward to finding a copy and putting it in my VCR. All that can remain embedded in my mind for 23 years deserves a "10".
