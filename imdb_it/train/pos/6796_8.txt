Zodiac Killer (2005) was an interesting film by the born German director Ulli Lommel. He directs, produces and co-stars in this latest production. Not only can he make an interesting movie cheaply. But it reaches a new low when Herr Lommel works on the film of almost all his film catalog. I've seen films from Boogeyman I and II, War Birds, Tenderness of the Wolf, Brain Waves and Cocaine Cowboys (Andy Warhol also makes a cameo from beyond the grave courtesy of this film). Even if he uses a lot of old movies, he works them well (and I could add creatively). <br /> <br /> The film follows a young man who copies the original Zodiac Killer. it also corresponds to a writer (Ulli Lommel) who originally wrote about the serial killer in the late sixties and early seventies. The writer's friend (David Hess) helps him to search and find this Zodiac. Can this killer be stopped? Will the writer do two plus two and claim part of his old glory? Is David Hess still the man? You'll have to find out for yourself and see the Zodiac Killer. <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT about the original Zodiac killer. I also heard people complaining about this video filmed. So. The artistic style of the director's old school exceeds the fact that it is shot on video. My only complaint was the excessive use of footage from previous films by Herr Lommel (but I understand why they "wink" "wink"). Don't believe the hype. This is a gritty and street horror movie. As in the case of the disclaimer at the outset, this film does not glorify the murder. Like this statement. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for Ulli Lommel fans.
