<br /> <br /> In 1970, after a five-year absence, Kurosawa did what would be his first color film. Dodes' Ka-Den is a film focused on many intertwined stories that take place in a small slum in Tokyo. <br /> <br /> The title comes from the sound that a mentally retarded boy makes while imagining he is driving a train. We slowly get to know other people from the small community, the two drunkards who trade wives because they are not happy with those they have. The old man who is the center of the city who helps a thief who tries to rob him. The very poor father and son who can never afford a home, so they imagine one of them. At the end of the film, all the stories return to the starting point, some are happy, others sad. <br /> <br /> As this was Kurosawa's first color film, you can see that he uses it to his advantage and shows. Maybe too much. This film goes in many different directions and it is difficult to settle down and deepen. But don't get me wrong, Dodes' Ka-Den may not be the best of Kurosawa, but coming from the greatest director of all time, it's much better than 99% of today's movies.
