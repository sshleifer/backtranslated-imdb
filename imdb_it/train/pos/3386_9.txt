Is this the future that awaits us? An overpopulated and merciless desolate land with an infernal and unwanted existence? This film reminds me of a problem that still affects us, doubly since the film was released way back in 1973. We hope the world doesn't end like this ... <br /> <br /> Soylent Green is a wild movie which I really enjoyed. He had cute characters, a semi-apocalyptic setting, a compelling and inspiring storyline, and the macho-macho man out there: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the film a very unpleasant and dirty feeling. You are almost suffocated by the stench of the city and its dirty inhabitants. <br /> <br /> The characters are wonderful. Charleton Heston, who has become one of my favorite actors, IS Thorn. The man has created this role of cock, yet likeable. I could definitely put myself in Thorn's shoes. He sees that something is not right, but everyone around him or does not listen (more like paid for not listening) or they want him dead. Edward G. Robinson (in his latest film, R.I.P.) plays the lovely old Sol, who has had enough of this bad place. All the others are fantastic, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a piece of "furniture" that comes with the apartment where she resides. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic, even for 1973. The Soylent Green manufactures, the futuristic apartments and above all the "scoops" (bulldozers that get rid of people) were excellent. The polluted air on the outside looks disgusting and very bad. The empty streets of the city full of putrid and disturbing people are very disturbing. <br /> <br /> A final note is the ending, which still still shocked me. It's creepy, but if you think about it, it's a good idea. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: <br /> <br /> An excellent science fiction movie from the 70s that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uncomfortable.
