A very promising directorial debut for Bill Paxton. A very dark / who-really-made-recommended thriller by Stephen King. This is a strong and well-conceived horror story about a devout, but demented man in Thurman, Texas, who makes a murderous binge after receiving orders from God to eliminate the demons that seek to control humanity. A couple of twists and a disturbing ending make your money worth. Most of the violence you don't really see, but still enough to double your stomach. <br /> <br /> Director Paxton plays the twisted man to be known as the hand of God Killer. Matthew McConaughey is equally impressive as the demented man's eldest son who ends up telling this story to an FBI agent in Dallas (Powers Boothe). Boothe, as always, is solid and impeccable. Knuckler white suspense! Highly recommended.
