The Color Purple speaks of the struggles of life and of love that helps those people strongly affected by the struggles of life. Each character had a purple element in them. The film touches love, loss, hope, hatred and triumph. if Celie has lived hell and lost her sister, and Shug is back in his life to show his love again, Albert is not the man who is correcting his wrong towards Celie, Shug shunned by his father and he confesses, in the end, Sofia and his good and bad stubbornness, and also Nettie, have had their emptiness and their difficulties in the film, but in the end they have been overcome and this is the sign of a good film. Good job to all the cast and crew.
