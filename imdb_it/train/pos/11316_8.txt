(Some spoilers) I haven't read the novel by James M. Cain ("The Postman Always Rings Twice") on which this film was based, so I can't compare this film version with it, but I've seen and love the American version of the 1946 (also entitled `Postman '). <br /> <br /> Even better is this gem from Italy, which, as I read, was "mutilated" in editing due to too many brazen references to the fascist regime. Well, doesn't it matter? what remains is a beautiful piece of cinema, apparently the precursor of the neorealist movement in cinema. You can certainly see why ?? despite the hard work of editing has gone on, there remains a pervasive sense of social and cultural oppression, as well as personal oppression, which hangs over the protagonists, who therefore have to face many limits in life. <br /> <br /> We consider Gino, the young tramp, not well educated, unemployed, and resorting to storing, stealing and defrauding people to get by, his only pair of shoes so worn out as to be practically useless. <br /> <br /> In Giovanna, he sees a way out, but he should have moved on, as Giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage with an older man with some money, his job ( working at the restaurant for her husband, slapping behind the counter and in the kitchen), and her sex In the past she had limited options and had decided to still marry the owner of the restaurant / service station (Giuseppe Bregana, played by Juan de Landa), knowing that he would not make her happy. He tells Gino that he feels ill every time Bregana touches her. <br /> <br /> Under the pretext of helping Bregana fix his car and send him to the village to buy a necessary part (which he actually pocketed), Gino wins the favor of Bregana (also promising to adjust the pump of 'broken water, water that symbolizes life, or lack thereof) and remains alone with Giovanna. They immediately begin a passionate but passionate romantic relationship. <br /> <br /> Gino soon feels suffocated by the relationship, and feels the need to go on again when Giovanna proposes to dispose of her husband. Gino, not wanting to be part of it, leaves the city for a train journey he cannot afford, kindly paid for by another type of gypsy called Spagnolo, another passenger on the train. For Gino, Spagnolo represents a kind of freedom, and they become friends (Spanish also symbolizes the morality and conscience of Gino), traveling and finding work together in a carnival. Finally Gino has a stable job. To his dismay (he has not yet overcome his love for Giovanna), a month has passed when Bregana and his wife go to the carnival and Bregana convinces Gino to go "home" to live and work with them again, since he is at have fingertips around. <br /> <br /> Too weak to resist, knowing that this will bring him and Giovanna together, Gino agrees and returns to being with the couple. After a while he surrenders to Gina's requests to get rid of her husband. Once the bad deed is accomplished, Giovanna becomes more cold-blooded than ever, seeming to have very little conscience, while guilt and shame devour Gino for hurting a man who never hurt him. How long do you want to leave her ?? he does it again briefly, they are now inextricably linked and have to face the consequences. <br /> <br /> Did I like the way the Spanish character came back into Gino's life to serve as judge of his misdeeds ?? it was very beautiful and interesting, adding another dimension to the story. <br /> <br /> While the American version of '46 with Lana Turner and John Garfield is lost a bit in a quagmire of peripheral characters, especially policemen and lawyers, Ossessione is right to focus much more on the effects psychological crime only on lovers. This gives the final result even more power, and makes a powerful affirmation reinforcing the impotence inherent in the society in which the characters must live. <br /> <br /> A small quirk: the amount of time (almost nothing) that elapses before immortal love is pronounced by lovers, how quickly they kill the husband (there is no first failed attempt as in the American version ); Gino's relationship with the dancer / actress very quick to escalate ?? they also profess their love quickly, and she is willing to risk a lot for a man she has just met! ?? all rather unrealistic, isn't it? I found this problem with the time frame quite distracting ?? made me think I must have lost something somewhere. Otherwise, it is worth the viewer's time. Both acting and directing were uniformly good. Recommended.
