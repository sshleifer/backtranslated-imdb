A very high level Columbo story, which was actually the first episode of the long series, but was initially broadcast second (after "Murder By The Book"). Robert Culp makes his first of three appearances as a series killer and plays the owner of a private detective agency, which blackmails his wife (Patricia Crowley) of a rich and highly influential businessman (interpreted very sympathetically by Ray Milland) after falsifying a report, in his favor, after it was discovered that he was having an affair. The wife later rebels against the blackmail scheme but is killed in a fit of rage .... <br /> <br /> A very satisfying episode in many respects, in particular because the plot is so strongly set and subsequently developed and also because of the rare ingredient of Columbo that the crime is an unpremeditated murder. Everything is further improved when the widowed husband uses the murderer to help Columbo in his investigations: a feature that facilitates numerous good quality scenes, particularly in the first sequence when the three central characters meet and the crucial qualities of Columbo are wonderfully in evidence. <br /> <br /> Directed with style by Bernard L. Kowalski and interpreted appropriately, he set the tone for the whole series (since "Murder By the Book" was disappointed by a poor finish). The screenplay by the creators of Columbo, Richard Levinson and William Link, is precise, well structured and well thought out and is supported by a constant and productive rhythm and significant sequences that really show the unpredictability of the story. Ultimately, the ending perfectly sums up that Columbo has always been a step ahead of the murderer. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great investigative work for Columbo, and strongly suggests that the production team worked positively and constructively to make a refined story about Columbo.
