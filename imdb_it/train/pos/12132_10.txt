Funny despite the performance of Leslie Howard. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a flat and uninteresting character. One should feel sorry for this man; however, I find myself cheering for Mildred of Bette Davis. Ms. Davis offers her best performances (she received an Oscar nomination). Thanks to his performance, he brings this boring movie to life. ** Make sure you don't miss out when Mildred tells Philip exactly how he feels about him.
