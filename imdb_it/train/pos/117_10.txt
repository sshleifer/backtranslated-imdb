Lars von Trier's Europe is an echo worthy of The Third Man, an American who arrives in post-World War II Europe and finds himself caught up in a dangerous mystery. Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler, a German-American who refused to join the United States army during the war, arrives in Frankfurt as soon as the war ended up working with his uncle as a wagon-sleeper on the Zentropa . What he does not know is that the war still continues secretly with an underground terrorist group called the werewolves that target the American allies. Leopold is strongly opposed to taking any position, but he is attracted and seduced by Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the femme fatale daughter of the railway company owner. His father was a Nazi sympathizer, but he is forgiven by American Colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) because he can help make the German transport system work again. The colonel soon enlisted, or forced, Leopold to be a spy (without giving him a choice or a chance to think about it) to see if the werewolves could perform attacks on the trains. <br /> <br /> Soon, Leopold is stuck in an adventure being involved on both sides of the conflict in a mysterious way and film noir, where everyone and everything is not what it seems. It is incredible to see the naive Leopold face everything (his lover, the terrorists, the colonel, the annoying passengers, his unhappy uncle, even the officials of the railway company who come to examine his work ethic) before finally turning up with control humor and violence. The film is infinitely unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The film shot with style, always takes place at night during the winter with a lot of falling snow. His shot in black and white with strokes of color that appear randomly in all. Also, background screens that show images that contrast with foreground images. Add the hypnotic narrative of Max von Sydow and Europa becomes a dreamlike place out of the world. <br /> <br /> This is now a favorite movie of mine.
