Very rarely one encounters an independent comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross Eyed is a rare gem. The screenwriter director has not only faced the challenge of directing his work, but offers an exhilarating performance as an evil roommate. The script offers an interesting look not only at the drama of the struggling writer, but mixes up so much comedy in the desolate world of the writer that you can't help but engage with Ernie as a character. Very funny stuff. Despite the small budget, Adam Jones manages to give the film a serious look. Don't mess around when it comes to making a good movie. I can't wait to see what comes out later. This guy can make people laugh and think; it is special
