"Match Point" and now "Scoop" have both convinced me that not only is Woody Allen doing a clean job making films in England (and that Scarlett Johansson is the right cast member), but has confirmed what I've known for years: he shouldn't have focused on neurotics rich in New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson plays the journalism student Sondra Pransky, which the magician Sid Waterman (Allen) puts in his missing box, where he meets the ghost of the murdered reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), who tells her that the serial kills they have distressed London were committed by the millionaire Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). So, you know him and ... well, I don't know how much I can tell you without giving it away. But I can say that this is probably Allen's most entertaining film in years. There is his omnipresent style of unique humor (especially the line on his religion). <br /> <br /> So you will surely like this movie. If nothing else, it will make you fall in love with London. But above all, it's so damn funny. Even if you don't like Woody Allen, you have to love this.
