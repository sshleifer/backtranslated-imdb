There are 21 comments while I add mine to this list and there is hardly a critique. This is because this film is fantastic entertainment and has a bit of everything. <br /> <br /> It may be a little scary for younger children, but my 15-year-old son thought it was fantastic in every aspect, for humor and also for the beautiful musical score. <br /> <br /> I only buy DVDs when I know they will be watched regularly and now that this is finally available in the UK, I will definitely add it to my collection.
