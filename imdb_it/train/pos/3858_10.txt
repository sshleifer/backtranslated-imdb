Director Paul Verhoeven's American vehicles are of varying quality, but most of the films he made in his hometown are indisputable masterpieces. This is the story of the alcoholic (and bisexual) writer who moves into a beautiful rich and very strange woman. But the woman does not know that she is only interested in meeting the beautiful male lover of the woman. Meanwhile, the writer is tormented by strange visions - initially they seem to be hallucinations triggered by alcohol abuse, but soon he begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some sort of premonition. Fascinating Hitchcockian thriller, very original and provocative. I love movies that make you think they are something, but then you realize that it's something completely different. This is one of those movies; a thriller during the first half and an almost religious surrealist saga during the second half. Very erotic, original and blasphemous, not for children or people who go to church every Sunday. Great photograph of the future director Jan de Bont. Highly recommended!
