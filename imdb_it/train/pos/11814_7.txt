Usually, when we use the word "evasion", we mean it negatively; Warren Beatty's big screen version of "Dick Tracy" shows that "escape" can be good. This is really a funny movie. As the eponymous character with the yellow title and without fear, Beatty creates a detective to whom we can all refer: ready for action, but not without his weaknesses. <br /> <br /> From there, the rest of the characters are almost a world of their own. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is as charming as one would expect any crime fighter's husband to be; Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) is probably the most disconcerting person imaginable; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is the average villain: ruthless but cool. Other characters include Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), the over-musical 88 Keys (Mandy Patinkin) and The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Even Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates act. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait a minute. I didn't even explain the plot! The plot involves Tracy trying - and so far fails - to find a way to capture Big Boy. At the same time, some very bizarre events have taken place in the city, the answers to which may or may not be close to what everyone thinks. <br /> <br /> Of course, the main thing about this film is that it's fun to watch. If Warren Beatty had had trouble behaving with his age, he made good use of it here. "Dick Tracy" is a good film.
