Writer / director Henry Brommel has done a great job with his film, "Panico", since 2000, and this includes the cast's choice: William H. Macy, Tracy Ullman, John Ritter, Neve Campbell, Donald Sutherland, Barbara Bain , David Dorfman. Brommel has hired Ullman and Ritter in very unpleasant roles, and unusual casting is a positive change from what we normally see. <br /> <br /> "Panic" is the story of a hit man, Alex (Macy) who actually works for his father (Sutherland). He covers his true profession by doing correspondence work; from all appearances, he and his wife (Ullman) and their son Sammy (Dorfman) are a typical suburban family. Dissatisfied with his life, Alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist (Ritter), who tells only his mother (Bain). In the waiting room, he meets a young woman (Campbell) to whom he is immediately attracted, which further complicates his situation. His mother interrupts his promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist. When Alex receives his next assignment, he discovers that he must kill his psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> This is a deep story of a kind and good man turned into a murderer by a monster of a father, with his mother acquainted, who kills to please his father but also can't resist and stop him. His anger is so deeply rooted that he has lost emotional attachment to everyone and everything except his son - and it is finally his son who wakes him from an almost permanent repression. When it's time for "Panic" to move, it does - quickly. <br /> <br /> "Panic" doesn't seem to panic at all. In reality, it moves very slowly. But it moves slowly, not because it's hurt - slowness is deliberate, slowly reflecting Alex's psyche coming out of the fog. Making a decision about Sara, the character of Campbell, and seeing his brand, his own psychiatrist, as a living and breathing human being, Alex starts to establish the connections between what he does and who he is - and how they don't do it jive. And the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche, that of Sammy. <br /> <br /> William Macy offers another brilliant interpretation, as a loving father, a distant husband and a cold killer, the son of two monsters who cared nothing for his feelings or desires, a man who finally he realizes he has to get on the plate or repeat the cycle. <br /> <br /> This is not the kind of drama that sounds good in a cinema. He's too adult, too small, too thin, too inspired by the characters and too good.
