Several features of this film date it immediately. The sound is quite acute and we realize the great strides made in sound reproduction in the following years. The language of the dialogue is rather characteristic and unnatural and the recitation still remembers its passage from the scene techniques. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis always gives a strong interpretation in all her films as she does in this first period of her highly successful career. However, I feel that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression. I think it's the alleged cockney accent that doesn't sound real to me. <br /> <br /> Somerset Maughan loves to deepen human relationships of great dramatic intensity that will satisfy all spectators. As in many of his character roles, Bette Davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman to a fire-hated viper. Leslie Howard is well established as an English artist, with a foot striving desperately for a partner and a bad choice in an intriguing little waitress. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film the young doctor meets his true love on a busy street. They cross the traffic completely unaware of a multitude of horns and whistles screaming at them. This scene is probably meant to be fun, but I find it rather ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film. It's probably interpreted to send you home with a smile on your face. And basically, as far as we can see (and hope), it's a happy ending.
