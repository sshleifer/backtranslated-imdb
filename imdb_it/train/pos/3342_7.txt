If you like romantic comedies, then you will find this story of two 30-year-old singles who fall in love during the American League pennant race. On the other hand, if you are around waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, you should probably stay away. The plot contains the obligatory boy meets the girl's friends, the girl meets the boy's friends, and the boy meets the scenes of the girl's parents. There is also a boy who meets the pet dog scene. That's all for the course in a movie like this. However, what I liked is that the plot has deepened the decision making process that people do as they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is actually a bit bizarre. The plot revolves around the answer to the questions; How much eccentricity is too much and how much passion does it take to win those oddities? It is interesting to see that the characters understand this because after all (if we admit it) we all have oddities. Barrymore does a great job in his role and Fallon surprised me, he's good too. I consider it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. Add a point if you are a baseball fan or romantically involved with one. Add another point if you are a Red Sox fan and subtract two points if you are a Yankees fan.
