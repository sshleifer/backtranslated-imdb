The acting in this film was superb, but mixed with the truth about the condition of many Africans in South Africa it made her heart aching. It was nice that the writer isolated Boesman and Lena from the others who ran away from their homes, so that they could fully share their triumphs and defeats; the conflicts they shared as they grew together and separated. It is worth seeing when the film fits into its proper context.
