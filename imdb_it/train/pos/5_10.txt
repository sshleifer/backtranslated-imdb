I got into the middle of this movie so I had no idea of ​​credits or even of his title until I looked at it here, where I see that he received a mixed reception from your commentators. I am optimistic about this film, but one thing caught my attention as I watched: the beautiful and delicate soundtrack written in American Copland-style. My surprise was great when I discovered that the score was written by none other than John Williams himself. It is true that he wrote sensitive and moving scores like Schindler's List, but generally associates his name with such bombasticity as Star Wars. But in my opinion what Williams wrote for this film goes beyond anything he has ever heard of tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, fully in line with the tender and beautiful plot of the film. And another of his recent albums, for Catch Me If You Can, shows even more intelligence and refinement. As for Stanley and Iris, I like educational films like How Green was my Valley and Konrack, the one with John Voigt and his young African Americans in South Carolina, and Danny deVito's Renaissance Man, etc. They tell a necessary story of intellectual and spiritual awakening, a story that cannot be told often enough. This is an excellent addition to that genre.
