I saw the new version redeployed and modified yesterday and I loved it. Then I went home to watch it with subtitles and I loved it. I'm ready to watch it again. <br /> <br /> I am a sucker for the mild secret identity and what could be milder than a pacifist librarian? The scenes in which he reveals his super powers to his friends or absently forget about being meek are my favorites. <br /> <br /> Of course martial arts are great. There's really not much I can say about them if you're familiar with the HK style. However, if you're not ... we briefly stopped playing and Walker, Texas Ranger was on. We noticed that after each strike there was a cut. Not in Black Mask. <br /> <br />
