Starlift is a pleasant and interesting return to those musical photos that all the stars have staged during the years of the Second World War. When you have stars like Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae and Randolph Scott, etc., in the film and with people like the Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn supply the music, it's a film that's easy to shoot . And the plot is not even a hindrance. <br /> <br /> What is the plot involving two men enlisted Air Force, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy, who try to meet the star of the Warner Brothers, Janice Rule, using as a gimmick the fact both come from Youngstown, Ohio, and Hagerthy's father was Rule's dentist and half of the city. The scheme works too well because Louella Parsons is putting them early as an object in her column. Yes, even Louella is in the film. She must have wanted Warner Brothers or Jack Warner to address her more than the other studio bosses because she also used this studio to advertise her Hollywood Hotel radio program later in the day. <br /> <br /> But the rest of the plot also touched on the real life efforts of Ruth Roman, also playing herself in her studio and others to perform military air force bases for soldiers and women who they go to Korea. Some of the names I mentioned and others sing and perform in a show at the base of Travis Air Force, where a lot of this film was shot. <br /> <br /> A special issue was shot for the talents of Phil Harris who sings / tells a ballad Look Out Stranger, is a Texas Ranger helped and assisted by Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yes, Cooper looked like he was having a great time making his image. <br /> <br /> This is the oldest of the clich√©s when you say they don't make them that way anymore, but in reality they don't because you don't have a studio system that has all this talent under contract. This is something of the death of the old study system that we can cry.
