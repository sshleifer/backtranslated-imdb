Story of four teenage girls growing up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the most balanced of the group - but wants to leave her home where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and is beaten by her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has overprotective parents. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks he is more mature than all the others. <br /> <br /> It's nothing new from what we've seen many times before - but this has a big difference - it's accurate. I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I first saw the film) and was surprised at how realistic it was. They completely blocked dialogue, clothes and attitudes. Even the main song of the film ("On the Radio" by Donna Summer) was a great success before it came out. This film struck me more than any other teenage movie of the time because I could understand and relate to the characters. I knew girls in high school who were just like that! The film is (obviously) dated but captures a time that we will never see again. <br /> <br /> Acting is good on all fronts, with Foster offering the best performance. The relationship between her and Kellerman (which was excellent) was realistic and well done. Even Scott Baio (who has a small role as a friend of the girls) has more or less realistically portrayed a teenage boy. <br /> <br /> A very beautiful film - essential vision if you came of age in 1980. The film has a well-deserved R score (full of drugs and bad words), but should be seen by all teenagers. I give him an 8.
