This is the compelling, fascinating, tragic story. Fairly good, and for the most part fairly accurate, considering it's a TV movie rather than a documentary. They created imaginary characters and brought together different real people into one character, but otherwise it's a good story about a very tragic and obscure story. <br /> <br /> The last moments of the film, which represent mass suicide / murder, are almost directly taken from an audio recording made by Jim Jones. This recording was made during the last 44 minutes of the existence of the People's Temple. It is available in several places on the Internet. This part of the film is almost apt in this regard. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this is not a documentary. However, it covers most of the basic elements of the history of the People's Temple.
