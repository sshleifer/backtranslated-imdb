Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are an excellent couple and they show it with their unique charisma in this film. <br /> <br /> This is the typical alternative or indie film with a plot that presents a rare situation that suddenly becomes really important. <br /> <br /> Pecker is an average guy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to photograph the exotic inhabitants of the small town where he lives. Suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his works and hires him to exhibit his works at major festivals and much more. <br /> <br /> But Pecker's life changes drastically, because now luck and fame seem to infuriate the people of the city who are Pecker's main source of inspiration. Even her sexy girlfriend gets angry because now she doesn't pay "adequate" attention to her. <br /> <br /> Well, this is an independent film with an advantage but not for everyone. It may seem boring or pretentious to some people, but I think it's worth being a watch just because it offers something "different" from typical Hollywood standards. <br /> <br /> To describe in a few words: This is the typical Christina Film Ricci and John Waters. That's all. <br /> <br /> Oh and I almost forgot to mention that the "Full of Grace" lines are really annoying. Damn.
