This is a great game! Okay, maybe he didn't have some of the features he should have had, but Digital Anvil still produced a good game. There is a certain resemblance to the Elite (you can trade, collect weapons and load destroyed ships, go on a mission), however this game presents a heavily written mission. It is a great mission. The control system is different, use the mouse! In practice, fly your spaceship around a system and make your way! The game has pretty good graphics even though it was released in 2003. It should also work well on a PC with modest detail. The plot features some great voiceovers of John Rhys Davies, George Takei, Jennifer Hale (featured in every computer game). Stay true to the story that gets better and better. There is also a competition section, where you and an opponent have to race with your spaceships around a path (it involves you as you walk the rings). This section took a while to beat. Adds variety to the game. Some sections are a bit difficult here and there, but overall you can beat this game. The game has a mod scene active on the network. Choose some changes to extend the game. I haven't played any of the mods yet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a sequel to this has been canceled, a real pity!
