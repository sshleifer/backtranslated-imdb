Initially, I had heard of TEARS OF KALI and it sounded like something I was going to do, but with all the movies I entered regularly, it fell off my radar. While wandering around the local WonderBook ... I found the box for this and grabbed it. I must say that I am quite happy to have done so. TEARS OF KALI is a strange, bloody, sometimes even gruesome film that is somewhat limited by its obviously low budget - but it is still a fun and useful watch. <br /> <br /> KALI TEARS focuses on the imagery based on India Taylor-Erikkson cult group, which practices meditation and other rituals in the quest to confront and banish the "inner demons" of the individual - but apparently these techniques work too well or not well enough (depending on the point of view ...) how dark the forces are not only exorcised, but also unleashed on unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> The film is told in "anthological style", with a short but memorable introduction sequence and "that opens the eyes", to then proceed in the three stories that make up most of the film. <br /> <br /> The first (SHAKTI) is about a journalist visiting one of the members of the sect who is in a psychiatric hospital. The journalist is undercover of wanting to research the cult of Taylor-Erikkson, but we discover that his real motives could hit him a little closer to home. When the interview takes a violent turn, the journalist discovers that he may have passed his head ... <br /> <br /> The second part (Devi) concerns a violent young man who is sentenced to psychological rehabilitation in place of him of a prison sentence for beating a young man in a coma. We find that the attending physician in question is actually a "pupil" of Taylor-Erikkson, and his rehabilitation methods are far from the norm ... <br /> <br /> The closing story (KALI) revolves around a charlatan "faith" Healer "and his assistant performing" miracles "for a fee. When the healer unintentionally helps one of his clients and actually expels a force that had possessed it, the demon is now free to roam and look for a new guest ... <br /> <br /> I must say that I really liked KALI MONEY.There are some flaws with the film that prevent it from being really excellent - but it is an original and ambitious film for what it is. My biggest complaint with production is the dubbed poor and uninspired dialogue The dubbing is under par and I would have much rather had an option subtitled with the original language track. Some reviewers said that the acting is poor, which are not necessary mind in agreement. I think the dubbing is so lackluster that it makes performances difficult, which is not really the case. In fact, some of the performances are pretty damn chilling (the "doctor" in the second segment, and the "client" in the third readily comes to mind ...) and remarkable. FX gores are very well made for a low-budget film, with some graphic scenes of removing eyelids using cuticle scissors, a suicide with a pencil in the throat, a decent car (but irritatingly "shaking") -faring, and some others goodies thrown in good measure. Not as crude as some of the more "extreme" films, but definitely stronger than your horror media. I also found the story about the cult group to be intriguing and a welcome change to the absurdities typical of the history of horror. There are many scenes of authentic atmosphere and tension, things like that I haven't encountered in a while. Although imperfect in some fundamental aspects, I still think that KALI TEARS appeals to most "underground" horror viewers - some scenes may prove too much for the more mainstream audience. Definitely recommended - 8.5 / 10
