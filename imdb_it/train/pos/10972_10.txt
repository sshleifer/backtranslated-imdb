I've only seen it recently, but I've been aware of it for several years and I've always been fascinated by the title. Now it belongs to me as one of my favorite movies. It is difficult to describe the incredible topic discovered by the Maysles, but everything in it works wonderfully. It has so many memorable images and moments when you feel that you are invading a very private world. I fell in love with this film and the characters it contains. It is as if the directors had enchanted the audience and dragged us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be away from it all, cooking my cob on my bedside table. He has an air of sadness that permeates everywhere. A fall from greatness for this family once estimated. The money was gone, but their arias and graces remained, as did their beauty. It attracted me from the first frame and, long after the end of the film, I found myself thinking about their destiny. I wondered if, while walking along East Hampton beach, I could still hear the voice of Old Edie during the night and see the outline of little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick climbing. Unforgettable.
