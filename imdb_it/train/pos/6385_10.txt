This movie was awesome! It was an excellent interpretation of an ancient myth. The entertainment was a bit odd, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie without singing. <br /> <br /> The background animation was magical. It was a different level of work for Disney. Some of the characters were a little square, but it was more than compensated for by the beauty and luxuriance of the scenery. The music was largely instrumental but was perfect for the film. This was definitely not a movie that needed the characters to go into the song. <br /> <br /> Perfect. 10 out of 10.
