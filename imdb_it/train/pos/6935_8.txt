James Stewart is the protagonist of a classic western story of revenge that binds to the fate of the films of other stars of the Winchester Rifle. Stewart is undoubtedly excellent, adding a bit of a cold obsession to his usual relaxed cowboy. The story follows the fate of a Winchester rifle and its owners after being won in a competition by our hero and stolen by the man he is hunting. <br /> <br /> We meet a selection of gamblers, gunslingers, Indian merchants and bank robberies as we follow the rifle route through Indian battles, bank shots, etc. The supporting cast is all solid with Dan Durya who stands out as Waco Johnny Dean, the gunslinger with cored wire with an itchy trigger. Also, as a curiosity, it is a very first appearance by Rock Hudson as an Indian chief. <br /> <br /> The final battle is a classic full-time battle of rifles fought long-range in a rocky outcrop. Throw in good old western action, punching fights, shootings and horse pursuits for a fun western adventure. 8/10
