When the Grinch came out I was excited, although I thought it would be a lucky movie and fortunately. Even though he had a little nightmare before Christmas, it's up to him. You know a little dark and ghostly. I loved this movie because it helped fill people with Christmas spirit. So for the most part the Grinch saved Christmas. And what happened then well to Whoville say that the Grinch's little heart grew three dimensions that day. GOOD GRINCHMAS!
