Why didn't the producers give this show a chance of all the junk on TV, because the producers didn't give Six Degrees a chance? Will the series go on video? I'd like to see how it ends. Put the first season on video and sell it. I was a loyal fan of Six Degrees and waited for his return. I set up my recorder to record all the shows on tape. Thank God for that. I just found out that the show has been canceled and my heart is broken. I would like to know that it would have been canceled, why didn't they tell us? I thought the show was only developing some depth in the characters. The writing was also quite good. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my all-time favorite. I'm so sorry to see him go!
