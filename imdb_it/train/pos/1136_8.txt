I'm not sure this comment contains a real spoiler, but I'm playing it safe, so don't read this if you haven't seen the movie. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, and so does everyone I work with - and that's the point. I spent most of my working life at the cinema, without being an actor. These people are the heroes of this film: electricians, shooters, directors, lighters and writers, costumes, etc., and everything else is told from their point of view, at least for a large extension. Most of the actors are crazy and completely absorbed to the point of being absurd, which is what this movie manages to find so well, but you must have worked with the actors to recognize that this film is a real-life drama! Possible spoiler alarm: in a big scene, the two protagonists, both actors, are "discussing" on "discus_ something personal, something completely out-of-script", with another actor, and begin to invent lines, to try them and criticize the performance of each one. <br /> <br /> Since this film appeared, what it was, '91, it has become fashionable to do so, especially on TV. But almost nobody did it so well.
