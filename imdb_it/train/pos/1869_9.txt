Antwone Fisher's story of neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all of us who have witnessed or even experienced the situation of foster children. Abandoned by a mother in difficulty, Antwone never met her father. Growing up with "pedophiles" who use the "n-word" not only to intimidate and hurt but also as a pet name, as a young witness of how his best friend is killed in a robber, lasting racist insults and is teased while serving in the Navy, Antwone's anger slowly turns into positive power when advised by a Navy psychiatrist, and a love enters his life. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Antwone meets his mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film. Stunned by the unexpected clash, the woman listens in silence to hear the young man tell her how he lived a life without criminality, drug addictions, father of children on the right and left, despite his absolutely adverse circumstances. <br /> <br /> If that scene were not powerful enough, the next one would take it home (and it will open the flood doors): a reception to welcome the Antwone home; dozens of smiling faces and open arms announcing that HE is part of this great family. <br /> <br /> One of the messages of this wonderful film is that there are many well-intentioned and sincere people who work to help orphans and unwanted children. Even though some of the houses and administrators don't seem to care and seem self-serving , many give their all. The character who found Antwone's "file" once he revealed the circumstances of his birth is one of those "bright lights" in the darkness of the system. <br /> <br /> The DVD includes a song in French, various subtitle options, as well as additional features and information on adoptive parenting. <br /> <br /> Like Clevelander I enjoyed the location movie. No matter where you come from, you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical gem.
