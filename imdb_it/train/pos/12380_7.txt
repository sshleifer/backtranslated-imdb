New York model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) rents a room in an old brownstone where she meets some strange neighbors and experiences some gruesome hallucinations. While the lawyer's fiancÃ© Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) asks questions in his name, he strives to maintain his sanity (not to mention his will to live) because his experiences have an impact on his physical, mental and health. emotional. /> <br /> I don't want to spoil the best moments in this psychological horror film for those not familiar with it. The story is interesting and fun, but the film doesn't offer much in terms of real fear. Or, for that matter, any atmosphere. It's kind of silently sinister, but it's not like the traditional horror movie. It is more a story about the attempts of a woman in difficulty to face the growing unreality of her life. At that level it works, but it's not powerful enough. <br /> <br /> What "The Sentinel" * does * offers are some scenic elements that attract attention (in particular, the fascinating and fabulously creepy climax, and there is a scene with Beverly D'Angelo who must be seen to be believed). There is also some blood to see, but not much. A threatening soundtrack by Gil Melle adds to the threat. <br /> <br /> No review of this film would be complete without an assessment for filmmakers in bringing together such excellent actors for its ensemble cast. Some of them can't do too much, but seeing them all together is awesome. Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith make the biggest impressions as, respectively, a hard-nosed detective and a caring neighbor. Other legendary names include Jose Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy and Ava Gardner. Future stars such as D'Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum make short appearances, and other familiar faces include Jerry Orbach, Sylvia Miles, William Hickey and Martin Balsam. Whoever was the casting director of this film deserves a kind of prize. <br /> <br /> Written for the screen by director Michael Winner, probably best known for the "Death Wish" series he did with Charles Bronson, from the novel by Jeffrey Konvitz. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't consider it a true horror thriller, but it has its moments and is reasonably fun. <br /> <br /> 7/10
