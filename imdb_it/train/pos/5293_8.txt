This is a very light comedy about a wonderful family that has a son named Pecker because he used to peck his food. Pecker loves taking pictures of all kinds of people in a small suburb of Baltimore, Maryland, and he captures the attention of a group of lovers of artistic photos from New York. Pecker has a cute sister who simply goes crazy for SUGAR and is actually an ADDICT, taking spoons of sugar from a bag. There are scenes of men showing lumps in their jockey with movements and girls who do almost the same thing. It's pretty hard to keep the mind out of the sewer with this movie, but who cares, it's just a movie to make you laugh about a simple photo taken in 1998.
