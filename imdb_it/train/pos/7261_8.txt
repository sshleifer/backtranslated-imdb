I totally disagree with "ctomvelu" about Jim Belushi's talent. I really liked Belushi. Of course, I was skeptical when he first appeared on the scene, because I was a big fan of his late brother John. But Jim has a charm on the screen that has taken him very far - and he has developed it well over the years. <br /> <br /> Curly Sue is one of his first films - its weight is a tribute (isn't it true for most of us?) - and I like the film. Yes, it is touching and moving, so if you like car chases, explosions and free sex, then you might want to pass this - it's a hot movie of three lost soles lying around each other. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the three keys mentioned above for a successful film, but I also like a beautiful and solid story like this. <br /> <br /> And although Belushi and Kelly Lynch offer excellent performances, the real star of this film is Alisan Porter - which is absolutely adorable. <br /> <br /> I don't know what happened to his career, but who is responsible for the ball drop (agent? parents??) should be shot. You could not ask for an introduction to the most perfect fame of that of the film, yet since then nothing interesting has been heard. <br /> <br /> Another sad Hollywood story ...
