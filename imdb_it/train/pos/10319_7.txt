Having read many of the other reviews for this film on IMDb, there is apparently a consensus among purists that this film is not like the books on which it is based. On this point I cannot comment, having never actually read any of the adventures of the protagonists previously. However, what I can say with certainty is that it strikes me that many of the aforementioned reviewers must surely have suffered a sense of humor; Let's be honest here - this movie is so fun! <br /> <br /> OK ?? .. so I have to admit that the film apparently is not representative of the character (s), but let's put it in a clear perspective ?? .. the same individuals who are worried about this film also complain that the classic Batman series of the '60s does not remain faithful to the original character of the DC comics? Or maybe there is STILL discontent in the same people that the 1980 film version of Flash Gordon was too far from the original series? <br /> <br /> The point is, yes, this film is incredibly camp but that's precisely its charm! <br /> <br /> The former Tarzan, Ron Ely plays the eponymous hero of this (and looks more like a Gary Busey resemblance to boot!) and is backed by a very supportive cast that everyone seems to be having a ball with their respective roles. He also looks for a very brief but very welcome appearance by the favorite of the horror film Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> The best scene? Too many to choose from, but take a look at the hilarious facial expressions taken by the waiter, when Savage and his men commit the last gaffe to order coke, lemonade and milk on a formal occasion! Even the scene often noted towards the end of the film in which Savage confronts his enemy Captain Seas using various martial arts disciplines that are labeled on the screen! ?? Priceless! <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the film does not take itself seriously and is even more fun. Great fun from start to finish! (and you will sing the acronym adapted by John Phillip Sousa for the following guaranteed days!)
