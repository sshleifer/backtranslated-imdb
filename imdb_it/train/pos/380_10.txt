Taking a break from his run to escape in the early 1980s, Steven Spielberg directed Whoopi Goldberg in an adaptation of "The Color Purple" by Alice Walker, on the desperate existence of an African American woman in the 1930s. Watching Goldberg play Celie, it's incredible that this is the same woman who starred in films like "Sister Act". This is the kind of film that could easily be - no, make this SHOULD BE - part of the curriculum in Black Studies and Women's Studies. There is a scene that could be the most magnificent editing work ever on the screen (you'll know when you see it). I can't believe this didn't win a single Oscar; it could be Spielberg's second best film behind "Schindler's List" (maybe even linked to it). Also starring Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia and Laurence Fishburne.
