I found the only comment on this film completely non-informative and completely too hard, so I decided to write my own. I saw this movie for the first time when it came out and I captured it a couple of times since then. First of all let me say that, on the whole, the things that this movie gets RIGHT is what makes it useful. Never mind that it has some low budget oddities and other flaws. Worth watching. The idea of ​​basing a film on Walt Whitman's visit to a narrow and restricted Anglo-Canadian community in southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant scene of mis-en-scene. The film is about the kind of humanizing catalyst that Whitman inspired in people. And in this sense it is exactly precise. The acting - in particular from Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as a doctor - is very good. The script and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the customs and inflections of the time. Overall, what's wrong? Also, to name another film in which Whitman is brought to life so vividly?
