I know a lot of people have a special fondness for Alistair Sim's version of Dickens' story, but for me this 1984 version is the one to beat. My wife and I own a copy of this movie on VHS and we watch it together every Christmas Eve. I often observe that we could also see it on Halloween, because it is a very creepy ghost story. <br /> <br /> Scott - typecast as Scrooge - is terribly bad and bad, making his transformation even more miraculous and moving. I think he's up there with his performance on Patton. The spirits are all effective, each one scarier than the last. Observing the dark, fluctuating and skeletal form of the Christmas Spirit that isn't there yet sends me chills down my spine every year. And what a supporting cast! David Warner, in particular, is in excellent shape as Bob Cratchit, as is Susannah York as his wife. <br /> <br /> I seem to remember that this version is closer to the original story than most others - but I could be wrong, since several years have passed since I read it. Regardless, this is a fantastic Christmas classic.
