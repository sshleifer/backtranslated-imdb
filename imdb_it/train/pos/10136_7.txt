This is one of the best episodes of the second season of MOH, I think Mick Garris has a problem with women ... He kills everyone, they are often the victims (Screwfly solution, Pro-life, Valerie on the stairs, I don't remember the episode of Silver in season 1, etc., Obviously Imprint). I think he likes to see women burn, torture, mutilate and I don't know. No less important "Right to die" is one of the best, with good curves and graphic and suspense scenes (especially with photos from the cellular scene, wonderful). Acting is like the whole series, normal I could be the worst of "Pro-life" or "We shout for Ice cream". I also think the plot can be made for a movie and not just for an episode. The ideology of the series is horrible, killing and ending women, mutilating animals and so on ... the first season was better than the second with episodes like "Cigarrette ustionati" (Best of all), "Homecoming" (Il more fun), "Imprint" (really shocking).
