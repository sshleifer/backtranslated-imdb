I saw this film in 2005 at the Palm Springs International Festival and of the 14 films I saw I would rate them in 4th place. The 900+ theater was full and eventually received a standing ovation. This was the classic Peter Falk if you are a Falk fan and you showed a lot of confusion between the characters of Peter Falk and Paul Reiser. The title of the film seemed too long and it seemed strange to me. I'm surprised he wasn't released in general. This was far better than most of the junk that the major studios have sent you. Perhaps too grown up as it was aimed at the baby boomers and the elderly public. A lot of people could relate to situations in this film. Probably this will enjoy a revival of different years from now, when people watch this movie and consider it a kind of jewel. I would rate this 8.0-8.5 on a scale of 10 and I would definitely recommend it.
