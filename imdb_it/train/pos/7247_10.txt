Robert Jannuci, Luca Venantini, Venantino Venantini, Alicia Moro (two stars come from CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD (I wonder what Luca is doing these days, probably a lawyer or something like Bela Lugosi Jr. or David Hennessey, a child of dark shadows who wanted to forget the dark shadows existed) In any case, in the video Thorn EMI there is no music on the credits ... but the music is fantastic once you enter ... with the Italian films the films do not they are as good as the music ... my favorite scene is with the guy with the robotic arm that follows the lonely Alien through the desert. Alien says why you follow me. Tommy answers because I feel so ... Alien responds which way you're headed Tommy says West, then Alien says well, I'm going east, so after a bit of walking, the theme playing in the background, Alien looks up and sees Tommy sitting on a rock caressing a pet hamster. .. Tommy looks up and he tells Alien, what brought you so much ... I love this movie ... It touches my heart. The boy with the robotic arm needs a dad and Alien is enlisted as Tommy's dad in the desert. . . oh yes, they also need water. . . not THE ROAD WARRIOR (MAD MAX 2) by all means except a stupid western / post nuke film with a guy with a robot arm and Alien and Trash and some other good guys with a bad chick with an iron claw and CRAZY BULL that looks like the warrior Wez in the Road. . .For Sunday afternoon on channel 57 (philadelphia, PA) after church I would go home and find this. . . often. . . too often. I love it. 10/10
