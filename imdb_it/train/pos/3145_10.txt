That 70s Show is the best TV program ever, period. It's up there with Andy Griffen Show, Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons in my book. That show of the 70s continued for 8 seasons, all focused on a group of teenagers / young adults dealing with relationships, separating from their parents and their overall future. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Eric and Donna, are two teenagers who live next to each other. They lived side by side for most of their lives and begin to feel more for each other at the start of the first season. A great deal of the show revolves around how their relationship works. <br /> <br /> Two other characters, Red and Kitty, are Eric's parents. Red was in service, so he really pushes Eric around. Kitty is exactly the opposite. Even if he drinks a lot, he treats Eric and his friends with care. Their neighbor Bob is obviously Donna's dad. Bob has fun around with several women during the rough story of the series. Bob also annoys the Red in all its extension. <br /> <br /> The remaining character, Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie, are Eric's friends. They also play an important role in the history of the show. <br /> <br /> Well, the first season is fantastic. This is when the characters start to try new things for each other. The first season is original, fun and fun. <br /> <br /> The second season is good, even if it is not as good as the first one. It is a basic continuation of the First. Eric and Donna are together, and everything works great. <br /> <br /> The third season is my favorite. He came back and captured the atmosphere and humor of the first season. I also think that the character's chemistry has improved, making the show even more fun to watch. <br /> <br /> The fourth season is not so good. Eric and Donna Arne together in this, making the show slightly less pleasant. It's still fun, although I didn't like it as much as the previous seasons. <br /> <br /> The fifth season is the last season I enjoyed to the fullest. It's the biggest year in the band, so it really helps the story. The fifth season also had the best final in all seasons. <br /> <br /> The sixth season is a good part of most. It's extremely fun, even if it doesn't capture the impression the other seasons have made. The band is out of high school, so I guess it didn't affect the adolescent aspect of previous seasons. Also, I didn't like the last three or four episodes considering that they had a dramatic feeling for them. <br /> <br /> The seventh season captures the same feeling that the fifth season had in a sense, even if you didn't do it all the time. I liked the seventh season like everyone else did, and the ending is fantastic . <br /> <br /> The last season was sucked. Eric wasn't involved, which ruined him. Even Kelso didn't work there for the most part, which didn't help. I hated the eighth season until the last episode. I thought the last episode was really good, and an appropriate ending for the series. <br /> <br /> So overall, if you like comedy, check out The 70s Show. They have stopped making new episodes, but a lot is still on TV. I also recommend buying Seasons 1-7. It's up to you if you want to buy Season 8.
