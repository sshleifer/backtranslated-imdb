A fascinating little film set in the United Kingdom about a (almost) World War II swing band meeting. A fine cast of old men brings carefree prospects for life to this fun story with an award-winning interpretation of Dench and the great "tubes" of Laine. Time well spent and a fun watch for everyone.
