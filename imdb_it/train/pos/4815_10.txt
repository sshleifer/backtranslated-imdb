This is on my list of all the favorite movies of all time! It's a fantastic and insightful film. It has been historically interesting and beautiful to look at! I thought the acting of Emily Blunt was fantastic and Rupert Friend was a fantastic Albert, the best actor was chosen for Albert. The costumes were fantastic and the settings and scenes like the opera house were incredible and detailed. I loved it, everything! I loved the childhood scenes in which she was the victim of "bullying" by John Conroy. And where his mother says he has to walk down the stairs with an adult. One still the writers did it! They produced this fantastic script! <br /> <br /> It fully deserves the prizes they have received. (Oscar and BAFTA win Sandy Powell, for the design of the costumes. A BAFTA for the best make-up and hair, an Oscar in the best result in Art Direction, Best realization in Costume Design, Best result in Makeup. Broadcast Film Critics Association for the best costume design, also nominated for best actress Emily Blunt CDG for excellence in Costume Design for the film - Period Hampton's International Film Awards for an audience award for best narrative film PFCS for best costume design. Sudbury Cinefest, does not say for what: VFCC for best actress, Emily Blunt.) Altogether 10 victories and 11 nominations! It's pretty good! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/awards Take a look at yourself, it's really interesting! Personally, Rupert Friend should have received an award.
