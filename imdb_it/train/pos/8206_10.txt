Clint Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Calahan in the 4th film of the Dirty Harry series. Clint is older, but he still understands, Harry was told to go on vacation after some trouble that happened due to a robbery (from which the memorable Make My Day trick came!) it was worse, one the woman became vigilant after an attack of rape in an amusement park and started taking punks one by one. The last film to see Sandra Locke in a Clint Eastwood movie! An improvement after The Enforcer which was a little more than a comedy and less serious. Clint Eastwood's sunglasses were Gargoyles that are best known for the sunglasses Arnold Shwartzeneger wears in The Terminator. It's worth checking out if you like Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry or action thrillers.
