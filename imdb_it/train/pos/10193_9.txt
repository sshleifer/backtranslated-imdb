This review is dedicated to the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle. <br /> <br /> The Original Drum and Bass. <br /> <br /> It seems that there is very little soon. Those who record in these days, if there is more than we let them experience, now-in-days tends to be of a very different kind of Chi, on the whole, a parody, a shadow of their (many) best years . To be honest, none of them has to prove anything to anyone, they have earned their respect and overtime. <br /> <br /> This movie is for me one of the best. To command an audience of over 400,000 plus solid cantatas, skills, charisma, spirit and a lot of bloody music. <br /> <br /> We all know the other acts in the program, The Doors (their last ever show weeks before Jim Morrison died), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many others. The point is that whoever was there was The Who that the majority had come to see. This show was a year after the Great Hippie Fest of the 60s; Woodstock. The film and the album had come out and so was Who's biggest work, Tommy. The always hungry crowd wanted a taste, to be able to live their own unique event, being able to "Grove and Love" in the knowledge that this concert was theirs. To do this you needed the best of what Rock 'n Roll had to throw at the hungry crowd. <br /> <br /> At two o'clock in the morning of late August 1970 the M.C. announces "Ladies and Gentlemen, a small Rock 'n Roll band of Shepherds Bush London, the' OO". <br /> <br /> The suit by John Entwistle is black leather, on the front is the outside line of a human skeleton from the neck to the feet, Roger dressed his traditional stage dress with long long flowing hair, Keith in white shirt and jeans, while Pete had his white suit for the boiler and Doc Martins he had preferred to wear. <br /> <br /> The Who never interrupted their High Energy Rock assault for over two hours, exhibiting their best songs from other artists such as Young Man Blues, Shaking 'all Over, and then queuing, Keith luring the song "Shut up, it's Bloody Opera" with Tommy, the Opera Rock. The song went wild. This is what they came to hear, and the Who did not disappoint, straight into Overture and never got up in the air until the final note of "Tommy can you hear me?" Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> To capture a show of this size from a band of this stature at the height of a festival that would be the last of its kind anywhere in the world was a fantastic piece of film history. <br /> <br /> The English DVD is only available in the English / linear PCM soundtrack, as in the US, I think we can get with at least 5.1, "Check the local press for details ??" on this, ok. <br /> <br /> The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes without extras, which is a disappointment. Yes, for a slice of Rock and Festival history this DVD would send you on a nostalgic journey along the memory lane when you press Play, for some of the best movies of Who how it was supposed to be, Live, Raw and in your face! <br /> <br /> I would have given this DVD ten if it weren't for the lack of 5.1, and some extras would have been nice. <br /> <br /> Thank you Roger, Pete, John and Keith.
