I saw this movie once in or near its release year 36 years ago (1969). Even if I can only remember a few now, I want to see it again. The parts I remember, rightly or wrongly, include mustard gas in the trenches and Suzie Kendall as a German spy, who offers some sexual favors on the back of a closed truck to get military information from him. The soundtrack was particularly memorable and exciting in the Gone With The Wind championship and I'd like to hear it again. There must be a commercial or copyright reason why this film is not available. Does anyone know why? I doubt it has anything to do with the lack of quality or interest.
