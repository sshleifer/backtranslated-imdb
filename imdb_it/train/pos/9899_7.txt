I've seen Slaughter High several times over the years, and I've always found it to be a fun slasher film with a strange sense of humor, but I never knew it was shot in the UK, and I never knew it was the actor who plays Marty Rantzen (Simon Scuddamore) committed suicide after the release of the film. I guess I noticed him watching him last night that the actors phrasing sounds pretty strange to Americans, and some of them aren't very good at hiding their English accents. <br /> <br /> All this apart from that, though, is the story of the nerd in the class, Marty, who is the target of his classmates' jokes, and on a particular day, April Fools Day, is attracted in the locker room of the girl from a Caroline Munro (yes, playing a teenager) and humiliated great moment for the cinema. Of course, the coach captures the gang at work and is given a vigorous workout to punish them, but not before a couple of guys put Marty in contact with a rod, who tries to smoke in the chemistry lab, but is full of something that makes him sick and when he runs to the bathroom, one of his classmates slips inside and puts a chemical that reacts with something that Marty is stirring, which results in a fire and the leakage of a bottle of nitric acid , which leaves poor Marty Bruciati and horribly scarred. <br /> <br /> Ten years later, this same band is headed to their class reunion at the good old Doddsville High, which seems strangely boarded and inaccessible, but thanks to their ingenuity they can enter and find the seemingly abandoned place. .. except that there is a room where a banquet and a liqueur are arranged and so, of course, they eat, drink and have fun. Soon, they will die, of course. <br /> <br /> The band is chased one by one by a figure in a jester's mask, but could it be Marty? They don't know, they think it's either in a crazy trash bin or that you work for IBM, they're not sure which one. But whoever he is, he's doing a quick job on them. Particularly unpleasant is the girl who takes a bath to wash away the blood from one of her classmates whose bowels came at her when she drank poisoned beer. You are the victim of an acid bath which I believe may have been one of the parts originally cut in the ribbon version, because it seemed much more unpleasant when I saw it this time. I could be wrong but I guess it wasn't on the tape. <br /> <br /> However, there is a rather cloudy finish, and this also contains footage not recorded on the tape, I think. There is also a bit of frontal nudity soon that has also been erased, but other than that I didn't really notice if there were any other bits in this full version, probably so, but it's been a while since the last time l 'I have seen. br /> <br /> However, if you are a fan of the slasher movies of the 80s, then pop up the new DVD, because it is a fun little slasher with a good atmosphere and atmosphere. 7 out of 10.
