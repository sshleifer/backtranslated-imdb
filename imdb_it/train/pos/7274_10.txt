No Strings Attached is one of Carlos Mencia's best shows to date. Mencia is known for researching and making fun of racial problems. However, he does more than this in this stand-up performance, which took place in San Francisco. In general, Mencia's material not only makes you laugh, but also makes you think about what is really wrong with today's society. <br /> <br /> In this hour-long performance, Mencia talks about things like illegal immigration, what women really mean when they ask for equality in the workplace, terrorism, his opinion on the Passion of Mel Gibson's Christ and a discussion he had with a woman about whether he is influenced by Jesus and how society should treat those who are physically or mentally handicapped. Mencia also discusses whether or should you have the right to speak and tell a joke. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not afraid to offend, which sometimes gets him in trouble with his critics. For example, he goes a bit far (and admits it) with a joke about Pope John Paul II and about what he is probably doing in heaven right now. <br /> <br /> Mencia's main message in all his performances is that we all have a voice and that we should use that voice to talk about what we hear and not be afraid to offend. It reminds us that we have the right to free speech and that we must use this right as Americans. <br /> <br /> If you like this performance, I highly recommend you to watch Mind of Mencia, his show on Comedy Central.
