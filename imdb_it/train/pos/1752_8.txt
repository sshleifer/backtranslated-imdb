SPOILERS Sex eh? It is one of the most basic parts of human life. Still, do we ever take it too seriously? People always want more, even those who receive it daily, and if you are unlucky, there are potential consequences that can change your life (create). Ironically, people say that we are all starting to have sex at a younger age (although Victorians marry and have children in their early teens), so it must be increasingly difficult for those who come to a point like virgins. In Steve Carell's first big-screen role, he plays a man who got 40 years without managing it. Treating ourselves to innumerable episodes of lude and extreme sex, not to mention more obscenities than an episode of "Eurotrash", the general plot of the film and its principle does not seem funny. It is a pleasant surprise therefore that for all the inappropriate and failed jokes there is an incredibly high number of people who hit the mark and leave the audience in hysteria. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a good guy with a good job and a pleasant temperament. At the same time, however, he brazenly takes life too seriously and after being invited to a poker game as a necessary fifth member, Andy's friends discover his secret. At the age of 40, Andy is still a virgin. Now, for various reasons, but above all for piety, the three men (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romany Malco) offer all of Andy's advice with a goal in mind. To put him out of his misery and let him have sex. <br /> <br /> One of the few good things about "Anchorman", it would have been only a matter of time before Steve Carell let himself be guided by him. Impressive, in "The 40 Year Old Virgin" does not disappoint. Showing the timid and hopeless virgin to perfection, Carell is a revelation as he gradually becomes more and more confident as the council begins to help. <br /> <br /> Carell is not alone in his performance though. Rudd, Rogen, Malco and Catherine Keener as the love interest are all superb. Rudd is a personal favorite like David, who loves love, who falls apart on several occasions and shares the best scene with Rogen while the two discuss homosexuality. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise of this film is not the way many of the jokes have hit the mark, but actually the smart way in which the message turns on its head. Obviously designed for conservative America, the whole tone of the film evolves from a simple story of sexual conquest to one of safe sex and abstinence. The virgin does not need sex to make her life complete, she just needs trust and true love. A message worthy of preaching and a noticeable improvement over what is expected to be seen at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> It is strange to see a crude comedy that is always fun and well acted, but low and behold, "40 years virgin" is just that. He also throws in a well-intentioned message and you are on your way to a high-level comedy. A surprising joy.
