Jacknife is a masterpiece of the 80s. It is a film that breathes through extraordinary acting and a very interesting directive touch. In Jacknife both lovers of European and American cinema can find things to refer to. The script is very compelling and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris is giving one of the biggest updated shows. He portrays his superbly alcoholic hero making us feel his broken heart in every line, in every move. Robert De Niro makes us think of him once again as one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the simplest but also most realistic performances of his career. Jacknife never gets boring because it shows its heroes free from any typical Hollywood feature. No one is a hero after the war. Everyone is a loser and this film is about that simple truth. No one can repair his pieces after a war, just like the heroes of this movie. Jacknife talks about the diseases of the soul created by war. Simply magnificent film.
