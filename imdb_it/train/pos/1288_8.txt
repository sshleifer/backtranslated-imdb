Preston Waters is in a bad summer. Besides his upcoming birthday, nothing else looks promising. <br /> <br /> First he must share his room with his brothers who will run a business. They can't do it in their rooms because they don't have enough space. At a birthday party he gets only 6 coins of $ 6, while others get $ 32, $ 35 and even $ 50. When one of his birthday cards arrives early, he receives only a check payable for $ 11. <br /> <br /> Going to the bank learns that he needs at least $ 200 to start an account. Leaving the bank, a bully steals the check. Chasing the child, it almost makes him overwhelm (surely his bike is ruined) by a criminal named Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrer). Quigley also comes from the bank to give the owner $ 1,000,000 to give to this guy tomorrow. Quigley starts writing a check for damage, but only manages to write his name before a police car circulates in the area. Frightened, he gives Preston control, informs him to give it to his father to finish. <br /> <br /> But that evening, Preston tells his father that he doesn't want a new bicycle, he wants his room back, even better his home. His father confines him to his room for the rest of the evening. Moping in his room Preston thinks things can't get worse he realizes he forgot the check because he's still in his shirt pocket. It's empty. <br /> <br /> Using the computer and after careful consideration, it does it for $ 1,000,000. The next day, while he is trying to cash it in the bank, he is brought by the owner who thinks he is the person who should give $ 1,000,000 and does it. It is not as if the real person named Juice arrived later. <br /> <br /> Now the three have to track down Preston. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Preston enjoys buying all sorts of stuff including his house and even dating a masked bank lady who is really an FBI agent (who is trying to track down the 3 bad guys). Makes this person named Mr. Macintosh work for and even plans a party for him on his birthday. <br /> <br /> But in the end things are okay (the money runs out, the bad guys take it). <br /> <br /> In general, a very funny film. Miguel Ferrer plays his role very well. If you liked it in Another Stakeout, you'll love it here. It does all sorts of crazy and evil things. <br /> <br /> Rick Ducommun (the stressed head of Ghost in the Machine) plays a splendid friendly driver in this film.
