I loved this movie. It is rare to come across Vietnam post-partum, and this film-sans scenes of fighting and thrilling bombs and shooting did. I had no idea that I would have been so impressed. What an incredible look at how alien vets feel. It was hard to look at, frankly. We understand all the fights and the kind of drama of Apocalypse Now, but it's so different. What happens when they come back and try to live a life? They can't make Me very aware of a large group of men lurking around America. He is not able to relate, he cannot sleep, he cannot have love affairs, he cannot deal with "normal society". They feel totally separate. This is a huge tragedy, and it is not sufficiently addressed. Yes, we have changed our attitude towards Vietnam veterinarians, we like them now, but then? It doesn't seem to have made any difference to them. It's too late? So it was a great movie, but I cried a lot. I have no other criticism.
