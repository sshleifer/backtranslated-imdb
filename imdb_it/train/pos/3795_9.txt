After watching this movie at the SF Independent Film Festival, I couldn't wait to know how to get a copy. Jim McKay gave a talk (Q&A) about the film that later presented his ironic situation: how to get distribution for a film that portrays minorities (women, not whites) working on resolving controversial issues (pregnant at age adolescence, adolescent motherhood, racial identity, single-mother families), and how to write a faithful script on all these subjects being a white male of mid-thirties. The multiracial and multi-ethnic audience of adults is mostly enthusiastic about the film's fantastic plot, detailed characters and the fantastic portrayal of "true teenage life". Most teenagers, however, left the building - leading me to think that this is a film most seen by adults with children, as a starting point for discussion rather than, as many adults thought, "a film that the guys should see why he talks about them ". So, questions about distribution: how can we get your hands on it? Internet (retail) would be a great path - this is a film that will be buried, like "Pups" or other modern and radical teenage films - and McKay seemed reactive. As for his credits as a writer / director, McKay was a sensitive and detailed _extremeley_ in his work - allying himself to the Crown Heights neighborhood where the film is set, working with actors to portray characters in their vision of what they think they should be - with results that are disarmingly realistic.
