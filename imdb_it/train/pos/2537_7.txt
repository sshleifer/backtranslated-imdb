Boris and Bela do well together in this film, whether they are against each other, or remodel the same boat. I saw this in 1972, and I just bought it from Borders this year. This time looking at it with my children, I took note of 2 things: it attracted the attention of a 3, 4 and 5 year old; and I took some things I didn't have when I first looked at it. A very fast story with an unpredictable end. A must for movie lovers !!!
