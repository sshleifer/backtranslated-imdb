I can't believe some of the comments on this show! The show is just brilliant! Of course he does not follow the tried and true, but we do as consumers always want the same things push us over and over again. We shouldn't have the chance to sit down and enjoy something new once in a while. The style is not as realistic as the previous "Scooby Doo" shows, but it shouldn't be. The show entitled "Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get a Clue" as part of that title states that the whole loved cast of other interpretations would constantly join the action. And nowhere are they said to solve the mysteries, and they can't even stand monsters, so why should they? I'm really happy to have included some points from the old storyline that work on a Scooby-Doo show. They still have jokes, awkward jokes, quick-change clothes in the hunting scenes, the standard corridor gag and even Scooby snacks. In fact, I'm glad this show is out there because I love it. I'm also happy that they got rid of the rest of the team for a while and only focused on two main characters and a villain. <br /> <br /> Of course it's ridiculous, it should be! Of course it's different, it should be. It should make you laugh at the villain, and cheer on the idiotic robotic butler to triumph over all intruding insects, no matter what the size. You should get the "Roobi-Roo" joke. Everything has just been put together so well, there is not a single thing that can think that it is WRONG with it. Writing, acting, animation, all top quality. The title music is fantastic (my computer plays "GET A CLUE!" When it starts up), and the background music is just compelling.
