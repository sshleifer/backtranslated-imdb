This anime has been underestimated and still is. Hardly the disgusting kid movie, as you know, I go back to these 10 years after I saw it for the first time. One of the best movies released. <br /> <br /> The animation while it is not perfect is good, the tricks of the camera give a 3D touch and the story is still good today even after I grew up and saw the switches like Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. Obviously it's not close to the depth, but try to see it from a carefree view. It is a story to entertain, not to question. <br /> <br /> Still one of my favorites I also come back when I feel like a giggle on happier spirits. Not to say it's a childish movie, there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humor to see everything.
