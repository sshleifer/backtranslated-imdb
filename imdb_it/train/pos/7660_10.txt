This film is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I could be a prejudice, because the era of apartheid is an area for which I have always felt. But I'd say it aligns with Cry Freedom and Cry the Beloved Country. Unfortunately, until a few days ago I had never heard of this film. Inside is one of the most underrated films of all time, probably because it was a small film company, I had never heard of it before. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors anyway, is believable and dramatic, Nigel Hawthorne plays his vile role well. Don't look for humor in this film, there is none. It is true, savage and gritty to the last, and to the sensitive I would say to bring a box of handkerchiefs. But films like this make you wonder, why are bigger films often never heard?
