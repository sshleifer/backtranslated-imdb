This is an excellent example of what can be done on a budget film. The acting is excellent considering the script and the whole atmosphere of the film is very disturbing. The gore is well made and used sparingly (watch out for the excellent death of the barbed wire) and the action is incisive when used. It is true that sometimes there are wrong lines in the script, but compared to other films on the same (or bigger!) Budget, it is almost imperceptible. Overall, this is recommended. Trust me, it's better than it looks! 8/10
