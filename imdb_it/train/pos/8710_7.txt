I remember this show from Swedish television. I was only 7 years old and scared me incredibly. <br /> <br /> I'd like to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as I remember it, although I suspect my tastes and requests have changed. <br /> <br /> Although this was released before alien and a plethora of other suspected space thrillers that have their roots in the scary movies of the 50s and the political climate of the 70s. When I think about it, this was a real science fiction, a film that tried to discuss scientific and political issues about who we are and what we are. The term science fiction has since weakened and becomes the term for every movie that contains spaceships.
