In truth, this is not a "film" as much as an extended final episode; by this I mean that, if I had not followed the TV series (Homicide: Life On The Street), I suspect you would have had difficulty following this movie made for TV. That being said, "Homicide: The Movie" is still a great watch. I think it talks a lot about a television production that EVERY single cast member would return, many after years of absence, to portray their characters once again and complete an incredible program. The film highlights that sense of "family", not only among the characters, but also among the actors. It is all very bitter-sweet knowing that this will be the LAST time we will see them all together under the title of HOMICIDE. From the point of view of history, I found this film a little lacking. The candidacy of the mayor of Giardello seems particularly artificial, and I felt that his shooting could have been addressed in the parameters of his regular position, like Leiutenant. Furthermore, Det. The extreme twist of Bayliss, which remained suspended at the end of the series, is finally solved, but I, for example, NEVER heard it had to be; I enjoyed staying with a mystery (let's remember that even the first case of the first episode went unresolved for the whole series!). As a DEVOTED fan of the TV series, I can love this movie, and the fact that it was made even after H: LOTS was canceled, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hasn't had the slightest exposure to the series. Now, if they just released it on DVD ...
