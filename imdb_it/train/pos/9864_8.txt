I saw "Ice Age" in the cinema and I liked the film. Despite the fact that "Ice Age" has many defects and scientific errors, such as humans, sabers, dinosaurs and mammoths that live in the same period, and even the place where history passes (it seems North America, but has some characteristics from the Iceland for example) we can enjoy ourselves even so. (unless you are very strict!) <br /> <br /> The planet is entering an ICE Era and many animals are migrating south, where it is warmer. Sid is a stupid sloth who is left behind by his own family, who can't stand him anymore. Walking on his way, he meets Manfred, or as he calls "Manny" a lunatic mammon that does not care about extinction or immigration and is going north. Worried about being easily caught, Sid decides to follow Manfred, and in the middle of their journey, they found a human mother with her baby. The mother dies but Manfred and Sid decide to take it and return the child to the humans. Diego, one of the sabers, decides to follow them and help them reach a shortcut for the human field. What Manfred and Sid don't know, is that Diego comes from a saber clan that hates humans and wants to kill the child, and also claims to betray both of them to turn them into saber food. What will happen, will depend on the behavior and conscience of Diego ... <br /> <br /> aka "A Era do Gelo" - Brazil
