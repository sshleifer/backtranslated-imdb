As a 90-minute experience, it's not up to the "Drive" standard, as the actors clearly learned their craft with "Who Am I?" academy, while action sequences are generally not better than those of Mark Dacascos' superb beat. However, those who enjoyed `Drive ', (and thought it was wonderful!), Will surely appreciate that too. Surely you won't go back and look at everything again, but you'll definitely come back to some of the action scenes for a long time to come. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing to see that the art of quality fighting choreography is still practiced, though not in Hong Kong, and I'd like to see what these kids could do with budgets, time and respect of Yuen Woo-ping and Corey Yuen Kuei. If you sit down during the first half hour and you are not mad about the atrocious dialogue, then you are ready for a surprise. Bosch is magnificent and can really make a move with some magnificent stunts, kicks and simple acts of courage. <br /> <br /> If you are lucky enough to find yourself within 500 miles of a copy, then follow it and watch it. It is not Shakespeare. In fact, it's less articulate than Coolio in "China Strike Force", but you'll be impressed by both the moves on display and the pain experienced by the stunt team - (I'm pretty sure there's no safe way to land directly on your head , or be forced to head to the roof of a wooden car from a racing car !? <br /> <br />
