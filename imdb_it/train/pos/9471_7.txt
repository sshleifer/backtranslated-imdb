Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, the newspaper's dying uncle and single father dedicated to three girls. In a large family returning home, Dan meets his perfect woman, only to discover that she is in a relationship with her brother. <br /> <br /> What is a man to do? <br /> <br /> I liked "Dan In Real Life", but I imagine the success or otherwise of this film will be if you are willing to accept that Steve Carell play a relatively direct and sober part, rather than face the big comedies that have made him so successful. If you can't accept it, don't worry, "Get Smart" will be available later this year, but for the record I thought he was very good. <br /> <br /> "Dan In Real Life" starts as your typical, incidentally funny, family drama, but it becomes more fun and entertaining as it goes on and Carell's frustration with his situation grows. It's not massively original (but if you only see films with original ideas, the film shoots would be really scarce, right?), But "Dan In Real Life" is fun, and a good cast (which would not fall in love with the bright Juliette Binoche?) Makes the most of a pretty insightful script that contains many ideas about the meaning and passion of love. <br /> <br /> I hope Steve Carell pushes and does something so interesting again.
