The 40 Year Old Virgin, about Andy Stitzer, a forty year old man who works in an electronics store and doesn't have much social life and is very embarrassing for women. Some of his colleagues in the shop invite him to go out one night and find out that Andy is still a virgin, so they're going to help him lose his virginity. One day in the Andy shop, he meets a woman named Trish, who gives him his phone number and in the end Andy, works enough to go on a date with her and they really start to like each other but Andy, it's still very embarrassing when it comes to have sex and will have to tell Trish, to his great embarrassment, if he can raise the courage to tell him before things get uncomfortable. The 40-year-old virgin has good direction, a good script, good comedic performances of the entire cast, good cinematography and good film editing. The film is the protagonist and is co-written by Steve Carell, who does a great comic performance and his script for the film is very good. I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It's sweet, fun, fun, funny, smart, good-natured and a good time. This film is as good as this year's Wedding Crashers, and both films are two of the best comedies I've seen in a while. The 40 Year Old Virgin really shows a lot of talent and is put to use and works like a comedy and a love story and is sweet and very funny. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
