David Lynch usually makes films that resemble puzzles put together in the wrong way. They are interesting to look at and to think about but they don't really gel in your mind. Perhaps art will always mean the maximum for its creator. <br /> <br /> The Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch film. Not that in any case there is something typical about them. It is an odyssey through rural America. A true journey into life Alvin Straight took a lawnmower to reach his brothers home. He drove 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin, to make amends to his sick brother for past offenses. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth is gently voiced at the center of this film. Bring Alvin straight to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the film is slow-paced coincides with Alvin's slow journey towards realization. <br /> <br /> Along the way Alvin meets a confused and scared girl. She is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation. After listening to Alvin talking about the family, reconsider. <br /> <br /> Subsequently Alvin attends a shocked woman who kills a deer in her car. He complains of having killed several and leaves. Alvin feels sick, but he's smart enough to make some meat that night. <br /> <br /> Later the mower Alvin loses its brakes and almost kills it. A good man and his wife leave him in their yard as he solves it. They even allowed him to call his sweet but slow daughter, played by Sissy Spacek, who was haunted by a terrible tragedy in her past. Alvin insists on paying the call. The man even offers to guide Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Alvin declines thanks. <br /> <br /> While Alvin waits, he also goes to a bar with a kind old man while they discuss the harshness of the war and the price he took on their souls. Alvin even confesses a fatal mistake that has been a sniper that has haunted him forever. <br /> <br /> Alvin also meets two quarrelsome brothers who have repaired his lawnmower. He rightly talks about the price calling them with their high labor and repair costs. It even helps them to appreciate each other by learning from their mistakes with their brother. <br /> <br /> The night before Alvin left the man's yard he took off his hat. The man tells him that it was an honor to have stayed and asks Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in its simplicity. It is heard because it is so simple, so real. <br /> <br /> The journey continues and we cannot help but involve ourselves more and more. We want Alvin to come to his brothers. We want you to make amends. We want to know that this world is full of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth was at his best. It was his last film and his performance was amazing. You can't help but understand his pride, listen to his wisdom and finally feel his pain. One becomes taken by him as the man who offers him his backyard to stay. <br /> <br /> If there is justice in the afterlife, then Alvin Straight, his brother and Richard Farnsworth are sitting in a bar together. I can imagine them talking about their lives, regrets, hopes and joys. As Alvin says in the movie, "My brother and I looked at the stars". Well, I know they are all with the best view of the house.
