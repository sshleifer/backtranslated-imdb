Red Rock West (1993) <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage becomes involved in a deadly crime without knowing it before, and the dominos leads to a growing risk, adventure and misadventure in the American Wild West of the 90s. Red Rock West is often brutal and sometimes funny, and Cage brings out the mixture with his usual sardonic and casual spirit. <br /> <br /> Is the plot at the top? Yes. Is Dennis Hopper perfect as a crazy, almost likeable killer? Yes. Does Cage have a chance? Well, you have to look and see. He never gives up, and he took me by surprise the first time I saw him. In yesterday's second vision, I was surprised at how beautiful it was, how well built it was and how macabre and fun it was at the same time. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Dahl (who also helped write) is known more for his work on TV, but with Rounders and this film shows a skillful hand with sensational storylines. By the way, he is saved by his humor and caricatures. The bar is shabby, questionable cops. And don't miss a truly inspired cameo from Dwight Yoakam as a truck driver.
