In this really fascinating and obscure film, an impoverished young student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money, in return the devil takes his mirror image (this is done brilliantly in the film and strangely anticipated when Balduin, the student is first practicing fencing in front of the mirror), a visual metaphor for a "man at war with himself" who attracts his immediate future. The student enjoys his money, but the woman he loves is unreachable (he made a pact with the devil, is forever cut off from love and other riches of the soul) you can have love or you can exchange your soul for money, not you can have them both Balduin is tormented by his double (the intertitles express him beautifully as the action does. Some scenes are incredible, the sense of destiny when the devil disappears with the mirror image of Balduin is amazing, as is the feeling that his patto has forever cut him out of human society (the scene in which he escapes from his double and ends up in the "desolate land" on the edge of the city, no longer entirely human (he has lost his soul) is like an animal hunted outside society Human There are many other things to say about this incredible film: Paul Wegener was a fantastic actor and director, a cultural hero of mine, useful if you know a little about German history at the time of making this film and the German doppelganger tradition (not google, take a good book) Remember, it's a very early film, sometimes it's a bit clumsy, but considering what it has to say and its tragic ending, it's one of the best absolute (yes it is!)
