It seems to be becoming fashionable to tear "Basic Instinct 2" to the point that a significant part of the public (including critics) found it terrible even before it was published. It seems even more fashionable to destroy Sharon Stone who, like all of us, is now fourteen years older and, unlike most of us, still looks wonderful. The first comments on this film were so vicious that I had to see them in person. In my opinion, this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film, but it's not as bad as most comments pretend. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, nor are Henry Bean and Leora Barish Joe Eszterhas. "Basic Instinct 2" is just a fun medium thriller and, in addition to adding the original Jerry Goldsmith score, bears little resemblance to its predecessor. Stone also gives his character a different dimension, creating a lustful and diabolical Catherine Trimell, who can perfectly classify himself among other monsters as Hannibal Lecter. She is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with the field at will. Unfortunately, she seems to be the main target for those who like to trash this movie. He has been too successful, too much of the main icon and, like all the actors who have reached that level, his time has come and is now destined to be destroyed by the Hollywood public. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is exceptional, giving performances that are much better than the material deserves. David Morrissey is a much better and far more interesting actor than Michael Douglas: his acting is impeccable, giving a dense and complex dimension to an otherwise one-dimensional character. Since it has more screen time and is the axis of the film, it can keep your attention from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> I am not recommending "Basic Instinct 2" as a great movie; I'm just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my belief that non-movie agendas are shaping the opinion of most viewers.
