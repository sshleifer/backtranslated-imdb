Prix ​​de Beauté was created at the height of the transition from silence to sound, which arrived a little later in Europe than in Hollywood. Originally conceived as a silent film, it was released with a soundtrack dubbed in France, with a French actress who spoke the lines of Louise Brooks, but was released as a silence in Italy and other parts of Europe. I was lucky enough to see the impeccable restoration of the Bologna Film Archive of an Italian silent print at the Tribeca Film Festival. I haven't seen the talkie version yet, but I think it's safe to assume that the silent version is much more satisfying, given that in all the reports the dubbing is bad (Louise Brooks speaks clearly English, so it's not possible that her lips can be matched.) Furthermore, the film is made entirely in silent style, with few titles and little need for dialogue. Prix ​​de Beauté visually tells its story, with exciting and imaginative photographic works. The opening is instantly kinetic, with rapid scenes of urban life and swimmers diving into a public beach. Throughout the film there is an emphasis on visual details, clothing, machinery, decoration and symbolic images such as a bird in a cage, a pile of torn photographs, a diamond bracelet. This is the silent film technique at its peak. <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks, of course, is responsible for saving the film from darkness. Seeing this just makes it more heartbreaking to reflect that this was his last starring role. Brilliantly beautiful, it dominates the film with its charisma and also gives a perfectly natural but highly charged performance. Her role here, more than in the Pabst films for which she is best known, is a woman with whom we can fully understand and sympathize. She plays Lucienne Garnier, a typist with a possessive boyfriend, who yearns to get more out of life and secretly enters a beauty contest, with immediate success. She is then divided between the excitement of her new fascinating life and her love for the man who insists that she gives up everything or loses it. All the characters are drawn with shades. The boyfriend inspires compassion and is not just a brute: he loves Lucienne, but he is a limited man who cannot bear to have a life separate from him or to attract the attention of other men. Even the "other man" in history is not the simple slimeball for which we take him for the first time, although his intentions may be just as possessive as those of the boyfriend. <br /> <br /> ********** *************** NOTICE: SPOILERS BELOW ************ ***** <br /> <br /> The film has many beautiful series pieces, including Lucienne's triumph in the "Miss Europe" competition, shown through the comical reactions of assorted members of the public, who end up hitting the heroin with flowers; her unhappiness as a housewife, peel the potatoes while the pendulum of the cuckoo clock marks the time behind her; a nightmare journey to a fun fair (in the silent version, this happens later in the film, after his marriage) in which Lucienne, crushed between the dead and depressed by her husband's antics, decides that she can't go with her existence here I'm; and above all the final scene in the screening room where he sees his talkie test. Louise Brooks would never have looked more beautiful than her, with the beam of the projector flickering on her alabaster profile, her shoulders wrapped in a white fur, her face glowing under the helmet of black hair as she watched herself sing on the screen. The double stroke of his exquisite corpse and his still alive image on the screen are particularly touching: the image of Louise Brooks, like that of Lucienne, remains immortal despite her frustrated and aborted film career.
