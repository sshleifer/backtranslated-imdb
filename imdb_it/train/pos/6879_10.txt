"The Groove Tube" was one of only two Ken Shapiro films, the other being the equally bizarre "Modern Problems". This is just a large-scale parody of TV. Apart from Shapiro - who apparently did nothing after "Modern Problems" - the film also features the participation of Chevy Chase and Henry Winkler's cousin, Richard Belzer. The three cast members (plus some other people in smaller roles) appear in various sketches. One of the most amusing is Chase in a Geritol-spoofing commercial, in which he describes medicine while his wife strips, and ends with her humping. There is also a pornographic news program, an irritating cooking show and the epic story of some drug dealers. <br /> <br /> However, the whole thing is just a hoot. In my opinion, the three best television spoofing films are this, in addition to "Tunnelvision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (although I could also include "The Truman Show"). Really fun. <br /> <br /> I wonder what he ever became of Ken Shapiro.
