This was the second entry in Columbo's regular series, and it holds up well today. Since I am now able to watch it closely on DVD and see how it is built, I am very impressed with the direction of Bernard L. Kowalski (who directed the beautiful MACHO CALLAHAN and countless TV episodes) - look at how the post-murder actions of the killers are shown on a split screen effect on his two glasses, see how the murder itself is shown in photomontage mode, look at the point of view turned from the perspective of the corpse. Furthermore, the avant-garde soundtrack of the famous jazzman Gil Melle was incredible and helped create an atmosphere. And Brett Halsey's supporting performance as a golf pro was wonderful - such subtlety and complexity in a role that nine times out of ten would be a one-dimensional cutout. The "formula" had not yet been set when this episode was shot, so there are still some surprises in Columbo's methods. Obviously Falk, Robert Culp and Ray Milland are very high quality actors and it is a pleasure to see them work - all men are familiar with many other roles, but they are lost in their characters here. In all, this entry in the Columbo series - and MANY of the others - is so well crafted as a great film.
