Far from my second favorite movie, Spielberg, after Animaniacs. Although the ratings were low, so I liked it and liked it a lot, it was so fun and I loved the cast, wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were there and they were just fantastic, the whole cast was brilliant, especially the legendary Frank Welker. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see this cartoon again, it was great and the lines were great. I can also remember the exhilarating moment in which the Brain cameos are there, hear his voice and play the PATB instrumental theme, it was simply fantastic, I love it in those cartoons when cameos appear. I wish this cartoon and Animaniacs came back, I loved them
