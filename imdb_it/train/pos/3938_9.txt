Henry Fonda brilliantly captures what we had long believed Abraham Lincoln. It's a fool. Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe (apparently) that Abraham Lincoln was a farmer. But, through his confrontation with the lynching crowd and especially during court proceedings, you can see that under the external positions there is a brilliant man who has a good grasp of what is happening around him and how to influence people around him. <br /> <br /> In this film Henry Fonda proves to have a very good knowledge of how to present humor. It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he tells stories and jokes, the moment is perfect. There is a sequence in the process that made me laugh hard enough. Show this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940. <br /> <br /> John Ford's finale is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda rising to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous symbolic storm of the Civil War. It goes on in history. The film is fiction but Lincoln's intuition is tremendous. Definitely worth seeing again.
