This film is a perfect example of a film that divides people into 2 groups. Those who get the joke and those who don't. People usually attack what they don't understand. This film has a comic style and a charm that since then has no equal. It's a great comedy .. and a great love story. It's a perfect dating movie. A perfect movie for someone who wants a carefree good laugh. And if your perspective is too tense, maybe this movie is not for you, and you may need advice. It's an injustice that Paramount has kept this film on the shelves since the early 1980s, having never seen the light of day on DVD. Yet they feel that an Urban version of "The Honeymooners" is a good idea. I find it strange that my two favorite romantic comedies of all time have never been published on DVD. The other is "The World's Greatest Lover" by Gene Wilder, of which Fox has been an interpreter since the early 80s ... Yet, "From Justin To Kelly" is present in almost all video stores in the country. There is no justice in the world. Perhaps those who have taken the time to enjoy it will enjoy "From Justin To Kelly", I'm sure one is watered enough for them to "get". Sometimes with age people lose their sense of humor ... Or sometimes it just becomes stale and they find comic satisfaction in "Full House" replicas.
