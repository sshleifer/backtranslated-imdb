I happened to watch this movie by accident a few days ago while I was shooting channels. My expectations were not very high but it was an interesting film. In 'A Guy Thing', Jason Lee plays Paul, a guy with feet in Seattle, who is about to marry his girlfriend Karen (Selma Blair) and settle for one undisputed life of middle-class domesticity. First we meet Paul at his bachelor party, where there is no desire to engage in any of the normal party-like activities that his (surprisingly few) companions encourage, in case he is a bit naughty and enjoys himself because of his problems soon and conflict. Of course, the next thing Paul knows, it's the next morning the night before, he's in bed with a naked hula dancer, and his mother-in-law calls to inform him that Karen is coming. Oh, and the hula dancer is Karen's cousin, Becky (Julia Stiles). <br /> <br /> From this small acorn of potential troubles grows a mighty oak of frantic misfortune, while Paul tries to escape from the misfortune to the misfortune, trying to cover what he did while maintaining the aspect of being a good boy respectful of the family, who is super-excited about his upcoming wedding. His efforts to ensure that Karen does not survive any of the potential errors on his part, ironically, compels Paul to get closer and closer to the hilarious Becky, forcing him to wonder if he really wants life that seems to have been drawn for him. The film contains the right mix of comedy and romance. Definitely worth looking at.
