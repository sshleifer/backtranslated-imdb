this is a wonderful film, it makes the 50s wonderfully elegant. Kim Novak is intriguing and compelling as a modern witch with one foot in Manhattan and the other in infinity. All supporting performances are fantastic, from Jack Lemmon to his annoyance Nicky to Ernie Kovacs as author of Magic in Mexico who is working on Magic in Manghattan, to Elsa Lanchester as the whore and the aunt Queenie witch. And then there's the cat - I have no idea how many witches (besides me) have called a cat Pyewacket but suggest one zillion. Jmes Stewart seems out of place, but only as much as his character is out of place in this strange underground of magic and sorcery. Perfect. And it has the perfect romantic happy ending, in which we believe because the films of this vintage have those happy endings. Gillian and Shep certainly have more chances to be happy like Rose and Charlie Allnut on The African Queen (another great movie)
