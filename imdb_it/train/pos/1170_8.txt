Night Of The Living Homeless is a fun parody of the 1978 movie (and remake of 2004) of "Dawn Of The Dead". Only this time ... with the homeless. The episode sees the homeless coming to South Park and people can't understand why. They treat the homeless as zombies who want to change and some of the parents end up on the roof of a supermarket like in the movie. Now it's up to the guys to find out where they come from and how It's a pretty funny episode with some good moments like the guys singing their version of the 2pac / Dr.Dre "California Love" song. Overall a good episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
