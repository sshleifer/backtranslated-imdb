Chase has created a real phenomenon with The Sopranos. Unfocusing performances, rock-solid writing and good music are part of what has probably become the best show ever. <br /> <br /> All the casts are strong, but Falco and Gandolfini have gained every inch of those Emmys. Anyone who doubts it, only needs to sample a few episodes; especially from the first seasons. James Gandolfini is absolutely fierce, absolutely terrifying, and you still find yourself loving him - hypnotized by him. <br /> <br /> Many people I've talked to about The Sopranos (who haven't seen it yet) say "I'm not a fan of the mafia movies / shows". Everything. Run - don't walk - and take it. Those same people usually love "E.R.", but I bet they don't really care about hospitals ... It's not the context.
