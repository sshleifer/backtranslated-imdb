I'm not sure if this counts as a spoiler or not, so be careful: <br /> <br /> Just a small but crucial thing to keep an eye on, an intriguing possibility: the boys steal a green Citroen at some point , for a round of joy and return it to the owner after having done an intentional and vengeful hidden damage to the car, hoping that the owner would crash. Is it the same car that they steal much later from the picnic family? We know that the original owner sold it. They eventually walk away on a dangerous road, which I understand has been closed to everyone except pedestrians in the last ten years. A new cut at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> On another topic, this film could have been called "Scent of a Woman". I don't remember another film, certainly not an American one, which treats a woman's perfume in such a frank and open way, very similar to the "nose" of a good Bordeaux.
