I've seen this movie at least 4 times since 1984 and it's always nice every time I see it. It's a very compelling version of the opera Carmen, with incredible Flamenco ballads, sets of bare bones and, of course, wonderful music. <br /> <br /> This story by Carmen is a story within a story, with every other parallel, to the end doubly tragic. Obviously a low budget Spanish production, the film contains ballets by some of the most important Flamenco dancers in Spain. The combination of the soaring opera music and the sound of ballerina boots on the wooden stage makes the story of the story even more powerful. <br /> <br /> It is the making of independent films at its best and probably my all-time favorite foreign film.
