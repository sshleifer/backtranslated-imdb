This film is a must for all people who love football as an art. What strikes first of this film about a soccer world cup is the way it is filmed. In addition to following the game as a television broadcast, there are generous videos dedicated to following individual players in games. This brings up the emotions and situations that these men go through as they try to achieve glory. Today's style of television transmission, so different from that of 1986, is still of lower quality than this film. <br /> <br /> Players are not the only stars. The public, the referees, the journalists who cover the games and the environment itself all play a central role in the development of what today is history. In this film you can see how all these factors play together in a very explicit way. In this regard, today's style of television broadcasting has not yet reached this level of quality, although it is now much closer than before. <br /> <br /> There are several players in evidence: Maradona (Argentina), Elkjaer and Laudrup (Denmark), Francescoli (Uruguay), Platini (France), Lineker (England), Rummenigge (Germany), Butrague # or (Spain), Socrates (Brazil) and Sanchez (Mexico). <br /> <br /> This film is not a collection of the best soccer moves of Mexico from 1986, although most of them are well covered. Throughout the film, there is a stress about presenting different aspects of the game and the competition itself based on the progress of these players and teams, even at the cost of skipping the relevant games of the games themselves. This is what makes this film so interesting and unique. <br /> <br /> Because of what happened because of the referees during the 1986 Mexico, many of the comments on this film and on the world cup are extremely influenced by Maradona. Many of these comments do not take into account the fact that there is a referee and two linesmen, who are human like the players and that all the aforementioned errors make mistakes in one way or another. The rules of football don't allow the referees to use TV-based replays to make decisions, so for the most part the referees have to decide what they perceive. As a result, the referees play an active role in developing a game. Their influence can be seen in different parts of this film. <br /> <br /> The 1990 World Cup sequel movie, compared to this, is just a source of bitter disappointment. Much of it comes from the fact that he became too involved in the game, while this film tells things from a more distant and impartial point of view.
