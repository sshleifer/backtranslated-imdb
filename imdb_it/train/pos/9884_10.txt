Rawhide was a wonderful western television series. Focusing on a group of trail enthusiasts led by trail leader Gil Favor. Most of the episodes, especially in the first 3 seasons, were studies on the character of Favor and his men. Guest stars came and went, but unlike Wagon Train they rarely dominated the episodes in which they had appeared. Rawhide was a true and gritty western and Gil Favor stood out as a memorable character to remember. Thanks to the performance of Eric Fleming the show became a great success. Of course he was ably supported by a wonderful cast of good actors: Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, Robert Cabal. All these actors have left their mark on a piece of television history. Rawhide has captured the flavor of that time in the west that no other series has for me, yet, however, it has managed to do it. The following seasons tended to divide the leads and give them individual narrative lines. For me, this didn't work for a while - cattle driving and regular customers provided the best stories. However, there are still some classic stories and Rawhide has remained in first place in the drawer. Black and white photography has added a dark and realistic touch that rarely other Western series have managed to capture. Rustlers, Indians, commancheroes, beautiful damsels in distress, serial killers, all showed up to give problems to our heroes. The end came quietly for the series when the last season was cut in less than half. The reason - Eric Fleming was gone and Rawhide was now a head without a body - the cruel realism was gone, Gil Favore commanded respect and exuded authority - it was never infallible and made it even more interesting. We will no longer see his fellows. Watch an episode whenever you can, rarely disappoint.
