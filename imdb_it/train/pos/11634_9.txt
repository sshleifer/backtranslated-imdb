I have just returned from an advanced screening of Red Eyes and I have to say that I haven't had so much fun in a movie in a long time. WES CRAVEN is at its best ever. It brings us a fantastic late-summer thriller that I desperately wanted. This is the thriller of the year ... no doubt. <br /> <br /> All the actors are fantastic and the action is realistic and fun. The F / X was fantastic. He constantly built suspense. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. It's been a while since I heard an audience cheer, clap and get excited in a theater. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for thrills, action and a good plot this summer, REDEYE offers. Go see it!
