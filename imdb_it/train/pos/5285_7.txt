You would think of taking a serious sightseeing tour when the premise of the film takes place mainly between two characters as they travel about 3000 miles from France to Saudi Arabia, crossing most of Europe - Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Turkey, before arriving in the Middle East. But this is not a tour, and there are no stopovers to dive into the vistas. <br /> <br /> Reda's father is in his twilight years and wants to do the Haj. However, since walking and taking the mule is out of the question, he chooses to travel to Mecca by car. He cannot drive, and therefore enlist the help of Reda, to his son's protest, to bring him there in their broken vehicle. <br /> <br /> But Reda doesn't see the point of having him go on, when his father could opt for the plane. He resents the idea of ​​having set aside his personal life for this pilgrimage he could not understand. And so, we started on this arduous journey with father and son, not being the best friends. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this film is to witness the development of the father-son couple, the challenges they face, the strange people they meet, who must dub in various weather conditions, and alternate rest breaks between motels and sleep in the car. We see a clear generational gap in them trying to communicate with each other, the father who tries to impose on his son, and the son who tries to assert himself as an adult, but the circumstances we see, reveal that Reda is rather a fish out of water. Through the numerous meetings, they actually ally quite well despite their differences. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's great that this movie was released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji and that he has the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their Haj. The final scene of Mecca is truly a sight to behold, and you too will feel claustrophobia and fear as Reda tries to hunt down his father among the thousands of people who gather. The places of interest of Europe have perhaps been deliberately not dwelt in order to build the wait and concentrate on the final destination. <br /> <br /> He certainly played the thought of telling and showing loved ones at home how much you appreciate them for who they are. Don't miss it, and yes, book early - I was pleasantly surprised that this evening's session was still full.
