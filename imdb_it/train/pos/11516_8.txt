I'm not a complete John Cleese (although I thought "Fawlty Towers was brilliant), but I'm a fan and when I saw this session, neglected, on a shelf of my local Blockbuster, I decided to try it. What I got is It was a wonderful surprise, and one of the most enjoyable 50-minute viewing experiences I've ever had. The text is a typical English goon show, in fact, like an audio skit, it wouldn't be out of place on a Firesign album Theater ", but the execution and timing are clear and this elevates" Strange Case "into a sort of amazing performance that can create fanatics of British comedy for life. <br /> <br /> The Brits have a gift for the combination of great satirical satyrs with strictly observed "tics" of character and timing, and the creators both use them with good results here. if he has such a skill for physical comedy that he has more than his own, but the unexpected surprise here is Arthur Lowe, who plays "Watson" as a genial but invincible non-sympathetic fool with such extraordinary timing and delivery to become the best aspect of the film. I had never heard of Lowe before this (his background seems to be vaudeville and musical theater), but he justifies his whole career with this performance as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br /> Some people may not take care of "Strange Case ...", especially if the British fantasy is not their "cuppa tea". But I'm extremely happy to have seen it before it disappeared from view.
