It is tempting to define the genre of Gert de Graaff's film as a "thought event" following the example of Merab Mamardashvili. The nominal plot is a tortuous search by Bart Klever for that ephemeral substance that constitutes the essence of the personality. The script of his new film takes shape simultaneously on his computer and in his imagination. This monologue film was born as an answer to "8 Â½" by Fellini and costs Gert de Graaff 13 years of work. Playing with exciting real and imaginary characters and with the public, he reveals the extravagant interconnection between real and imaginary, the paradoxical coexistence in two different galaxies: that of Guttenberg and that of MacLhuen. For some time we are inclined to stand with the screenwriter, who believes that the cause of all misfortunes is the damned stereotypes of the mass mentality ("man", "catholic", "window cleaner"). And together with him we fall into a trap when the author-creator is finally faced with the insoluble dilemma: how can he be eliminated from the film of the future. Bart Klever? Only five minutes before the finale, thanks to the common reproaches of the creator's wife, deeply immersed in the work, we realize that together with the main character we have been "framed" again. Really, what is the price of art for which it is acceptable to renounce one's name and daily care for the young daughter? <br /> <br /> So who is he, this Bart? Klever? Is he a brilliant prophet or someone possessed like Frenhoffer by Balzac's masterpiece (just like the latter that the screenwriter eventually erases everything he wrote from the computer's memory)? Gert de Graaff suggests we answer this question ourselves. <br /> <br />
