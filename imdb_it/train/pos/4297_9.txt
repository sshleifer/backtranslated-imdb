Every now and then a director brings a unique group of people to life and lets you in to see the things that make us human. Lawrence Kasden did this again. I always thought that Bg Cill was the anthem of his age and that he managed to do it again in the Grand Canyon. Sometimes we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and so often we blow it. This is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience life because of that choice. The juxtaposition of small and large events that shows us how fundamentally insignificant the things we care about is truly brilliant. I have seen this movie several times and am constantly surprised by how deep the emotions that go through this film are. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline play their roles with great tenderness and the portrait of Stever Martins of an exec film is priceless. Thanks again Mr. Kasden
