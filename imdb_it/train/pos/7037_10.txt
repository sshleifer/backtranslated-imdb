This is a brilliant political satire. No wonder why it was largely ignored in the United States: it exposes our foreign murderous policy to what it really is. <br /> <br /> Another good film of this era, Rendition, was totally rejected simply because it showed, with precision, that the United States is a war machine determined to torture, kill and mutilate civilians in its search for the total domain. <br /> <br /> A clever storyline, good acting, some great stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei someone?) And some hilarious scenes should have made this film a success. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are complicit in mass murder.
