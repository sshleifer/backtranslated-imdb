Of course, I don't know anything about baseball, I'm not even a fan of the sport, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the last Farrelly brothers' movie, Fever Pitch, a charming and irreverent romantic comedy. The film is not really about baseball; rather, it is really about relationships, and the emotional disconnection that can often take place. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Fallen ?? giving his best performance to date ?? plays the role of Ben, a lousy and slightly nerdy teacher. Ben is kind of a man-man, who unfortunately never grew up, and promotes an almost fanatical addiction to the Red Sox baseball team. Ben has dedicated his life to the Sox, and does everything to make the pilgrimage to Florida for spring training to decorate every square inch of his apartment in team paraphernalia. <br /> <br /> One day, as he holds his honors geometry class on a trip to his office, Ben meets lover Lindsey (a wonderful Drew Barrymore). Lindsey is a career-oriented kind of corporate girl, but she has a sort of cuteness that Ben finds totally captivating. At first she is reluctant to ask her out, thinking that she's definitely out of her "class" and, Lindsey doesn't immediately see a potential partner in Ben. <br /> <br /> Their first date starts with a disastrous start when Lindsey is hit by a serious case of food poisoning? and his resounding twitches provide the first clue that we're watching a Farrelly brothers movie. Rather than accepting Lindsey's rather urgent request to reschedule, Ben merely plays nursing, in order, and janitor. So Ben cleans the toilet and the dog's teeth, while his love interest is passed out with a bucket near his bed. <br /> <br /> When Lindsay wakes up in the morning and finds him asleep on his couch, the long and arduous process of dismantling the network of anxiety and state ambition begins to think like his standards. Soon they are falling in love, with Lindsey happily accepting Ben's fanatical devotion to his sport. <br /> <br /> Having inherited the seasonal tickets from his beloved uncle, has Ben organized his life around the season ?? he never lost a game. But their relationship, which has progressed smoothly during the winter, hits an obstacle at the start of the season. <br /> <br /> Lindsey wants Ben to do other things, like holidays with his parents and party with his friends, but Ben begins to have problems modulating his interest in meeting Lindsey halfway. Can Lindsey agree to her irrational devotion to summer boys to make their relationship work? Can he really welcome Ben's infatuation with sport? Can a diehard and passionate Red Sox fan find true love after all? Of course, Lindsey and Ben have a colorful assortment of friends armed with opinions. Lindsey's strictest friend, the skinny, rich and blonde Robin (KaDee Strickland), insists that there must be something wrong with the boy if he is still single at 30. However, chubby and curly Sarah (Marissa Jaret Winokur) and Molly (Ione Skye) provides a more optimistic and positive view of Ben. <br /> <br /> Ben's eccentricity could be applied to virtually any obsessive sports fan, while Lindsay's frustrations could be representative of any upwardly career-driven woman. Fallon is as formidable as Ben, displaying real potential for the big screen, overcoming the insignificant challenge of keeping Ben from being unpleasant. Barrymore, meanwhile, is just as charming of the Lindsey workaholic, particularly when he struggles to accept Ben for what he is without losing sight of his needs. <br /> <br /> Fever Pitch really works, and although there are many inspired comic moments, the film also addresses the serious problem of sports addiction and how difficult it is for couples to negotiate this fragile territory. <br /> <br /> Much of the film was shot at Fenway Park in Boston, which adds a subtle sense of authenticity to the process, as well as the atmosphere of the games, even if you fully appreciate what happened with the team will probably be limited to baseball fans. Even so, Fever Pitch is blessed with a script so finely crafted and intelligently funny that even novice fans will find a lot to connect. Mike Leonard, 5 September.
