I loved this movie. It was almost the same as the first (a hut by the lake), but instead of killing only women, it also kills men. And the scenes are much more interesting, 2 of my favorite scenes are first, when Stanley and Allison are in the disco and are describing Kimberly's last moments before she is thrown into the water, and secondly, when Stanley is visiting Allison in her basement, just before they go down to the set, when she kisses him. Those scenes, for me, were very intense and compelling. I gave the film an 8/10 rating, not because the film was bad, but because the footage was bad, I mean there were times when you noticed that there was nothing wrong, like it was shot in the way you usually shoot a movie, you wouldn't see the "live" footage, but then, very little, you'll notice the shooting errors. What went wrong??
