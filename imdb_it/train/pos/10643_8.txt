There was a political documentary, recently harvested, entitled Why We Fight, which attempts to examine the infamous Military Industrial Complex and its hold on this nation. He is considered both argumentative and incisive in asserting his thesis against the complex fiasco of war in which we are currently involved in Iraq. Still, a far more famous series of films, with the same name, was made during World War II, by Hollywood director Frank Capra. Although considered a documentary, and having won Oscars in this category, this seven-movie series is really, really simple, more in the vein of Leni Reifenstal's Triumph Of The Will, scenes that Capra recycles for his purposes. That said, this does not mean that it has no vital information that successive generations of WWII documentaries (such as the BBC praised The World At War) were missing, nor does it mean that its value as a primary source is all the less valuable. They are cleverly crafted and, having recently bought some used DVDs at a discount store, I found myself with the opportunity to select a free DVD with my purchase. I chose the collection of four DVDs from the Goodtimes DVD series. <br /> <br /> Something free has rarely been so valuable. Although there are no extras on DVDs, and the sound quality of the prints varies, these films give an idea of ​​the minds of Americans two-thirds of a century ago when racism was obvious (as in many of the classic Warner Brothers pro- war cartoons of the time), and there was nothing wrong with a clear distortion of the facts. The seven films, produced between 1942 and 1945, are Prelude To War, The Nazis Strike, Divide And Conquer, The Battle of Great Britain, The Battle of Russia, The Battle of China and The War arrives in America. <br /> <br /> In general, it is worth looking at the film series, not only for the obvious reasons, but for the subtle things it reveals, such as the use of the plural for terms like X million in reference to dollars , rather than the modern single, or the most abused graphic of the whole series - a Japanese sword that pierces the center of Manchuria. However, it also shows the complexity of the attempt to apply past standards to current wars. The lesson of the First World War (to avoid foreign entanglements) was not applicable to the Second World War, whose lesson (early against dictatorships) was not applicable in the three main wars America has fought since: Korea, Vietnam and Iraq. The fact that much of this series touches the uncertainties of the times in which it was created underlines only its historical value in today's times clogged with information. It may not help you solve the truth from today's lies and propaganda, but at least you will realize that you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position, nor will you be the last.
