Butch the peacemaker? Evidently. After the violent start with Spike, Tom and Jerry swinging at each other, Butch calls a setback and wants to know why. It's a good question. <br /> <br /> "Cats can get along with dogs, right?" he asks Tom, who nods in approval. "Mice can get along with cats, right?" Jerry nods "no" and then sees that it is not the right answer. <br /> <br /> Come in and Butch draws a "Peace Treaty" (complete with professional artwork!). Most of the rest, and most cartoons, are extremely pleasing to each other. What a refreshing change of pace. I found it fun to watch. I can a million of these cartoons in which every beat is exceeded. <br /> <br /> However, you knew that peace would not last. A big piece of steak marks the death of the "peace treaty", but during the trip it was a nice change and still had some of the usual Tom & Jerry humor.
