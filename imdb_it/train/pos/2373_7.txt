Pendragon Pictures' new film "War of the Worlds by H G Wells", the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been in development for about 5 years. A theatrical version was scheduled for this year (March 2005), but it never happened. The DVD came out in a hurry to coincide with the release of Spielberg's version, which will be released in theaters on June 29th. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, with some reservations. <br /> <br /> How faithful is the adaptation? It is not 100% faithful to the Wells book, but 90-95% of the faithful is good enough for me. At least several scenes were totally new, such as Ogilvy, the astronomer's confrontation with a peasant, and the unnamed writer / narrator who awkwardly took tea with his cousin. But overall, this film follows the book very closely - certainly much more than the classic 1953 version of George Pal. <br /> <br /> The biggest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget. Most appear to have been shot on a blue screen and composed of digitally rendered backgrounds. This is particularly annoying during most of the internal shots and crowded city street scenes. The 1898 London panoramas resemble something of a video game. Numerous horse-drawn carriage scenes were fake - I guess they couldn't afford to rent a horse. The only scenes shot for "real" seem to be those in open fields or forests. <br /> <br /> But within those budget restrictions, they managed to do a lot. Artistically, the film looks right. The Martians and their tripods are well made and very faithful to Wells' descriptions. I was particularly struck by the heat beam. Although the Thunder Child sequence, which should have been one of the highlights of the film, is very disappointing. It's a pity they can't afford more real sets or better quality animations. <br /> <br /> Acting and directing win no Oscars. For the most part, they are competent, not bad, but not exceptional. The music is also quite good, although not on par with any of the major Hollywood composers. <br /> <br /> I'm really glad this didn't have a film release, because the budget limitation would have made it look a lot worse on a big screen. At present, I will evaluate this in a similar way to an adaptation of classic BBC literature. <br /> <br /> Some nitpicks: most of the scenes have different colored filters (mainly red). This may have been an artistic choice, but it is used inconsistently and seems more like a sloppy job of burning the DVD. And the obviously fake mustache of the writer / narrator changes from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - Is it worth seeing? If you can overcome the technical and budget limits and get into the story, I think you'll like it, especially if you've read H G Wells' original novel. If, however, you are easily discouraged by low production values, you better let it pass (unless you're a fan of MST3K). Attention, however, the film lasts 3 hours, so I don't recommend looking at it all at once. <br /> <br /> BTW: A completely different version of War of the Worlds (aka "INVASION") was released on DVD the same month as Spielberg was released in theaters: http://imdb.com/title/ tt0449040 /. This was also done on a budget, but it is updated to the present day like Spielberg's film - but it's much better! And to top it off, Jeff Wayne is making an animated film from his best-selling 1978 album, but it won't be until 2007.
