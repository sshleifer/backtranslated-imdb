Henri Verneuil's film may not be as famous as Parallax View, 3 Days of the Condor or JFK, but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic representatives of the genre. The action takes place in the imaginary western state where the fictitious president was killed. After several years of investigation, a special government commission decides that the president was killed by a lone gunman. But one man - the prosecutor Volney, played by Yves Montand - thinks there is still something to investigate and so the film begins. This film does not address some exact theories, but embraces the entire structure of the relationship between government and society in today's world. This film could only be made in the 70s but it will never lose its relevance. Moreover, it is also a bit scary how precise his oracles are. 10 out of 10.
