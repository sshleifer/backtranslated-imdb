I read so many comments that I too shared the memory of this film and wanted to see it again so badly, but I didn't know the name of the film. Fortunately, due to a search and finding the title on this site, I read the comments left here and realized that this was the film I remembered. So I did a search and found the movie and I was so excited to be able to watch the movie again after 40 years. Because of this site and your comments, you helped me and so I want to thank you all. I want to share how I managed to find this film for all of you who were looking for a copy. It was in the VHS version of "Call it Courage" by Wonderful World of Disney which contained 2 films, the second was "The legend of the boy and the eagle". It touched me now like 40 years ago and now I own my copy. I think it's only available on VHS. I found it on ebay and saw several copies there. Have fun, I know I did it! <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful story about a boy's love and the eagle he worked on. When it was time to sacrifice the eagle, the boy freed the eagle because he could not allow him to be killed. After the boy was forced to leave the tribe for punishment after releasing the eagle, the eagle also saved the boy's life and more than that, taught him how to survive. The closeness between the boy and the eagle in the desert was so moving and the shooting was truly remarkable. What a wonderful time this was. I've never seen anything approach this movie!
