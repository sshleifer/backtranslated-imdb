Olivier, Kosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli and Almerayeda all led Hamlet but Branagh is the only one who understood correctly. <br /> <br /> This is the only "Hamlet" film that contains the full four hours of William Shakespeare's masterpiece gives a unique feel to the whole story. <br /> <br /> Not many directors could pull it off without boring the audience, but Branagh's skillful use of the bravura movie style and stunt cast allows people to see the importance of the scenes they usually are cut. <br /> <br /> Examples of this include Gerarde Depardue as Ranyaldo, whose purpose was simply to say "yes my lord" when Polonio asks him to spy on Leartes. This also included Billy Crystal as the tombstone seeker, Robin Williams as Osric, Jack Lemmon as Marcellous and Charlton Heston as an actor. <br /> <br /> Branagh in the role of the soliloquy of scene 4 in scene 4 (which is usually cut out again) is nothing short of cinematic wonder while the camera slowly retreats with increasing intensity. It is a scene that literally made me want to jump out of my chair and start applauding. <br /> <br /> Branagh is the only director who understood the importance of every scene in this film and knew how to convey that importance to the general public. <br /> <br /> This is a must see for all those who love good story, brilliant acting and incredible direction. All these parts of the great triumph of William Shakespeare.
