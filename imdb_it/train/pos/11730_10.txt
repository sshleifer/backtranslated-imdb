What can be said of Elvira that has not already been said in the world press? The classic comic that IS Elvira offers in its first large-scale life-size masterpiece. <br /> <br /> From the very first thing to the frame of the cinema, Elvira encloses a recitative punch that clearly says Film Great .... eat your heart out, Bette Davis! Admire a desolate Elvira, see an excitable Elvira, see a jealous Elvira, see an irritating Elvira. You can't help but marvel at its agonizing prowess! <br /> <br /> At the center of this comic masterpiece is Elvira's desire for the Las Vegas show celebrity. Despite having inserted "the breast in the boobtube" as a horror hostess (with the tallest), Elvira emotionally finds the small constructive screen ... and PHYSICALLY! Nuff said, he puts his bag back and heads east ... a hot dog in one hand and a letter from his aunt's lawyer outlining his "positive effect" in the other. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie so many times, I can almost recite it literally ... (literally it would only be on display)! <br /> <br /> Take a copy, reduce silly, learn the jokes .... <br /> <br /> Because he didn't win the Oscar for best actress for this role is beyond me.
