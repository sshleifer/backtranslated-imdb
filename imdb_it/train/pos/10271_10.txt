This film should not be compared to "The Sting" or other caper / robbery / scam movies. What makes a cinematic experience so exceptional is what it has to say about relationships, deceit and trust. It is also a fairly sharp criticism of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then behaves so primitive in the ending. Has Mr. Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy? Highly recommended highly!
