I haven't always been a fan, but the show has grown on me. It wasn't until after the fifth season that I started to see the richness of the show. Eventually they completed Daniel Jackson's research for his wife and finally most of the Go, System Lords were killed by rivals Lords, SG-1 or others. <br /> <br /> Towards season 5, Stargate SG-1, was starting to become stale. With the new writers and the attention of the producer Peter Deleuise, the show has become increasingly solid. <br /> <br /> Even the characters have become stale. Colonel Jack O'Neill was the stereotyped hero with an emotional baggage. After his son Charlie was killed in an O'Neill weapon shooting incident, he decided to end his life by going to Abydos to face the Go'ould RA. The character offers little growth for any actor and actor Richard Dean Anderson has chosen to play him as a character that raises emotional barriers to protect himself. just allowing his closest friends in. <br /> <br /> Amanda Tapping joined the cast as Captain Samantha Carter. She was a feminist on the edge, ready to fight any man who doubted his ability to do his job. Although this character had a small area of ​​growth, Tapping did a great job of focusing on Carter's strengths. It has taken the time to understand in a basic way some of the things that Carter talks about in order to present the character in an intelligent way. <br /> <br /> Christopher Judge joined the cast playing the alien Teal'c. Teal'c was an alien called Jaffa. The small Go'ould (snake-like creatures) would be incorporated into the Jaffa until they grew to the point where they would be placed in another life form. The Jaffa would die. Teal'c was the first prime minister of Apophis. Knowing that Apophis was not a god as Go'ould pretended, he realized the genocide their armies had caused on the galaxy. In the end, having had enough, he and Jack O'Neill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people. After arriving on Earth, he realized that the Earth was the planet he was looking for, which would help him fight the Go'ould. Christopher Judge did a lot with a limited character. Teal'c is a wise warrior, much of whom he learned from master Bra'tac. The show would not be complete without Master Bra'tac played by Tony Amandola. It is also a rock. Eventually, he became an adviser to most of SG-1, in particular Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Don S. Davil was there from the beginning to play Major General George Hammand. Davis did an incredible job with Hammond making him nice and normal. He does his job, he has a wife, sons and daughters and grandchildren. You can really say that it's the anchor of the base. I would simply die for that man. If it is not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams outside the world. He will go himself. He leaves no one behind. <br /> <br /> I saved Dr. Daniel Jackson last, because this character, I believe, has grown more in the last ten or eleven years. In choosing Shanks I don't think the producer realized how strong Shanks would be and now, when people talk about Jackson, they don't talk about Spader, they talk about Shanks. In the early years, the character of Jackson came out as a whiner. That's why I probably wasn't a fan. With the passing of the seasons, the character has become stronger. This gave him confidence. Eventually, starting with season 10, Jackson's character matured to the point that he became a self-sacrificing hero. Check the group ethics again. It is still leading the supply of information that can carry out any mission. Aacheaology, history, culture and exploration are part of his very being. It is determined. Although he is a man of peace, he has matured to the point that using his weapons can be the only way to resolve a disagreement. <br /> <br /> Other characters include, more recently: Vala Mal Doran (Claudia Black) and Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder), new SG-1 protagonists. Both actors come from a series called Farscape and the reason they were put together is any hypothesis. I see little difference between Mitchell and Crichton (Farscape character). Black's character is simply off the wall. Definitely different from his character like Arin Soon.
