A remarkable piece of documentary, which offers a vivid representation of a country deeply divided in itself (for further evidence, take a look at some of the comments on IMDb ...!). Compare extremely favorable with Oliver Stone's "Commander" (which is mainly a thorough examination of Fidel Castro's nostril hair). I don't know if Chavez is all that looks like he is, or yet another in the long series of Latin American populist "caudillos". Nor do I know if he will be able to remedy the enormous expectations he has clearly built among the poor majority of Venezuelans. It is not reasonable to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions - but now I certainly have a clear idea of ​​what is at stake, and how one feels involved in a coup. Someone says in the film "we're making history", and that's exactly what the movie seems to capture. Exceptional stuff.
