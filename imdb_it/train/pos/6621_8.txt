I have just returned from a preliminary view of this excellent science fiction film. The style is definitely unique and very well done. It is shot with real actors, but turned into a black and white comic style never seen before. It goes one step further than Sin City, and does it well. It is a winning combination of French comics and film cultures. The story and the atmosphere remind Blade Runner, and if you liked that you will surely like it too. The plot is smart, never boring and has some nice twists. This film is a must for every cinephile except perhaps for those who absolutely don't like science fiction or b & w.
