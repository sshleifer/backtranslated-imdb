Roman Polanski plays Trelkovsky who rents an apartment in France. The previous tenant is in a hospital after a suicide attempt. He goes to see her where he also meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani), Simone's friend. He and Stella become quite close. Lord Simone dies. Trelkovsky begins to think that the landlord and neighbors are trying to change him to Simone so that in the end he too would jump out of the window. last film of Polanski's apartment trilogy. The precedents were Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby. Roman Polanski doesn't do a good job just as a director, but his acting is also superb. Isabelle Adjani with her big glasses is wonderful. The landlord, Mr. Zy, is played by the great Melvyn Douglas.Jo Van Fleet plays Madame Dioz. The fantastic Shelley Winters is The Concierge. The tenant is something very scary from time to time. It gives a lot of psychological fright. This film is not the easiest to understand or explain, but it makes everything so fascinating.
