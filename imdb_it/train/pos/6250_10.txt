There is something special about Austrian films, not only of Seidl, but also of Spielmann and other directors. This is the penetrating sense of reality that never leaves the viewer throughout the film. Hundstage is no exception. This effect is achieved not only by the painted stories but also by the actors acting. In Hundstage I never had the feeling that these actors are playing, but real people instead. So real is the visceral feeling of the viewer ... Almost as if the grumpy pensioner or the lonely lady in the movie lived below you on your block. <br /> <br /> Any person living in Vienna can no doubt painfully recognize the people in the film with their meckern / sudern (complaining), their hidden sexual impulses and the prolo-macho boys. This is further reinforced by the Viennese dialect which, according to many, is made especially to complain about lifestyle. A special parochial and the typical Vienna arrogance are also very well represented. <br /> <br /> The Viennese suburbs have a vivid presence in the film with their torpor and drowsiness where nothing happens. Furthermore, they have been transformed into a celebration of materialism with shopping centers and department stores. Among them are the homes of people who indulge in what they consider pleasure activities, trying to stay in touch with their human selves, but in vain. The examples are the sexual play of the old lady with the men that bordered on rape, the child who loses nerves and strikes his girlfriend and the young woman who hitchhikes and irritates her drivers. <br /> <br /> The film has no soundtrack as it focuses exclusively on the normality / abnormality of its images. Another typical feature of Seidl (and other Austrian directors) is its representation of sexually disturbing images. These include the stripping of the old woman for her husband, the sexual scenes in the bathtub, the sexual play of the lady with the two men in her apartment, etc. <br /> <br /> In Hundstage Seild portrayed the lives of people who could ultimately be as much Viennese as citizens of Paris, New York or Madrid. Viewers should not despise or feel pity for the Viennese in the film because they themselves could become victims of the same human estrangement and alienation, even if in different circumstances. In the end, I think Seidl's film is warning us about the terrible state of human relations so brutally revealed in Hundstage. And if the viewer does not succumb to the reasons for this evil transformation, Seidl has achieved his goal.
