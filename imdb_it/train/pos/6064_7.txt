I have to start by telling you how I came across this movie. It was winter in Alaska around the year 1990. An Australian friend of mine was staying with me and my girlfriend in a shoe box of an apartment. Winters in Alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay at home, drink heavily and watch everything that comes on television. I had found this film outside of a thrift store in a snow bank and immediately was a treasure again. Best worst film ever. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish. We have watched so many times that sometimes we would have turned the TV to one side or upside down for a fuller filling effect. It is a real gem. The laughter will come on and the memories will last forever. If you see this movie for rent in a video store, steal it. You will not regret!
