A carefree comedy, Nothing shows us a world we sometimes want to escape: a world of nothing. Anything you don't like, be it a pile of bills, a bad memory or even hunger, can disappear according to your wishes. They approached this film very well and, with a star duo, there were only a few things that I didn't like about Nothing, and they weren't even part of the main movie. <br /> <br /> First, the post-credit scene (and yes, there is one): good for a laugh, but what were they trying to get? I was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing. Instead, we hear only a random assortment of noises and scream. Try to create a sequel in my opinion, and it wasn't really necessary, nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of the frame. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the trailer: I saw the trailer on the DVD and, as others have said, promotes a horror film that never arrived. Oh, poor marketing, I guess. <br /> <br /> If you see it in your movie rental store, take a look, because Nothing is a great movie to watch. If you have a big screen, you may want to wear shades.
