This film surprised me in a good way. From the box I had the impression that it was an action thriller but it was too much fun to be a thriller, even if it was a little exciting. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of good jokes and funny situations in this movie and James Belushi was born to make Bill Manucci, he does a great job. Even the rest of the cast is not at all evil, and especially Timothy Dalton is a pleasure. <br /> <br /> The story can get quite confusing when the new characters appear during the movie. Things get complicated because rarely nobody tells the truth about things. If you don't pay attention, in the end things could get a little confused, but I really liked it. <br /> <br /> Louis Morneau is not very well known, but he did a perfectly fine job with this and I never really got impatient watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Made men are worth a try.
