Ya. This is what I think. Of course, it was still a great show with John, but personally I think it's better without it. <br /> <br /> I like having CJ and grandfather living at home because they are so much fun together. <Br /> <br /> When John was still around, I didn't laugh as much as I do now. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that no others are made. (I don't think ...) because I'd like to see new material. <br /> <br /> My favorite character must be Rory. poor Rory is almost always excluded. It's always about Bridget or Carrie. WHAT ABOUT RORY !!! ??? Honestly this is a great show and for anyone who has never looked at it you have to go and see it. I almost guarantee you that you will laugh. good also to giggle.
