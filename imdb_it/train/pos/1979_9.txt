Me and my girlfriend, Annette, we watched this together and we both comment. <br /> <br /> We both really enjoyed watching it even though it took liberties with Dicken's work. A lot of Dicken's works are rather dark and gloomy (including Oliver Twist), but this film has changed all that. It was fun, colorful (both visually and musically), and the characters were more carefree. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: Normally, I don't care much for musical and dance films, but the songs in this production were catchy and lively, and the choreography was fantastic. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: This says a lot from Travis. I can't stress enough how good the dance numbers were. You can say, for example, that those guys have really worked hard to complete routines to perfection. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: Three actors really stood out IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed) and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). Friend, that Oliver Reed can really do a good villain. That scene where you see his eyes through the mail slot gave me the chills down my spine ... AWESOME. And that boy Jack Wild was a perfect Artful Dodger. And Nancy was fantastic (man, I felt bad when she was killed). She too can sing! Congratulations to the casting department for their choices there. I hated Oliver Twist's kid. He was too whiny and skinny for my taste. (I kept wishing that Bill Sikes would throw it in the mud during the chase scene.) And they shouldn't even let him sing. ANNETTE: Acting was really superb. In addition to the three stars mentioned by Travis, I heard that Ron Moody (Fagin) did an extraordinary job. He was so funny and at the same time slightly sinister. Even the secondary actors were fantastic. Harry Secombe played his role as Mr. Bumble extremely well. And he has a wonderful singing voice. I saw Mr. Secombe perform in another film called "Davy" where he played an opera singer with pleasant results. The talented Harry Secombe should have acted in many other films. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: As I said before, the story is not entirely true to the book, but IMO was more robust. Not even this film was boring, as some musicals seem to be. And continuity allowed you to get on with the characters. The melodies did not diminish the plot or put you to sleep too long. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: any musical film that Travis observes completely must be a rare find. And this is indeed a rare find. It is a very easy to look production that transports the viewer fluidly and pleasantly to the end. On a day when the films all look like effects combined with cute faces, this was a refreshing interlude. <br /> <br /> Our combined score was 8.5 out of 10. (In this case, we will round up to 9.). <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: I evaluated this 7 mainly because the kid Oliver Twist (Mark L.) irritated me, and his songs were torture for my sensitive ears. Otherwise, it was an exceptional film. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: My vote is 10. Movies are not much better than this. And you can say that all the people involved in this production have worked hard to make it what it was ... a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Please don't miss it ... even if you don't normally like musicals. It is indeed a rare treat.
