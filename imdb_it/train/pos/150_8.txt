The last film by Spanish director Agusti Villaronga is a study on how children who live violence and isolation in their remote community, turn into young adults in difficulty who need some psychic tools to face their hidden mental fragility. If these tools are religious followed at a fanatic level, taking care of others or simply putting up a macho image while engaging as prostitutes, Villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in Spain under Franco. The three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and then bury the emotions they experience with their fragile fragile bodies until they meet again in the hospital for those suffering from tuberculosis. <br /> <br /> the cinematographic style of the text is typically visually opulent as one would expect from a Spanish author and is extremely reminiscent of the work of his Spanish colleague Pedro Almodovar with themes that deal with sexual desire, both heterosexual and homosexual. An element that is different between the two directors is that Villaronga favors a supernatural undertone combined with a gritty and claustrophobic realism opposed to Almodovar's use of surrealism, although both styles are similar. <br /> <br /> The piece offers a vision in distress young psyche and contains violent violence and scenes of a sexual nature. I highly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the public for a considerable period after watching.
