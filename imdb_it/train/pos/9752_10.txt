I vaguely remember seeing him when I was 3, then my parents accidentally recorded everything, but a few seconds with other cartoons. Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I rediscovered it and since then I've been able to understand things better, so I thought it was a good movie. Fast forward to Just a few weeks ago (June 2006) when I found out I discovered it through some articles on the Internet / video clips and it's not the same movie. I'm sure he's still good with children, but for us 20-30 there's definitely written "Cult Status" written everywhere. It is a pity that the original production went through a painful process; if Fox had given enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today. Maybe if they had to do it again with a completely different story and a cast of all the stars could be, but it's up to Fox to decide. I'm wandering here, I know. I still think it's a great movie, but it could be more than nice.
