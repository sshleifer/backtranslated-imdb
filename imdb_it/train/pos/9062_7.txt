It's a weekend I've been watching this funny movie. and I really like it. all the kids are cute, they remind me of my childhood with those stupid thoughts. It's a fun movie for a group of families during the weekend night, which could make many memories and laughter. Children's humor always works. nice acting as well. simple story but fashion shot. nice job for directer to find the way of the child. when it comes to children's films, I think of "12 and waiting". another this year but it looks different than the world of children, which is real and cruel. amazing work. H2EFW focuses on the positive side of childhood, which every child and every family needs. post scriptum Twitch, I think, is Nemo's voice from "Finding Nemo".
