I'm not sure I understand where all these enthusiastic anti-resentment characters are talking, maybe it's just that some people like to complain about things. <br /> <br /> The film was definitely imperfect (uneven acting, could have had difficulties with time changes, the actors are too eager to go to places where I would prefer not to go, etc.) but IMHO were some things that more than compensated for imperfections. <br /> <br /> First of all, I loved the "break the rules" bit. NORMALLY when you leave the haunted house the bad guys leave you alone, giving you time to reorganize, to have friends and find the mysterious type of paranormal. NORMALLY (semi-spoiler alarm) when you hide under the covers you can only let yourself pass through that small opening from which the cops. NORMALLY in the end the ghosts somehow became less disturbing because you discovered that they are just misunderstood, or that they were released, or whatever. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the production was exceptional. While the film was barely special effects, the supernatural bits were short but extremely well made. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best kind of film for those who think that Freddy and Jason are the last type of horror (nothing against them, they got their place), but great for those who started to take conventions for granted and have no problems with temporal distortions.
