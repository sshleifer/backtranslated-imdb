For a happy coincidence, the same year that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak released Alfred Hitchcock's eerie masterpiece "Vertigo", they also made this light comedy. Maybe the two actors had to do it after suffering the heaviness of the Hitchcock movie. However this is a great piece to accompany "Vertigo" while exploring a very unlikely but powerful love story. In fact the film can be seen as the reverse side of the "Vertigo" medal with its happy ending. Here too Novak undergoes a transformation, in Vertigo he essentially plays two women and here "turns" from a witch into a mortal. Stewart is again bewitched and for a while tormented by his love for her. Unlike Vertigo the two come together in "Bell Book and Candle", a perfect antidote for Hitcock's film. Again the dynamics of love and attraction are examined, but in a completely different vein. The cast is exceptional. Exhilarating Lemmon like a sorcerer's brother from Novak and Elsa Lancaster who give a classic performance like the aunt. Ernie Kovacs, an alcohol writer and of course Hermoine Gingold who plays the role of Novak, is fantastic. The scene with Stewart drinking the potion is comedy at its best. Anyone who has seen Vertigo or even if they haven't seen it should see this memorable light comedy.
