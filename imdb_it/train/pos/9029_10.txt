I saw that movie a few days ago. This film is so beautiful that it makes me feel that if you want something really ugly that you've always dreamed of, you can have it. This shows a great desire that becomes reality through happiness and sadness, without hope and without success. But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something you love you can make things different and be happy.
