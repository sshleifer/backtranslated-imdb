This must be one of the best films released in Hong Kong since a long time, I was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just by looking at the title. A lot of fantastic actors in this show and I was particularly impressed by Sam Lee's incredibly believable behavior and Edison's portrait of a killing machine, which completely reversed his normal idol image. I would certainly recommend it to those looking for an elegant and action-packed film. However, I must warn you, this is also an equally depressing film, given that every character in the film is in a sort of blind alley and its own problems and struggles to breathe. It makes you think about what life really is.
