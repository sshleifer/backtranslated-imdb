It's time to scream, eh: I thought Spirit was a great movie to watch. However, there have been some things that prevent me from classifying it higher than a 6 or 7 (I'm a little generous with 7). <br /> <br /> Point # 1: Matt Damon aggravates me. I was thinking, 'what a crazy voice they had for the main character,' when I first heard him tell - and then I realized that it's Matt Damon. The man bothered me so much - his performance in "The Departed" was terrible and ruined the film for me (before the film had a chance to get ruined, but that's another story for some other time) , like almost "Spirit" ". I was able to overcome this fact because of how little narrative there really was ... fortunately. <br /> <br /> Step 2: Brian Adams sucks ... The whole score was terrible ... The songs were not original, generic and poorly executed, not once did I find the right music, and the lyrics were terrible. Every time one of the limping songs came on, I was turned off. to start feeling patriotic propaganda stuck in the super-American liberty-style texts (I couldn't help remembering those terrible patriotic songs that were constantly playing on the radio after September 11th) In light of the film's native American aspects, they should have gone with the music to datta using right tools, not petty radio-hit, teen-bop, fourteen years old. I thought I was back to middle school. I can't believe we can't do better, I refuse. If it hadn't been for that, I'd classify the movie with Disney more, know something about originality (ok, don't worry about saying what I know some of you are probably thinking;). Too bad, it's a pity they couldn't hire better musicians. <br /> <br /> I liked art and animation, with the exception of a few things here and there ... as sometimes the corners appear too sharp on the face and the lines are too thick or dark on the body ( thick / dark lines mainly near the end). There were often times when I thought I had tried too hard on emotions and facial expressions and couldn't get any real emotion. But there were also times when the excitement ran strong. However, many scenes were lazy and the layers were obvious. <br /> <br /> OK, I'm falling asleep here, so I'll summarize everything before I start making less sense ... <br /> <br /> Nice attempt at an epic movie ... it was mediocre. Matt Damon, you suck!
