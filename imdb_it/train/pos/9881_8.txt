In the West of Hollywood those hands were an agitated group that celebrated quite well when they arrived in the city. After all, trail driving was a solitary affair the day before the railways arrived in all parts of the United States. <br /> <br /> The drovers who worked for the trail master Gil Favor, played by Eric Fleming, were no different. But Fleming was a man of all business, he had a job to do and he hired a higher level crew to do it. <br /> <br /> With the long run of Rawhide and the fact that the regular customers kept us for the most part, we got to know all the cowhands at some point. Some narrative lines were focused on all of them, though most were with the character of Fleming and Clint Eastwood, Rowdy Yates, boy number 2 with the herd. <br /> <br /> The western image of Clint Eastwood was modeled by Rawhide, it's a shame that these are not shown more often. Probably because they were made in black and white. If it was an NBC show, this would have been done in color as Bonanza and would have been running as often as they are. We could have seen much more than a man who became a legendary move. <br /> <br /> Ironically it was Eric Fleming who left the show before it closed to make films. He made some and hoped that the show would give him a bankable movie name. Unfortunately he was killed in a movie in an action movie, drowned in a river. If he had lived he could have become a name like Eastwood's. <br /> <br /> Clint took on the role of head of track last season and then the show completed its run. And obviously it has become the icon that is today and not just in the Western genre. <br /> <br /> Rawhide was a difficult western with some difficult types. No frills in this, these were cowboys who were doing work and fighting against the elements and situations in which they were thrown away every year. <br /> <br /> They no longer make TV series like these. What a pity.
