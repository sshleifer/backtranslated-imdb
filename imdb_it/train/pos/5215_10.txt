All I can say is, the first film of this season that caught my attention. I chose it for the actors, Gere and Claire, and the story seemed promising ... I just watched it and I can say I'm overwhelmed. There are shocking scenes, true ... but that's what makes it more realistic. We should not run away from our reality, these things are happening right now. And there are experts who are trying to change things and improve things and start laughing at their commitment to the cause. Actually I can't perceive the "Hollywood touch" in the film ... and that's what makes it better. Both Claire and Richard have done a great role, and they deserve a 10 of me.
