I became very fond of Laurence Olivier in the past few weeks and was thrilled when I discovered this gem. I have always found it wonderful when I run into a movie where I don't have to have my finger on the remote control in the event that nudity lifts its ugly head. <br /> <br /> The divorce of Lady X is fascinating until the final scene, and must have been a real pleasure for the spectators in 1938. I only wish that people today could accept and love true humor instead of horror Junk talk that people call now fun. <br /> <br /> The Divorce of Lady X is really worth anyone's time.
