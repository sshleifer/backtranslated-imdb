this is the best comedy I've ever seen! but not everyone can understand that you have to be from Georgia to understand this fantastic movie! :) overall one of the best films I've ever seen ......... Vachtangi (Benjamin) and all the supporting actors play very well, but the acting of Kote Daoshvili (father Germogel) is the best for me interpretation of the supporting role in film history :)) many Georgian stars such as hypolite xvichia, sergo Zakariadze, sofiko chiaureli, verikoan djafaridze, Sesilia Takaishvili, Dodo Abashidze are all stars in Georgian cinema :) in this film the great Russian star Evgeni Leonov is playing and, of course, the film's director Georgy Danelia is one of the best ... I recommend this film for everyone, but remember that you have to know a good Russian language to watch this movie
