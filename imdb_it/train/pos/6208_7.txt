The 1997 low-key indie drama Henry Fool would apparently be a safe film choice, no one would have bothered to revisit a sequel. A messy and dissipated tramp (Thomas Jay Ryan) walks in the city. His jokes and anarchic disappointments inspire a nerd of scavengers (James Urbaniak) to write poetry, while Henry reluctantly tries to bathe the boy's sister (Parker Posey). While the poet thrives, Henry refuses. Nothing special about any of the characters or the story. A pitch for Harold and Maude's Ghost would have been listed higher likely to reach a screen. <br /> <br /> But Parker Posey is not the semi-official Indies queen for nothing ". So when writer / director Hal Hartley invented a new incarnation for his cast, a movie was born. Even if we recover the same characters for many years, they find themselves in a completely different dark comedy, this is full of espionage! Henry may have been an international spy - and possibly double or even triple agent - for years before meeting others. and by the authorities of many countries. Everyone wants his diapositive and inconsistent diary which could contain codified secrets that could destabilize the nations and economies Posey's Fay is the wife he left to go on the run, or his widow, depending on who is telling the truth Fay's efforts to find Henry and / or the highly contested magazines include a worldwide competition glove of affected people and multinational henchmen to og ni shift. He never knows whom to believe or believe. Nor us. <br /> <br /> While we breed these unlikely characters in the territory of Jason Bourne / Jack Ryan, Hartley's script maintains the ironic and impassive humor of their first appearance, moving away from farce to expose them to physical threats. His clever flash of paranoia, duplicity and musical presence of today's geopolitical alliances begins to collapse towards the end. Even so, fans of the first film will be pleasantly surprised by the novelty of Hartley's recycling methods. (05/18/07)
