"Radiofreccia" is still a nice surprise in Italian cinema. The film is based on a book by Italian singer-songwriter Luciano Ligabue, who also directs the film and writes the musical score, of course. <br /> <br /> The film is a portrait of the life of the province of northern Italy, in the Emilia Romagna region. We are in 1975, the time of the first free radios - one of the boys of the film creates "Radioraptus". The desires of youth, friendship, love, sex, individual dramas and unemployment are among the themes, but the film also speaks of drugs - Freccia, the main character, is a victim of heroin slavery. <br /> <br /> Without being boring and moralistic, the story flows very well; the spontaneity of the actors is strong and also the way of directing. Obviously Luciano "Liga" Ligabue is neither Fellini nor a film professional, first of all he is a musician. But he manages to make a good product. Unfortunately he will not repeat the success with his second film "From zero to ten", not at all good. <br /> <br /> In "Radiofreccia" the actors are generally not very famous, the only star is Stefano Accorsi - one of the most famous young Italian actors. Look in a small role at another Italian singer -Francesco Guccini, he is the handsome communist bartender and football coach!
