Bettie Page was an icon of the 1950s repressed, when she represented sexual freedom that was still a decade away, but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults. Gretchen Mol does a great job of portraying the scandalous Bettie, who was a provincial girl with acting ambitions and a big body. Her acting career went nowhere, but her body took her to the pinnacle of fame in an openly marginal field. Photogrammed in black and white with color interludes when it comes from the world of exploitation in New York, this made-for-TV film (HBO) has good production values ​​and a very credible supporting cast. The problem is that it is emotionally rather flat. It is difficult to create an attachment to the character, since Bettie is interpreted as a superficial and naive person because of the business in which she was. The government's autonomous investigations receive a lot of time on the screen, which slows the film towards the end. But it is certainly worth looking at the history of the time and seeing the heavy repression of the government which was a characteristic of the fifties. 7/10
