I eagerly looked at the first series, but wondered if I would come back after a long pause. However, I tuned in to episode one of series 2 and was again captured. This is really excellent telly; revolutionary things like Mission: Impossible in the 60s. The characters are well rounded and expand as the series goes on, they change as they adapt - some more readily than others - to their new environment, but they remain skillfully rigorous, yet it is more than possible to have sympathy for someone you wouldn't have thought you could ever feel sorry when something really overwhelming happens. I hope there will be many years of "Lost" so I can't wait - and really I don't care that much if I never get answers to all the mysteries!
