The creators chose the best people for the job and set it beautifully. Every interior is full of details that tells you all about the people who live there. If the period is the twentieth (the first story), the present (ie 1950) for central history, or the 10s (the last), the customs and settings are lovingly observed and created. I love the fussy customs of the two old ladies of the sanatorium - the precious lace covered by the best Shetland shawls. Roland Culver in the role of Ashenden is very attractive, but it doesn't matter to the young and mushy lovers, it is Raymond Huntley the man who resents the health and independence of his wife who rips our emotions. He usually played comic and pompous characters, but here he is subtle, convincing and very impressive. The China Seas (a great movie from the 1930s with Gable and Harlow) stole the plot from the Mr Know All episode (and also broke a Kipling story). I would like to see Naunton Wayne as the jealous husband, even though he has a nice moment that looks like he is melancholy in a Mexican hat. I love that elegant bird that also plays his wife.
