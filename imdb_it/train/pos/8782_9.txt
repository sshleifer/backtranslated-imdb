Freely inspired by James J Corbett's "The Roar Of The Crowd" biography, Gentleman Jim is a wonderfully airy image that perfectly encapsulates not only the rise of the boxer priest who was Corbett, but also the wind of change with regards to sport boxing around 1890. <br /> <br /> The story follows Corbett {a perfectly cast Errol Flynn} from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in San Fransico, through a chance to fight with a former boxing champion who in the end he leads him fighting against the fearsome world heavyweight champion, John L Sullivan {a deliciously Ward Bond beefcake}. Not all fights are in the ring tho, and are all the spin-off cartoons in Corbett's life that makes this a great fun image. There are class problems to overcome here {perfectly played when club members pay for cutting down a peg or two} and Corbett must not only struggle to gain respect from his so-called peers, but must also overcome his ego as he grows as quickly as his reputation. Together with the wonderful Corbett family and their stoic humorous support, Corbett's journey is as compelling as it is joyful, yet as brash and bold as he is, he is a very nice character, and is a character that fits the tagged moniker he got from Gentleman Jim. <br /> <br /> The film never stops for a moment, and it is a testimony of the director Raoul Walsh that, even if we wait impatiently for the final fight, the outer ring is keeping us firmly entertained, not even the sub plot love interest hurts this image {thank you Alexis Smith}. The fight sequences stand up very well and show perfectly how Corbett became the champion he was, his trademark of slugger fighters round dance rings is now firmly embedded in boxing history. As the final reel rolls, we all come down to the ground as a fight after fight between Sullivan and Corbett puts all the brutality into context, and that's where humility and humility become the absolute winner, and as far as this viewer is concerned. .. .......... will make for me to be sure of it, 9/10 for a truly wonderful image.
