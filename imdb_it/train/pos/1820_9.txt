I can remember this movie since I was a small child, I loved it then and I still do it now. I managed to get it on DVD for my 18th birthday and I was happy because I found it so hard to find it before and it was only rented when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie because he learns to be a good dog. The film is full of funny songs and music. The animation is brilliant and the characters' voices are perfect. This film has always been tearful to me, but I think that if I hadn't seen the movie when I was a kid, I wouldn't find it as bright and charming as me, even though I still believe I'd like it anyway because I'm really into animated films.
