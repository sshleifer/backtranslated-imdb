"Lion King 1 1/2" is the funniest non-theatrical version of Disney. I recently saw this movie again after not having seen it in many years. I remember the first time I saw him that I had no expectations and I was pleasantly surprised by this watchable and very funny movie. <br /> <br /> Is it better than "Pride of Simba"? In many ways, yes. Although "The Pride of Simba" was not really bad, he had some problems: lack of a good script and bad characterizations, which had an impact on what would otherwise be an ok film. <br /> <br /> Anyway: it's nice to see The personalities of Timon and Pumbaa bloom again in the way we (or surely I) loved them in this movie; in "The Pride of Simba" they were completely annoying and I didn't even like the "Timon and Pumbaa" series. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily have been a fool, but fortunately the filmmakers didn't take the wrong turn and instead focused on making this movie at times extremely hilarious. There are some jokes that adults can enjoy alone. The score is quite good. There are two new songs, which are catchy and two new characters, Timon's mother, (voiced by the recognizable Julie Kavner by Marge Simpsons) and Uncle Max, who are fun. The friendship between Timon and Pumbaa is touchingly portrayed. Emotional scenes are well integrated into comic history and don't feel out of place, which could easily have been done (especially in comedies). <br /> <br /> But is there anything that distracts this image from getting 10 votes from me? Yes there is. Although fortunately they don't have an excessive impact, but I will mention them: 1. Many scenes from the first film are used in this. Personally, it was strange to see old scenes integrated with new ones. <br /> <br /> 2. During the climax, some lines become lame. <br /> <br /> 3. Storywise, this is the story of Timon and although the directors try to integrate his story with that of Simba, he sometimes makes the script seem a little rushed. <br /> <br /> But hey, those details don't impact this otherwise fun movie. It's the only truly acceptable Disney sequel, which should be in every movie collection.
