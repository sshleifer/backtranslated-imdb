So refresh yourself with a delicious experience. <br /> <br /> Two women decide to pool their resources in response to a one-month lease of a villa in Italy. Due to financial circumstances, two other women join them. Two have a husband's life; one is an old woman who prefers to live in the past; the fourth is a rich and beautiful woman completely exhausted by life. <br /> <br /> As the spell of the villa permeates their spirit, everyone grows in his own way and is relieved in his perspective.
