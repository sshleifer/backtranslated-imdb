Famous was "famous" for their tension and their cartoon-free style in which the semi-main character is in terrible danger, only to be saved by the hero at the last second. This Casper in particular is the only one who can remember where death actually takes a hand. But even in death, there is still a happy ending. <br /> <br /> The constant in Famous Studios' cartoons is that "virtue always triumphs". Popeye always comes to his spinach in time, Baby Huey always flaunts the fox, Little Audery always "learns his lesson". And some FS cartoons are really dark and depressing. <br /> <br /> You must give them credit. As much as I love Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry", I don't think anyone has produced a better cartoon than Paramount. Color, animation, music (the great Winston Sharples), editing, voices. They were consistent and a shining example of the best the art form had to offer.
