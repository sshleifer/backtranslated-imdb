Lloyd Bridges as Mike Nelson and his boat were the protagonists of this series. What made me so beautiful when I saw it was the real feeling of going underwater. The show shows a youthful energy energy for underwater exploration that is contagious. <br /> <br /> The show was educational and shows the viewer things about scuba diving from someone who seemed to be a consummate professional, Mike Nelson. There were excellent shows, and the program always seemed to be well produced. Of course, the drama in the scripts sometimes hit the same notes in more than one episode, but each show holds its own with any other show produced during this era, the childhood of American television.
