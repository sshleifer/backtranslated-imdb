OLIVER TWIST would have had controversy and success after Dickens published it in 1837. His image of life in urban ghettos was something shocking and new, and his interpretation of the central figures of the novel included criminals was another innovation. /> <br /> One day he was walking in London and he passed a young woman he had been friendly with. He said goodbye, but was rather strict with him. He couldn't understand it. A few days later they met again and he asked what he had done to trouble her. "Well, if you need to know, I didn't like your last novel," he said. "Really, everyone else thinks a lot about it." He was puzzled: "What's wrong?" "Oh, Charles," he said, "I'm Jewish, how could you invent a character like Fagin ?!" He did not expect this: "Well ... you know that last year's trial of Ikey Solomon, the thieves coach, is a model for Fagin and he was Jewish". <br /> <br /> Dickens discovered that he did not fix things. "Yes," he replied, "He got what he deserved, but Charles, they did not call him" Solomon the Jew "as he called Fagin" the Jew "! Furthermore, Solomon did not plan a murder. Dickens had to admit that he could have been taken away. He left to think about what he said. <br /> <br /> Oliver Twist was published in several editions. Dickens tried to improve Fagin a little bit. Then he had an idea. He reworked the chapter entitled "Fagin's Last Night Alive", showing the fears in the man while he was facing the hanging. He also added some additional details. <br /> <br /> He lets his friend know about his decision to change Fagin. A day or more after he met her at a friend's house. She looked at him as if he were crazy. "Didn't you like the changes?" he asked. "Charles, what's the change - he's still a vile criminal called" the Jew "!", "Yes, I kept them inside, but you didn't see how scared he was in the prison cell of death." young woman had noticed this, but felt that he was so vile that he deserved to suffer from such fears. "Ah ... so I was right about this ... and did you see the little details I added?", He asked. "What details?" She replied. "When you see Fagin for the first time, he's cooking dinner by himself ... have you read that?", Dickens looked at her, expecting an acknowledgment. Instead the lady seemed confused. "I read that it was by the fireplace, but I must have looked through the passage." Dickens smiled as if he were a genius: "He's cooking a pork sausage for his dinner." "What!" He exclaimed. "He's eating pork, my dear ... see - he's not a good Jew!" His friend looked at him, shook his head and to his dismay left the house of their friends. He hasn't talked to him for years. <br /> <br /> Dickens has never totally shaken off his bigotry, but the situation has led to a partial attempt to correct his latest complete novel. In our common friend (1865) he has a minor character, Mr. Riah, who is used by an unscrupulous landlord to raise high rents from poor tenants. The landlord calculates that Mr. Riah will be charged because he is Jewish. <br /> <br /> But Mr. Riah is a good man. He is a very good man. He is a very, very, very, very good man, so good to be incredible. If Fagin saw Mr. Riah in action he probably drove him away with a stick. <br /> <br /> The anti-Semitic image of Fagin remains to this day. It is a measure of Dickens' genius as a writer that the novel surpasses it. However, in presenting the story on the film, it continues to cause problems for writers and directors: how, after the Holocaust, can a cinematographic treatment of a worthy novel be made without igniting fanaticism? David Lean showed how having Alec Guiness appear in one or two scenes that show a human side and face a crowd at the end with true dignity. Sir Carol Reed, in his musical version of the novel did even better, due to a rewrite in the script of the original musical. <br /> <br /> OLIVER was turned into a West End musical hit in the mid-60s, and then taken to Broadway where it was a hit again. With a wonderful soundtrack by Lionel Bart, including "Food Glorious Food", "I'm reviewing the situation", "Consider yourself", "Boy for sale", "Who will buy", "Until he needs me", deserved its success. Reed played the roles well, including his nephew Oliver Reed as Sykes, Ron Moody as Fagin, Mark Lester as Oliver, Jack Wild as Dodger, Shani Wallis as Nancy and Harry Secombe in the role by Mr. Bumble. There have been no great musical successes in Hollywood for a decade: the last musical to win the Oscar for best film was GIGI in 1958. OLIVER won it in 1968. <br /> <br /> E Fagin : how to handle the eternal problem of caricature? Well in the musical, Fagin is not captured, tried and executed for the murder committed. After all, Lean also showed that Fagin tried to control his confederate in his actions. But here Fagin realizes he is getting too old to depend on this kind of risky life. Even if he loses his treasures (those stolen objects he kept because he knew their value and admired their beauty), he decides to be able to reform. He is allowed to do so, accompanied by his faithful acolyte, the Artful Dodger. I don't think Dickens would have appreciated the change (his friend might have), but a modern audience certainly accepts it as appropriate.
