I realize that many people hate this movie, but I have to admit it's one of my favorites. I enjoyed it much more than its predecessor and happy to appreciate it better than many movies. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think people never give credit to history, much like Back to the Future, Time to Travel is hard to write, and in this film they included Time Travel and a spiritual journey. <br /> <br /> I also heard that Keanu and Alex were the best performances in this film, they seemed cooler, they played cooler, and said cooler things. <br /> <br /> Even the set design of this film is amazing, the sets are quite detailed and massive at times and it can be hard to believe that these sets were made for a movie of two teenage buds that are hard to write ... but this is not the genius of the whole series, making these two idiots bigger than the characters of life who are responsible for the entire utopian future of the earth. <br /> <br /> The costume was gorgeous as well. Bill and Ted are really fantastic in Bogus Journey, where, as in Excellent Adventure, they seem rather, as they would say, FAGS !!! <br /> <br /> Even the music in this film is wonderful, the score particularly. There is so much I can say about this film, because I love it. But this is one of those films that I grew up watching and every time I liked it better, so I can understand why people hate or think only about their Bogus compared to the excellent adventure (which I also love by the way). <br /> <br /> REACH YOU WITH YOUR BAD SEX !!!!
