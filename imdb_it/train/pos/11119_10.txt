There are so many reasons why I consider sopranos so high, one of his greatest triumphs is the cast and character building. Each character is revealed more and more each series. Furthermore, each series has a number of different "small time characters" and also the main one. A good example of a character (which was only in three episodes) that you can try is David the compulsive gambler brilliantly played by Robert Patrick. Every little detail builds the perfect TV series. The show revolves around the mafia boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) who tries to balance his crime life with his role as the father of two. The show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogues and images and this is what makes it so believable. While Tony manages things with the Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant) bosses his nephew Christopher (Michael imperioli) seeks a promotion. Each episode also includes Tony's other family in some way that includes his sons and the Carmel soprano wife (Edie Falco). In addition to these problems, uncle Junior soprano (Dominic Chianese) is trying to get what he can do with Tony's activities despite being under house arrest. All the acting is powerful and the characters are complex, but the two that stand out the most are; James Gandolfini who is' Tony Soprano. Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher, also represents the younger generation (20-30 years) of the crime. If David Chase had not created this masterpiece, modern television dramas of that caliber may not have existed, such as The Wire and Dexter. So the Sopranos are definitely the Godfather, the Goodfellas and the TV Pulp fiction
