If only ALL the animation was so great. This film is classic because it is strong are two simple aspects: history and character. The characters in this film are wonderfully personified. I've heard for all the characters, and the man-animal relationship in the film works perfectly. The beautiful animation and three-dimensional computer animation did not work better in any other film. This is a great movie for children and adults who want the journey of a classic hero. 8 of 10.
