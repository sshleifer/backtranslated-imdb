Elephant Walk (1954) Protagonist of an ancient Peter Finch as lord of the manor in a plantation abandoned by God where there is always the danger of elephants or crazy Englishmen, stand out in the midday sun and go crazy. Well, in the end they do it, after the typhoid or the cholera epidemic, of course, and a great chaos ensues. Taylor replaced Vivien Leigh in trouble with this boiler / adventure movie. When the elephants attack the house and trap Liz on the great staircase, I still get goose bumps. Thank God Dana Andrews is around to save the day. One of my favorite guilty pleasures. Even in color!
