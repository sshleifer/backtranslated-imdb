A fake documentary about a couple of Canadian producers, Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek), trying to make their first film in the late 70s. Hollywood North is the comic tale of their struggle to bring everything together, despite a series of conflicting discussions. <br /> <br /> Hollywood North works like a movie in a way very similar to why This Is Spinal Tap (1984) works so well. That is to say, although somewhat exaggerated, it is very close to the truth, and the truth consists in facts "behind the scenes" that are very different from the public face of the sector. It is not easy to make a film, and it must have been particularly difficult in Canada in the late 1970s. The films involve dozens, if not hundreds, of people. Many have incompatible desires, motivations and personalities. Particularly crucial are the financiers and the talent on the screen, as if one or the other abandons or becomes unreliable at any stage while the film is in production, it could jeopardize the whole thing, or request extended shots or abandon quite the film. > <br /> So it's not surprising that Hollywood North focuses on these types of relationships. The result is an excellent film, at the same time exhilarating and tragic. The script is impeccable and the performances are top notch. This is a must see for any budding director and anyone with a serious interest in the directorial profession. It should also be more than fun for every viewer with a minimum of intelligence and a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> A 10 out of 10 from me.
