Cinematography - In comparison to "The Wrestler", a degree of truthful and cinematographic skill that disarms the viewer, and then hypnotizes as well. <br /> <br /> Acting - Dialogue is minimal, but pauses and touching silence. <br /> <br /> History - The conflict in a "Balkanized" Denmark is unstable, as we have recently seen the jihad murders in the Netherlands and the riots in France. Although I have no love for Islam, the departure from the West from Christian values ​​has no reason to celebrate. <br /> <br /> The director of this film managed to mirror the two companies in a way that didn't even make a difference, emphasizing the development of Aicha as an individual who became a champion, not so much in the ring, but to all those around her. Even its worst. . . I will stop here to avoid the spoiler.
