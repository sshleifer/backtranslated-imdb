The first time I see Buster Keaton's first feature film and I have to admit I liked it a lot and would just like to have stumbled on it years ago. Rohauer's press initially warns that the three-nitrate three-sided print had been rediscovered and recovered in 1954 just in time before combustion, and many frames that looked hopelessly glued together were separated. So, it's a rocky view in some places, but I've seen and survived much worse. <br /> <br /> It would have been OK as the 3 short films, but as intuition for Intolerance the ending is creative and fun from the beginning: in the Stone Age with the evil Wallace Beery riding an elephant and Goodie Buster riding a domestic brontosaurus; In Roman times Buster riding a wagon with wheel locks and adapted for sledding, No Parking in Latin signs; In this technology Age of Speed ​​Need and Greed his car falls splendidly at the first hump. Both he and Beery follow the girl through the centuries, an endless struggle. Favorite well: how the caveman falls backwards over a cliff edge, but continues to kiss the camera - a fantastic second or two! <br /> <br /> Great things, reaffirming my love for silent film comedy.
