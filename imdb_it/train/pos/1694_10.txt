If the creators of this film had tried to introduce reality into the plot, it would have been just another waste of time, money and creative effort. Fortunately, by making every fiction of reality to the winds, they have created a comic marvel. Who could pass a movie in which an alien pilot spends the entire movie starring as Jack Nicholson, complete with the Lakers T-shirt. Don't dismiss this movie as garbage.
