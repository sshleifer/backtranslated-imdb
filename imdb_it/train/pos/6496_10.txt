Example of how a World War II documentary should be made, using first-hand accounts of real troops and civilians who participated in this terrible conflict and filed footage collected over time. I discovered it during a repetition on the History channel about a year and a half back, at that time I didn't know anything about World War II, but it enveloped me, and now I consider myself a World War II lover, looking and reading everything and everything what I can find about it, but nothing comes close to this historical documentary, it is definitely worth buying the ............. <br /> <br /> box set This is simply a documentary that makes very high standards.
