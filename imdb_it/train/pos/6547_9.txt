I took my 10-year-old daughter to see Nancy Drew over the weekend and I felt at ease. First of all, it was clean, and I mean by my standards. Most of today's children's movies are filled with wet toilet humor and coarse jokes to arouse laughter from the pre-teen audience. Nancy Drew is smarter than that, however, and humor is subtle and intelligent. <br /> <br /> The title role is played with lively vivacity by Emma Roberts, who is lively and polite without ever becoming annoying. Unlike the Brady Bunch film, in which anachronistic characters are derided and ridiculed, Nancy's style is treated with respect and dignity. It's a great time when LA's "style-conscious" girls with their Paris Hilton walking clothes are fired by the owner of the boutique, while Nancy, with her elegant loafers and homemade Butterick model dress, is embraced . This film eschews the desire for we-need-to-enlighten-this-wholesome-girl so many Hollywood movies take. Nancy remains true to herself and her values. <br /> <br /> The mystery is sometimes tense enough to be engaging. There were several moments of suspense in which my daughter nervously grabbed my arm, but there were no free shock scenes. It's all based on tension and mood and it's a lot of fun. The supporting cast is good, especially Marshall Bell as the creepy keeper. There are some great cameos by Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis and many moments that will make adults smile. <br /> <br /> This film deserves better grades than they gave it. Not only was I happy not to be dragged into another computer animated film in which talking animals roared and transmitted gas everywhere, but I was also very entertained. If I had been there without a child, I would have liked the movie anyway. This is a DVD that will have my daughter's name under the Christmas tree.
