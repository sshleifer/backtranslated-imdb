There is something irresistible and strangely credible in this episode. From the beginning, an atmosphere of tension is created by the awareness that a certain planet will explode within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have teleported to evacuate the inhabitants, who appear to have already left for unknown parties, with the exception of an old librarian. <br /> <br /> The educated but cryptic advice of the librarian on where all the citizens have ended up interrupted by a crisis in which all three members of the crew of the Enterprise find themselves unexpectedly thrown in different eras of the past of the planet. Kirk finds himself at a time similar to 17th century England, while Spock and McCoy are stuck in a desolate, frozen loss. <br /> <br /> The interconnection between the two stories and the different dangerous situations in which men find themselves is superbly managed, with the return to the present an unknown possibility, while the minutes are counting down to the explosion of the planet. <br /> <br /> Imaginative writing and fine acting characterize this episode, with a moving interpretation of Mariette Hartley as a woman exiled to the Ice Age, and Ian Wolfe as the town librarian. A bit reminiscent of the classic episode City On The Edge of Forever, this time travel story is a rich and compelling ending to the series, which ended an episode later. This must be one of the best of the whole series, especially noticeable given the generally lower quality of the third season.
