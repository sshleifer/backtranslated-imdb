An independent feature can now be seen both as a film work and as a video clip. Enter Broken, and aggressively promoted, twenty minutes with style and enthusiasm to sell. But is it as good as a movie, or does it work just like a demo piece? Broken, the story of Bonnie Clayton being kidnapped after waking up from a recurring nightmare one night by "a sadistic stranger and her colorful entourage" (quote from the video-box). Since she is held captive, it becomes obvious that her captors know things about her that even she didn't know about herself. While interrogating her, a soldier dressed in black makes his way into their hiding place in an attempt to save her. A chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for us, director Alex Ferrari seems to know what he is doing, or at least he is very good at pretending. Broken does not suffer from a lack of visual style, which is particularly commendable considering the budget and inexperience of all those involved. What suffers is weak and the type of derivative writing. Think Long Kiss Goodnight meets The Matrix, written ten minutes after reading Fight Club. The good news for Ferrari and producer / writer Jorge Rodriguez is that the elements of the story are easily ignored due to the abundance of eye candy on display. Did the plot really matter so much in a short minute of twenty mean to showcase the technical skills of its creators? No, not really. <br /> <br /> Although it would be unfair of me to overlook the negative aspects in light of the budget and duration of the film. Broken is not a classic genre. The biggest problem was that it would actually work better as a full-length feature. The last "turn" has not enough time to be shocking. If Ferrari was given time to slow down the function as needed, the plot elements would seem less casual and the film more complete. Here is to know that he has the possibility. <br /> <br /> The Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation of Audio Broken is second to none in the independent world. I've never heard such an aggressive sound from such a small feature. The soundtrack inspired by the Matrix is ​​very rich and deep, the shots are punched and the dialogue also enters the scene with the surround effects. Of all that is presented on this record, it is the audio that is praised for the modern production of independent DVDs. An equally impressive Dolby 2.0 surround track is also included, which is the default menu setting. <br /> <br /> Extras There are literally hours of feature creation to be found on this record. There are so many extras, in fact, that I find it unrealistic to list and describe each of them here, while I wait for my readers to continue reading. Whatever defect the real short may have, the DVD has no precedent in its information resources. People who have enjoyed the film can learn all there is to know about its production, including everything from conceptual art to the promotional campaign. Those who plan to create their own independent film can learn all that is necessary to know from these features. <br /> <br /> The extras are divided into categorical menus. These include: pre-production, production, post-production, after the short, and the crew's cast and biologist. From a critical point of view, I discovered that some sections were quite short. If they had been changed to a menu option, they would have been less frustrating to navigate, as the cursor would automatically position itself on the first selection with each return to the main section menu. This is, of course, only the fussy, but perhaps for future releases on DVD the directors will take my advice to heart. <br /> <br /> He has six audio comments and hours of interviewed movies and talented people, and despite the consonant sales, their true colors shine. <br /> <br /> The willingness to share their cinematic secrets with anyone who collects this DVD is quite generous. From the extras I learned which editing and effects software is more reliable and effective, which brand of camera creates the most professional look at the lowest price, even where to get cheap weapons at low cost. In addition to this, I was given a number of alternative options, in case I found myself able to identify all the products used in this particular production. Wannabe directors reluctant to read a book on the subject would do well to watch this DVD. <br /> <br /> In general, I scored the actual short of 6 out of 10, but I wish there was an option for the length of the potential function and commitment, because I would have scored an 8 or 9 in these fields. I recommend the DVD for its features and as a perfect example of what can be done with just eight thousand American dollars. Those who buy the DVD can think of themselves as ghost producers for a larger project, since more attention is given to these guys, the more it will be financing the version of the feature film.
