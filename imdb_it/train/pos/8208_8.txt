I liked almost all the movies in the Dirty Harry series except for what I think is called "Enforcer". "Deadpool" was a bit weak even in the areas, but I still liked it. This is one of my favorites of the series, if only for the great line of "Go ahead, prepare my day". This also presents an interesting plot, even if familiar, of someone who kills those who have hurt her. Just think of "Magnum Force" with less mystery about who's behind the murders and have your storyline. Of course, there is a little more as this is characterized by a beautiful final showdown in an amusement park. It also contains Dirty Harry who receives a bulldog as a gift and makes Sandra Locke stumble into a rather amusing scene. The only question that remains is why Clint Eastwood had the rather mediocre actress Sandra Locke in so many of her films. It reduces the score by one point every time, even when overall the film is pleasant for me. Sure, it's not bad here, but his character could have been much better by someone else. Another problem with this movie and other Dirty Harry films, they sometimes seem like advertisements for guns. I like guns as much as the next person, but do we really need scenes of him that explain all the different strengths of his latest weapon and how many bullets it contains? However, very nice entry in the Dirty Harry movie series.
