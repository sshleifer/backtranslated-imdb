This movie is fantastic. If you take it too seriously, you will obviously hate it; however, the amount of "dudes" and "righteous" brings laughter and weak memories of about 15 years ago. I like his ability to simply make me giggle at obvious jokes and nonsense, and his ability to make me want to see his precursor, "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" (1989). If you're looking for a movie full of multi-faceted jokes and mature humor, don't watch it; however, if you want a movie that is fun and silly, yet intelligent and engaging, you'll like it. Actually I want more of this kind of photos shown in today's cinemas. And hey, it's Keanu Reeves who behaves the way everyone parodies him like acting ... right ... it's not much better than that :)
