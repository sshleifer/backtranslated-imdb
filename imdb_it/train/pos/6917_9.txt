This is a story of the Winchester Rifle Model 1873 "The Gun That Won The West" For cowboys, outlaws, peacekeepers or soldiers, the Winchester 73 was a precious treasure. An Indian would sell his soul to own one ... <br /> <br /> Winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart, a duo that would continue to create a series of higher westerns which added a new psychological depth to the genre. The story sees Stewart as Lin McAdam chasing the man who killed his father. Riding Dodge City with his faithful friend, Johnny Williams (Millard Mitchell), Lin meets the Dutchman Henry Brown (Stephen McNally), the man he wants. But with Wyatt Earp {Will Geer} who took all the guns from those who enter the city, both men are unable to get the shots for which they are ready. The men instead line up in a competition to win a Winchester 73 rifle, a competition that eventually wins. But before he can leave the city with the magnificent prize, the Dutchman ambushes him, steals the gun and quickly jumps the city. While Lin starts in pursuit full of hatred both of the man and of the rifle, the rifle will change hands several times, each time adding another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches. <br /> <br /> benchmark for what became known as the so-called "western psychological", Winchester 73 is basically a story of a decent man driven to a borderline madness by an event in his past. Tho shot in black and white {the only duos western that has been} the landscapes are still breathtaking feasts for the eyes. The tone is set with the opening scene like Lin and Johnny on horseback, and in silhouette, they walk up a hill as they head towards Dodge City. It is only the starting point that would see Mann using his panoramas as a way of running in conjunction with his characters' emotional states. <br /> <br /> Stewart offers one of his best and most intense interpretations of McAdam, proving once and for all that he was one of America's finest and most versatile actors. Even the supporting cast is not bad. Shelley Winters is excellent as the only woman in the midst of machismo, while Mitchell, McNally, Geer and the ever great Dan Duryea add further class to the proceedings. There's also a few parts for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson here, while the latter who plays a brave Indian is too long. <br /> <br /> Originally the film was a project for Fritz Lang, who also had the script ready to run. But Lang left, something that turned out to be a blessing for Western fans. As great as a director was, Lang, directed by Mann (and with a new script by Borden Chase and Robert Richards in hand), set the wheels in motion to alter the course of the genre. Not only with the additional efforts that Mann & Stewart has produced, but also who influenced them. Characters like Budd Boetticher, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller took notes, and cheerfully for Western purists, followed suit and carried the psychological torch even more. <br /> <br /> A great box office success at the time of release, Winchester 73 is a magnificent film that continues to punch in the modern age. 9.5 / 10
