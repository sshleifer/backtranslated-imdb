The father of pride is a pleasant surprise: he is funny, witty and presents a beautiful vocal acting. The show is about the family of a lion that acts as the attraction of shows Siegfried and Roy. In fact all of them are stereotypes, but this is what makes them so funny. FOTP is not a kiddie-cartoon, it includes a crude humor for adults but in a very delicate way. It is full of popculture references and cameo celebrities and many of them are very well executed. I would say that I will give a show of 7 out of 10 because it is beautiful, rather well executed but not very original, I saw many of those stereotypes many times before, even in that particular order!
