The direction of this film was fantastic for a comedy. Many scenes seem to come from a comic and much more obscure (visually - not from wisdom) than I expected. Of course, this may not be the funniest movie ever made, especially if you like very rude sexist jokes because it has very little of it (compared to others like Something About Mary or American Pie). As you look at it again, several jokes stand out and become more fun. If you've ever read a comic or you've seen a comic type movie (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and you liked them, you'll probably appreciate the subtle humor that continues throughout the film. If you don't like them, you might appreciate the respectful ridicule that this movie has for those. If you enjoyed this movie, the DVD has some fantastic extras. (8/10)
