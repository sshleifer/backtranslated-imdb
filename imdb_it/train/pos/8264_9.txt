Based on a veritable mining disaster, this first German talkie (with English subtitles) still remains one of the most effective docu-dramas ever shot. With the participation of many non-professional actors, "Kameradschaft" offers a chilling view of the friendship that binds mine workers, regardless of which part of the Franco-German border they may be. A fatal accident brings out the best in everyone, canceling the orders of superiors. A needy fellow miner will receive the help of his companions, even at the risk of serious losses, including life. <br /> <br /> This film is reminiscent of the self-sacrificing heroism shown by the NYFD following the September 11 attacks. Setting aside the official rules and regulations, these uniformed men and women knew only one cause: saving lives and finding their firefighters. - More than 70 years later, "Kameradschaft" still has the strong and timeless message: a friend in need is a friend in action.
