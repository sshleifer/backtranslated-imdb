When it came out for the first time, my father brought it home - we were stunned by it - it was so different from everything we had seen before. I was looking for a specific movie last night and found "The Mind's Eye" again. The box is falling apart and I'm surprised the tape still works! Although it is not the quality "Finding Nemo" graphics, it is still very good. They should sell it again, it's a benchmark for computer animation images. Highly recommended! <br /> <br /> This is what it is: <br /> <br /> "The Mind's Eye" is a spectacular odyssey over time. Your journey begins at the dawn of creation and moves through the rise of man and technology. Travel through the world of abstraction and into the future with fantastic computer-based animation images. <br /> <br /> "The Mind's Eye" combines the imagination of over 300 of the world's most talented computer animation artists with powerful music and original soundtrack. This unique collaboration takes you on an incredible journey into "The Mind's Eye".
