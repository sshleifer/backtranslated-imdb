Ok, so he borrowed a little from "It's a Wonderful Life", but this was 44 years before this movie, so why not try again. Belushi is experiencing a thirty-fifth birthday. He didn't get his Wheaties, his coffee and he lost his job. The capper is when his car described "big blue piece of sh **" the car breaks at the end of the day. He goes to an empty bar to call a trailer. Waiting, he is recognized by the bartender (Caine) as the guy who lost the city championship baseball game 20 years earlier. This makes him think about what life would have been like if he had won the game. He will discover when, unbeknownst to him, Caine prepares a moving potion in a glass that gives him a villa, the queen of the dance (Russian) as his wife, and makes him president of the sporting goods company from which it was imported. Caine later reveals himself as the one responsible for this change, but Belushi is not entirely on board. It never fits completely, and in a development of the plot that does not kill the film, but is still strange, try to woo his wife (Hamilton) from his real life, which is now married to someone else. The good move is that they don't spend too much time on it, because they basically snatch "Ghost", with Belushi constantly telling Hamilton things that only she could know. He also brings in a dramatic hockey element, like two of his kevetch lovers in the shadows, his new Russian wife, and his lopsided lover Cox. But the keys to the film are the rather long beginning and the cheerful end. Great job even for the large and recognizable cast, as Belushi is very likeable, the VERY attractive ladies choices, and Caine is perfectly at hand as the title boy. Strange that this was the second Belushi film of 1990 to deal with him with an alternative lifestyle of wealth, which was found in "Taking care of business". Although similar, both films are on the same level as the laughs provided. So take a look for a fun exploration of "what if?"
