The fact that this film was released on DVD is still formatted on TV and with a blurred image it has really annoyed many movie purists ... and rightly so. This deserves much better treatment. <br /> <br /> The story is about a street artist who needs a child to convey his trade (the rules of the day) and ends with a child instead (not the conventional way) .... and problems that follow. The old man had bought the child at a slave auction and soon finds out that the child is not a boy, which he obviously thought was the case. <br /> <br /> The old "Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is kind of the girl" Doggie "(Zhou Renying) is a bit funny, the rest of the story is how the two manage to handle it, usually I like a nice sentimental ending, but this gets a little dragged in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall, it involves a complete story of drama, suspense, humor and sadness, but don't expect a picture of good quality for the money you are spending DVDs. Until it is displayed on widescreen, rent it.
