After reading the other reviews and lukewarm comments, I felt I had to come and pee for this movie. <br /> <br /> Roeg movies tend to have little to do with each other, and to expect this to be like one of his that you liked is probably out of place. <br /> <br /> What this film is is a thoughtful and no-frills look at religious faith. The only other film like this, in terms of a religious message, should be Tolkin's "The Rapture". <br /> <br /> I am amazed that someone can say that the story is confusing or supernatural. It's a simple film about the Catholic faith, miracles and redemption - even if you never guess it until the end. It is also the only film I can think of, whose resolution literally turns into a play on words. <br /> <br /> As a (happily) fallen Catholic myself, I know what the film is about, and I find a kind of affection in its utmost innocence about the relationship between God and man. But if you are not familiar with the kind of theology on which the film is based, then it will pass right over your head. <br /> <br /> Like a movie, unlike a story, "Heaven Heaven" is not innovative. While "The Rapture" is full of pictorial meaning and cinematic images, "Cold Heaven" minimizes its cinematographic qualities. There are no surprising strokes, no sharp edges, no attempt to adapt the content to the form. It is a shot of a worker, but submissive. Nor does he have dialogue or acting to put him in a high drama class. It is a simple story that simply unfolds. It may seem strange; but in the end the mystery is revealed. It seems ambiguous; but with a single line the ambiguity vanishes in a breath of Catholic dogma. <br /> <br /> In this regard, "Cold Heaven" has in the heart exactly the same kind of thing that drives a film like "The Sting," or "The Sixth Sense" or "Final Descent" or "A Pure formality "of Polanski. All these are films with a trick in their sleeves. They may frustrate you along the way, but they have a point - an obvious, indeed - but the fun is, at least in part, in having been accepted. <br /> <br /> Again, even if it sounds a bit more like a fucking dog story with a punchline, it's worth looking at the way it directs and misfires you. Try it, especially if you are or have been a Catholic.
