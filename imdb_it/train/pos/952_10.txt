So this made only 7.6 for movies on TV on this site? Bah! Humbug! No doubt this version of the classic Dickens story of 1984 is the best ever made. And yes, the hound saw the 1951 version which was also good, but not good enough. The lack of color is perhaps the biggest flaw of that version, even if the acting was wonderful. George C. Scott is simply incredible as Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of this miserly businessman who is haunted by the ghost of his dead partner, then by three other spirits later that evening. Scott is correctly gruff like Scrooge. Too bad, in fact, for some critics who claim that they are unable to project the rediscovered joy that wakes up on Christmas morning after the spirits have taught them a valuable lesson. But hey, this is George C. Scott. He will never go dancing on the street in a fit of joy. He has too much dignity and his Scrooge projects his emotions realistically. <br /> <br /> The support performances are uniformly excellent, as are the costumes, the music and the scenery. 19th century London comes to life in the visionary style of Clive Donner. The film is even on the verge of terror in various scenes involving spirits. However, the important history of morality transpires in every frame. <br /> <br /> You will no longer find this version broadcast on television, and this is a disappointment. The 1984 version of A Christmas Carol should be a mandatory part of any family's celebration of the party. When the decorations come out of the basement, this film should find its way into the DVD player at least once during the season. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
