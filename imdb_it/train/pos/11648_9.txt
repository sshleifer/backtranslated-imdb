There are people who claim that this is another ultraviolet Mexican film "male language". They are right, but more than this film is an invitation to create awareness of what we have become. The horrible truth hurts, or you get bored when you've already accepted the paradigm of living the third world as the only possible goal. One of the most important things about "Cero y van cuatro" is the invitation open to a profound reflection on our current identity. Is that what we all are? Is that all we want to be? I am abroad and realized how flawed Mexican society is when the Tlahuac incident came to light. I still can't understand the spectators watching a mass murder. I almost vomited when I saw some pictures. It wasn't Iraq or Rwanda, just a tiny village near Mexico City when fury broke out with the indulgence of the media and the government. The recreation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply. The other stories were good for portraying other situations of corruption, dishonesty, betrayal and violence, but I consider "Tamales de Chivo" the best. <br /> <br /> The film is deeper than some "cabr√≥n" and "pendejo" screams. Those are meaningless compared to people's actions. With few exceptions they are all perfect examples of human junk. Just like in real life, honesty is becoming an exception rather than the rule in our country. Furthermore, honesty is only miraculously rewarded.
