This is an oriental fantasy of "Arabian Nights" full of incredible adventures, fantasy fantasies and magicians. The wicked vizier Jaffar (magnificently played by Conrad Veidt) with powerful magical faculties imprisons Prince Ahamad of Baghdad (attractive John Justin) who loses the throne, then flees thanks to a small thief named Abu (sympathetic Sabu). Here comes Basora where Ahamad and the princess (splendid June Duprez) fall in love. But the prince and the thief are persecuted by Jaffar, Ahamd has gone blind and Abu has become a dog. The story accumulates several fantastic ingredients such as the transformation of the protagonist, a flying mechanical horse, magic bow, flying carpet and, of course, the colossal genius (overacting performed by Rex Ingram) that gives Sabu three desires, the magic eye, the figure of the goddess Kali with several hands, among others. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary photo ranks as one of the best fantastic films of all time. Produced by Alexander Korda of London Fim and directed by Ludwing Berger, definitively credited, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan with an extraordinary screenplay by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson, he is also screenwriter and actor as Sultan passionate about mechanical games. The explosion of the second world war caused the paralyzing of the filming, then the three brothers and collaborators of Korda traveled to the United States continuing the shooting in particular on Grand Cannon Colorado. The splendid cinematography and setting Technicolor and FX have resulted in the achievement of three Oscars: Production design by William Cameron Menzies and Vincent Korda, Cinematography by George Perinal and Special effects by Osmond Borradaile are dated today and a necessary remastering is urgently needed because the colors are worn . Also a nomination for the evocative and oriental soundtrack by Miklos Rozsa. This vivid story with immense doses of imagination will appeal to fantasy fans and fans of classic cinema
