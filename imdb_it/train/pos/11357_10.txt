"Citizen X" is the story told superbly about the hunt for one of the worst serial killers in history. What makes this story even more compelling is where and when it took place; the Soviet Union in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> ** Slight spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Viktor Burakov (beautifully played by Stephen Rea) is a forensic researcher recently promoted for the Rostov militia. Discover the past and the present unsolved murders, apparently from the same person. The murders are unresolved because no one has ever bothered to properly investigate the evidence. He is driven to find and stop the killer. His only tools are his dedication, skill and honesty. Its obstacles are corruption and the political ideology of the Soviet system that discourages the search for truth. His naivety would have led to failure if it hadn't been for his boss, Colonel Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland). Fetisov is a politically astute cynic who understands the game and knows how to handle the Soviet bureaucracy. However, he also shares Burakov's desire to bring a murderer to justice, even though the party's official line is "There are no serial killers in the Soviet Union!" <br /> <br /> The cast is exceptional. The places and scenes are perfect recreations of Soviet life in the last days. Randy Edelman's score is particularly good. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon with intensity and intensity. This film was made on cable by HBO Films and has become a great resource for films that otherwise would never have been made.
