This show is fast, colorful, dark but fun, trendy and still somehow clean. The cast, including an extraordinary rotation of special guests (eg Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Guy-From-Office-Space) is electric. He has murder, romance, family and zombies without ever going out as a comic book ... Somehow. You really connect with these characters. The entire production is an unlikely magical act that left me, a bit skeptical if I say so too, totally absorbed and returned for more every Wednesday night. I just reread this and it feels a bit like someone paid me to write it. It's really so beautiful. I just heard a voice that had been deleted, so I thought I'd send a blaze of good will. This is one of those shows that go under the radar because the network suits don't understand how to make it sexy and sell cars with it. Do yourself a great favor, if you haven't already, and enjoy this gem while it lasts. OK, another thing. This show is smart. What it means is that every critic / "writer" in Hollywood will insert a stick in his instant, before they sit down to watch it, defending themselves with a speech like "I could have written it" to anyone else in their renewed solitude Hollywood hotel. In other words: internet. This is a website of general interest / anonymous. Before giving the time of your Wednesday to the version of Dirty Sexy Money or of Next Hot Model or any other outside and outside of tripe these internet "critics" do not comment, give a show to my favorites. It is funny. Good fun without pretensions.
