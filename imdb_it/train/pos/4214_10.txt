The best of the seven Sam Fuller films I've seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten !, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One and this movie), Pickup on South Street counts as one of the best movies noir. It represents Fuller in its most controlled form. I like it when it's out of control, of course, but almost everything in Pickup is perfect. The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark plays a pickpocket who steals microfilm destined for communist spies. Jean Peters plays the woman who was carrying the film for her boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to find Widmark and retrieve it. He finds it through a pigeon stool played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which changes Peters' loyalty (which, and the fact that he learns to work for the communists, the Cold War stuff is really interesting). The love story is a bit fast and not entirely believable, but it's not so bad that it harms the film (unlike the previous Fuller movie, Park Row). Richard Widmark is fantastic. This must be one of his best roles, but I am not so familiar with his career that I can say for sure. Thelma Ritter offers the most memorable performances. His role gives the film a sudden emotional resonance, and his final scene in this film is as touching as that which can be found in the cinema. I'll never forget it. 10/10.
