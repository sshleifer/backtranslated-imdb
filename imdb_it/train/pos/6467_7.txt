Two back-to-back films dealing with Indian prisoners of war; Veer Zaara and Deewaar. Although Veer Zara was a love story about a guy who gives everything for someone, Deewaar focuses on the main subject itself. It is not hidden that many Indian prisoners of war have been rotting in Pakistani prisons for years - for which neither of the two Indian governments. has time or sympathy, nor the other part. I'm sure some Pakistani prisoners of war are also in India, but let's focus on the film. Full of actors. Some were theater actors like Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the major, acted well. Akshaye Khanna did his part well. There was nothing for Amrita Rao to do with a few chuckles and a couple of songs. I think the role of Sanjay Dutt was more solid even though it wasn't too long. He played very well here and his dialogue was also impressive. If you compare it to LOC, which was nothing more than a day-long movie with a story going in all directions (if it had a story) - Deewaar is a well-directed film that maintains a good rhythm and does justice to all actors . 7.5 / 10
