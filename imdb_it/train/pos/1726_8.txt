While thinking of "The Great Escape" I allowed my mind to return to this little gem of a movie from my childhood. I read and reread the 1949 autobiographical novel that inspired him, and when it was the only cinema (we never used that word then, actually) in the city that showed "foreign" films, I was in the front row to buy my ticket. <br /> <br /> As someone who grew up on war newsreels and propaganda films during World War II, I had an avid interest in exploring the realities of that conflict, as can be seen from the memories and stories of men who they were there in person. This extended as a result of an acute willingness over the years to buy any book on the subject, and finally to read the equally compelling novels of Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque, which provided an even more profound sensitivity. The versions of the film, however, were different from this one in that the goods were rarely delivered. <br /> <br /> The medium of the film in black and white has never been served as well as it was in those years. I have never seen any technicolor version of the war that seems as authentic as the profound chiaroscuro of films like "The Wooden Horse". If it is true that we are destined to always be prisoners of the images of our childhood, then I confess it freely. <br /> <br /> And there will never be another like Leo Genn as the iconic British war hero on the film. Not even Sir Alec.
