As a former Okinawan karate world champion, I like sports sacrifice films. But this film speaks much more. This film is so good and so deep. Recently I was tormented by very serious injuries and practically a disastrous lack of passion. Almost goes out for me. And this stupid movie touched me so deeply that, like me outside, it reminded me of what life is supposed to be. This is a film about life. Live your life for yourself and respect others. Empowerment. God, bless "Rather like Beckham" I think it's a real gem.
