Emily Watson's Natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character I've ever seen on a screen. She is the queen of this film beyond doubt. Or is it transmuted to the king? The interwoven storyline of chess games and the struggles of families for control, power and victory are amazing. Just like chess masters in the film, the director is simultaneously playing many simultaneous games with our mind, but all are intertwined with major or minor models. The period, customs and images of the Lake District of early twentieth century Italy have been captured beautifully. Not a single square of space was wasted. <br /> <br /> So many brilliant scenes abound, I can't tell them all. I recommend having enough time to watch this movie twice, maybe a week apart, because it is not possible to capture all the poetry within a 64 square but multidimensional painting in a single setup. <br /> <br /> I haven't read Nabakov's book, but to try an analogy of mine, what I'm reading reminds me of another poetically triumphant poem, The Natural by Barry Levinson. He totally abandoned the negative end of Bernard Malamud's fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely American. Well, the director did the one best by perfectly integrating Russian and Italian morals and morals as a backdrop for lighting. The real story here is that the games are zero-sum; there is a winner and a loser, unless both competitors draw. But, in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are limited only by those constraints and the conventions of life to the extent that we let others break our spirit. <br /> <br /> Pure love, personified by Natalia of Emily Watson, can transcend and allow all of us to be valued by her gifts simultaneously. Only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from it. <br /> <br /> This is a magnificent film (10/10).
