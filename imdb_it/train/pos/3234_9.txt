I thought it was an extremely intelligent film. I was very pleased and could not really ask for more. I'm actually the owner of the movie because I didn't return it to someone ... What should I do, but I really want to keep it because of how much I liked it. Furthermore, the fact of not having too many foreign films and this is the first. Now, personally I love Finnish things, so I definitely added what I liked. But overall, it's worth watching. However, if you're not trying to understand Finnish or read subtitles altogether, then this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
