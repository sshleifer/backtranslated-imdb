THE JIST: See something else. <br /> <br /> This film was rated by Gene Siskel, but after seeing it I can't understand why. The film is definitely original and different. Sometimes it also has interesting dialogues, some fantastic moments and a thrilling "noir" atmosphere. But it's not funny. Moreover it doesn't make much sense, in the plot but above all in the motivations of the characters. I don't know anyone who behaves like these characters. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult film to deal with - I suggest you not accept the challenge.
