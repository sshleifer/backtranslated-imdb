I saw this film in 1969 when it was first released at the Cameo Theater in South Beach, now the famous Crowbar nightclub. It was the last year of the wild 60s and this film was really touched at home. It has everything; the generation gap, the sexual revolution, the search for success and the conflict between following the "traditions" of the family and those of seeking one's own way through life. <br /> <br /> It was a fast and very pleasant film. Vegas was at its most incredible peak, Sin City in all its glory. Beautiful women, famous cameos, laughter, conflicts, romance and even a happy ending. A very pleasant moment on everything. <br /> <br /> The poster for this film rests on the wall of my bedroom. I look at it and go back in time; a time of my youth and my times with my father, a great moment in my life.
