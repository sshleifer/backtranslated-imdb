It is not an easy film to watch - it is more than three and a half hours long and consists entirely of conversations. Yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character, which is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br /> The film is depressing, cynical and cruel. (If you want something uplifting, look at the fantastic Céline by Jacques Rivette and Julie Go Boating, made at the same time). It shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing other than the society he was trying to change. <br /> <br /> Involves an apparently liberated ménage-à-trois between Alexandre (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud), Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronika (Francoise Lebrun). However, Alexandre shows himself as chauvinist and jealous as any other man. Women are exhibited as voluntarily submissive and define their femininity through the male gaze. <br /> <br /> The film is an extremely cold end for the revolutionary French New Wave. This movement was one of the most significant movements in the history of cinema and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it. Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the main actors of the New Wave, having played (among other films) in the influential Les Quatres Cent Coups (1959) by François Truffaut as a rebellious teenager. The director Jean Eustache is not known as other directors of the New Wave, but he should be. <br /> <br /> There is no improvisation (unlike the similar films of John Cassavetes made in the United States) and the dialogue comes from conversations in real life. The film resonates with Eustache's personal experiences. For example, Francoise Lebrun was a former lover of Eustache. The same Eustache committed suicide in 1981 and also the person of real life on which the character of Marie is based. Anger and bitterness culminate in Veronika's heartbreaking monologue delivered directly to the public, breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film. This fascinating, personal and honest cinematographic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature in circulation.
