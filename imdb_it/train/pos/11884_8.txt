I found this film a fascinating study of a family in crisis. When Leo, the oldest announces that he is HIV +, the reactions of family members alone and between them are moving and yet strange. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a family that was as physical as this one; nor one that risks screaming to each other. I didn't understand why the family felt that the youngest could not handle the news, but once it got so hard I found this moving film. <br /> <br />
