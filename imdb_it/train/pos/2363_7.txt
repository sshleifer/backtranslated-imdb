This adaptation of MR James's short story "A View From A Hill" was first screened on British television in 2005, on the little-watched digital channel BBC 4. I saw it being repeated again on BBC 4, and I decided to give it a go, recalling the BBC's 70s adaptations of other stories by MR James, including "Whistle and I'll Come You My Lad" and "The Signalman". Although not in the same class as these masterpieces, "A View From A Hill" is still a fun and sometimes suspenseful drama. <br /> <br /> A historian arrives in a small rural village to examine the collection of a collector of recently lost antique objects. While in the countryside, he sees an abbey that has been in ruins for hundreds of years. But what does this have to do with an old pair of binoculars and a gruesome legend about the ominously named Gallows Hill? And what do they know about the sharp country squire and his servant on the situation? Although not scary in any way, I liked this small production, and if the execution time was more than 40 minutes, it could have become a real adaptation. As it stands, it all seems a little rushed and a little more exposure to set the atmosphere would have been welcome. <br /> <br /> I give him 7 out of 10.
