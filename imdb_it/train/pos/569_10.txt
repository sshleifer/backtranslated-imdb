A River Runs Through It is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers, Norman and Paul (Brad Pitt and Craig Sheffer) whose reverend father (Tom Skerritt) is a severe man whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing, - and, for him and his sons, there is a thin line between the two. This story describes the slow progression of the lives of the brothers and how their lives separate on two different paths. It is a touching film narrated by director Robert Redford, who plays Elder Norman and reflects on distant times and long dead people. <br /> <br /> Some themes are repeated in the film, such as memory, death, eternity and dreams. Most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of Paul. He is a capable, charming and courageous man, but he has his fatal flaws. <br /> <br /> The closing lines sum up the "point" of the film: "Then in the arctic penumbra of the canyon, all existence vanishes into a being with my soul and the memories and sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. In the end, all things merge into one, and a river flows through it, the river was cut by the great flood of the world and flows over the rocks of the basement of time. Some of those rocks are timeless drops of rain. Under the rocks there are words, and some of the words are theirs. I am infested with water. "
