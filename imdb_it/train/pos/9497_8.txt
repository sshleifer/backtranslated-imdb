Absolutely fantastic basket .... this has it all: nudity, scenes of good fighting, cold blood, action, explosions, etc. Also, he sees the beautiful Belinda Mayne as Ingrid - not Olga as the other reviewer pointed out - although Olga turns Ingrid into the film later (you'll have to watch him to understand what I mean). <br /> <br /> I won't worry about getting into the story because it's too long and not very interesting. The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo (Robert Ginty) is interesting - look at the scene of towel theft to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were pretty good and then ruined by a real cock that effects seemed to have been made by the team that made City of the Walking Dead (ie the strange colored blood that gushed from the neck wounds ). <br /> <br /> I advise low-cost trash enthusiasts to check it if they can find a copy - it's quite rare and I could never see anyone bothering to republish it so that it becomes increasingly rare in a few years. <br /> <br /> I recommend it only for the great nude scenes of Belinda Mayne! That lady is a fox!
