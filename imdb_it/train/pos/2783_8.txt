It is not one of your most difficult stories, and this is a real strength of this film. There are at least two reports in which less confident writers would have added some too predictable romantic tension. Not only do they save the public, but they throw some surprises at the same time. There are some Disney-ish moments, especially towards the end, but they are manageable. Overall the rental was worth it and it was nice, fun and relaxed. <br /> <br /> BTW, if you get the DVD, look at the segment where the director teaches you how to do aloo gobi. We followed his directions and it was BRILLIANT! Next time we'll make it the day before we plan to eat it, because this is a dish that surely gets better with a whole night in the fridge to let the spices out!
