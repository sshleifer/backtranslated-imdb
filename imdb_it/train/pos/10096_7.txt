Robert Standish's novel is about a triangular romantic situation in a Ceylon tea plantation ... So Ceylon's background events and pictorial beauty are rewarding points for William Dieterle's film ... <br /> <br /> The story is about a rich and powerful planter (Peter Finch), who brings a fascinating and tender beauty (Elizabeth Taylor) in the jungle as his bride ... The plantation, of course, is endangered by a kind of wild life. .. For this reason Taylor ?? elegant as ever in dazzling costumes ?? finds himself in a strange atmosphere ... The echo of the determination of a ghost, the bad mood of a husband obsessed by the memory of his autocratic father, a highly dangerous illness and the fury of wild animals ... <br /> < br /> In her confusion, boredom and annoyance Elizabeth Taylor looks to a friendly face, a pretentious foreman (Dana Andrews), who admires her beauty but tries to win her love ... <br /> <br / > With echoes of "Jane Eyre", the mysterious Yorkshire dwelling with a brooding master, and "Rebecca", the innocent second wife hunted by the image of her first charming wife, "Elephant Walk" is a menacing melodrama with a broad vision of a huge tropical bungalow, exotic dances with excessively colorful anger, large bull elephants that crowd, a splendid burned villa, all in the company of an exquisite creature with an undisputed beauty and talent ... <br /> < br /> The film gave away to Liz a change of scenery, and allowed her to have more creative energy and respect for oneself than most of her debutant-rebel will? The wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will, and so Taylor plays his heroine of the movie star with more spirit than the one she was given credit for ??
