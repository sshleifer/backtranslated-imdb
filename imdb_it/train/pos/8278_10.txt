If you want Scream or something similar to the great horror product that is forced on us these days don't worry. This well-written film kept me awake thinking of everything he had to say. Importance of myth in our lives to make it sensible, how children interpret the world (and violence in it), our plunder of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends ... that's all, but not on the surface. You could technically call it a "movie monster" even if the Wendigo doesn't take physical form until the end, and therefore it also depends on you and your beliefs about what is happening with the legendary spirit / beast. Some elements of the standard thriller for those who seek only the basics and the film never gets bored, even if in reality the less we see of the creature, the better. Fessenden successfully continues the tradition of George Romero of using gender as a parable and as a forum for discussion, while continuing to make us squeak.
