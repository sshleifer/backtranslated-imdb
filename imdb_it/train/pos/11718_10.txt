Those who love Elivra like I did in their late night movie steward duties will love this movie - it's simply beautiful - her car is fantastic, and it's a bit of a Transylvanian Dolly Parton - she's so innocent and naive sometimes - and sexy all the time - plus, more than a touch of Mae West - <br /> <br /> The sets are well made, and the comic cast is fantastic, with Edie McClurg at his usual best - in addition to Sally Kellerman As Patty, it's hilarious. Whenever I have to munch on something for a topping, I'll think about how Elvira squeaks the chips - <br /> <br /> This movie is one to watch again and again - just for the fun of it. Now I have to get the sequel, Elvira's Haunted Hills, and see if it is up to this ----
