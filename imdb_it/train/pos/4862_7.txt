This musical is definitely mixed, and none of the elements fits really well, but somehow it manages to be mostly pleasant. The plot contains some elements of the Wodehouse novel, but none of its virtues, although it co-scripted the script. The songs, although fascinating, have nothing to do with this particular film and are strangely crushed in the plot, even by pre-Oklahoma standards. Burns and Allen do their usual shtick quite competently, but they lack the tone of the rest of the film by about forty IQ points. <br /> <br /> There are some highlights. Reginald Gardiner does a good job when he remembers that this is a talkie and stops attacking like a silent actor. And there are some writing pieces that could have been written by Wodehouse, although most of the film looks like the production of one of the Hollywood meetings that he later parodied.
