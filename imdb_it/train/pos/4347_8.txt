I won't talk too much about the plot of this film because the other reviewers have covered the same ground. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say that I really liked the movie. Peter Falk's performance alone is reason enough to watch the film. <br /> <br /> A small-scale street film with Falk and Paul Reiser in upstate New York is the set for most of the action in the film. <br /> <br /> Very well written with a target audience for adults in mind. A lot of reality-based humor and some well-played dramas give the film the feeling that it could be your family. <br /> <br /> I can't really say enough about this movie, except it's a shame that an adorable movie in this way doesn't get more visibility while other junk is there. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Falk as a leading character and he takes full advantage of it. It shows that his famous friend and screenwriter / director John Casavettes was right in launching Falk in many of his revolutionary films of the 60s and 70s.
