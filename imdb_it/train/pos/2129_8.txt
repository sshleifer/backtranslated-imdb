Sweet romantic drama / comedy about Stewart and Sullavan who write love letters between them without either of them knowing who the other one is. Of course, they work together and can't stand each other. You can imagine the rest. He is beautifully played by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a witty and intelligent script and looks absolutely amazing. It takes place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, but I found myself believing that I saw Budapest! Everything looks so perfect and dreamlike. A unique film of its kind. Not to be missed!
