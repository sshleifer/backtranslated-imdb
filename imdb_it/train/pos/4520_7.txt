A little too long and going up towards the end, this comedy is an absolutely delightful look, never condescending or ridiculous in the problems of a "powerful man", who likes to wear women's clothes at the nito. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters is as adorable as ever, but Adrian Pasdar is absolutely credible and steals the movie. He (she) is absolutely gorgeous with high heels and silk stockings.
