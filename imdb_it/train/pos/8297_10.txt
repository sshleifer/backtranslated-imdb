A classy film pulled in 2 directions. To his advantage is directed by Wes Craven. On the flip side of the coin the TV movie budget shows what could have been much more with a larger budget. He moves while Susan Lucci draws Robert Urichfamily into his clutches and tries to convince him to enter the secret of his wellness center. His latest invention, a space suit that can analyze people or things becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighborhood. Anyone who sees this should pay attention to Susan Lucci. Its appearance and its performance had unexpected repercussions a few years later. The actor, scientist and parapsychologist Stephen Armourae is a fan of this film and has written a review of this film. Lucci became the subject of a portrait he followed as the basis for the works of a babysitter called Catherine. The portrait of Lucci and Barbara Steele in "Black Sunday" was used as a reference for Catherine's portraits that were immediately withdrawn by Armourae. Probably due to a personal nature between the artist and Catherine. So, seeing both films, we can get an idea of ​​another story and the appearance of an unknown woman that could make a movie interesting.
