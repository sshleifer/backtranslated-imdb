I have to start by apologizing because I thought the first 75-80% of this film was hilarious. It is mainly because of Brad Pitt's performance. Spot on. <br /> <br /> The acting of all the actors involved was pretty good, but Brad stole the movie. The atmosphere was perfect in all respects. I'm not a big Pitt fan but this has to be one of his best roles ever. <br /> <br /> Brutal, Honest, Gritty. All good words to describe this film. <br /> <br /> I was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind Early's violence is not explained. It has been explained, but fortunately they don't have to go into the graphic details to get their point of view. <br /> <br /> In general I gave a 9 because every scene 1 or 2 was effective. I think the humor in the first semester is perfect for this film. Underrated.
