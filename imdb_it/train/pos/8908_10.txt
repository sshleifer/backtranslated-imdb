First of all, I hadn't seen "The Blob" since I was 7 or 8 and seeing it as an adult was an incredible experience. The pages could be written about his influence on horror films even today. And even more could be written about his social subtext with the "fear of adolescents" of the 1950s. But this simple little story of interplanetary horror is still a damn good and scary movie if you let it be. <br /> <br /> Sure, it looks poor while everyone goes out into our modern world. But "The Blob" contains some really scary moments while a band of kids track down the unstoppable creature when adults don't believe it. In fact, there are also some rather bleak moments in his colorful candy world. And Steve McQueen offers much more than he deserved on paper that we viewers are really caught in the moment and believe in him. To sum up, if you can remove your postmodern irony filter, there is much more to love here than it seems.
