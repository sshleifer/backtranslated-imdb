as for me, the central part of the film, especially the love scene, is a bit too long, but all the time you can imagine this feeling of the desert. but the best, what made this film unforgettable are the great explosive images, their color, slowmotion and pink floyd music are unique in the history of cinema! <br /> <br /> in its properson and popular form.
