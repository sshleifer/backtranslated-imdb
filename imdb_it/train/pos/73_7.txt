This is essentially a variation of House Of Wax, both in the plot and in the type of role played by the star of both films, Vincent Price. In both images he plays a talented artist who is sent to fall into madness when his creations are usurped by others, less talented and less scrupulous. In this film he plays a designer of illusions for theater magicians who aspire to pursue a solo career to be frustrated when another illusionist, the great Rinaldo (John Emery) insists that he will honor his contract and give him the first choice of illusions he draws . The price is already ill-disposed towards Rinaldi as his ex-wife is now a lover of Rinaldi. He explains his talent as an illusionist and as a brilliant imitation to take revenge on Rinaldi and others who hinder his recognition plans as an artist and designer. <br /> <br /> The price is practically the whole show here and gives a well-judged star turns into an abused man whose situation generates sympathy for the public. The rest of the cast is competent if colorless and the weight of the entire enterprise falls on Price who carries the burden with him. <br /> <br /> Good solid B Film melodrama, this is a detective movie rather than a horror movie and it's fun as long as you don't expect a masterpiece. Shot in black and white it is a bit gore and is best seen as a melodrama and appreciated for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance
