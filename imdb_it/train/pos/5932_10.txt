The best Stephen King film alongside IT, although this is more fun than scary. <br /> <br /> This has it all: <br /> <br /> - an exceptional cast with Alice Krige and Brian Krause and a fun cameo from King himself; <br /> <br /> - well proportioned horror in a funny storyline; <br /> <br /> - great use of music, especially "Sleepwalk" by Santo & Johnny; <br /> <br /> - predictable characters in a typical King setting: half of a village nowhere; <br /> <br /> - lots of humor. You can't really make beautiful scars here because it's too funny and exaggerated; <br /> <br /> -old but really nice makeup effects like those that don't do anymore! <br /> <br /> Rating 4.5: I really don't understand. When was the last time a horror movie was as fun as this?
