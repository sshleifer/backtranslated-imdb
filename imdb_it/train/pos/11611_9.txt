Japan 1918. The story of 16-year-old Ryu begins with the death of his father. As will be revealed later, both his parents died of tuberculosis. In this desperate situation Ryus aunt organized a marriage with a Japanese in Hawaii, whom they only know from her image. With his arrival in Hawaii, Ryu discovers that his new husband is much older than in photography, and that he lives in very humble circumstances next to a sugar cane plantation he works on. Ryu is not used to forced labor on the ground and in desperation for his situation in his new home he thinks of escaping. He soon discovers that he has no place to go. Her friendship with Kana, one of her collaborators, gives her new hope and strength. This image is based on real events between 1907 and the 1920s, when thousands of Asian women married men in America, whom they only knew from their image. This not very well known image is well written and recited. The location is breathtaking. This film also features Mifune Toshiro in his last appearance as Benshi (narrator of silent films). This film offers some information on Japanese culture here and across the ocean. A must see!
