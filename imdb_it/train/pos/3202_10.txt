I can't understand why many IMDb users don't like this movie. Because they think it's awful and so on. It's no worse than anything else out there. Personally I think "Soldier" is a great movie, much better than most other films of the same genre. <br /> <br /> Reasons I liked "Soldier": Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, the script (David Webb Peoples), great visual effects and directing (Paul Anderson). I even think this is the best work I saw from director Paul Anderson, who previously directed the entertainment "Mortal Kombat" and the not so funny "Event Horizon".
