I cannot see the point in burying a film like this in sulphurous sarcasm, when it is in no way intended as anything more than a vehicle for entertaining children and preparing them for the next line of goods to be insanely begging for. /> <br /> This is a funny movie. My children sat quietly through the whole thing and loved every minute of it. Sure, the villain is a bit exaggerated with his stupid costume and the crazy laugh, but this is much easier to take than the dark, gloomy and obscure Pokemon. 3. My children have since started playing Pokemon, they are coming to the times when "childish things are postponed" and pass to others. I'm glad we had fun together.
