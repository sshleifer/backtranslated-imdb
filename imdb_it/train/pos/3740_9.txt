While being filmed on a site of the Florida National Guard, "Tigerland" totally reminded me of Fortk Polk, Los Angeles, shooting ranges, maneuvering areas, deep water to the waist and everything else. The film was quite authentic and the characters similar to those of my AIT in 1974. The difference between the Tigerland year of 1971 and mine of 1974 is all the sergeants instructors and the instructors knew that they would not return to Vietnam, as was practically everything finished, so the workout was very relaxed, not a challenge. This was the forerunner of all our problems in the 70s and 80s, which I know for sure because I stayed until 2004. I never heard anyone mention "Tigerland", but the army had realistic training villages in Vietnam at different bases in the United States. Vietnam Veterinarians tell me that the Basic & AIT of 1972 could be quite tough and robust, because the trainers had been there and they were in charge of training the Vietnamese men for those abilities to make it, even if it wasn't always so. Both a sergeant instructor in Polk and one of my NCO veterinarians in Vietnam, when we became instructors of a basic training brigade in Fort Bliss, told me that there was nothing to do to prepare someone and people just had to find out and understand out for yourself. This film is high.
