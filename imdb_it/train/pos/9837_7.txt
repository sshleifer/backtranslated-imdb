Zombi 3 has an interesting story in its making. First, it's the sequel to Fulci Zombi 2's success, with Zombi 2 which is obviously a marketing gimmick to get people to think it was a sequel to Dawn of the Dead by George A. Romero aka Zombi. Pretty confused? Basically, none of the films has anything to do with one another, but who cares when they make money. I imagine that the same Fulci started not to care about the half-way production of Zombi 3 when he decided to go out. Bruno Mattei was brought on board to help fill the film with additional scenes to lengthen the execution time. <br /> <br /> The plot of Zombi 3 is the typical zombie fare. Scientists develop a serum on an island in the Philippines, the terrorists steal it causing a plague and the zombies go wild. Scientists want to create an antidote, while the military is ready to mow all without prejudice. There are also short inserts of a Radio DJ sermon on how we treat the planet. <br /> <br /> In general, I really liked this movie. I've heard horrible things, but I find the dialogue silly enough. The film seems to be an attempt to raise awareness about pollution, the corrupt army, the man who plays God, etc. I have the feeling that this was at one point a serious film, but it veered in a strange direction, presumably when Mattei came on board. <br /> <br /> In addition to ripping other zombie movies, this is very reminiscent of Romero The The Crazies. You hear that Radio DJ breaks the good news with "When you see men in white overalls and gas masks, Run to them for help." This is obviously played on images of white men shooting at zombies. Later, they steal a scene from the Crazies where one of the normal, uncontaminated people is killed by mistake. <br /> <br /> The gore factor is quite good in this with hordes of zombies around every corner. How beautiful is it? Let me count the ways ?? 1. Zombie Birth 2. Flying Zombie Head 3. Zombie Birds. 4. Legless zombies swimming in a pool. My favorite zombie was the maniac armed with a machete at the gas station. He was an ugly ass and almost knocked down the whole building trying to kill a girl. <br /> <br /> Favorite quote ?? When a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie, the scientists ask, "Don't you think that once the ash is in the air, will it fall to the ground and contaminate everything?" To which Sergeant bravely replies: "Now you're talking about science fiction". He also goes on to mention the "Science Fiction" told by scientists even at the end when everyone dies. <br /> <br /> Extras: Gallery, trailers and interviews, in particular the one with Mattei where he insists he directed 40% of the scenes, but is unable to remember which or other significant details. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: not to be missed for zombie and Fulci fans. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
