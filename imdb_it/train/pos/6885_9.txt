It came by surprise. . . The impact and resumption of this film had my automatic way of being responsive to people and situations. The most vivid was the agitation of emotional anger. Very similar to the way a spoiled child would when he reacts to not getting their way. . . A bad mood if you want. To think that I was hiding this anger from others was the most ridiculous farce of all. What did it cost me? So much love. . . so many blessings. Now I am present to how incredibly humiliating I feel and to have a constant attitude of gratitude for life. . For what is happening in the moment, without my harsh expectations for life to be a particular way, the way I think life or people should "be". This film has contributed to the freedom that I now feel to connect with others, without limits and expectations. . .and connect with genuine love. . without fear of losing. . just love first, and accept what love is given.
