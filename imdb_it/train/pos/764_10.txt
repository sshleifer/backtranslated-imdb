Without doubt, Beat Street is the best movie on the break scene. Everything is perfect, the clothes (puma), the music and above all the dance! The plot is fundamental, but hey what is there to tell a story? The main objective of the film is to show what the children of that moment were doing, what mattered to them. It shows that adolescents in general are good, all that mattered to these everyday children was music, dance and friendship. Recently, after watching the DVD, I was pleasantly surprised by how it had stood the test of time! The clothes didn't seem dated (maybe because Puma is having a great comeback), the music still sounds fresh, and the dance is still captivating to watch. A film that every 10-25 years should see as part of their youth culture.
