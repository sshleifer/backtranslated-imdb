I still liked it anyway. Warren Beatty is just like the comic book hero. What saves this film is the set, the incredible cast and represents a mediocre script. I really expected something more substantial in terms of action, or plot, but I had very little. The main reason for watching this movie is to watch some of the biggest Hollywood stars at the moment in such an unusual film. <br /> <br /> The only person who did a terrible job and did not even belong to this film was Madonna. She didn't belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad. The film has stopped in some places. You were expecting something more and you got nothing. Al Pacino is really a bad guy and he does it very well. He and Beatty make a great and good bad guy. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in a film other than Isthar. I didn't see Ishtar but I heard bad things. The thing about this movie is that it's good, but it could have been a lot better. I liked it as a child because I thought it was beautiful, and visually the film is fantastic, the sets are incredible, the script is right, and with a cast like that I would still expect a little better. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> I thought above all that the ending wasn't big enough. It was interesting but for such a big movie I thought it could end with a little more bang. The reason for watching this film is the atmosphere. The film uses only the 7 colors of the comics, making it all the more beautiful visually. <br /> <br /> Even the costumes and make-up were impeccable. The face makeup for the bad guys was great. Beatty is not up to a character bigger than life. Still, this is a good movie that could have been much more. It is better for me than Batman, the other comic book adaptation that came close at the same time. Obviously that film was much bigger in terms of gross.
