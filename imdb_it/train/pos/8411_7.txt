This first version of the story "The student of Prague" was made in Germany in 1913, with Paul Wegener (who was also in the "Golem" a few years later). In this film he plays a dual role (technically impressive for a 95-year-old film to see them in the same shot) after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a deal with him for gold - the gold he needs to woo a countess which he previously saved from drowning. <br /> <br /> Moving at a fast pace (the film runs just over an hour) and fairly well written and characterized, "The Prague student" has echoes of the legend of Faust and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde , beginning as with a pact with a mysterious figure of evil potential, and developing into good and bad sides of the same person.
