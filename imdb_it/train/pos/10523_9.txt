Emma is a true love story. If you love sloppy stuff, full of wit and madness, you will love this movie! It is true for the novel, which is very important, with some twists added for pleasure. Gwen is not one of my favorite skills, but she does justice to a role that required everything she had to offer in spades. She shines in a role I believe no other actress could have done justice. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam, like the hero. how shocked are you I've never considered it too good but heck! What can be the right role for you! He is as beautiful as the sensible and regal Mr. K, who is literally looking at him in a new light. He is an excellent romantic protagonist. The charm and character that leads to his role is wonderful! <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings the rest. a good cast. A nice movie. If you're a fan of Jane Austen, watch this movie, along with Pride and Prejudice - AND, MORE IMPORTANT, buy the books. Enhance the film to extraordinary heights
