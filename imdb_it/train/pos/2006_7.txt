At this point it seems almost superfluous to say that Jon Bon Jovi offers a solid, strong and uninterrupted performance like Derek Bliss. His ability as an actor was previously established by his critical acclaim collected in other films (The Leading Man, No Looking Back). But, in case someone is still wondering, yes, Jon Bon Jovi can act. He can behave well and is expected of him. It's easy to separate Derek from the guy who kills VH-1. Generally I wouldn't watch a horror movie. I have come to expect them to focus on sensationalist goral rather than dialogue and plot. What made me very happy about this film was the fact that there was indeed a viable plot. The gore is not so much to become the focal point of the film and does not have a disturbingly realistic film quality with higher technical effects budgets. So, gore fans might be disappointed, but history fans won't. <br /> <br /> Unlike an action movie like the U-571 in which dialogue passes in the background compared to the bomb, we have the possibility to know "the good guys" and actually care about that what happens to them. Some scenes are left unexplained (like Derek's hallucinations), but one has the feeling that certain aspects were like laying the foundations for a sequel. Unfortunately, with the lack of interest shown by Hollywood in this film, that sequel will never happen. These few instances are forgivable knowing that the Vampires could have been a continuous series. <br /> <br /> Is this the best film I've ever seen in my life? No. Is it a good way to spend two hours having fun? Yes. He will not leave the person who fears horror movies with insomnia and will not leave the lover of the disappointed horror movie at all. If you're somewhere between the horror loather genre and the lover of the horror genre, this movie is for you. He reaches a happy medium with effects and stories that balance each other. <br /> <br />
