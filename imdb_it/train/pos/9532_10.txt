I loved this movie so much ... the time it took to develop the characters, the attention to detail, superb performance, beautiful lighting and cinematography, the wonderful soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> It has an intensity and lightness of touch combined that will not work for all those who want the typical fast-paced action movie. If we lived in the Elizabethan era, I would say that this film is a bit like a Shakespearean tragedy. But since we don't do it, let's say it's more like a Drama-Suspense movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but the plot is complex. The film is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored. Much of the story is shown rather than told, which I find more subtle and moving, and that works well for a story based on a comic book (or a graphic novel). Sometimes I felt I was there in the 1930s, part of this story - there was a quality so realistic but dreamlike in the style of his story. <br /> <br /> I don't often prefer films to the books they were based on, but in this case I do. (Although I really liked the book.) I bought the DVD, which is fantastic because it has some wonderful scenes and insightful comments. <br /> <br /> (I also took my little cousin, who is a little younger than the boy in the movie, seeing him after seeing him for the first time, because he has problems at home and wanted to use it as a way to start a discussion of father-son problems with him - and discussion).
