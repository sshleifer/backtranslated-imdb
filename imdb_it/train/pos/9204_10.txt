The story of Hare Rama Hare Krishna came to the mind of Dev Anand when he saw the hippies and their fallen values ​​in Kathmandu, where he was visiting after protests against his previous Prem Pujari in Calcutta. He was low in morale because his film had been opposed and some had burned Prem Pujari posters. But the hippy's life has rekindled a story in Dev's mind to be turned into a movie. <br /> <br /> This was perhaps Dev Anand's best directorial effort. The film was a smash hit at the box office and Zeenat Aman as Dev's sister had an extraordinary impact. <br /> <br /> This film was Dev Anand's call to the nation to maintain their moral values. <br /> <br /> It is an Indian family based in Montereal and the role of the brother is very affectionate for his sister. But parents quarrel and separate, leaving Prashant (Dev) with mother and Jasbir (Zeenat) with their father. She is repeatedly told that her mother and brother are dead and eventually believes that she will never see Prashant again. <br /> <br /> She is abused by her stepmother and runs away from home. Dev becomes a pilot and learns that Jasbir is in Kathmandu with some hippies. <br /> <br /> To rejoin his sister, Dev goes to Kathmandu and meets Shanti (Mumtaz) who will marry him later and also Janice who is actually Jasbir with a new name and a new identity. He also forgot his childhood and Dev. <br /> <br /> Dev must bring his sister back to all other events, including his being suspected as a thief in Kathmandu and the people after his life. <br /> <br /> This was a well-directed and recited story, both by Dev Anand. We see more of Zeenat Aman than of Mumtaz. But the music of Rahul Dev Burman was well composed. Dev had first offered the music to be composed by Sachin Dev Burman, but Burman Da didn't want Dev to make the film. He was very close to Dev and his previous film Prem Pujari, although he was good, but he was opposed to Calcutta. Burman Da wanted Dev to have a lighter subject as he thought the hippie cultist movie could rekindle people's anger against Dev. But Dev continued with the film reassuring Burman Da and the film was really a success. <br /> <br /> R D Burman had Asha Bhosle sing the award-winning Dum Maro Dum. Kanchi King Kanchi was another good number. <br /> <br /> Overall it's a good movie.
