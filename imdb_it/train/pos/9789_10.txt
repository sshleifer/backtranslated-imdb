The story is told in a fluid way. There are no interruptions. Flashbacks are woven into the present without interruption. The casting was superb. The young Ya'ara looked very much like Ya'ara who would have looked at that age. His portrait of a blind person was convincingly done. Director Daniel Syrkin has done a great job in making the various actors interact in this story. Photography is very good. You feel like you're with Yaara and Talia walking towards the ocean to the edge of the cliff. English subtitles closely follow the Hebrew script. It is interesting to note that although "Out of sight" is not a direct translation of "Lemarit Ayin" both names are very appropriate to the story.
