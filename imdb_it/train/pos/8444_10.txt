After a rocky road of about 7 years on the NBC, it was decided to make only one last Super Rata. The series had been on the bubble several times, thanks to the fact that it didn't have the numbers that would have qualified it as a one-hour TV block buster. He had always had a consistent and hard core of followers. <br /> <br /> It was almost as if the series with the full title of "HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET" (1993-99) was a sort of "Mr. In-Between" of the series. It was too big to be deleted, but too small to have a "Rabid Ratings Ravings" case. <br /> <br /> During the precarious Friday night stay, they presented some of the best and most daring artists of Drama times. There, I said it artistic, artistic !! But please remember that we mean artistic, but not just fake preaching, pretentious, pedantic, politically correct. <br /> <br /> When in the end, he was sure it was the end of the sentence for "HOMICIDE"; this super episode was prepared like this 2 hours made for TV Movie. <br /> <br /> Watching all the events of the past season and the parade of regular characters, the production team came out and gave us what turned out to be a super send. <br /> <br /> OUR HISTORY? ?????. As we join the story, we discover that the Commanding Officer of the Baltimore Omicidi, Lieutenant Al Giardello, "pulled the pin", withdrawn from work, that is. But "G" is not yet ready to retire and retire. So instead of a rocking chair or a fishing rod, we find out that Al is running for the mayor of "City of Spells". <br /> <br /> While you are in the city, making some arrests and speeches, the former detective, Lieutenant, takes a killer bullet. Alive, but in a comatose state, he is taken to the hospital. <br /> <br /> The news spreads rapidly and, as if they had been officially convened, we find all the Detectives of the Baltimore unit that we saw on the show presenting themselves to offer their services and assistance. There is a great meeting between all these previous and present gumshoes while they insert and follow every lead and possibility of a lead. <br /> <br /> The producer has found a way to deal with those who died earlier in bringing their memory into history. They were able to answer some long-standing questions and also presented some to the unrevealed ones. The whole story envelops the series in a more satisfying and original way. But at least for now, we'll leave it as "classified". <br /> <br /> In packaging everything in a small and accurate package, this TV movie certainly deserves our approval. As for the evaluation of "IL FILM HOMICIDE", we must give it an A or an A +, too. But, regardless of the grade here, he didn't get the highest score of a typical weekly episode.
