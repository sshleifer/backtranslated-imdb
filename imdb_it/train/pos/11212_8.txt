This photo was released in 1975 and was the second in the three-part series of Sheriff Buford Pusser's life. Bo Svenson takes on the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser and Luke Askew plays the role of Mobster Pinky Dobson. The last one we saw Sheriff Pusser was laid in a hospital bed after him and his wife who was killed in an ambush on Sunday morning. After Pusser recovers, he chases the men who killed his wife. Pusser is able to complete the revenge he seeks or the crowd tries to take him out before his successes. The only thing that bothers me about this image is that this was a true true story. How could you leave in a city with this kind of crime and yet do nothing about it. Since there was no name actress in this photo, I can't give him 10 star weasels, but I can give him 8
