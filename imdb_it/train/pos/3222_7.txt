The first two sequences of this film have created the two conflicts: the conflict-subject between the soldier Todd and his repressed humanity and the physical conflict between Todd and his bio-engineered substitute. Both sequences are quite compelling in different ways. <br /> <br /> The script of the characters falters a little by solving the first of these strings in the middle of the film, which means that the second half is little more than a direct action game. <br /> <br /> However, I congratulate the creators for creating a genre action piece with a heart and a little soul and especially with Kurt Russell who transmits a lot with very little. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, but it's worth seeing.
