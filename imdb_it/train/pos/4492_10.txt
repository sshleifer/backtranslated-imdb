but I want to say that I can no longer agree with Moira. <br /> <br /> What a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> I was just thinking about it this morning, wanting to give advice to some lout who had lost money with his fraud debit card, and he meant "Keep your money in your pocket" and I knew I was talking like James Mason. <br /> <br /> Even if he didn't say those words, I still think he would do it! I never forgot 'Are you carrying?' in his reconciliation with his son, Hywel Bennet: "You always have the money in your pocket!" Good advice. <br /> <br /> Children do not have enough fathers with such ruthless but well-intentioned attitudes. Or any father. <br /> <br /> It would be a good thing for us to reinstate "you", "your" and "yours" in our language to show that we care. It is the same as "tutoyer" in French or "du" in German. <br /> <br /> Addendum: I just realized that a lot of my comments were about James Mason on The Family Way! <br /> <br /> I think it's because I mixed Susan George with Hayley Mills. Well, easy mistake. <br /> <br /> Remainder of tho comments. <br /> <br /> And Spring and Port Wine is very similar to The Family Way. <br /> <br /> When you brought a girl to the photos in those days, you really had something to say and talk about later, something that affected your knowledge of the world and your personal development. <br /> <br /> Theatrical experiences are almost real and are important to help young people grow. <br /> <br /> It doesn't happen now, I think, that teenagers can simply go to the photos like we did.
