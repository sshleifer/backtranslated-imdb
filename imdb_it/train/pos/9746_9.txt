Ok, let's face it, this is a terrible movie. The plot (as it is) is horrible, the acting worse. But the film was made for one reason and one reason, like all those horrible Mario Lanza films ... just to hear the voice of the star, in this case Pavarotti in its full glory. Ok, maybe Lanza's films were also an excuse for him for women, but this film is about listening to Luciano. It's just worth watching the movie. A great star of the opera clings to his fears, finds humility and love along the way, and also brings out many numbers of success. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I have prejudices on a number of levels. I'm italian. I'm a big Pavarotti fan (is there anything in Pavarotti that isn't great, including his fan base?). And when I saw this film for the first time I went out alone, seeing the height and depth of the possibilities of Life and in love for the first time. As terrible as this film, the beautiful voice and the memories are enough to make me breathe deeply into life and love again. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's trivial and terrible. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and the voice is what it is about. So I give a very high grade to this film in the hope that someone who has never listened to Pavarotti first listens and watches and enjoys a new level of music and love, especially since he has disappeared. Like the Italian food you've never tried before, try it! You could be pleasantly surprised, like a lover of Luciano or a fearful Pavarotti.
