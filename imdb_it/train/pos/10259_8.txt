A lot of people do this series unjustly but many of the videos on Guinea Pig are pretty funny. In particular, Devil's Experiment has some really fantastic effects - not only the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic slice of skin on the foot and a hammer-breaking hand is very realistic - especially for the video's vintage and low -budget. <br /> <br /> Let me start at the beginning for those who don't know: this film is an "extreme" film of torture / fake snuff that emerged in Japan in the mid-80s. The plot as it is is simple: a young girl is held by a few men and forced to endure a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is. This involves brutal violence - all actually realistic effects, including those mentioned in the last paragraph, as well as a painful application of boiling oil to the captive girl's arm and placement of worms in the next wobbly wound. <br /> <br /> The less effective sequences are right at the beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session in which three men take turns slapping the girl while her head falls and a second sequence in which the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground. These two scenes are obviously staged and diminish the realism of the rest of the proceedings. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the "experiment" victim is quite convincing in being sore and takes a good deal of abuse and bad stuff on the camera. His reactions while she has headphones tied to her head and loud noises are played for hours and hours are chilling. Some of the other maltreatments she takes are stuck in a tree net during the only times she is given a rest. There's also a disturbing scene in which the ridiculous captors through her courage and another disgustingly dreary scene where she is turned on an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels until she vomits. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this series, I hope I helped you decide if you want to give this episode a shot. 8.5 / 10 for the devil's experiment.
