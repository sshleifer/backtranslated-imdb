Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are the couple who disagree who get in the car and run errands according to the needs of one or the other. Morgan Freeman is superbly human, related to one and all, while Paz Vega is the edgy teller behind the "10 articles or less" checkout line, intimidating customers and bored by his mind. Together they explore, discover and learn from each other. To do this they obviously have to be vulnerable, interested in change and have a sense of humor, which they both have. I would like this film to be realistic, I would like this kind of story to happen more often, I wish we didn't have to go to the movies to realize that we can actually connect to each other, even if we come from very different backgrounds. The message of the film is based on the open heart and makes us wonder about the possibility of another world in which we meet from there - a world where peace could be a possibility.
