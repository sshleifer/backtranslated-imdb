This light comedy should be appreciated for its entertainment value. Sometimes it becomes quite hysterical, but if you haven't spent some time on that side of the songs you'll miss the comedy when it explodes. <br /> <br /> The cast of characters blend well together are quite believable in their roles. How Grace handles the meeting with his dead husbands girlfriend has been well played. She is a real woman. And, my favorite is Grace's white pimp dress she's wearing. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to laugh out loud, who applauds for the underdog or simply wants to see something different.
