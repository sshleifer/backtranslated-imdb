Although Lang's version is more famous, Borzage's work is not without interest, on the contrary: his "celestial" sequences are even better. The metaphor of the train (perhaps borrowed from the end of "la roue" by Abel Gance) is in the end more convincing than the celestial world "above". <br /> <br /> Borzage's tenderness for his characters shows in the character of Marie and love beyond the grave is one of his favorite subjects (the end of "three companions"). Fun the park seems to be everywhere: we see it even when we are in the poor house of Marie. I don't think the sets are so cheap, they are stylized by fault. The fair from afar seems almost like a science fiction sensation to the film. <br /> <br /> Borzage never forgets his social concerns: in the celestial train that goes up, the rich cannot stand to be confused with the rabble but as "chief magistrate" says: "here there is no more difference ". <br /> <br /> It is not an important job for Borzage (not even Lang's version), but to look for if you are interested in the career of the great director.
