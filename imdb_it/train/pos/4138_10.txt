Another reason to watch this delicious film is Florence Rice. Florence who? This was my first reaction when the opening credits arrived on the screen. I soon discovered who Florence Rice was, a true beauty that turns into a simply wonderful performance. As everyone does in this exciting ensemble piece. Since 1939, it's a different time, but here is the charm. It transports you to another world. It starts as a light comedy but then becomes very serious. Florence Rice goes from a comedy to heroin. It is absolutely delicious, at the same time strong, vulnerable, evolving from girl to woman. Watch the facial expressions at the end of the film. He has made over forty films and I will look for the other thirty-nine. Alan Marshal is of Flynn / Gable mode and turns out to be a perfect couple for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel offer some excellent comic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fan of films from the 40s / 40s, don't miss it!
