I don't watch porn much, but I love porn stars. And I love bloody movies. So when I heard about a gastro-pornographic movie, I was really excited. Of course, it was years ago, and when I heard about all the problems with making and finishing the film, I never thought I'd see it. But I did it and I'm not ashamed to admit that I loved him, even with all his faults. <br /> <br /> First of all, the defects. The story is set in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story that seemed to tell the story concerns the Sawney Beane clan from Scotland. So why not put it there and skip the third grade report on Samhain / Irish immigrants / Halloween? Furthermore, he breaks his rules by stating that you are safe on the trail, but then the cannibal mutants start running away everywhere. It is never clear how many cannibals we are dealing with. There is a large stone castle that is obviously ancient, but no one has noticed it before. Self-aware horror references are annoying and so are the characters. The heroine has a flashback montage of all her dead friends that include a character she never met. The ending makes no sense. <br /> <br /> So what works? The blood! Of course, I would have liked more, but it was nice to see a film so ugly that it wasn't afraid of being anything but a goreo movie. Two murders are at the top and Taylor Hayes has a beautiful, disgusting scene. The two wild murders are also given extended blows on the DVD. I have always been convinced that blood can overcome a stupid story and Evil Breed has reinforced it.
