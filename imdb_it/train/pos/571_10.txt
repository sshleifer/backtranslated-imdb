Looking at how the two brothers interact and nurture each other through the entire film, it makes me personally happy to live in a rural area very similar to that of the film. I've seen this movie countless times and I have the book right next to my Bible. After seeing the film, I agree that this is one of the few films that does justice to a book. I highly recommend it to anyone who has the opportunity to go fishing in Montana or to be outdoors to do so. It's amazing. I can't think of anyone else who can play the role better than Brad Pitt. Get justice and watch one of the best films in the era of modern movies. I strongly recommend and as a guide for fishing trips both in Montana and Wyoming, don't try to learn how to catch fish from the movie scenes because, even if it sounds great in the movie, you have no idea how much practice and skill to fish that way actually it takes. Thanks for listening. Watch this movie if you want a sad and long film.
