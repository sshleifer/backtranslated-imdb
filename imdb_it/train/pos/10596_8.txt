Every time this film is on the BBC, someone from the "Radio Times" says it is a satire against the post-war world of rationing and the welfare state. I don't think this is the point of the film. The film is a parody of the Spaniards (small criminals of the time who ran the black market) and of the home league that fought against government restrictions but were really a Tory front organization. <br /> <br /> Yes, of course, the film sends the political / social situation but in the end people realize that they need all the controls to guarantee a fair society, they want to be British and confused rather than foreigners. <br /> <br /> But I don't think they come back to being exactly like they were before.
