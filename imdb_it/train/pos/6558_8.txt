I disagree with the previous comments on this film. I think it was cute and fun and brought a good message for girls like my daughter. You don't have to dress like a cheap prostitute to be cool. You can be smart, cute and classy all at once. <br /> <br /> I think the cast was good and the story was good for the target audience. Overall, my wife, my daughter (10) and I thought it was a good movie. I would definitely recommend it. He also encouraged my daughter to start reading Nancy Drew's original mysteries that I'm sure she will love how I loved the Hardy Boys. <br /> <br /> It was a struggle to make her sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading right away. I can't think of a better result for that movie than to rekindle interest in that classic series.
