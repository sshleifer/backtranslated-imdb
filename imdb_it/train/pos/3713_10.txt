With this film, it's about style, atmosphere and acting. True, I didn't believe all the developments in the plot, but it didn't matter - the terrifying acting, the unexpected twists, and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me in, and they took me on the journey, and I had a great moment. Kenneth Branagh is not only a great actor but a master of accents, and he demonstrates this once again with an impeccable Georgian accent. He is surrounded by so much talent in supporting roles (Robert Downey, Jr., Embeth Davidtz of Schindler's List and Fallen, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah and Robert Duvall) that I was simply blown away. I recently bought a copy of this film and I never tire of watching it. Simply one of the best thrillers of the year. If you ignored this movie (and you probably have), I suggest you take a look.
