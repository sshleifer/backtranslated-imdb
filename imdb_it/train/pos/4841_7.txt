In the colonies we are not so familiar with Arthur Askey, so I almost skipped this film (which had its TCM preview recently) due to the negative comments here on its appearance in "Ghost Train" - which I expected to be completely annoying. Instead I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and his timing in delivering a sentence suggest what would be achieved if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a child. There is no comparison with Bud Abbott or the other usual suppliers of comic relief that appear in films of this genre. One can also hear the thread linking Askey to the British comedy 30 years later; at least it is clear from an American point of view that it has more in common with the company Monty Python than with any of its counterparts here. As for the rest of the film - the more movies you've seen, the more likely you are to guess at the final, but it's still pretty fun and atmospheric and it's worth the wait for your next appearance.
