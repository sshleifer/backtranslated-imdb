The freedom to have your Sea Going Power Boat, the excitement of going on a sturdy underwater adventures, an adventurer and adorable (and so well endowed!) Assistants in fine Bikinis were all the strengths for "SEA HUNT" (1958-61). <br /> <br /> Just what was the reason to produce a sort of series of series "for hire". Let's take a closer look now. There must be some clues around. <br /> <br /> If we were to look back a bit, let's see UNDERWATER's RKO Radio Pictures production! (1955). She played Jane Russell, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan and Lori Nelson as a quartet of adorable Scuba Diving Adventurers working on rescue in the Caribbean, including a pre-Fidel Cuba. The film was fairly successful and was memorable not necessarily for its history as for the looks of headmasters in bathing suits. Beautiful well made women, in some swimsuits in 2 really interesting pieces (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) They are always an advantage for the boys; and the presence of robust and athletic athletic men who exhibit their best beef "poses" is equally pleasing to the girls. <br /> <br /> And there is an element that is a true legacy of this old RKO feature. It is on the soundtrack contained between the tails and the musical themes. It is the recording of "It's Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White", written by Louiguy and Jacques LaRue and interpreted by Damaso Perez Prado and his orchestra. <br /> <br /> Anyone listening to this Insturmental or Song (with lyrics) I will not soon forget His Carribbean Beat is so lively and his rich use of the Brass Section of the Orchestra is powerful and instantly makes instant impression and memory. The 45th Record of this song has become one of the 10 most popular songs of the week for many Saturday nights on "Your HIT PARADE" by NBC TV. We can't remember just how many weeks or how tall. (Maybe someone can fill us in on that one object, please!) So, we went back to "SEA HUNT" and its odyssey of taking "The Tube". The audience had taken UNDERWATER! okay, but they should be for a TV series. <br /> <br /> ZIV TV Productions was gaining a reputation for publishing a type of product that, for the most part, was not signed by multi-station connection networks. But they had had great success with Television Syndication. ** By this we mean by offering a series of stations for performances from one to one television station for each market area. (Just as the various newspapers that sell "sell" comics to various newspapers throughout the country, and even around the world. <br /> <br /> So we got "Mike Nelson" in the physical presence of Lloyd Bridges Mr. Bridges had been around for about 15 years and had made some memorable performances in predominantly supportive and very different roles in a pair of Boston Blackie movies (with Chester Morris) at THEY STOOGE TO CONGA (3 Stooges 1943), SAHARA (also 1943), HOME OF THE BRAVE (1949) and THE WHISTLE AT EATON FALLS (1951). <br /> <br /> Lloyd brought a very convincing way to his characterization, together with a convincing athletic physique, having the aspect of a boy who makes his living from his physical abilities, he has taken very well as Diver's Diver, whether he carries out tasks on board, or arms under the sea. <br /> <br /> And Lloyd has hired quickly the role, but contrary to a lot of misleading information, had no famil with SCUBA. *** before landing this Mike Nelson concert. But the athletic Mr. Bridges proved to be a quick student, as many of the underwater close-ups revealed that there was no doubt, that it was Lloyd with the mask, the bubbler (air tank) and the fins in fins. <br /> <br /> Stories have almost always involved helping some customers pay, just as a private investigator would. So, if the customer was an adorable Lady who was fine with a swimsuit, so much the better. <br /> <br /> Like many others of the ZIV / UNITED ARTISTS TV Productions, "SEA HUNT" possessed a fine, haunting opening and closing theme, along with some original accidental music and tails. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, I believe that "SEA HUNT" was the TV series in syndication, a success that the ZIV series had already known with the likes of "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". As for the exhibition site of this underwater saga, here in Chicago it was shown late at night (after 10.30pm) on WNBQ TV, Channel 5 (our NBC affiliate, now known as WMAQ TV). <br /> <br /> And I can remember who the original sponsor was in this particular market. And there were even commercials made by the Star! How well we can remember and visualize Lloyd as Mike Nelson, riding his motor boat. And while we were invited to come back next week and watch "..... another" SEA HUNT "adventure, sponsored by the G. Heileman Brewing Company of LaCrosse, Wisconsin" the creators of Old Style Lager Beer! "while Mike toasted us, lifting an old-fashioned bottle. (Shame on you, Mike! Drink beer on your moving boat! We're talking about the Coast Guard!) So the boat will leave the dock, accompanied by the Hunt at Sea theme roll the credits. <br /> <br /> NOTE: * More figuratively than literally, Mike was on hire and things were very much like a detective story. <br /> <br /> NOTE: ** The syndicated successes of ZIV included "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER", "WEST POINT" (and its clone "MEN OF ANNAPOLIS"), "SEA HUNT" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". <br /> <br /> NOTE *** And, of course, SCUBA stands for Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus.
