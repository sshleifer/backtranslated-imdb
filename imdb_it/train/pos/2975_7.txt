Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the "South Park" show, come back with something completely different. They create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball. This sport is known as a baseketball. It's like basketball except that the rules of baseball are involved and there's another letter in the title. Here's how you play: just shoot the ball while these two guys try to distract you from taking the shot. Simple sounds. In fact, I could try it one day. After the game the streets soon became a huge success. Who would have ever imagined that two immature friends could invent a sport that has become so famous? <br /> <br /> My opinion <br /> <br /> "Baseketball" is a very crude and silly parody full of slapstick violence, but actually offers some laughter and lots of fun. A definitive recommendation for those of you who love slapstick and rude humor.
