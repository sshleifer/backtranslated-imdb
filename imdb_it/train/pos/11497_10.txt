This is one of the very few movies out there that are very erotic without being pornographic, although there is only a very rudimentary storyline. There is not much live sound or dialogue; instead, the actors do voice-overs describing their experience, because they participated, etc. <br /> <br /> It's a document. <br /> <br /> It's amazing. <br /> <br /> I understand perfectly why no one else has ever tried to do something like this. There is already something similar. This. :-) <br /> <br /> NB: The producer does not have the rights to distribute a DVD version. Besides, I've never seen it sold elsewhere; one can send an email to Mr. Boerner and order a copy on VHS.
