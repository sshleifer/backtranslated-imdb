The family of Mat Spirogolou (Toby Malone) knows he is a talented footballer and is happy when he secures an audition to join a big club. They hope that when he arrives in the city the cousin will take care of him. <br /> <br /> But cousins ​​are like chalk and cheese: a naive country boy, the other a street spender who managed to mix with drug dealers and gangsters. A Mat is unlikely to spend a quiet evening before his big day. <br /> <br /> Having lost his cousin George (Damien Robertson) upon arrival in the city, Mat encounters further problems when a young motorcyclist takes him for a ride in more than one way. <br /> <br /> Toby Malone, probably best known for his work in the theater, stages a commendable performance as the bucolic teenager. There are tell-tale signs of a low budget, but like so many other low-budget films, there is more fun, apparently more spontaneity and more charm than can be seen in the blockbuster Hollywood movie.
