I had never heard of The Man in the Moon until I saw it last night on this HDTV channel. Look, my taste is like everyone else, eclectic. My favorites range from Blue Velvet to Dr. Strangelove to The Ghost and Mrs. Muir thru The Wizard of Oz and The Loved One, Eraserhead, repo man and The Spy Within. <br /> <br /> The Man in the Moon is made superbly, a film with a tender, joyful and tragic heart, wonderfully filmed, one in which the actors really live in the moment rather than act. This sweet story will soon be in our private library. This beautiful story of life in a much more refined era in rural Louisiana literally transports you to its pastoral environment. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to remain stoic during the last moments of the film, particularly when the girl is older than her, the heart of her sister who burns her private pain and forgives everything. <br /> <br /> Instead of ruining the enjoyment or annoying sobs with my dull prose, it will end with this suggestion from those who love films that speak from our heart to ours. <br /> <br /> If you don't buy any other films, please buy Man in the Moon. You will like to relive this moving story over and over again. It is a joy and a gem, a film that is too scarce in this world of hardened hearts. <br /> <br /> The simple virtues of Man in the Moon are a joy to behold. <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Manasota Key, Florida <br /> <br /> April 5, 2009
