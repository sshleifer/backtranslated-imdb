<br /> <br /> This is definitely a "must see" for those who occasionally smoke a reefer in their secret hiding place, trying to avoid being caught by parents, teachers, police, etc. ... The main character is a lady of about forty, who lives in her villa, who raises orchids, and absolutely unaware of the fact that her so-called rich and sincere husband is actually broke and betrays her. When she suddenly dies, she is faced with the truth. The bailiff arrives to tell her that he has a huge debt. She doesn't know what to do until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in Britain. He decides after a long period of reflection to get rid of his flowers and start raising a vase instead ... The story is quite original, the performance exceptional! I can only think of some films that made me laugh more than this. Yet the melodramatic touch is present. The film is typical English: the jokes are not vulgar, there is no violence. It should not be said that it is advisable to have taken some drafts before looking at "Saving grace". It will be much more fun! Especially the scene with the 2 old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious. I thought my jaws would explode. 9/10
