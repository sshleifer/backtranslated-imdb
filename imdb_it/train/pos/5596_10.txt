"The Tenant" is the best film by Roman Polanski IMO. And I love "Chinatown", but this is much more original, unconventional and decidedly gruesome. It's also a great black comedy. Some people I showed to this film have been * very disturbed * by this later, so be aware that this affects some people that way. Polanski does a great job starring in "The Tenant" and directing it.
