Also known as the Big Spook war. The Great War Yokai is Miike's attempt to shoot a family film and he too does a damn good job. The problem is that I can't imagine many parents wanting to submit their children to this film. The best films for children are those that are scary or have slightly disturbing images, I can think of Neverending Story and Return to Oz, but in the case of the Great Yokai War, Miike probably takes things a little too far. In fact at the screening I was present to the person who presented the reiterated film to the two families there, which was probably not very suitable. <br /> <br /> The film kicks off with the young hero of the piece who introduces himself and explains about his current family problems. This brief moment of worldliness breaks off abruptly when a cow gives birth to a calf with the face of a human who shouts that something terrible is coming before falling as dead as the abomination it is (it is quite possible that the sheer crap of creature is a bizarre tribute to Quato). <br /> <br /> After an incredible introduction to the main villain Kato, and to his scagnotrice Agi (a surprisingly attractive Chiaki Kuriyami), by means of an increasing apocalyptic army. The story returns to normal for a while, but it doesn't take long before all the logic goes down the drain and the young boy joins a group of Miyazaki who refuses to eliminate the evil wizard. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is quite simple and sometimes surprisingly sometimes truculent, the whole chosen seems completely out of place in a film that breaks clich√©s so often, but is helped by a simple vision inspirer of a magical world. This is really a film by Miyazaki turned into a live action movie, even if it is a more humane and crueler film than the usual Miyazaki movie. <br /> <br /> The film is simply a joy to see the designs of the Yokai is colorful, and largely practical, while the monstrous robotic monstrosities that do not show the best CGI in the world have a practicality and a threat that makes them much more a palpable threat than one can imagine. <br /> <br /> The cast is uniformly excellent, they simply make their characters look perfectly natural, which is commendable considering that most of them are in full body makeup or latex. Agi has also trained with a ridiculous hive and is sensual and deadly thanks to Kuriyami's surprisingly excellent acting. <br /> <br /> While the film has many elements that place it firmly in the territory of family films; cute creatures, junior heroes, a completely evil villain, a sense of mischief and adventure, and a significant lack of violence. There are elements that make you doubt that Miike should have directed a film like that. <br /> <br /> The robot army is a real threat terrifying everyday objects deformed in monstrous beasts that look like T-101 sans skin and with chainsaws added. These beasts tear the characters apart; suck the creatures in their blood-stained mouths and kidnap the children from their homes by sliding them directly under their parents' noses before giving in to a little patricide. <br /> <br /> Creation of the creature is equally difficult for young minds. The Yokai, essentially the heroes, are fed in a gigantic furnace filled with a form of liquidated hatred that corrodes the flesh of the Yokai and forces their angry souls to possess pieces of metal. If the children thought that Anakin was a bad wait, they see a hedgehog of a man burning in an abyss of melted hatred for a minute before being turned into a motorcycle abomination. There is also a cut of the limbs, in one case a severed hand writhes in front of the camera dripping with blood, a fair amount of sexual energy (Agi wears a dress designed specifically for the service of fans and seems to have slept only with Kato as motivation, while the princess of the rivers wears almost nothing and is tempted by the young hero in different scenes), and the general humor that will go right over the heads of those that this technicolor wonder has apparently been designed for. <br /> <br /> Spoilers An example of this is that the Yokai are only interested in the final battle when they think it is a big party. The next battle more than a festival more than anything else, complete with beer, crowd surfing and moshing. Even a scene in which Agi defeats the tar of a pretty hairy creature seems designed to attract the exhausted masses from the pokemon overkill. <br /> <br /> End Spoilers At the end of the day The Great Yokai War is easily on Miike's most recent films. While it lacks some of the perverse charm of saying Gozu or Ichi, it continues to push the public along a road of general madness. In fact this is easily the most bewildered film of Miike, in the sense that it embraces the pure magic of the subject with all his heart. <br /> <br /> Deserves a watch only for the occasional flash of the Gogo ass.
