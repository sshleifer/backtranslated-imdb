Family Ties' Skippy moves from a clean movie to a metal guy in this pretty bad movie. It seems that the film was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed that metal music was making their children bad or killing them - except in this one dead satanic metal star is trying to get back from the grave (using Skippy to help out). And while the plot is trivial and clich√©, the cornea (for example, a wicked green mist that takes away a girl's clothes) and the soundtrack are what make the movie so funny (and great). And, of course, there's nothing like Ozzy Osbourne who plays a preacher asking what happened to the love song :). Definitely a movie to have some friends over for a good laugh. And while you're at it, make it a double movie with Slumber Party Massacre 2 - there's a "wicked rocker" (as stated on the video box) killer of black leather with fringes. A must see for cinema fans.
