It's a strange story, but somehow impressive, about love. Persistently, I have never come across such a shocking story in real life. But, I can imagine there is. <br /> <br /> It's a story that promises to be "sick" from the title. But, having seen it, I did not have this feeling of "illness" that I would certainly have had regarding the rules of society. It is something beautiful in this film ... something impressive ... which I cannot contradict with the rules of morality or society. <br /> <br /> The film focuses mainly on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship starts, evolves and eventually ends. Feel the moment when this love blossoms, the first touching, whispers. Feel the connection. And at no time did I think it was immoral. You also hope that it won't break in the end ... it can't break ... it's not right. Feel the pain of being broken in the end ... <br /> <br /> But I also need to add a negative rotation to this comment ... I don't know if the story is somehow * showed * to give the feeling that these relationships are sick only in form, but not in content. You don't have the total history, but only fragments. When the film started, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu was already in place. So, no clue about the nature of the relationship. You feel only a tension between them ... a struggle between the need for love and the desire to break this relationship. I think this line of Kiki to Sandu says it all: "I want to stop ... and if you love me, you'll do as I ask." <br /> <br /> This film will probably raise some questions about what love is and what must be moral ... and where is the limit between them. I don't know if the idea of ​​this film is "love conquers all ... even social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful ... no matter how or where". But in my opinion, this film is already a success for the simple reason that makes you think ...
