I'm a big fan of Woody Allen and so, when I saw that this was in the cinema, I couldn't do without myself. I wanted to see how Allen would follow his magnificent film Match Point as this is another of his films shot in G.B. (which is unique among Allen's works) along with what appears to be his new muse Scarlett Johanson. Scoop is much lighter than MP and humor is the funniest aspect of Scoop. The plot revolves around the character of Johanson (a journalism student) who gets a hint about a warm story from beyond the grave. He falls in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman) and must decide if it's worth discovering the truth. Oh, and all this was done with the help of an angry magician turned detective played by Allen. <br /> <br /> I must say that I enjoyed Johanson's performance a lot but I'm a little bias, I could watch a three-hour movie with Johanson in ever frame and be enchanted. She plays a ditsy, awkward and bumbling treasure which is a kind of variation in the sense of the stereotypical character of Allen's neuroses. Adds the appropriate body language for comic effect. Needless to say, almost everyone who sees this will find the Johanson character incredibly cute and that's an advantage. <br /> <br /> Allen is Allen ... He's still playing the same character very similar to Chaplin and his character in Little Tramp. Something that happens in this film makes me wonder if I will see the little neurotic hypochondriac again. He is not in the cast of his next photo and has spent more time exclusively behind the camera ... <br /> <br /> Jackman is also funny as the suspected suspicion of millionaire murders. I can't say that Jackman does anything in particular to make his role, but it still fits his character. <br /> <br /> In terms of plot I can't help but feel that this is cool ... In fact it smells like Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Johanson and Allen are more detectives than anything else. However, I have to applaud Allen for his final because he is a little smarter than the typical Hollywood version of this film. Instead of being all in black and white, things are painted in shades of gray. Being completely innocent has nothing to do with it, nor does it imply an unmistakable sense of guilt. Although the plot seemed old, Woody still has a talent for a ship. I found his allusions to his latest interesting film ... Come for humor, laugh and be happy. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if you like Allen's work, watch it. If you don't look at something else ...
