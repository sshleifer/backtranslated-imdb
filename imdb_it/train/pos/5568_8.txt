A typical joke to the reality of Cheech and Chong that includes drugs, singing, more drugs, cars and driving, even more drugs, Pee Wee, aliens, gasoline, laundry, comedy standing, surprisingly more drugs and SPACE COKE !!. It's not as consistent or plausible as Up in Smoke but it's still incredibly fun, without becoming as strange as Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes, which include the opening scene where they get some gas for their car and the drive to work. Also funny is Cheech's (Mexican-American) song and Chong's follow-up song. Another noteworthy scene is the welfare office scene with Jones (human noise machine), the Police Academy series and the old laughing man. All in all, this is a great sequel to Up in Smoke and it's quite watchable when it's sober or not. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
