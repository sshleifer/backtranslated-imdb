The first series of Lost started with a bang ... literally and slowly decreased in rhythm. This may have turned some viewers off and people who started looking halfway would be bored or just confused. <br /> <br /> I would like to advise new people in the world of Lost to simply look at the beginning and not let them escape the slower episodes. The acting is excellent, but why are 5 series programmed ... WHY? All this means that there will be no answers for at least 4 years, oh well, I will continue to watch if it maintains high tension and dialogue flows.
