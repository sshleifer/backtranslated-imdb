I must say that I was surprised by the quality of the film. It was much better than I expected. The scenery and acting are quite good. The director also did a good job. Although some scenes seem a bit clumsy, overall it's a decent movie. The idea was decidedly brilliant and the truth was not revealed until the end. The atmosphere of the psychiatric hospital was quite good. The plot was clear, consistent and well thought out. Some people might find it a bit boring even though the plot is very focused and they take their time for character and story development. Moral of the plot, it is a decent film for its genre and is surprisingly good.
