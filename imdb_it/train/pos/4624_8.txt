Believe it or not, the last case of the Inspector Gadget is the one that made me fall in love with the whole Gadget thing. <br /> <br /> My name is Miriam and I am twelve, so obviously I wasn't around when the Inspector Gadget was at the beginning of his career. Of course, I had heard of him, but I didn't really know him. <br /> <br /> While reading, note that I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE ORIGINAL SERIES (I would if it came!). This is just the only Gadget item I've ever seen (even though I'm obsessed now) and I'll focus on what I liked because everyone else is so negative. For all you pessimists, I also have disadvantages. = P First of all, for a sense of childish humor, you might consider this film rather amusing. I thought it was, so report me. I also thought that the animation and character design were good, and I'm also glad there was more Gadget, since it's my favorite character. (I don't like Penny.) Then there was Claw (his voice was terrible, though) and the Madcat; I thought they were also pretty good. Gadget's idiocy seemed pretty good, if not a bit exaggerated (ie sucking the thumb of his hand with his hat hand. It would be a good screen, though. = P) Oh, and I liked the song that was playing credits. Yes, I'm strange. <br /> <br /> And, like all films, there are also some negative aspects. <br /> <br /> Talking machines? What happens with that? It can be said that this was aimed at younger kids. This would not bother me that much if there were not the fact that the machines actually saved the situation. I would have preferred a lot if Penny and Brain had taken their place. And apparently Gadget loved his car more than it can be called natural. A bit strange, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the boss was definitely bad with Gadget. I mean, sheesh, yes, he wasn't always the most cheerful of people, but he didn't hate Gadget, from what I read. Like the inspector, his personality was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Well, that's pretty much all I have to say about this movie. I thought the animation compensated for the car-centered plot and that it was overall pretty decent; more than live-action gadget movies (slaughtered, slaughtered, BUTCHERED!) at least. Maybe I'm just biased because that's what got me into Gadget, first, or maybe my mind is twisted, or maybe I'm just weird, but I really liked this movie, even though I'm the oldest it's recommended for.
