In the "101 Dalmatian" of 1996, Crudelia De Vil was arrested by the Metropolitain police in London (God bless them) for trying to steal and kill 101 puppies - Dalmatians. All covered in mud and hay, he spent the next 4 years in the "tin can". Now, 4 years later, she, unfortunately, was released from prison. I say, I'm about 28 - in dog years !!!!! <br /> <br /> So, in 2000, Disney decided to release a sequel to the hit live-action version of the classic movie and is nicknamed "102 Dalmatians". In it, there is a 102m Dalmatian added to the family (Oddball is the name, I think, I should know this since this has just been shown on TV recently), and the puppy had no spots !!!!! Also, while Cruella (again played by Glenn Close) ran away again, she wanted a bigger and better coat, once again out of the puppies !!!!! <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the acronym - I'm sure everyone loves the "Atomic Dog" song of the '70s or so. And now we hear a little about it in this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> "102 Dalmatians" is such a beautiful film that I keep asking myself: WHEN WILL THE "103 DALMATIANS ???" LOL <br /> <br /> 10 stars
