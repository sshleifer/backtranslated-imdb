Strange but emotionally disturbing chiller for the old middle-aged man (William H. Macy) who eventually decides to leave the family business (hire murder) run by his silently exaggerated father (Donald Sutherland) while he sees a shrink (John Ritter) and flirting with another patient (Neve Campbell). <br /> <br /> Talking about a big dilemma, but "Panic" is a high-level thriller that looks like "American Beauty" meets "The Professional". Macy and Sutherland are the protagonists here. Notable debut for the debut writer / director Henry Bromell. I am surprised that this film has not had the chance to stay in theaters for more than a couple of weeks.
