I've seen Maslin Beach a couple of times - both in free to air TV in Brisbane. I do not mean whether it is good, bad or not, as others have treated well and truly. <br /> <br /> I will say that it is so Australian. Only in Australia can we have a film about the relationships between people who spend the day naked as the day they were born and to see it on free commercial television. <br /> <br /> I have a friend from the United States who is constantly amazed at what we put on our free TV compared to his home country. Sex and the CIty and Huff are just examples. <br /> <br /> Although our government has tried to transform us into the 51st state of the United States, it's nice to know that at least some things really remain Aussie
