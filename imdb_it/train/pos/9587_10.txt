Fifteen years later, Paris Is Burning is still on fire. This is a classic in black gay movies, right there with the other black gay honorary films, The Color Purple and Mahoganoy. This seminal work captures the culture and the gay and sub-class underclass and sub-classes like no other work before or after, including all the retrospectives and gay representations of Harlem Rennaissance sentimental. They are good, but this is the best (dare I say the only "real" movie you'll find on the subject. It's Relentlessy Cunty (the classic invention of house music) that comes to Hollywood, a non-stop, hilarious field (like only us we do it) and dead social criticism All this from a white director (who obviously had to be a nun Gurl or Mizz Thing in a previous life). I could go on, but I think you understood immediately: I love this movie!
