A well-made film, with a tragic ending. Advantages: the way the story moves - it starts with Soorya struggling to live followed by a long flashback on why it's there. The music. A disinterested look at the lives of policemen. Negative aspects: violence and blood, but I think they add realistic effects. Still, having heads of people cut and sent in boxes and bags could have been avoided. <br /> <br /> No complaints - 7/10
