A friend of mine recommended this film, citing my vocal and inflective similarities with Des Howl, the main character in the film. I imagine that up to a point I can see it and maybe a little more, I'm not very sure it's a flattering portrait. <br /> <br /> This is a rather unique work, the only film that this could have more of a garish resemblance would be True Romance, not for the content or style of the shoot or for the rhythm of the dialogue (Whale Music is just so much more, well, relaxed.) But instead that both represent modern love stories. <br /> <br /> In general I am a big fan of Canadian films about music and musicians (for example I highly recommend the Hard Core logo) and in particular this film. He has an innocent charm, Des is not always the nicest guy, but there is something about him that draws a kind of empathy.
