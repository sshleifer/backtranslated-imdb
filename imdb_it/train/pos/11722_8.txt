To be honest I only watched this film for my audience needs. I mean, I couldn't have women at my age (I was 9 or 10), so I thought watching Elvira's neckline was the most secret thing about sex. <br /> <br /> I ended up having fun with this classic cult of horror comedy, Halloween parties, sassy humor and sexy evil shown by Elvira. They just don't make films like this anymore ... It had the feeling of an amateur effort mixed with a host of talk shows in the late evening. <br /> <br /> The truth is that it generated a lot of fans because of his humor and ability to perform on Cassandra's part. <br /> <br /> This is a classic that reminds me of the good days of USA Up All Night.
