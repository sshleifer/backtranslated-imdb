How can the viewer rating for this movie be only 5.4 ?! Only the young and adorable Alisan Porter should automatically start at six when you decide your score. Even James Belushi is good at this, his first serious and serious role, I didn't like anything, except About Last Night up to this. He was pretty good at Gang Related with Tupac also. Kelly Lynch, you must love her. Well, I do it. I'm just wondering what happened to Miss Porter? <br /> <br /> I gave Curly Sue a 7
