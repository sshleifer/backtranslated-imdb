"Castle of Blood" (also known as "Castle of Terror") is a surprisingly spooky entry by Italian director Anthony Dawson. A refined cinematography in black and white, an impeccable dubbing, an excellent cast, quite logical scripts, a deliberate stimulation and a surprise conclusion (even if completely appropriate) that distinguish this one. Only the films, sometimes the mushy music and the sudden "passion at first sight" between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivière) show off an otherwise surprisingly amusing film. <br /> <br /> During his visit to England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub, telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young journalist, requires an interview with Poe. During the course of the conversation, Poe reveals that all his stories are true. Incredulous, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers to bet 100 pounds of Alan that he can't survive this night in Blackwood Castle, one night after Halloween when the dead walk. Alan can't afford the bet, so he bets on his life for a £ 10 bet. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Black Sunday" by Mario Bava (aka "The Mask of Satan"), "Castle of Blood" is quite discreet, making the few moments of violence even more terrible, especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible Italian space films of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> It's a shame the only version of this film I found is a badly deteriorated (and recorded) pan and scan version. Even so, it's worth seeing, and yelling for a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch it and enjoy a movie that compares well with "The Haunting" by Robert Wise.
