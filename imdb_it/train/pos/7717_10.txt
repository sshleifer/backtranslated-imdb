I loved this movie all my life. It is also such a clever story, with many classic allusions. for example. The ship that was missing decades ago was called Bellerophon. Well, in classical mythology this was the man who killed the Chimera, a legendary beast composed of two or more other creatures. In FP, Walter Pidgeon is clearly the chimera and his monster. <br /> <br /> I like movies where writers have clearly credited their audiences with a minimum of intelligence, unlike the more modern blockbusters that spend $ 150 million on special effects, but about $ 1.50 on a script. <br /> <br /> Greetings
