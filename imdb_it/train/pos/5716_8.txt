I haven't seen any of the Japanese Grudge movies, but I really like that. I rarely fear watching movies. I can jump, if the effect and the sound are quite surprising, but scaring me from a movie is a rare thing for me. But I got scared of Grudge. Maybe because I didn't expect anything when I saw it. I didn't expect to be afraid. I didn't know anything either. It was probably a good thing. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you apparently love or hate. Most people seem to compare it to Japanese Grudge movies, but even if I haven't seen them, I think it's not fair to compare any movie, actually. This film is all his. <br /> <br /> The story is weak, many people say. I disagree The story is minimalist and made on purpose. The story telling techniques used - for example the broken time lapse - are perfectly executed. The director knows exactly what he's doing, and I think he got his vision the way he wanted. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 8 out of 10. It's a movie that you will like to watch or hate. It's that simple.
