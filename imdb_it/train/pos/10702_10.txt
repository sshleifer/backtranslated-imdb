From what the critics and the public have indicated, BIRTHDAY GIRL had to be a big fat clinker. Anyway, because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent it last night. He proved to be quite worthy of watching. Of course, it's not your basic American comedy, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out that it's a very British film, but that's why I liked it. It was a change from all the other films in circulation, a breath of fresh air. Of course, there were a few holes in the plot, but overall it worked. First of all, Kidman was fabulous again in a very different role, not very charming, but still quite sexy. He continues to prove that she is one of Hollywood's best talents. Not only is he his Russian accent when he speaks effective English, but there are moments when he has long conversations in Russian and if you didn't know it was Nicole Kidman, I would never question his authenticity. Harrison Ford should have taken note in "K-19". Overall a small film that works despite the bad buzz.
