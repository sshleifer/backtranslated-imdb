Oh, what fun is here! <br /> <br /> Amy Heckerling has a talent for directing the comedy (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Look Who's Talking) but here it seems she told the actors to go out and have fun. Michael Keaton bears witness to the role of Johnny, easily his best performance on screen. Joe Piscopo is as exceptional as Danny Vermin, who has not understood shameful directors. And I also mentioned Richard Dimitri who plays Moroni and the character's unique vocabulary. I don't think it's a coincidence that most of the character's name is written MORON. <br /> <br /> Good lines are scattered throughout the film, with Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne. Murren Stapleton, Merilu Henner gave good jokes. Even actors with minor roles like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale have a good reputation. <br /> <br /> recommend it to a friend.
