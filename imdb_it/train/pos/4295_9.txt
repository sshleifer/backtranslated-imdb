Alain Chabat states that this film is his original idea, but the theme of the reluctant lovers who eventually do it is old, if not older than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Chabat is a "vieux garcon", happily single and not wanting any member of the opposite sex to disturb his life. He has a problem, 5 sisters and a matriarchal mother - the G7 - who decides he should be married. Enter the delightful and charming Charlotte Gainsbourg and what a simple plan should be. Charlotte has to pose as Chabat's girlfriend and then simply does not show up on her wedding day. We no longer talk about marriage from the G7. Of course the best plans have the habit of going out of control. <br /> <br /> There are very strong support roles from Lafont as mother and Osterman as the hard fist brother of Gainsbourg. <br /> <br /> There are some fantastic scenes like Charlotte must first fascinate, then turn the family over. French farce with an Englishman.
