I have to deliver it to the creative team behind these "American Pie" films. "Direct To DVD" is generally synonymous with economic and incompetent film production. Yet last year I was pleasantly surprised when I was comfortable with the sequel to the DVD "The Naked Mile". The directors took advantage of the opportunity to offer a small, vulgar, but amusing film. This year they offer the sequel, "Beta House". This is honest truth, "Beta House" makes the first "American Pie" movies look like "The Little Mermaid". <br /> <br /> This is a fun game with no holds barred, tasteless, fun. Of course, the story is a bit thin, but this is the beauty of the whole thing. Within the first 10 minutes we introduce ourselves to all the main characters, the new supporting characters, take a handful of raucous gags, meet the bad guys and establish the general plot. With all this, the film becomes a limitless ride. The gags are a lot, and they did NOT hold on to this. I'm talking about male sperm, urine, dildos, cocks with cocks, sex with sheep, splashes of female orgazim and much more. Not to mention the fact that not a minute passes without boobs or a sex scene. <br /> <br /> Coming back from "The Naked Mile" are John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley and Eugene Levy (in a similar supporting role as the latest films). The whole cast works great. Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler), in particular, has a great energy and presence on the screen. I foresee good things for him. The film is also packed with fantastic film references for those who keep their eyes open. By far the biggest laugh in the film for me was the parody of "The Deerhunter". Classic. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that, if you're a fan of the series, you'll feel right at home with "Beta House". It really pushes the limits of good taste, but in the end it's damn funny.
