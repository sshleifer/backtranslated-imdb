It takes courage to make a movie about Gandhi in India, in which it is not shown as a man who cannot make mistakes. This film shows how a Mahatma was not a decent father (at least in the eyes of his son). <br /> <br /> The shows are fantastic, the cinematic fantastic, the fabulous direction, but the film draws. If the intention was to make this film without box office expectations, which I assume is the case here, then it's a brilliant attempt, but if the producers expected this to be a commercial success, then the fate of the film was condemned on day they chose this topic .. <br /> <br /> 20 years from now, this film will be remembered for the brilliant portrait of Harilal by Akshaye Khanna. He deserves an Oscar nomination for this .. And honestly, his is not the only performance worth clapping, even Shefali Chhaya is terrifying .. <br /> <br /> Watch the scene where Harilal hears of his father's death. No dialogue, no shouting, but a wordless shot from Khanna. If it is one of the most beautiful scenes ever filmed in the history of cinema, Gandhi, my father is not at all exciting cinema but yes, his excellent cinema and a watch not to be missed. Brilliant attempt ...
