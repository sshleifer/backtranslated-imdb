Riding Giants is a fantastic film. It really shows how these people lived then just to browse. Their lives were essentially surfing, life, breathing and fun. They didn't care about money, work, girls or anything. For them the waves were their girls. I've never been on a surfboard, and it seems so hard, I don't understand how they can stand on them, it doesn't make any sense. This is a fantastic movie and if you love surfing, you should really watch this movie. If you are a surfer and want to find out who started surfing, how it was born, who is really famous or what ever, then you should really see it. It could be a documentary, but it's really good. -Tara F.-
