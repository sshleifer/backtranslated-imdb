King's Solomon's Mines brings Patrick Swayze (playing Allan Quatermain) who spent a lot of time in Africa, but decides it's time to go back to England and be the father of his son. He finds out that his wife's parents have taken his son into custody and that he has little chance of getting custody of him with a lot of money for a lawsuit. Alison Deedy (who plays Elizabeth) arrives, whose father is in Africa and is detained by an African tribe for the redemption of the map that Elizabeth's father had sent her. Elizabeth seeks Quatermain to bring her back to Africa to find her father. <br /> <br /> There is a good cast of secondary characters that accompany Quatermain and Elizabeth and of course there are some enemies (Russians) who also want the map. <br /> <br /> The film draws your attention to the end. Patrick, once again, plays a man of rare beauty and honor who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress. Patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, the robust good man, anger and strength; In King Solomon's Minds his character smiles a few times. I would really like to see Patrick Swayze in a story of relaxed live loves, in which he doesn't have to tighten his jaws and be so strong. Maybe a little dance could help. But this is a good film for the whole family and is worth watching.
