Xizao is a rare little film. It is simple and undemanding, and at the same time so gratifying in emotions and joy. The plot is simple, and the theme of the old and the new clash is wonderfully introduced in the early scenes. This theme is the essence of the film, but it would have fallen if it hadn't been for the magnificent characters and actors that portrayed them. <br /> <br /> The elderly patriarch, Master Liu, is a relic of China days of pre-expansion. He runs a bathroom in an old neighborhood. Every single scene set in the bathtub is a source of jealousy for us stressed out, unhappy people. Not even the most hardened cynics can find fault in this wonderful setting. <br /> <br /> Master Liu's son, Er Ming, is the second really powerful character in the film, along with the brother of his modern life. The interactions between these three people and the various visitors to the beach establishment are incredibly detailed and touching, with some scenes that contain so many emotions that go beyond everything seen in the movies. <br /> <br /> With his regime - critical message, this film was not only censored, but also given an unreasonably small coverage. It could be a coincidence, but when a movie of this caliber is practically impossible to find, even on the Internet (!), You can't help but be suspicious. <br /> <br /> So it helps freedom of speech and the film world, buy, rent, copy this wonderful film, and if you happen to own the DVD, if there is one, share the sharing!
