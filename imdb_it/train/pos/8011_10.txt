This was the best Muppet movie I've ever seen! It happens to know that Miss Piggy's fantasy of meeting children was the cause of the Muppet Babies. The songs will remain in my head forever. I only say this because that stupid Nickelodeon song, Hey Dude, still remains in my head. Sorry, a little off topic. But anyway what I like is Animal after the credits that say "Bye bye! Bye bye! Bye bye! Bye bye! Bye! Hasta luego!" This made me laugh so hard. My absolute favorite is the game at the end. I was surprised that the characters from Sesame Street turned up at the wedding. I'm glad this movie was a lot of fun. I borrowed it from the library and now I bought it because I can't keep the copy of the library forever. In conclusion, I proclaim that this is the best film I've ever seen! In my case, it's even better than Austin Powers in Goldmember, which was my favorite movie!
