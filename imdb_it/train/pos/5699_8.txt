One of the most disturbing and tragic periods in American history begins. The members of the Summer of Love culture, in the late seventies and early eighties, were eventually an old tool for love pearls and all night parties and evolved into current life, whatever meant. For those who failed to grow their youthful and sometimes irrational exuberance, theirs was the culture of Wonderland. The love for drugs and the sense of law combined with disgust for authority, values ​​and the "establishment" is the world that the film captures. <br /> <br /> The sixties were a period of revolution and violent changes that pierced the American "home". Once the battles were over, we all had to face the consequences of the carnage. The characters in the house of wonders are icons of the misfits of the seventies; part-biker, partly hippie, partly swindler, all marginalized. No ideology to express, only a sense of dissatisfaction with everything and loyalty to nothing. Ron, Billy and David imagine themselves as a kind of Robin Hoods with drugs. They speak of love and behave in a violent way; take from the rich and sell to the unfortunate; steal from everyone. <br /> <br /> Holmes and company are the end result of a strange antimatter collision like sex, drugs and rock & roll, when lab technicians get bored and move on. <br /> <br /> The film is skillfully directed and stimulated and captures the fast-paced world of drug enemies in their element. The fact that Holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant. That story was told in "Boogie Nights". This is a story of a transient and forgettable age.
