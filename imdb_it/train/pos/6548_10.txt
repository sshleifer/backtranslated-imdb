This is a great movie! I played all of Nancy Drew's games and read the books, and I never expected the film to be so exciting and fun! If you've never heard of Nancy Drew, read the first book (Secret of the Old Clock) so you can get used to Nancy, so you can watch the movie, because in the movie, they don't really introduce the characters' quick names. ;) We liked all my family and the plot was extremely interesting. This is a last comeback from Nancy Drew's previous films, which the Nancy Drew actor didn't seem to match. This film is very similar to Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. It's so beautiful! Nancy Drew lovers, you have to watch this!
