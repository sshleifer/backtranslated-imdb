I really liked this documentary about Kenny and Spencer's attempt to publish "The Dawn". It was a great look at how strangers try to get inside to make it big. <br /> <br /> The story was well made and organized in an interesting way that made the film go well. Definitely worth looking at. My only complaint is that they didn't seem to be closed. Maybe it's part of the point. We expect but in reality it is not what happened (or what usually happens). <br /> <br /> The film is also a great way to see the personalities of Kenny and Spencer outside of their Canadian television program. You can see some of what is yet to come. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to see The Papal Chase.
