The Dirty Harry series began with a very aggressive police action, and was almost immediately lightened for "Magnum Force". At a time when "The Enforcer" turned around, Dirty Harry was little more than a television police show (saved only by Tyne Daly). After a seven-year break, Dirty Harry has finally returned to his roots. Maybe this time he's gone for too long. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood is the first Harry film directed by Don Siegel who did the first, which helps greatly. Harry is again a darker character, not the nice cop he had become. He can once again say things like "Go ahead, prepare my day" and really think seriously. "Sudden Impact" is a true sequel to Dirty Harry. "The Enforcer" should never have been realized. <br /> <br /> 7.2 out of 10
