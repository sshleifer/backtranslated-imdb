Terry Gilliam traveled back to the future (he had already done so in "Brazil") to tell this story of a virus that is destroying the human race. <br /> <br /> The script is totally insane with some easy tricks on it but it's pretty funny and Gilliam proves to have imagination (futuristic scenes are just fantastic). As for the cast, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (whatever happened to her ??) are OK, but Brad Pitt is so irritating, every time he plays in roles he missed, he turns out to be all forced and not credible. . He should just play good-looking young men. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
