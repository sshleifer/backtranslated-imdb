I remember when I was five and my parents thought it was a normal cartoon movie ... except when the bras and bullets began to fly. I must say that this film will make anyone and everyone angry because it is set up to discriminate against everyone and anyone ... but the truth is that it is as much fun as it is profound. I recommend it to anyone who loves cult classics. Try Fritz the cat and the nine lives of Fritz the cat. If I'm correct, even Ralph Bashki made that movie. It involves a cat that goes through difficult times with family, roads, jobs, etc. When I was old enough, I rented all these films. Because Coonskin was an offensive title during that era he was also labeled as Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki also made Cool World starring a very young Brad Pitt. Heavy traffic was another cartoon that dealt with a young man's street life.
