My parents took me to this movie when I was nine. I never forgot it. I had never seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor. (He was twenty-two when he did Elephant Walk.) Remember, I'm nine, so the feelings aren't sexual, I couldn't see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit at his feet like a puppy and stare at her. She started showing her age, (she's almost seventy-four) but I still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women I've ever lived. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie several times since then, and it's a mushy melodrama. What saves him is, of course, the beauty of Miss Taylor, the magnificent landscapes, the strong flight of elephants and a well-made point about human arrogance in the face of nature. <br /> <br /> All in all, a well-spent a couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video.
