I'm not a very good writer, so I'll keep this brief. World at War is the best WWII documentary I've ever seen. I saw several documentaries from the Second World War (not only English / North American) and this documentary seems to be the most complete documentary of the Second World War I've ever seen. I think he could talk a little more about the Great Depression and why Hitler took power, but he does a great job of covering up the war. It seems to be complete and objective / fair for everyone. It does not exaggerate or diminish the roles of different nations. It has a lot of original footage, including full-color shoots and many eyewitnesses (it was made in the 1970s when a lot more were alive). He has excellent music and narrator. All-in-All I gave this 10/10, because it's so good. (I haven't seen DVD specials, so I can't comment on those)
