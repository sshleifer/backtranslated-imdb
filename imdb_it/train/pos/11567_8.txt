In the 1930s the studios used short films like this as a testing ground for new actors, given the relative ease of production compared to feature films, so it's interesting that this is the protagonist of Shirley Temple, who had long established herself as the most famous child star of all time. Then again, it probably wasn't the one being tested, I imagined it would be Frank Coghlan Jr., who played the role of Shirley's brother, Sonny, in the film and which offered relatively less impressive performances. So again, a 9-year-old Shirley Temple probably wasn't an easy act to accompany. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a flashy visual that involves a leaky ceiling, which I suppose was designed to have Shirley Temple give a disdainful look at the ceiling, illustrates the status of the working class of the family in the film and provide a clean transition in the next scene, which sees Shirley beat happily in the rain. <br /> <br /> It's Sonny 'y birthday, and his father makes occasional and horrendous efforts to hide the fact that he wants to give Sonny a dog he really wants for himself, but Sonny is afraid of dogs because he was bitten from one only once and has always been beside himself with. It is curious that, when his father insists on having a dog, Sonny decides to run away from home rather than having a dog at home, and while he is running away without a destination in sight, it is also curious that the film illustrates what appears to be a indifference to the homeless that overcomes the incredible indifference that exists today. <br /> <br /> Sonny passes a man who cooks the bacon in an iron pan on the side of the tracks (immediately after flying over a train, considering how close to the tracks it was, one might think that the man jumped off the rails, but it doesn't matter). After Sonny has given up sharing breakfast because of the sour look his joyful smile receives from the boy, he continues and the homeless boy disappears from the movie. It is interesting to consider what a longer film would have done, because this leaves this poor boy like a spring. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter, Sonny soon hears a dog moaning under an easel as he passes by and jumps down to find a dog covered in drool. It might seem trivial that he immediately takes the dog and adopts it since he just left home because of his fear of dogs, but it seemed to me that he was not reminded of his power over dogs, but of their lack of power over he. As soon as he saw a needy dog ​​he overcame his fear. <br /> <br /> Hey, if that's all it takes, all I have to do is find a defenseless spider and I'm ready! <br /> <br /> It is a very comfortable film in which everything works exactly as it should, but it's pretty nice and fun (and short enough, so to speak) to still be a fun movie. We don't already expect an epic storyline in a 19-minute movie, but Pardon My Pups still contains a significant amount of character and story development in its short execution period. It also features a fight scene at the end of the film that must have made Charlie Chaplin proud. I'm not an expert on Shirley Temple movies, but it's not hard to see how she became the most famous star of all time.
