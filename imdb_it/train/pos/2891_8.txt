We saw it on "The Wonderful World of Disney" on ABC last night, and came to the conclusion that things had to be closer to the "Mouse" than usual. <br /> <br /> Since this film only lasts 74 minutes, and they had to distribute it for 2 hours of television broadcasting, they had, and I'm not inventing, commercial breaks that lasted from 6 to 7 minutes. And during these commercial breaks, they had another announcement in the guise of a "television show" hosted by the very annoying Kelly Rippa who loudly proclaimed the magical wonders of "Cinderella 2: dreams come true". <br /> <br /> Again and again, pause after pause, Disney took time out of the real movie to tell us, the faithful viewers, that we needed to get a copy of the sequel. Thank you, Disney, for giving us the service of creating a sequel to your beloved movie gem. <br /> <br /> However, all this commercialism and the registration of the cash register made it a difficult task to get into the real "Cinderella" movie, because when the commercials were over, I had forgotten where the plot was interrupted . <br /> <br /> But of course, the original "Cinderella" still retains its magic, and the story is still good, even though we've seen it all the times. It's a shame that they had to downsize it with all the marketing for what appears to be a lame sequel.
