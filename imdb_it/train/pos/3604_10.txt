I think it's a great movie. because you can see what Diana's life is like at home. he has been so aggressive and wants to show that girls can fight too. I think she and Adrian were great actors. Because of this film, I Boxing also. It really impressed me. the only negative part I think. It's the end. because it's all right between Diana and Adrian. But you can't see how he is at home. And I really didn't like that you don't understand how his father and brother are. but I think it was a great movie and I think I will watch it a lot more :) I recommend it to anyone, even when you don't like boxing, you can see more than boxing. I had a great time watching it.
