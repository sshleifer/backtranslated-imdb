An Australian football player (Mat) goes to the city the night before an important game of the AFL process, in which he must be picked up by his cousin. And then things go wrong. <br /> <br /> His non-hoper cousin became confused in a drug affair involving the local lender / drug dealer Tiny (who looks like any gangster anywhere but is definitely Australian). Needless to say, Mat becomes enmeshed in chaos, and it won't be long before the thoughts of tomorrow's game are moved to the back of his mind as the frantic night events are destroyed. <br /> <br /> Professional of Shakespearian Western Australia The actor Toby Malone plays a performance as a young and naive country boy Mat and successfully plays a part well below his age. The best support comes from John Batchelor as Tiny, and a fun role for David Ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events. The shooting is hectic, often fun, and a very useful use of an hour.
