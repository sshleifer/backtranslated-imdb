First let me tell you that Before Sunrise, like all movies, is NOT a movie for everyone. It seems that some people are less good at recognizing this fact, but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of antipathy that this small harmless film generates from some people. For me, like most people here, Before Sunrise struck a deep agreement in me, I was really stunned, touched, inspired by it. This is a film that benefits from more than one vision. Create some of the incredibly unforgettable feelings and emotions you can imagine. It is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspiring feelings I got. <br /> <br /> The film functions as a communion of two fragile souls who are beginning to know each other. It is very intelligent and stimulating, not so much in the way a conversation necessarily links itself to the next or in the meaning of the topics of the discussions of Jesse and Celine, but rather in the small nuances, the perfectly articulated answers that they provoke one from the other. It captures an honest, romantic, but fleeting human emotion that is beginning to blossom in the incredible Viennese environment; convinces us that their evanescent relationship could be the greatest compliment in the world. And what happens after that night is open to debate, but I never doubt that they will never see each other again. <br /> <br /> The easy comments of RockytheBear and the following user are hopeless examples of a doctrinal dissertator who does not want to accept and respect those who love this film. <br /> <br /> Watch it and it could change your lifestyle.
