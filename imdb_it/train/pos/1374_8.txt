A French film that Ester Williams would love. But synchronized swimming was just a hook for the story of three girls in an exurbia of Paris who were there. No question about where Sciamma's sympathies are located since all the boys are depicted as "animaux", but in reality only the 3 girls are in focus, and all the time, with the few adults and other teenagers mainly in the background . Marie is a stick of a girl, unattractive but determined. She wants to be a swimmer and imposes herself on Floriane (a beauty of Renascence quality for a reviewer) and is also a friend of convenience for Anna: not unattractive, but for her the time of perfection of her body was short, and now she he is a teenager in a woman's body. What follows is a journey towards self-realization without a road map, but there is a gloom towards the three that is not natural: where is the joy and the senseless chatter of youth? While the d√©nouement was breathtaking, with Floriane's self-absorption beautifully portrayed, as well as the equally beautiful union of Marie and Anne, everything seemed abstract, the puppets of Sciamma.
