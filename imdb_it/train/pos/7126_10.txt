This film resonated with me on two levels. As a child I was evacuated from London and planted on guests not in a country village. While escaping from the bombing and doing experiences that produced precious memories (for example hearing a nightingale sing a dark night for the first time) and enjoying a life I could never have in London, I missed my family and worried about them. Tom is an old man whose wife and son both died and who lives alone in a small country village. Like an old man who is now without a wife whose children got married and live far away in another province, I am again sometimes lonely. The boy's mother is a religious fanatic with very strange ideas of raising a child. Since a deep affection grew between the old Tom Oakley and this young boy, Tom goes in search of him and finally saves him from very strange and dangerous circumstances. At the end of the story there is a lot of tension because due to some bureaucratic sentence it seems that the child will lose someone who has developed a loving relationship with him.
