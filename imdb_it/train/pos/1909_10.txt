I originally looked at 8 simple rules on the Disney UK channel for the first series and got completely passionate about it. When they didn't show him anymore he was bored, but then abc 1 satred which showed the second series. I didn't think another series would start after reading that John Ritter was dead, but the second series wasn't surprising, the last series has returned to its old excellent standard. I hope they will soon be producing other shows even if I could watch every show a thousand times. Kaley couco is my favorite character as airhead Bridget and also performs in Charmed. Rory is also good, he also shares my name and Grampa. I will continue to watch it until the end, I hope it continues to be as fun as ever
