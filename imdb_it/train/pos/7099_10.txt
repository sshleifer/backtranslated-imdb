The fantastic and twisted story of Terry Gilliam of a virus that destroys all but a handful of people across the Earth and forces them to move underground and the man sent back in time to gather information about it is a fantastic film, dizzying and highly stylized boasting Bruce Willis's best performance ever. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes 12 Monkeys from most sci-fi films over time is that Bruce Willis's character actually deals with what the psychological effects of time travel are, that is, not knowing what reality is current reality: the place from which the time traveler comes or goes. Furthermore, the film recognizes that the things they have passed cannot be altered and that the prevention of a catastrophic event, in this case the release of the said virus, cannot be stopped or modified. As Willis states, "It has already happened", while in a psychiatric hospital, the great dilemma in which the film drags on is not a trivial plot to save the world; instead it is Willis's inner struggle to simply survive himself. It's a new and innovative concept, and works beautifully thanks to a screenplay written by Peoples and Gilliam's exclusive dementia brand. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, 12 Monkey's storytelling is totally non-linear and instead opts to distort and bend the way the story is skillfully told by incorporating a series of different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past, the future and even a scene that is extracted from Hitchcock's Vertigo. Everyone serves to wrap the viewer in his disturbing cacophony of madness and futility. <br /> <br /> Visually, Gilliam is a master of desolation and shadow who rivals Tim Burton in his scenario and his incredibly discouraging images. With a cold, wide and engaging cinematography, Gilliam immerses himself in the colorless environment and the darkness of his characters. The scenes are often immersed in a strange antiseptic white and help to counter the often extravagant characters. <br /> <br /> As for performance, Brad Pitt steals most of the scenes, filling them with a patented crazy, off-the-wall performance that earned him a deserved Oscar nomination. As mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best interpretation of his career, not returning to his heroic clich√©s and heroes of cardboard and instead portrays Cole as a simple, moving, tragic ordinary man. Equally good is Madeline Stowe as a psychologist for Willis. He holds her in his arms, injecting his character with wild energy and strength as he collapses under the weight of what he believes to be a false 'religion'. <br /> <br /> Gilliam is an expert, overwhelming and complex what could have been a routine action / science fiction movie, making 12 Monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmare and futuristic landscape. His rich, well-crafted and intricate plot, along with the cast's clever performances and his dark and gloomy cinematography, make it a masterpiece of madness. In my all-time top 10, 12 Monkeys is a darkly lavish spectacle of a film full of brilliance. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
