I took this film on the Sundance channel in cable late in the afternoon. You could say "Who Loves the Sun" is a perfect pastime for a story, why not. You have to go out with the trio: Lukas Haas is Will (coming back after leaving abruptly all years ago), Molly Parker is Maggie (we learn that she is very part of the Bloom family), and Adam Scott is Daniel (he is a friend or foe or boyfriend ), from the scenic Falcon Lake, Manitoba, Canada, captured in graphic compositions juxtaposed in bright summer colors against the sun and shadows. And to support the trio there are two other family members in the revealing mix: Wendy Crewson is mom Mary Bloom, and R.H. Thomson is Arthur Bloom's dad. The director and screenwriter Matt Bissonnette has made an ingenious deployment of the plot and its various sprawling connections - don't worry, Haas could have a "listless" face, but the humor will come when Parker and Scott enter the circle of reunited friends, ironic smiles break up and get to know the mixed delicacies. The dialogues could be concise or even null, however we would have the taste of what is cooking, confused or amazed. <br /> <br /> Yes, "Who loves the sun" can be categorized as a dormant gem. The chemistry between all five presidents ensures gel and "combust", giving an energetic show of the whole. After all, it's all in the family, and the movie certainly doesn't take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> It seems that the official website is still available on "wholovesthes.com" and there is information on the soundtrack of Mac McCaughan (Portastatic with guitar melodies and strings) in which excerpts of songs and notes are played behind-the-scenes production, interview with writer-director-producer Bissonnette on how the film was born and the concept, the cast and more. I have always appreciated Molly Parker after her successful and hypnotic performance in 1996 "Kissed" by Lynne Stopkewich, and is married to Bissonnette, who "wrote the part of Maggie for Molly".
