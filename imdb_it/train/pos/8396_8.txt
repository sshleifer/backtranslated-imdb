Sensual and hard Maria Braun. (Hanna Schygula) marries a soldier in the middle of World War II and spends half a day and all night with him. That is how his marriage lasts before you forgive him in war and then in prison. She continues her life, becomes a successful business woman not only sensual but intelligent, ambitious and willing to use sex wherever and whenever it is necessary: ​​"I don't know anything about business, but I know what German women want. You could also say that I am an expert ". While climbing to success, she always remembers her husband, Hermann (her man) and becomes convinced that whatever she does? it is for him, for their future happy life together. The style of "Maria Braun" recalls most of the melodramas of Fassbinder's favorite Hollywood director, Douglas Sirk, and offers a glimpse of the loss and survival in post-war Germany. Hanna Schygula literally shines in every scene of the film and she is fantastic. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
