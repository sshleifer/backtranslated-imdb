This is one of the most daring and important films of the so-called "Pre-Codes" made in Hollywood in the 1930s. Unlike some pre-coded films that occasionally delighted in topics that would never have been admitted after 1934-5, this film has completely immersed itself in a very sordid but amusing plot from beginning to end. The conventional morality of the late 1930s and 40s was not at all evident in this film, as the film essentially talks about a conniving woman who sleeps to the top - and without excuses along the way. This "broad" loved sex and used it on all men who could help her get rich - something you would never have seen in movies made just two or three years later. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Barbara Stanwyck working in her father's comparison. Besides being her boss, she is also her pimp and encourages her to sleep with a local government official so that she can allow the illegal bar to operate with impunity. Although it is not particularly clear here, it seems that Dad has "rented" his daughter's body for a long time. <br /> <br /> However, after having almost raped and attacked this man by breaking a bottle of beer on his skull, Barbara had enough and headed for the big city. It doesn't hurt that the anchor exploded and killed his father, but his feeling that she was prostituting herself and had nothing to show seemed to be the impulse to move. <br /> <br /> Despite the Depression, Barbara uses sex to find work in a huge mega bank. He starts a rather humble job as an archivist, but in the space of what seems like only a few weeks, he sleeps from one job to another for another - until he sleeps with the head of the bank and his future son-in-law !!! All this ends in tragedy, but Babs does not seem too shaken by the death of these two men. In fact, some time later, he is able to creep into the life of the NEW CEO and once again is on top (perhaps more than one). <br /> <br /> Now, so far, this is a wonderful film because it was so gritty and unrepentant. Barbara played a 100% sociopath - a woman without morality and without conscience - only the desire to squeeze as much from life as she could not count on those who injured in the process. However, the brave writers and the producer "got busy" and thought it was important to face a redemptive ending. Considering that this woman was so wicked and conniving, her change of heart in the end was a great disappointment and severely penalized the film. In many ways, this reminded me of the end of JEZEBEL - as once again, a bad person somehow "sees the light" and changes to the not too convincing conclusion. <br /> <br /> My advice is to try looking at DONNA A RED HEAD and PLANS. THE RED HEAD WOMAN is very similar to BABY FACE but has no magical transformation at the end - the main character is really a skunk down deep! In DOWNSTAIRS, a film very similar to RED-HEADED WOMAN, the roles are reversed and a man (John Gilbert) plays a similar conniving character. Both are classic and a little better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is an extraordinary curiosity of a short period of often ultra-squalid Hollywood films and in this light it is worthwhile seeing Cinephiles. Also, The Duke fans take note - John Wayne plays a very small part in the film and it is very unusual to see a very young Wayne playing such a conventional role.
