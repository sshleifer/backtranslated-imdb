Here's what I knew about "Atlantis" before watching it: <br /> <br /> * - It's officially the first science fiction adventure from Disney. I'm not sure how precise it is (I like nitpick) but it made me curious the first time I heard it described. <br /> <br /> * - The preview seemed, for the most part, damn beautiful. Evidently, he was also "too cryptic" according to some critics after the fact. <br /> <br /> * - Apparently he did so badly that Disney said: "Fuck it, let's reread 'Spy Kids'". <br /> <br /> So with all that said, how is the movie? <br /> <br /> Hella-cool. <br /> <br /> I am an animated fantasy sucker that involves moving music and rampant special effects anyway, but "Atlantis" does everything. It's a return to all the CGI eye-candy shots in "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin", so much so that it's almost a best-of-effect show. The characters may not be so memorable (except, perhaps, for the ship's medical officer), and the plot is a bit boring, but this is not a movie you watch for the plot. <br /> <br /> Here is a controversy that annoys me. The "failure" (as in, "only" took, like, five hundred million or something like that, I know the animators who would kill to see fifteen dollars of that) of this movie compared to the popularity of "Shrek" and "Monsters Inc. " was seen as proof of the death of traditional animation. I don't think that's true. How do you explain the movie "South Park"? What about "Final Fantasy"? In reality, history and artistry are everything, not the method. I don't know what the Disney movie will be like, but I don't think they are still out of the picture.
