I saw this film for the first time when I was a beginner in high school and the film stayed with me over the years. It's not about the soundtrack, nor the cinematography, nor the dialogue and the acting, but it concerns the educational purpose and the message behind is the most important. It's not a shame to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school, and it's not even a bad thing, but it's a problem. Tons of girls I knew now all have children, and I imagine they never saw this great movie, and if they did, they clearly didn't get the message behind it all. It involves not taking risks when you are in a sexual relationship. Every girl can get pregnant for the first time. It is not a myth. You don't necessarily have to lose your dreams, but they have to go back to your future because you have a child to think about first. <br /> <br /> This film has a clear message behind it: JUST SAY NO!
