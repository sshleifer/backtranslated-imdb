Summary: it is normal as at the Louche casino in Tanger. The casino is about to close and prepares for a big transaction the next day. The owner Louche and some staff members leave for the night, leaving Modesty in charge. Suddenly a troop of armed gangsters storm the casino, firing wildly. Unknown for modesty, they have already killed Louche, and now they are looking for the money hidden in the vault. But no one present, and still alive, at the casino knows the code to open the vault. The vault itself is heavily exploded with explosives, so the attackers cannot jump the door as expected. Suddenly Modesty comes face to face with the leader of the gangsters Miklos in a game of roulette with their lives in danger. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is a review written without any connection to what ever with other media published in Modestia Blaise, as I have not seen or read anything about it. The first point I would like to make is that this is classified slightly incorrectly. First I thought this was a thriller with a battle of wits between Modesty and Miklos as the main plot. Of course, there are some gusts of action, but they are not really an integral or important part of history. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, the main plot and the main scene full of suspense, is the game between Modesty and Miklos. It's an innovative and intriguing way to reveal a character's background, and by doing so much of the story takes place outside the casino at a much earlier time. Someone said that it is almost like a pilot for a television series, and the feeling is that it could really be used as such. But I felt it was a much better way to present a character than many others. I was not at all disappointed by the lack of action, instead I liked this game, the story much more than just an action movie. <br /> <br /> I think the two main stars, Alexandra Staden and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, did very well. Staden in particular portrays Modesty very well, and truly brings this self-confident and talented character. <br /> <br /> 7/10
