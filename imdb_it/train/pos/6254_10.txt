I just watched this movie at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival. The working title was "Dog Days". The audience's reaction was mixed. Some people have found graphic sex and realistic violence too much for them. Others seemed genuinely to appreciate how beautiful this film was. <br /> <br /> This film is not for the faint of heart. It's like "Happiness" with explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity. There is animal poisoning, a striptease from an old man, a bath tub orgy in a mall, an anal candle penetration and the molestation of mentally incompetent. <br /> <br /> If something like this seems too much to handle then this movie is not for you. This film shows humanity at its most desperate and pathetic. The banality of our existence is thrust in the face with the greatest joy. <br /> <br /> Seidl has no interest in redeeming humanity here. And why should it? This film presents excellent performances by everyone involved, it's always interesting, and it's probably the smartest social statement to make in a movie for a while.
