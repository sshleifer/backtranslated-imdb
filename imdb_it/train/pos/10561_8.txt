089: Footlight Parade (1933) - published on 09/30/1933, displayed on 5/5/07. <br /> <br /> The ice cream cone was invented in New York. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: After a long and demanding break, we reached another Busby Berkeley musical from Warner Bros. This time it is the ultra-fast Footlight Parade, with James Cagney as stage producer Chester Kent. I'm 100% sure that Cagney channeled Berkeley with his interpretation of the unquestionable Kent, who has to come up with new exhibition ideas every minute. Joan Blondell is also excellent as the acute interest of the secretariat turned into love. The Ruby Keeler / Dick Powell subplot is not so important this time, but no less fun. One thing that baffled me are the same interpretations of Berkeley, which seemed too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage, not to mention a stage that would later show a film. Obviously Busby does not let a small thing like history prevent him from putting together the most exaggerated musical numbers he can conjure up. I liked almost all of this film until the end, with the shamelessly offensive number of "Shanghai Lil", which, as you can guess, is like a stomach turning like the displays of racial aversion. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Six films in three months. I have to be a new record. However, this completes the Warner Bros. "1933 musical trilogy, preceded by" 42nd Street "and" Gold Diggers of 1933. "I highly recommend looking at all three in a row. I wonder if James Cagney was channeling Busby Berkeley while playing Chester Kent in this film, or if the role as written was inspired by Busby. I hope it was, it seems to make sense that Berkeley is the kind of guy who would see elaborate dances in everyday events like Chester does. was that he didn't really look like a guide man in the traditional sense. He was 5'7 ", square-headed, and spoke with a strange New York accent, but the boy was quite versatile, going from the poisonous gangsters who made him so famous to the guys. of producer who speak quickly that we see here. He was basically a man in the body of a character actor. The rest of the cast has some familiar faces, Joan Blondell returns and almost steals the show as loyal and eager secretary to Cagney, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler to play the cute couple, but it seems having less time on the screen than before, Billy Barty appears again as a fearless imp. The film is typical of the most daring and adult-oriented musicals of the pre-Code era, as opposed to those of the 1950s and 1960s they were more family-oriented, and it is an excellent climax of the Warner musicals of that year ( the "Shanghai Lil" number does not stand up, with Keeler doing a bad job watching Chinese). <br /> <br /> Latest film: Dinner At Eight (1933). Next movie: I'm No Angel (1933).
