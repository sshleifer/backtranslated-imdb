I have always been a fan of David Lynch and with this film Lynch has shown critics to have the talent, style and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura for which he has become famous in the last ten years. As the film is G-rated, it is pure Lynch in style, rhythm and tone. The film moves at a masterfully hypnotic rhythm and is full of scenes of authentic emotion and power. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is fantastic, as can be expected from a Lynch film, and the transition montage sequences are breathtaking. It is also very pleasant to see a film in which the characters are all friendly, kind-hearted and unmotivated characters who are clearly labeled "good" or "bad". <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth turns into a beautiful performance like the rest of the cast, particularly Sissy Spacek in a captivating performance like his daughter, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role. <br /> <br /> With this film, David Lynch demonstrated to critics that he could make a powerful moving film just like in the 80s with "Blue Velvet" and "The Elephant Man". Critics seemed to lose confidence over the last ten years after producing surreal films like "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me" and "Lost Highway" but with this film showed that there was a method for FWWM and LH, and it seems as if critics finally understood his recent film 'Mulholland Drive', considering the high praise he received and the Oscar nomination for Lynch. <br /> <br /> 'Straight Story' is for me one of the most moving films I've ever seen. It is a love story about family, friendship and kindness of strangers. I highly recommend it.
