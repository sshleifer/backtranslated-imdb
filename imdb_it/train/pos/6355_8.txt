I already loved "How the Grinch stole Christmas" when he was released and I still love him now, 5 years later. Still many people seem to disagree with my opinion and this film never received much love at the time it came out. Of course, the film is exaggerated and campy but that is also why this film is so fascinating and fun to watch. All sets, costumes and characters are made perfectly over the top in a fun way, without ever becoming really ridiculous. It is a visually spectacular film to watch. It's a campy movie at its best! Director Ron Howard really surprises with this fun little Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The main reason why the movie works and why it is so fun to watch is Jim Carrey as the Grinch. He really brings the movie with his good and fun role. It is naturally aided by the convincing trick, which also received an Oscar. Of course if you are a Jim Carrey hater you shouldn't even think about watching this movie. This movie is really his movie and it makes it all work and a lot of fun to watch. Other fun and memorable roles are played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the young Grinch. <br /> <br /> The film has a good moral, but for me it's all a little mushy. Maybe it's because I'm Dutch and we don't really celebrate Christmas so enthusiastic and big here, like in the United States or England. For me the film was simply fun and funny and the morale left me cold enough to be honest. <br /> <br /> The James Horner soundtrack is good and fun, even though it's your average Horner everyday stuff, it still works perfectly for the movie and helps you do some work on the scene. <br /> <br /> Perfect Christmas entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
