This anime has seriously shaken my stockings. When the anime first opened, I thought it was too slow; the story didn't go all the way, and Shirou was a rather insignificant male leader. Once you learn more about tracing, and learn more about Saber and the Holy Grail War itself, the story explores and you can see multiple facets of it that move together. It was great. <br /> <br /> Also, I felt that the way the characters developed was very true to form with the way real people develop in the real world. There were no stupid and completely obvious things going on; the development of Ilya and Rin was interesting to watch, but I think the way Shirou and Saber grew in their certain personalities was simply interesting to watch everyone on it. Some of the "surprise" people that appear (Gilgamesh?) Seemed to be unique from the rest of the cast in one way or another, which means we didn't have "Generic Bad-ass A" replaced by "Generic Bad-ass B" as soon as A died. <br /> <br /> Anddd, I loved music. The opening music fluctuated and the final theme of the final episode ... pushed the theme of the last episode even more seriously. Good job, LUNA type!
