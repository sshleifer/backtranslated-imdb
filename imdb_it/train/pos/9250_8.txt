Clark Gable plays a swindler who entertains himself in the life of the hard-boiled lady Jean Harlow. He tries to suck her while she sweeps him away with his tough attitude. Despite their cynicism and against, they fall in love. When Gable accidentally kills a man during a puncture, he leaves, leaving his faithful Harlow to the women's prison where he discovers he is pregnant. The screenplay by Anita Loos and Howard Emmett Rogers is excellent, with many well-designed and surprising characters (including an inmate of a Jewish socialist woman and a recluse of a black woman and the father of her preacher played almost without any stereotype ). Gable and Harlow show their courage as actors who add nuances and oddities to their characters that push them beyond the typical roles of Gable and Harlow. And the management is much better than you'd expect from Sam Wood. A beautiful blow brought Harlow to the prison, then taken out into a surprisingly snowy courtyard while the camera chases them. This is one of the best among the "criminal in love" and "female prison" genres and has some of the best hard-boiled dialogues ever written.
