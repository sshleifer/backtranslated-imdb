"Life stinks" is a parody of life and death, happiness and depression. White and black are always present in our lives. Mel Brooks' performance is as brilliant as ever, and the other actors also work well. This film has a certain Capra flavor, that's why it's so beautiful. <br /> <br /> There are some unforgettable gags like the one where Brooks tries to earn some money by dancing on the street, and all the people passing by ignore him or when he meets a funny fool who believes he is Paul Getty and then he starts fighting and slapping each other. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, you don't know what you are. I've lost it. <br /> <br /> This film tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this film and the reality is that this film has a happy ending, and the reality is not. <br /> <br /> Yes, indeed, Life Stinks.
