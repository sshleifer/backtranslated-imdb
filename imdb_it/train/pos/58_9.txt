I captured the tail of this movie channel by browsing through the channels of cable films, and I was so intrigued that I looked for the next screening. <br /> <br /> I didn't really know what to expect after reading the program summary, but I came out of this film feeling rather disturbed and distressed. He also gave me an adult who attended high school in the 1980s, a little better insight into what our children have to deal with these days. <br /> <br /> The fact that you don't see the shot only adds to the coldness of the plot. Seeing both children and adults struggling to understand and come to terms with senseless shootings has sometimes been overwhelming. And I'll admit I shed a lot of tears. <br /> <br /> Overall, not a film I would have tried to find out, however I'm glad I saw it.
