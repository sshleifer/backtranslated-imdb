Life begins - and ends - in a typical 30s maternity / recovery department, where we see 48 hours in the lives of many high-risk pregnant women, played by Loretta Young, Glenda Farrell, Clara Blandick (Aunty Em ??? ), Vivienne Osborne, Dorothy Tree and Gloria Shea, as they wait to give birth. While the film is characterized by plot devices that seem far-fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted, it offers us a look back in time to see what to give birth to in a typical city hospital in 1932 was like for our grandmothers and grandmothers. I found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the most extraordinary performance of this film comes from a member of the male cast, young Eric Linden as Jed Sutton, Grace's husband (Loretta Young). What an actor! For the first time father, Jed is upset and uncomfortable with the hospital staff who seem to escape his worries about his wife because they could wipe out the crumbs from a coffee table. I felt his concern intensely. I'd like to see more of this actor's work. He had a very emotional voice, which was used for an unforgettable effect on Gone with the Wind. In that film Eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia, who shouted "Don't cut! Don't cut!" while Scarlett escaped from the horrified hospital. Chilling! Another great performance is by Aline MacMahon, who plays Miss Bowers, the nurse. His character is a saline type of earth, the kind of nurse we hope to get for our hospital admissions, who constantly breaks the hospital rules to show a more human side of the medical profession. <br /> <br /> Also Loretta Young did another wonderful acting job, a very authentic performance and deeply felt like Grace. My, she is exceptional in these precepts, I really learned to appreciate her more as an actress in recent months. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell played the role of a squeaky voracious mother a little exaggerated for my taste (no one knew that in 1932 the brandy that trickled from a hot water bottle could be dangerous to health of unborn children?) but his character eventually redeems himself. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast was an uncredited Gilbert Roland, a silent film star, like a grieving Italian husband. His screen time was short, but remarkable. <br /> <br /> Life Begins is a must-see precode, try to catch it sometimes on TCM, but remember to bring some bundles to cry on. 9 out of 10.
