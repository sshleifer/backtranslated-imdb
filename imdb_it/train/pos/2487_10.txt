I must say that, looking at Hamlet from a student's point of view, the Hamlet version of Brannagh is by far the best. His dedication to staying true to the original text should be applauded. It helps the game come to life on the screen, and makes it easier for people who keep the text while watching, as we did studying, to follow and analyze the text. <br /> <br /> One of the things I've heard criticized many times is the casting of the biggest Hollywood comedy names. I find this helps viewers to recognize characters more easily, as opposed to having actors who all look the same and help in the confusion normally associated with Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, its flashbacks help to clarify many ambiguities in the text. For example to what extent the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia really went and why Fortinbras was at the castle at the end. All in all, not only does this version contain some brilliant interpretations of both familiar and unfamiliar actors with Shakespeare. It is presented in such a way that it is not necessary to be a doctorate of English literature to understand and enjoy it.
