I saw this movie on TV and fascinated by the beauty of Jennifer McComb. It was a clean film and you can watch it for the beauty of Africa and, of course, McComb. At that time I was thrilled watching this movie and from then on I'm looking for VCDs of this movie, but I can't find it. Huge African lions make their appearance in his film and we will be simply enchanted by the size of those animals and their grace. All sections of the audience can watch this film, especially children will love this film. But some scenes involving Mccomb force parental guidance for this film. It's a fun vacation movie for everyone.
