The classic novel by Robert A. Heinlein Starship Troopers has been messed up in recent years, throughout the 1997 Paul Verhoeven film, in a TV series, in a series of games. But none of these, so to speak, really captured the spirit of his novel. The games are usually not connected, the TV series was more than a spin off, and the less it said about the Verhoeven movie, the better. Most know, however, that an animated adaptation had already been made in Japan, published the year of Heinlein's death. And, believe it or not, despite its differences, this animated 6-part series is, by plot, the most faithful adaptation of the Heinlein classic. <br /> <br /> The most obvious plus of this series is the presence of powered armed exoskeletons, something we have been deprived of in Verhoeven's film. Like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, even if we see a good part of it. While events happen differently than in the book, the plot of the book's plot is present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it is only slightly more touched than in the book. While some may believe that the dialogue and the interaction between the characters are a little inferior to the book (it gets a bit of the treatment of the souls, but what did you expect?), But it is far superior to the film. Heinlein's political opinions are simply excised, unlike the film, where they are reversed. The great success of the series, however, is the climatic battle on Klendathu between troops and insects / aliens, which presents the kind of action of the fed semi armor that we wanted to see in a film version. > <br /> Overall, I liked this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to Heinlein's. And I think they did quite well with this. If you can find this series, take a look.
