This obscure of Sica delivers the goods. And they say "the meek will inherit the earth". This story of surface classes, but actually an allegory for all the homeless who populated Europe after the great war. They are homeless but are cheerful, in a society that is too poor and selfish to take care of them or recognize them, doormats for Italian carp anglers. de Sica chooses to tell it like a fairy tale, a story of Cinderella. I have not read the book on which it is based, so I cannot predict whether the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or Vittorio. Start with the words "Once upon a time ..." to exemplify the eternity of his story, so that the story could be set anywhere and everywhere. Caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut the bones, the extravagant nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their desires and an ending from a painting by Spielberg make this boulange a pleasure for everyone. The most accessible image of De Sica is also one of his best. Abandoning neo-realism, he has always disappointed between this and the pure good old film, he creates a film that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the desire for hope that is necessary to continue to leave in this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias !!! Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!
