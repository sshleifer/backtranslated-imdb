A terrorist attempts to steal a top secret biological weapon and, in an attempt to escape, is infected when the case containing the mortal agent is compromised. The soldiers are able to recover the case, but the terrorist heads for a hotel where he tries to hide. Eventually they arrive where the hotel and its occupants hide and "clean up". Unfortunately they get rid of his body with cremation, and if you've seen Return of the Living Dead, you know what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 has been extensively cut short by critics and zombie fans as a complete film mess. While this is a fair assessment, it is not without its high points. First, he has a lot of bloody deaths to keep hunting dogs happy. There is an abundance of zombies that seem to come from wherever they can. They are in the water, among the beams of houses, they hide among the trees and, for some reason, they like to hide under a pile of dead bushes, only to go wild while the heroes try to escape. There is even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator. You have to see it to believe it, since only this scene makes Zombi 3 necessary to visualize the IMO. They might have some terrible editing and some very questionable acting, especially from the doctor who must be one of the worst actors I've ever seen, but Zombie 3 is still a very funny movie. Sometimes it's nice to sit and watch a movie that requires nothing but your time and an open mind. Zombi 3 fits that bill, and then some. It's even more fun if you open some beer and watch it with like-minded friends. I give him an 8/10, just for pleasure.
