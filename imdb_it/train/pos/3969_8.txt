Someone noticed that James Earl Jones is the waiter who serves when Hagarty's wife reveals she is pregnant while they are at the restaurant by the lake. I saw this movie on a video I had recorded on the TV. When I saw this scene I thought I recognized Jones's voice when the "waiter" laughed at the end. I rewound the tape then slowly crossed that part as the camera pulled back and showed the waiter. Listen carefully as the waiter laughs when Hagarty looks up and tells him that they are going to have a baby, so look closely or slow down the scene when the camera shows the waiter, even if quickly.
