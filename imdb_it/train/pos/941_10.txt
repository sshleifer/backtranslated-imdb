I first saw this version of "A Christmas Carol" when it first appeared on television. I actually expected to see the film when it was advertised and it was more than up to my expectations. Now I bought the DVD and I'm going to watch it every year. With the exception of "It's A Wonderful Life" I consider this version of "A Christmas Carol" one of the best Christmas movies ever made. George C. Scott is excellent and an exceptional cast led by Roger Rees surrounds him! Scott proves once again to be one of the best actors of our time. Scott has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique for himself. How can anyone remember someone like Patton and Scrooge? Scott does it easily. The direction is wonderful with refined sets, costumes and music that give the film a special feeling of time, place and age. You will simply love this movie and will put it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season.
