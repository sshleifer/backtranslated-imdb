I loved this series when it was on Kids WB, I didn't think there was a Batman spin-off since the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997. First of all I liked the idea of ​​Robin who left Batman to solve the crime alone. It was an interesting prospect for their relationship. I also liked the addition of Tim Drake to the series, and once again, like his predecessor, this show had great narrative lines, great animation (better than the original), fantastic vocal work and, of course, a brilliant writing. The only thing I didn't like was that when he was in the United States he often did episodes in a 15-minute plot. I just wish some of the episodes could be longer. My favorite episode of any Batman cartoon comes in this series, and it's called "Over the Edge", which I think is good if not better than "Heart of Ice" and "Robin's reckoning". Overall a nice sequel, along with Superman, this show made my childhood very happy.
