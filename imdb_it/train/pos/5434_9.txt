The film was shot on Movie Flats, just off Route 395, near Lone Pine, California, north of the Whitney Portals road. It is still possible to find concrete sketches and iron joists plastered through the rocks where the sets were built. And you will recognize the area from any Randolph Scott movie. <br /> <br /> I won't worry about the plot, as I'm sure it's treated elsewhere. The film features three athletes - Fairbanks fils, who must have learned a lot from their father - Grant, an acrobat in his youth - and MacLaughlin, a professional boxer from South Africa. Their physical abilities are all on display. <br /> <br /> Not a moment of this film is to be taken seriously. It speaks of Thugees, a sect in India, hence our English word "thug". I can't go through all the happiness of this film, but I probably have to point out that the director, George Stevens, was a policeman with a background in the films of Laurel and Hardy - he looks at his fight scene choreography - and went on to infinitely long Shane's Fades and The Diary of Anne Frank. The dynasties rose and fell. The geological epochs came and went, while Liz Taylor and Monty Clift kissed in "A Place in the Sun." Here, in his comic mode, he excels. <br /> <br /> This is a story of male bonding and it would be easy - too easy - to read the homoeroticism in it, as many people do with Howard Hawks. Or hate for women. But this is not the case at all. Sometimes the things depicted on the screen don't deserve too much heuristic attention. Men will form bonds by working together in a way that women do not have. (Women share secrets). Read Deborah Tannen, no one's idea of ​​an anti-feminist. Well, when you think about it, that's what evolution should have produced. For most of human history - about nine tenths - hominids have been hunters and gatherers, and men tend to hunt and women gather. Hunting is more effective as a team enterprise. The men who weren't very good at binding were Darwinians out, leaving men who have a lot of team spirit. And Grant, Fairbanks, and MacLaughlin made fun of him. <br /> <br /> Sorry if I ramble on evolution, but I am an anthropologist and it is an occupational disease. Did I ever talk to you about Vaitongi's horse, Samoa, who slipped on concrete and fell into the bathtub with me? You have to look at the hooves. <br /> <br /> Joan Fontaine is adorable, really. I only met her in the last few years and wondered why she was in so many movies. I lived in Saratoga, California, where his sister, Olivia De Havilland, grew up and went to a convent school. Nice place. <br /> <br /> If you miss this lively and adventurous British Hempa chronicle at its peak, you should never forgive yourself. He is so famous that he is parodied in Peter Sellers' film, "The Party". Yes, the colonel must know.
