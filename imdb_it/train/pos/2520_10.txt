Despite what others have said (* cough *), this is my favorite movie of all time. I don't know how long I waited to see it, but once I finally did, I immediately fell in love. Sure, it's weird, but this just gives more of an exciting taste. For the uninitiated, Moonchild is one of the first films of Gackt and Hyde. They didn't have many, maybe 3 or 4 tops each. So give him some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler was not the best at first. I think there are some strange situations, but I look further to find the best points of this film, the emotions shown and so on. Therefore, I have given, and will always have to give, this film a 10 out of 10.
