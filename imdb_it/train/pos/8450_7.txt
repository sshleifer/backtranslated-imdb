It wasn't bad for the first Raw PPV of 006. But the ending was really shocking for all those present and for those who were watching at home. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH- RIC FLAIR VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR THE WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP It's not a bad start, these two can seriously put on a great game if they had more time to put on a wrestling match. Flair wins for DQ after Edge hits him with his MITB folder. 3/10 SECOND WEDDING STRATUS VS. MICKIE JAMES FOR THE WOMEN CHAMPIONSHIP WWE Not bad noticing the fact that this is the first time that these Diva face off together in the ring. Mickie goes for a modified Chick Kick, but Trish ducks and nails his Chick Kick for the win to keep his title. 3/10 THIRD MATCH - TRIPLE H VS. GREAT SHOW Really good this meeting was, really. The entire HHH game focuses on the injured Big Show arm, but Big Show still fights. Later HHH is able to overthrow the Big Show and nail a Pedigree for victory. 5/10 FOURTH MATCH- SHELTON BENJAMIN W / MAMA VS. VISCERA {This was a bonus game} Not bad, it was fine. After Viscera was down, behind the referee, Benjamin's mom took a handbag {which had bricks in it} and slammed Viscera's head three times. Viscera got up only to get caught with a rotating Benjamin kick for the victory against the big man. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH- JERRY 'THE KING' LAWLER VS. GREGORY ELEMENTS Boring, slow and sloppy. Both men haven't really done a great job. Jerry Lawler wins after a Fist Drop for the win. 2/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH MATCH- TORRIE Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY VS. MARIA VS. CANDICE MICHELLE IN A FIRST PAIR OF WOMAN EVER It was a lot of fun for me. Ashley {I think} eliminates Candice last to win the first women's game of Gauntlet. 5/10 SEPTEMBER MATCH - JOHN CENA VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. KURT ANGLE W / DAIVARI IN AN ELIMINATION CHAMPION CHAMPION FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP It was a good elimination match. But nothing will surpass last year's Elimination Chamber, the best. The last three are Masters, Cena and Carlito. Carlito turns his back on Masters and is given a roll to eliminate him. Seconds later Cena gets a roll-up on Carlito for the three counts to win the Elimination Chamber and keep his WWE title. But his night wasn't over yet. 7/10 After the game, Vince McMahon comes out and congratulates Cena on his victory. Vince McMahon says his evening is not over yet, and says that Edge takes his opportunity in Money In The Bank to challenge Cena for the title. Edge goes out with Lita, hands the folder to Vince and leaves in the ring because Cena has another game to do here tonight. <br /> <br /> OTTO MATCH - JOHN CENA VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP {Dinner that gets busted during the Chamber game} is immediately hit by Edge, Edge, then nails a Lancia to Cena, goes to the cover and stops his supper at his shock. Edge nails another Spear & cover for the shocking three-count as he beat Cena and won the WWE championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So last year's New Year's Revolution was better than this year, but it was still good. Even the EC game was good and the Edge shock that collects its opportunity at MITB is certainly the most shocking of the PPV show. <br /> <br /> In general: I will give it 7/10 and a C
