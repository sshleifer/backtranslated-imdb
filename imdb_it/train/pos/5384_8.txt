I thought the film was pretty well done for a TV movie, and contained both a lot of action and humor. I found the value of entertainment worth watching and I would watch it again or again like that. I am disappointed that Sean was not credited here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> I can see a possibility for an action series based on this concept or a sequel with Sean that once again plays for even higher "cash" odds, since his life would be again online anyway. <br /> <br /> I heard that Sean played the role very well, and reminds me of an actor by the name of Matthew Ashford who plays Jack Deveraux on Days of Our Lives - Soap Opera.
