If the themes of The Girl From Missouri sound familiar, they should. This is because Anita Loos who wrote the script here also wrote the classic Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Unlike Marilyn Monroe in that film, Jean Harlow will accept any type of jewelry from men of means. <br /> <br /> And he is a man of means to which Jean Harlow is looking. Leave the side street of the hash house run by his mother and stepfather because he decided that the best way to get an easy life is to marry him. His talents as chorus girl are limited, but he will be able to trade on that beauty. <br /> <br /> His odyssey begins with her and her friend Patsy Kelly receiving an invitation to perform at a party launched by millionaire Lewis Stone. But unbeknownst to Jean, Stone has just had a wild adventure before doing himself because of the money he doesn't have to own. Still she enjoys a couple of balls from him noticing fellow millionaire Lionel Barrymore. <br /> <br /> Lionel enjoyed it until Jean put his views on Playboy's son, Franchot Tone. After that he is not amused and seems to shake Jean from climbing the family tree. <br /> <br /> The Missouri girl went into production halfway through the Code, so she went under a strange complaint. I have a feeling that we would have seen a much more audacious film. Always Jean Harlow as a young and wise version of Mae West is always appreciated. That woman's great comedic talent, to see The Girl From Missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss of the film world sustained with her passing three years later. <br /> <br /> Ironically enough the casting of Patsy Kelly with Harlow was undoubtedly influenced by the hit shorts that Kelly was doing with another famous platinum blonde, Thelma Todd. Harlow and Kelly have the same chemistry that is easy among what Patsy had with Thelma. Todd would have died even a year later in a bizarre accident / suicide / murder that no satisfactory explanation was ever really given. <br /> <br /> Do not miss The Girl From Missouri, it is bright and cheeky, it must come from all those sparkling jewels.
