I think "Blackadder the Third" is the best in the series. <br /> <br /> Actually all the episodes are fun, personally I really like the episode with "the French invasion", but the one with the superstitious actors, in 'MACBETH' is also a lot of fun, the way in which Rowan continues to play with them is really (English) Humor at the highest level. <br /> <br /> Actors: "Never say it again, always call it Scottish Play; Blackadder: Oh, so you want me to say Scottish Play? Actors: YES Blackadder: Rather than MACBETH ...! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Rowan and I have most of his work, but I think he made the Blackadder series particularly well. <Br /> <br /> I hope the Rowan continues his great style, but I think we can count on him, because he's already working on a Bean 2 movie, which will be released this year, I'm looking forward to it .. <br /> <br /> I give this 3 Blackadder a 9 out of 10 Rating.
