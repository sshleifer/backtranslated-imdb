I'm not a big fan of kitsch camp and the kind of "so bad is good" vision. However, I really like this movie because of its fun factor and - believe it or not - it's innovation. <br /> <br /> Everything has a ring by John Waters and is infinitely enthusiastic, but with some superb actors and considered a direction that makes the most of slapstick and constipated movements. Billy Zane moves with incredible expression (see the scene on the bus for a text lesson on how to use movement) and is framed by some unexpected stars. <br /> <br /> You might not like this movie, you may not like it, but if you have the chance to watch it, save time because it's likely you'll end up with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humor of some great stars. Highly recommended.
