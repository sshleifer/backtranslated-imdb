I could be biased, I am the author of the novel The Hungry Bachelors Club, self-published in 1994. The script was written by my dear hungry bachelor friend Fred Dresch, who was the inspiration for the character Marlon in the film . I could not be happier with the trailer, I hope to see the film in its entirety and I will talk further. But Jorja Fox, who plays Delmar Youngblood, my character, is stellar. It carries most emotional vehicles in excellent form. I couldn't have done better myself! It looks like a real people, hardly guided by the formula and, fortunately, pushes my statement against racial prejudice at home, with grace and heartfelt.
