THE LAST WAVE will never win the mainstream public. It's a slow but fascinating film for those willing to get along. An Australian lawyer is invited to take on the case of five Aborigines accused in the murder of one of them. Soon all kinds of omens and omens will appear, since the death of man entails a tribal question that was not intended for the white court, and very soon the lawyer has difficulty distinguishing reality from fantasy. It seems that the end of the world is at hand, and he and the aborigines may know it, but no one else knows. Richard Chamberlain as the lawyer is at its peak here. David Guptil, a face familiar to many other Australian films and a decent actor, is one of the five aborigines on trial. THE LAST WAVE is not simply for everyone, any more than MAGNOLIA (both have strange things falling from the sky). Take a look at a slow Saturday night.
