Kubrick again demonstrated his brilliance, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled alike. Jack Torrance is a man in his forties, married, with a son and with a history of trouble and alcoholism. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends service during the winter due to its extreme weather conditions, and there is a well-paid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months; and Torrance, who was trying to become a writer, found it perfect. But the manager advised Torrance of loneliness there during the potentially dangerous winter, and told him that some warden in the past went mad and killed his family. Even before they arrived, his son Danny, who has a kind of imaginary friend who shines his future (shinning), knew the place was not right and he didn't want to go. Once they settled into the hotel, things went well but within a month, Jack started acting strange, irritated and depressed. At this point, we know that something is going to happen, but we don't know when and how. Scary things happen like the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny and someone who attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later, Jack began to see other people and immediately felt good about them, as if they were his family; among them the famous psychotic custodian, Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are "intruders" in the hotel. Following this order, Jack sought the goal and many of the scariest things I've ever seen happen here. The finale is spectacular and the spectators will be interested and shocked until the last minute.
