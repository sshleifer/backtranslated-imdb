Several years ago the Navy was held at a distance studied from the creation of "Men of Honor", a film based on the experiences of the first fight of the supreme commander of the supreme commander of the service to overcome virulent racism. Always eager to support films that show the best side of our Navy in the United States. Nimitz and two helicopter assault vectors, with ground support installations, were provided to complete this compelling tale of the battle of a young sailor with uncontrollable anger. Some films were shot on board the United States Belleau Wood. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher wrote the screenplay for Denzel Washington's directorial debut in which he plays a Navy psychiatrist who treats Fisher, played effectively and profoundly by Derek Luke. <br /> <br /> Fisher is a clearly enlisted man assigned to the USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3), a front-line helicopter assault platform. It seems that Fisher does not avoid launching his own assaults with the slightest provocation of his enlisted colleagues. Sent to the MD as part of a possible pre-separation proceeding, Fisher slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist, revealing a terrible childhood of great negligence and shivering brutality. <br /> <br /> The story develops like Fisher with caution but more and more trusts his doctor and gets the courage to pursue a love interest, an enlisted sailor named Cheryl, played by an extraordinary beauty Joy Bryant. <br /> <br /> Fisher reluctantly commits himself to the doctor by asking long questions about simmering but soon realizes that he must seek answers, however painful, to grow and move away from destructive behavior in search of conflict. <br /> <br /> While all the main characters are black, this story transcends the race while unequivocally showing the evil of exuberant religiosity and concurrent hypocrisy in adoptive family contexts. Viola Davis, a versatile actress seen in a series of recent films, is a photo of sullen immorality but it is nothing compared to her adoptive mother, Mrs Tate (Novella Nelson), who in a short but burning scene would have earned - if she existed - the Oscar for shameless brutality. <br /> <br /> Patient-therapist interaction films follow a certain predictability (all that transference and countertransference stuff) but the seriousness of Fisher and his doctor / mentor is realistically compelling. It's a beautiful story, well told. Period. <br /> <br /> While in the Navy, "Antwone Fisher" is in no sense a service story like "Men of Honor", an excellent film that dealt with overwhelming racism directed against a real person. Nor is it really a film about blacks. It is about surviving terrible childhood experiences and, as Fisher says, being able to proclaim in adulthood that the victim is still "standing". Persecutors shrink in size and meaning as a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the help of a caring doctor. <br /> <br /> My only quibble is that Washington is a lieutenant commander but is addressed as a commander With all the Navy support people listed in the end credits, someone should have told the Washington director that his character, like all naval officers under the rank of commander, it is referred to as "Mister". Not a great criticism, is it? :) <br /> <br /> I don't know why this movie is playing in so few theaters. It deserves wide distribution. Derek Luke could receive an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> 8/10. <br /> <br />
