Someone releases this film on DVD so that it can take its established place as one of the greatest films of all time in ten and twenty years when film critics and historians look back on the so-called films of the 90s and see how vain they were for the most part, and as Lars Von Trier has tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece. At present, "Zentropa" (or "Europe" as it is indicated outside the United States) is one of the most fascinating and artistic visions of the desolation and almost psychotic uncertainty that oozed from post-World War II Europe, is worth to say the decimated German landscape, whose physical horrors were matched only by the damage to the psyche of its people. Von Trier brilliantly paints his vision on the screen. You'll feel like you're looking at some spying of the classic noir from the late 1940s with perfectly lit black and white scenes, while at the same time feeling like you're on the brink of something beyond the limit, especially in scenes like murder on board the train. Literally, when you see this movie, you are witnessing the evolution of an art form. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Von Trier was involved in his Dogma movement soon after. And while his "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark" are stand-alone classics, it is with "Zentropa" that he really raised the art of creating a film in new and exciting heights. 10/10, it ages like a good wine and asks for the release of a DVD.
