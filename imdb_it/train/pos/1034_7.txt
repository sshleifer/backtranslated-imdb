I think this film was probably a lot more powerful when it debuted for the first time in 1943, although today it seems a bit too prolific and static to elevate it to greatness. The film is set in 1940, just before the United States entered the war. Paul Lukas plays the very serious and dignified leader of his family. He is a German who spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture. Bette Davis is his very understanding and long-lived wife who has managed to educate and raise children without him from time to time. At the beginning of the film, they are crossing the border from Mexico to the United States and for the first time in years they will relax and stop running. <br /> <br /> The problem for me was that the family was perfect and too dignified - making them look like obvious positive propaganda instead of real family suffering through real problems. While this has had a very noble goal at the moment, it seems only fake today. In particular, the incredibly strange and extremely scripted dialogue used by children did not sound true. They looked more like anti-fascist speeches than real child voices. As a result they were extremely annoying, particularly the smaller one who sometimes came out of a brat. The only ones who seemed real were Bette Davis and his extended American family, as well as the noise-makers who lived with them (although he had no discernible accents). <br /> <br /> It's really hard to believe that the ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialogue, since it doesn't seem true for life. The story was based on the drama of her lover, Lillian Hellman. And the basic idea and plot are good, but sometimes the dialogue is bad. Overall, an interesting curiosity and a film with some excellent moments, ... but it's really all.
