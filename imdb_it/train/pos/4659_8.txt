Without Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, this could easily have been a turkey. But they are brilliant. Ustinov is at his best, and for Maggie fans, it's nice to see her in her early days, matching Ustinov with every step of the time and the times. For the fifties English (and I'm in that band), it's always fun to see the rings and listen to the sounds of Swinging Sixties, and although this movie spends a lot of time in the offices, it has a lot of nostalgia for the sixties, including buses reds, Carnaby Street, a song by Lulu and a delightful blow on the micro-skirt of a maid, whose English style she has never seen since then in public places. As an I.T. engineer, I know that computer tricks are laughable, but they are not meant to be taken seriously. Nor are the wonderful stereotypes of Italians, French and Germans.
