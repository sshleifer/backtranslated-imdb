Having never heard of this film until I saw the rented DVD, I'm a little skeptical, there have been many films in the past with a good cast of ensembles that can't make bad screenplay movies, and in some cases do not seem expensive. <br /> <br /> Having just seen it, there was no reason not to give this film a theatrical version, it's good. History as most of this kind may seem a little forced at times, but there also seems to be a good deal of realism that allows momentum. I was pleasantly surprised by Justin Timberlake's excellent work here with such an important role, OK, it's not yet an Oscar material, but he'll learn with each role and show MUCH promise for the future here. Dylan McDermott was also extraordinarily good at his unexpectedly bad role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this film. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, try it. you will not be disappointed, you will not be bored, on the contrary, I think you will be more than happy with the final result.
