Not having seen the films before (and unable to stand Matt Damon), I was reluctant to go see The Bourne Ultimatum when asked to see it for the AS Film Studies. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a movie with Damon could be fun. <br /> <br /> Fast-paced scenes, crazy motorcycle chases and BIG explosions were the things that got you off your seat in TBU. The quasi-incidents between the CIA and Bourne kept you on your toes and thoroughly enjoyed yourself. <br /> <br /> However, many things really gratified me. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the fact that the film was just a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence is repetitive and eventually boring. Even though Damon kept us entertained and always seemed a step ahead of the CIA, I was getting a little angry with Bourne's constant survival. It crashed into a car and came out as if it had touched or something! Very unrealistic. <br /> <br /> And secondly (inevitably) - the SHAKY CAMERA. It was so shaky that it was completely obvious and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class (even the tutors) seasickness. The tutors told us that if we ever used it in a movie we did in class, it would automatically be wrong and we would have been told to use a tripod. Fair enough if Greengrass wanted it to look like we were there looking at Damon and Stiles in a conversation, but we certainly wouldn't shake our heads so violently! <br /> <br /> But all in all TBU is a fun movie and worth watching. But I didn't think it was the best film of the year, even though it was a fun piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
