Before turning to politics or public service, Glenda Jackson was one of Britain's best film actresses. This film shows his talent despite having a supporting role in a stellar cast that includes Julie Christie as Kitty, the wife of a British royal captain who has lost her memory for the past 20 years, and Jenny played by American Ann Margret in an unrecognizable role as an adoring sister. Alan Bates plays the captain who suffers from the memory loss triggered by the shock of the shell during the First World War. Sir Ian Holm has a minor role as the doctor who treats him. See familiar faces like Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne and Frank Finlay. You can't help but watch Glenda play a sloppy housewife and the Captain's first true love, but they came from different classes. It's not the biggest movie, but it's nice to see Glenda's extraordinary talent. She is still a fantastic actress, a comedy or a drama. Turn Margaret Gray into a nice character and understand why a royal captain fell in love with her.
