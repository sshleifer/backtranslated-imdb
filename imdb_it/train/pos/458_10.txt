My wife, Kate and I loved the series and I can't wait for the next one to come (hopefully there's a sequel!). I'd like to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it, maybe because I'm "old and gray" and still interested in life :-). If anyone has the full text, please send them. <br /> <br /> Obviously one of the main reasons why my wife and I enjoyed this series is that we are 75 years old and retired, but still very intellectually active. It's nice to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience. The aspect of human interest that shows the interactions between the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show. <br /> <br /> This series is very fun and very sophisticated, on par with some of our other favorites, "Spooks" and "Hustle".
