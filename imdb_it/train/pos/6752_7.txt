A detective (Dana Andrews) with a reputation for violence accidentally kills a suspect in a murder (Craig Stevens) and then tries to cover it up. The film directed by Otto Preminger has a lot of atmosphere but the story vanishes when the dead man's wife (Gene Tierney) falls in love with Andrews. He was doing well enough to dig in and out of a large hole, but it was too light at the end of the tunnel for a film noir. Gary Merrill is as big as Scalese, a crime boss whom Andrews is obsessed with breaking down, and the tension between them gives the film its energy and lead, especially a scene in a bathroom house with Merrill, Andrews and Neville Brand, and the appointment night outside the Bellevue Hospital, which establishes what would have been the conclusion of the film. High grades for the atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill, etc. And the general portrait of the underworld, although the angle of love and the elements of the good quality bad cop don't help his cause.
