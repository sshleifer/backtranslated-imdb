Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) collects Candy's portfolio (Jean Peters) which contains an important microfiche destined for the communist cause. She is followed by 2 federal agents who are waiting to jump after passing the microfiche to her contact. However, Skip steals the bag on the subway under everyone's nose and so begins a hunt for him by the police and Joey (Richard Kiley) and Candy who want to return the microfiche. Skip can only be tracked through Moe (Thelma Ritter) who sells information on criminals. It has been made clear to Skip that what he has stolen is important and that both sides want the film, but he intends to resist at a high price. This leads Joey to the hunt for him and a conflict between Joey and Jean, who fell in love with Skip. Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss. <br /> <br /> It is a well acted film and has a good start that involves you immediately. It's a bit unrealistic how Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark, but this point is otherwise necessary because he would later have to resist Joey. It is a good movie.
