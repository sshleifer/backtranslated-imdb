It is a real pity that this spin-off TV series inspired by the higher quality television images "The Night Stalker" and "The Night Strangler" lasted only one season and twenty episodes, because at its best this program often offered a winning mix and much fun of keen cynical humor (the lively spirit of Carl Kolchak matches the perpetually irascible and long-suffering editor Tony Vincenzo is always a pleasure to watch and listen to), intelligent writing, elegant supernatural threats (you must love the original and original creatures in "The Spanish Moss Murders "," The Sentry "and" Horror in the Heights ", plus you can't go wrong with these bolds so tried as zombies, vampires, werewolves and witches), colorful characters, lively acting from a series of fantastic guest stars (the legendary icon of the motorcycle film William Smith had a rare opportunity to face a heroic protagonist in "The Energy Eater", while other episodes h year seen as protagonists of great veteran characters like Keenan Wynn, John Fiedler, John Dehner, Severn Darden and William Daniels in juicy roles), effective moments of authentic suspense (the climax of "The Spanish Moss Murders" in particular was really heartbreaking), and, above all, the one and only Darren McGavin in the mood for vertigo is the brash, aggressive and excitable, but fundamentally decent, courageous and honest little Chicago journalist, the Illinois journalist, Carl Kolchak. <br /> <br /> Kolchak was the quintessence of the protagonist of every man of the 70s, a shrewd and witty companion with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and an unfortunate talent to face all kinds of problems. Moreover, the Kolchak from time to time was anything but superhuman; he had usually stumbled or stumbled while running away from a mortal threat, yet he possessed a certain inner strength and courage that allowed him to save the human race many times from all kinds of otherworldly mortal enemies. Kolchak was surrounded by a handful of funny secondary characters: Simon Oakland was perfect as Carl's chronic boss, Vincenzo Vincenzo, Jack Grinnage as the perfidious Ron Updyke made for an ideal comic foil, Ruth McDevitt was simply as delicious as the sweet Miss Emily Cowles and also Carol Ann Susi was very funny as the needy newcomer of the beavers, Monique Marmelstein (who unfortunately disappeared after appearing in only three episodes). Of course, the show suffered from make-up and special effects (the Werewolf titular werewolf, unfortunately, looks like a Yorkshire terrier!) And the last few episodes boasted some funny silly monsters (the headless biker in "Chopper", Cathy Lee Crosby in the role of Helen of Troy in "The Youth Killer"), but also the second-rate shows are redeemed by the trademark of the sardonic mischievous spirit and the boundless vitality of McGavin and a captivating presence.
