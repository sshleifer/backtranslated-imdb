I'm a Belgian and I grew up in the sixties. Most of the American series have been shown here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first to whom I became passionate. Unfortunately, in these parts there arose a "panic hysteria" among mothers because Batman was considered too violent. Damn, compare the innocence of that series with the crap that children see nowadays. So because of my overprotective mothers of the 1960s I only had the chance to see maybe two or three episodes! I felt so frustrated that I started picking up comics and soap bubbles (I still got them!) To compensate. I even had the View Master slides ... I had the urge to see the hooded crusader. All children need some kind of hero. <br /> <br /> Years later I finally had the chance to see the filming as a teenager and had a great time. The ironic acting would have escaped me when I looked at it as a child, but I understood it at the age of 17. Yes, I watched them all now and the occasional gentle soul on internet episode posts because they didn't release the DVD series (as far as I know) <br /> <br /> Tonight I liked "Back to the cave bats "... it was a pleasure to watch it because it was full of curiosity and inside-jokes. Seeing Adam and Burt was a pleasure and this TV movie is simply fantastic in every respect. They play themselves while playing their parts in the series. Congratulations to the people who have produced this great nostalgic "party" ... I'll watch it again. My advice to all Batman fans is: WATCH !!! Rent it !!! Lend it to a friend !!! Buy it !!! I would never expect him to rate this as 9/10 ... Very well done!
