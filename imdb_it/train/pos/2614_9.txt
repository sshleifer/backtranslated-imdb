Why wasn't this released? I thought it must have been a bit junk since it wasn't. How wrong a girl can be! This film is, in a word, compelling. <br /> <br /> You will be fascinated. Keep your attention from the beginning and its rhythm never slows down. <br /> <br /> The final part of the film, the episode "so to speak" (don't give anything, you saw it in the trailer) is also unmissable. You will choose a favorite, you will be shocked, you will not be able to go to make a coffee because you need to find out what happens. Adrenaline increases and you can't watch. Cudos for the actors, it is very credible. And it doesn't end there, they have a final shock for you. <br /> <br /> It also makes you question TV reality and if you look. And how far are we from this, really? Endemol (who is a big brother) did a TV show in Holland last year offering a kidney from a dying woman to patients who needed a transplant. The show was eventually revealed as a hoax, apparently to raise awareness of organ donation, but are we getting too close for comfort?
