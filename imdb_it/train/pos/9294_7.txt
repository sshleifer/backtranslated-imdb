Before starting, I would like to stress that I know the publisher of this film. We never met, but we belong to the same fanzine (those things that came before message boards), and we talked on the phone, so I have a prejudice here. However ... <br /> <br /> In some ways, it is ironic how the "Rat Pack" culture of the late 1950s and early 1960s returned to the mid-90s, this film, from his son of one of the original Rat Packs, and that was done in a similar way, was a flop. Not only that, it was a critical flop; I think that Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was the only one who didn't hurt him (he gave him a mixed review, as a souvenir). And even though I don't think this is the biggest movie in the world, and I'm not a fan of the Rat Pack, or "cocktail", culture, I think it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> First, this looks elegant and moves along. For another, the main performances are all good. Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly restrained here as the chief gangster who returns from a sanatorium, and has a funny side to him. Jeff Goldblum returns to the silently ironic performances he held in his pre-blockbuster days, such as THE BIG CHILL. And while Ellen Barkin is only asked for the vampire in this movie, she is amused. Of course, it's not a great film; dialogue is mostly made up of word games, and many of them don't work (like the whole "Zen of Ben" speech). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are horrible here. However, I was entertained, and if you like gangster movies, you could be too.
