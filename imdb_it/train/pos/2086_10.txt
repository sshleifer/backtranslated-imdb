Faithful to the work of Pearl S. Buck, whose years spent in China as the son of missionary parents who gave her a profound knowledge of Chinese culture and her philosophy, this film adaptation is brilliantly done, both in terms of technique and acting . /> <br /> Wang Lung is a humble farmer grateful for the foundations of life: surviving out of his land and marrying recently with Olan, servant of a rich and powerful family in the village area. Despite the best efforts of Wang Lung and Olan to cultivate the land, raise children and build savings and wealth, a famine risks wiping out everything they have worked for. By choosing not to sell their land, a traditional Asian belief, they instead go to a big city to wait for the famine. While in the city, they are reduced to begging and being just one of hundreds of unfortunate homeless families. Although he is not a looter, Olan is captured by a crowd that ransacks a rich man's home. It is summarily summarized to be executed by the army, but saved at the last minute. His luck, however, is that he found precious jewels on the looting site that offers her and her family the opportunity to return to their farm to start over. The new wealth has transformed Wang Lung. Become selfish, self-centered and take credit for the discovery. He becomes a very rich farmer, but it only makes things worse because he becomes increasingly inappropriate, arrogant and difficult to reason. It loses contact with the fundamental things of life that money cannot buy: loyalty, commitment, trust, fairness and honesty. As a punishment, nature once again turns the table on Wang Lung by sending a plague of black locust to destroy all it has. Taken to his knees, Wang Lung enlists the help of all friends, former friends, workers and family. With all this help, he manages to save the farm. From that experience, he returns once again to humility and an appreciation for the foundations of life.
