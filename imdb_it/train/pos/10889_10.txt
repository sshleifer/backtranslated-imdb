What's all the negative comments? After seeing this movie for the first time tonight, I can only say that this is a good comedy for the holidays that will definitely brighten the day of a solitary person. When I saw that Drew (Ben Affleck) could end up spending the holidays alone, I wanted to cry. You should see the movie if you want to know why. Also, even though I liked Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) after a while, if they asked me, they were real snobs. However, this film made me smile and feel good inside. Before concluding, I would like to say that Mike Mitchell has achieved a holiday success. Now, in conclusion, I strongly recommend this beautiful holiday comedy that will surely brighten up a solitary day for any Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate fan who has never seen it.
