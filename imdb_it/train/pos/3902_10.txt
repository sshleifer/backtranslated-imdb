I had heard of Eddie Izzard, but I had never seen him in action. I knew he was a transvestite and when last summer I saw that he was on HBO, I wore it, not knowing how my husband would react. Well, it blew us away. It's better than Robin Williams ever was. Has total control of the public; when he does 'Englebert is dead - no he is not', routinely, the public does not know what to think in the end. God like James Mason is also an inspired touch, and his version of the Spanish Python Inquisition performed by the Church of England - "Pie or death?" no price My jaws were sore from the laughter at the end of the show. We scoured the TV listings for months afterwards to be able to review it, and we were lucky enough to register it the next time it arrived. If you have the chance to watch this show, delete everything and record it, you won't be disappointed.
