I saw this film premiered at the Imagine Festival in Munich. <br /> <br /> I saw the first trailer four years ago, and from this moment, I was waiting to see the final result. I have not been disappointed. <br /> <br /> It is a 3D film with a high contrast black and white rendering. Clearly inspired by some comic books, such as those by F. Miller. In this view, it goes one step beyond R. Rodriguez's excellent adaptation "Sin City". This time, (almost) without gray or any intermediate color, but a graphic style never seen before in a realistic animated film. (I can't wait to have a dark scanner) <br /> <br /> The massive use of Motion Capture offers a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we soon forget the technical aspect to focus on more classic elements, like the direction or the plot. The direction remains sober and controlled despite the endless possibilities of the medium, and this is really a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> Futuristic history (Paris 2053) makes it a classic science fiction film and keeps the viewer interested until the end. Despite a basic classic plot (a survey that goes far beyond initial expectations), the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, the absolute power of certain companies ...) gives this film great interest. <br /> <br /> Although it is an animated film, obviously it is not made for children. You won't find any funny pets or any stupid moral family here, just the cold reality. He is much closer to a good film noir. <br /> <br /> I have found that the setting is one of the best aspects of the film: we still hear the well-known Paris, but it is transformed by a refined touch of futurism. <br /> <br /> However, I regret some mistakes. The editing is sometimes a bit flat, one or two slow-motion effects very cliche and some poor dialogues. Although the technique is excellent, it shows its limitations in some romantic sequences (a bit like the "final fantasy" did). Those little things make it a 7/10. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's an artistic challenge of success that you have to look at if you can. The director, Christian Volckman, knows how not to fall into potential traps (fortunately, they didn't ask John Woo to do the job!). <br /> <br /> To conclude, it is a film with explosive visual effects, an intelligent story and a wonderful artistic direction. Watch it if you can! <br /> <br /> Please excuse me for spelling mistakes.
