What an incredibly fun and original show. The cast that begins with the hysterical Julie Brown (Homecoming Queen's Got A Gun) is simply perfect. Add Amy Hill (All American Girl-Nonna Kim) who plays a lesbian who always discusses with her partner and business partner (Asian restaurant WOK-DON "T RUN) I laughed louder during this show than any other I've ever seen (including Newhart, one of my favorite programs of all time) If you like movies like Naked Gun and Airplane, you'll love this series !! One of the best moments of the show is Cindy Williams who plays herself, cleaners, Tammy finds a picture by Cindy Williams in her coat, the image is by Cindy Williams who does an unmentionable act with an upside-down bowling pin. It is great to see an actress like Cindy Williams who is able to interpret herself in this way. with many surprise twists in the course of his short run. I can only hope that this one day will be released on DVD with special special special bonuses .. Most entertaining series I've ever seen !!!!
