Ah, Domino is actually a breath of fresh air, something new in the world of cinema. I really liked the film because of the intricate plot, the various characters and the intense effects of the camera. I have seen some complaining about camera work and, in fact, according to the same authors, the wild and striking shots were the culmination of mistakes made over time. All you see is the desired effect. Perhaps some people complain that something like this has never been done before, even though this is what sets it apart. In a deeper aspect, what you are seeing is how Domino sees things through his eyes, think about it. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the story, I see nothing negative. Despite its "disordered" nature, according to some, it is actually just a quick form of narration. The plot is not really that difficult to follow, if you actually focus on what's going on. Maybe it's just me because I see films from many different aspects, like acting, plot, etc. I'm not an "interpreter" or anything that collects films separately, it just comes from me. Having said that, I think this is indeed an excellent film, despite being the future as a cult classic, blockbusters, or whatever. <br /> <br /> And the characters, well, there's no doubt that the cast is varied. I think the cast is excellent, because everyone does good jobs and effectively plays their characters, that's what makes a movie ladies and gentlemen. The characters are all very unique and an advantage is that you get to witness a small piece of each of their lives, moving them further away. Basically, I personally loved the cast and the characters. <br /> <br /> All those who hit and burn this movie, maybe they don't see it the way I do, or they just don't like it. No matter, this is a great film in its own right, no, it's a great cinematic period.
