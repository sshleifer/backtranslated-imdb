In the film several references are made in a sneaky way to Blade runner, but one of the most obvious is the fact that the Cain 607 and its unity are all genetic constructs, which are transformed into expendable warriors. But as my favorite quote from the movie is "you should have made them smart as well as fast". Kurt Russell did an incredible job, his facial expressions or lack of films gave more in the way of relating the story, then the rest of the combined cast. Even when he falls in love with Sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions, and his tears after being expelled from the group, or his shuddering when given a hug, and his attachment to the dumb boy who in many ways reminded Todd himself, and what could have been if it hadn't been for his selection to be a soldier.
