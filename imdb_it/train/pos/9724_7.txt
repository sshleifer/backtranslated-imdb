I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I guess she's the kind of actress who shouldn't be acting before the camera, but just being herself. He did it and it seemed so natural in Elizabethtown. In this film, however, he tried to add more artificial performances, especially in the first half of the film, so that he looked more like a sober editor. While in the other half, she was completely reinserted into her daily track, and I couldn't tell her to be an editor in any way. Therefore, his performance is not lasting in this film. <br /> <br /> The film, overall, is attractive and stimulating. Young's character is full and reasonable. However, the film tells a great and sophisticated story. <br /> <br /> The only major flaw is that it showed no turning point in the love story of the hero and heroin. I am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story, because this is rather unclear for the two people.
