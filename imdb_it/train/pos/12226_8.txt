This is the best made-for-TV movie of all time! Am I saying this because I'm a big Silverstone fan? Partially, but also without her, I would see him anyway. I'm a fan of serial killer movies, and I think this is a great voice in that category. In addition, Mary Giordano easily ranks among the top five creations of Alicia's characters. Totally memorable - how she really exists. I would also have it on my side, if there was a mystery to solve. She plays the character, as she does with her real life, with total confidence in everything she does. She looks sweet, honest, cute ... just like she is in real life. So it's that acting? Yes, in fact it is a kind of rebel again. This time it's not bad, it's too good and a little scared to do things that seem above the law. But she doesn't do things that the normal teenager would do. Instead, he spends his time reading investigative magazines and solving crimes. A clich√© abounds: she is avenging her father's death, in a way different from that of the vigilante. At the time, Alicia seemed to play the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without a parent, a loner. This happens here too, but this time it's a bit of a geek. It does not matter; it is still as beautiful as a nerd. See you soon, otherwise Giordano will investigate why you haven't ...
