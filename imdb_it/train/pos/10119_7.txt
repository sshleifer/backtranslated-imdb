Anyone new in Takashi Miike's incredibly prolific work may want to think twice before making this amazing film the first experience of this truly nonconformist director. In line with Miike's working practice of taking any job that happens to him and then grafting his sensitivity on the script, this is basically a fairly simple yakuza thriller, with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a band whose brother fell lawyer. What takes the film out of the same old-old realms, however, is the absolutely inflexible attitude, so some of the most sudden and horrible violence seen in today's cinema. And this is not a nice, cold, clean violence so loved by American cinema - this stuff is nasty, painful and it hurts! That said, the pace is breathtaking, the characters are unusual without being weighed down by standard eccentricity, Miike's sense of humor is revealed and the most unexpected moments, and his camera is never completely unexpected, making it difficult to look away from the screen, whatever it can show you! It does not have the "Ohmigod" ending of "Dead Or Alive", but if you are not picky, now is the time to board the Miike wagon before it ends up in the "John Woo store list" of some Hollywood studio ...
