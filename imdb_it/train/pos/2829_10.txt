Without a doubt, Private Lessons II is the greatest film I've ever seen. A Japanese import (bad) translated into English, is a joy to watch. It doesn't make much sense, but it doesn't matter. It's the biggest comedy out there without ever being intentionally funny. <br /> <br /> The film is rare and not available on video, but I took it a couple of times late, late at night with the payment cable. My registered copy has been looked at dozens of times while slowly, person by person, I introduce this jewel of cinema to the world. Joanna Pacula plays the tutor / lover of Ken, our hero. (Apparently he was just working on his check.) Ken is played by Goro Inagaki, of the Japanese pop group SMAP, who gives it all and has great hair throughout the movie. Stacy Edwards, of "In the Company of Men" fame, also appears in the film and is probably happy to have found other films later. <br /> <br /> It takes at least three views to figure out what the plot is. Repeating the view you can enjoy elements like the abnormal amount of jars that Ken has at home (at least 50) or that Ken wears a shirt with corn grains embroidered in the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The film is predictable, but highly quotable. My friends and I recall whole scenes. Yes, it seems we are lame losers and we are ... but we are weak losers who have seen "Private Lessons II". Be one of the ten people in the world who have seen this film. You'll thank me for this.
