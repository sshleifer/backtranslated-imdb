Red Eye is an electrifying film by the creator of Freddy Kreuger, Wes Craven. Wes Craven describes the story of a normal hotelier Lisa. After attending his grandmother's funeral, he decides to take the red eye flight. While waiting, he meets this man named Jack Rippner, (how is it fffrreeaakkyy?) And they have become friends. Ironically, both sit next to each other on this floor. Then this is when the horror begins. This movie is thrilling and for the weak people who don't like horror / exciting movies, well, let's say they can pee in their pants. This is an excellent example of bone shaking production. Wes Craven did well with this film. He chose the right actors, like Rachel McAdams, a smart and sexy girl who knows what she's doing and is cautious about everything when she plays in a movie. Cillian Murphy, the terrifying and horrible actor who can relax the bones of his extraordinary acting as the bad character of this movie, and his face can really enlarge your eyes. Wes Craven has done an excellent job and I hope he does more movies like this.
