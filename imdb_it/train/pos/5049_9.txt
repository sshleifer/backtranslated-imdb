I had to see this gem twice to really appreciate it. When a widowed father of two interrupts the sleep of his two children with a shocking revelation, they are divided between believing in him and not in him. As the horrific events of this story unfold, we learn a lot about the father, his two children and their fate. With a shocking turn after a shocking turn, this film never allows a pause in the plot. Bill Paxton plays the father, but the most important performances are those of the eldest son, Fenton, played by Matthew O'Leary and the younger son, Adam, played by Jeremy Sumpter. This is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while, and you'll want to see it a few times to appreciate every intricate aspect of the plot. I give this movie at 9/10.
