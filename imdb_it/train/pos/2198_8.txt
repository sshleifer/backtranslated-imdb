Fred MacMurray's third film / Carole Lombard is a bit more serious than Hands Across the Table and The Princess Comes Across. It is yet another adaptation of the Burlesque game that was apparently popular throughout the day. <br /> <br /> The original Burlesque opera aired on Broadway in the 1927-1928 season for 372 shows and is the role played by Carole Lombard Barbara Stanwyck is a Broadway native who brought her to Hollywood. A version played by Nancy Carroll in the early days of talkies and later Betty Grable and Dan Dailey made another version of it in When My Baby Smiles At Me. <br /> <br /> In fact I have a vinyl version album radio show that Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler did for the Lux Radio Theater. It's an interesting job, believe me. <br /> <br /> However MacMurray and Lombard are good for the old chestnut tree, the story is set in a disco where Lombard is a singer and MacMurray is a jazz trumpet player. Notice a beautiful performance by Dorothy Lamour as the Latin fox that stands between Fred and Carole. Even Anthony Quinn is in one of his first films as a wolf on the Lombard brand. <br /> <br /> Swing High, Swing Low holds up really well today and I wouldn't be surprised if we see yet another version of Burlesque for the twenty-first century.
