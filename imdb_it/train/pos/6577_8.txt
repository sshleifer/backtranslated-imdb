With few exceptions, most of the works of George Bernard Shaw have virtually disappeared from the theater these days. Too much arch, too talkative seems to be the general verdict. This BBC version of one of Shaw's funniest comedies does not deny that verdict. It is certainly arched and chatty, but it is also wonderful. And because of the quality of the British theater, it is perfectly projected with actors who - with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter - many of us probably never heard of. Carter is as beautiful as the Bulgarian girl who houses the professional "chocolate soldier" (Pip Torrens) and later falls in love with him. One could argue with the particularly ridiculous interpretation of Sergeant (Patrick Ryecart), the Bulgarian cavalry officer who led the charge in the enemy lines and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for his machine guns. However, the role invites us to act excessively and Ryecart was obviously told to act excessively. The other players are perfect letter. Carter as an "aristocratic" self-taught Bulgarian and Torrens as the Swiss fortune soldier are at the center of the game, of course, and they are wonderful. Yes, "Arms and the Man" looks like a filmed comedy. But it is unlikely that you see a Shaw film that does not betray its origin. The plots are generally intelligent. However, Shaw is all about the dialog. The action is minimal (even in St. Joan) and the sets are irrelevant. Enjoy this for what it is.
