This is the kind of film that the United States doesn't do. This is why people rent foreign films. It's a great story about how a person, even if delayed, can find a person find a reason in an empty life. Everyone can learn from Georges. It also shows how mentally challenged people suffer in their lives and shows them in a very realistic way (I think). As his classic in foreign films this film has a bittersweet ending, but this makes it just a better movie.
