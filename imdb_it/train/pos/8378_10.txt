What a beautiful film it is. The notion of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is in bad taste. The ending is not only suitable, it is more inspiring. <br /> <br /> But I'm fascinated by the characters. Too bad to never see the relationship of Achilles and Athena more developed than a couple of kisses and Athena's fear of Achilles' safety. Their romance is a lot of fun. <br /> <br />
