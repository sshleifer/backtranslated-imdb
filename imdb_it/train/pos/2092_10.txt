I watched this movie with some curiosity. I wanted to see if 1) Paul Muni could play Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer deserved his Oscar. I came out of the movie thinking about YES! Having seen Muni in one film in which he was quite fit, I expected the same kind of performance here. I happily proved myself wrong. Although some might criticize it as too childish and stereotypically simple in the Asian idea of ​​Hollywood, I thought it was in the role. Keye Luke, if he had had the chance to play a leading role, could have played it the same way. <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed with the camera work and the use of crowd scenes, especially during the dismissal of the building where O-Lan was once a slave. The gloomy graphics and atmosphere of the firing squad and the drought have made this an epic quite different from the others of the same period when everything was gorgeous and gleaming. I saw this film from start to finish fascinated. I can't say the same for today's "epics".
