This film is considered one of my 10 favorite movies of all time. Many people see it for the first time and know little about many of the film's themes, they probably won't understand why I find it so compelling so I'll try to explain ... <br /> <br /> The film is very rich in historical details and cultural insights, and while it has some minor anachronisms, they are completely forgivable. The story is a tale of the famous duel between the monk Benkei and the young prince Yoshitsune on the Gojo bridge. During the fight according to legend, Yoshitsune gives his best to Benkei and the monk becomes the prince's faithful servant. This film, however, is a revision of that story and concerns war, obscure prophecies and political maneuvers. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes of the film is "Mappo", which is the prophecy of the Buddha that after 1000 years his teachings would have failed and the world would have fallen into chaos. It was believed in Heian Japan, after the eruption of Mount Fuji and the civil war between Taira (Heike) and Minamoto (Genji) that the world would fall into anarchy and everything would collapse. It's a period of demons. <br /> <br /> So you have the way the film solves the problem of training with Yoshitsune's sword of Karuma's Raven Goblins. The defeated clans often fled to the mountains and disguised themselves as demons to frighten the locals. This is said to be the place where ninja clans began historically. The description of Yoshitsune in Gojo welcomes all this. <br /> <br /> Then there is Benkei, and the various tensions of Buddhism are depicted, including a lot of Esoteric Buddhism from the Shingon sect. These are all depicted fairly accurately, and just to add a little extra, the film manages to convey the power of meditation and Ki energy in a way that makes it an integral part of the story, ie it uses magical realism to add an extra dimension to the film but does so in order to make it tactical and threatening. <br /> <br /> Overall it is full of curious bites and surprisingly realistic rings for that period. The scenery and the costume are also absolutely unmissable and very authentic. The soundtrack is large, very dark and threatening. I also thought that acting performances were surprisingly good. Benkei is a great brooding anti-hero, Shanao (Yoshitsune) is depicted as a young man who tests his limits and becomes increasingly drunk with his own power, and Tetsukichi the swordsman of the sword and the interesting representation of the "common man" and his less than flattering opinion of the murderers who like his best socially. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, to see why it's so good, I really recommend digging an old book on Japanese history and seeing how this reinterpretation turns an almost light Robin Hood into a story of intrigue, violence and hellish karma.
