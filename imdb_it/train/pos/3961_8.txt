This is the opus magnum of the Swedish shit king, Mats-Helge Olsson. Rarely has a film of this magnitude been filmed in Sweden and stands out as one of the most surprising results of Swedish cinema to date. Who pays for these things? <br /> <br /> Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to desert in Sweden. But his plans are ruined by the Russian soldiers who kidnap him and tell him that he has arrived in Sweden. This deception is their way of seeing that Markov continues his work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize energy supply for the entire planet. However, the CIA is willing to take Markov west and send his ninjas to free him. <br /> <br /> The practice of having Swedish speakers who speak English is something that Mats-Helge has perfected in his later works. The economic feeling of the b-movie that this creates is probably unmatched for performance. But beyond that? Well, the action is standard direct-to-video. Machine guns firing huge clouds of smoke. Thousands of Russians die. People running in black ninja costume, trying to hide in the snow. <br /> <br /> What stands out is the crazy way in which the fight scenes are choreographed. When they say "Ninja" in the title I expect martial arts, I expect close combat. But there are maybe two or three scenes of real martial arts in this film. And they're fun. It is so ugly that I miss the words to describe it. If the ninja moved more slowly their hearts would stop. And of course the whole movie ends in a bang indicating a budget for special effects consisting of four meal vouchers and a McDonald's voucher. <br /> <br /> So what's the verdict? Instant classic, of course. Never before has a film been made that is obviously intended to be consumed along with huge amounts of alcohol. It's the last film for the holidays. Insert in the video and laugh. Just realize that films like these are no longer made. This is the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> So the score is 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents.
