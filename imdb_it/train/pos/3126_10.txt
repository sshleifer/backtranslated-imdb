I do not easily distribute ten star ratings. A film must really impress me, and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that. Moreover, this trilogy has come together so well, that I believe it is one of the greatest cinematographic trilogies of our time. Although all three films can no longer be different from Ludlum's novels, they still represent an important reference point for film success. The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete, yet I couldn't even try to stop smiling for hours. <br /> <br /> From the moment the opening title appeared, I knew we would be around. Paul Greengrass did it again. Everything we love about previous Bourne films is here again: action, dialogue and, of course, the flickering camera. However for me, that last one was never a problem. I think the suspense increases. <br /> <br /> I will return to watch this movie several times before it is released on DVD, simply because it is brilliant. It is a perfectly satisfying conclusion and should stand the test of time as a fantastic film and, overall, an unforgettable trilogy.
