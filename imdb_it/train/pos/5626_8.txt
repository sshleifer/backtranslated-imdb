Marjorie, a young woman who works in a museum and lives with two roommates, Pat and Terry. One night he gets in his car and is attacked by a masked man with a knife. His plan is to rape her, but he manages to escape. The man has his bag. The police can't help her, since the real rape didn't happen. Then one day, when Marjorie's roommates are at work, her attacker arrives there. His name is Joe. Start a long battle against this man. But then he manages to spray his eyes and mouth with insect repellent, stuff that will kill him if help doesn't come soon. It binds him and makes Joe the subject of the same kind of physical and mental aggression used on her. The Extremities (1986) is directed by Robert M. Young. It is based on William Mastrosimone's controversial 1982 off-Broadway opera. Farrah Fawcett, who unfortunately lost his battle with cancer last year, is as exceptional as Marjorie. James Russo, who played the aggressor also in the game, is as convincing as Joe. Alfre Woodard and Dia na Scarwid are fantastic as Pat and Terry. James Avery is seen as a security guard. He received a Golden Globe nomination. It is not a film that should entertain you. A justified question arises. Revenge is not a perfect film, but I recommend it
