no film with dennis hopper, gary busey, erika eleniak, tom berenger, dean stockwell, marilu henner deserves a rating below 5 here. This is a poor version of films like 16 blocks or the endless midnight race, apart from the fact that the prisoner carried here is very easy on the eye. Tom Berenger interprets another military, nonconformist type well, and William Mcnamara plays his novice, who is about to be thwarted well. The plot is absurd at first sight because I lost count of the times that Eleniak should have and could have run away, but this is a fun wellness film and there are good cameos of all the actors above who keep the film running. This is not a family movie, because there is a bit of swearing and a rare nude scene with eleniak, but this is much better than some other guff that came out during this time.
