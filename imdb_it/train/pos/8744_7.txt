This is a low-budget film with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of location shooting. The Philippines replaces Thailand and no one actually goes to Hong Kong. The stock of a Cathay Pacific jumbo jet landing in the old airport makes the transition perfect. This film shows that you don't need mega budgets or headliner stars to produce an excellent film. It contains neither the gaffes nor the excesses that young directors often run into. Solid bill from people who know all aspects of creating a film and who understand the compromises between art and box office. An excellent job!
