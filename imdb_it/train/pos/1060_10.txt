Dark Angel is a cross between Huxley's Brave New World and Percy's Love in the Ruins - which portray the not too distant future as a disturbing mix of chaos and order, both in the worst sense of the word. Once the premise is swallowed that all modern technology can be blocked by "The Pulse", it provides a fun landscape to explore the personalities and relationships between the two main characters - Max (the Dark Angel / bike messenger) and Logan ( the rich rebel). It seems irregular, perhaps the result of a variety of authors, but it is held together by the energetic, beautiful and fascinating Jessica Alba, who seems to be strong and calloused, but vulnerable and sensitive. I think Fox did it again.
