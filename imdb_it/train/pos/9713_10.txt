This series premiered on "Comedy Central" cable television in the United States. It had been chopped to death and shown out of sequence. This was sad for the audience that should have attracted him, he didn't and he fell on the roadside. Fortunately, at the same time my cable company became digital and I had the BBC. Thank goodness because I got to see "The League of Gentlemen" in order, complete and complete. <br /> <br /> The "The League of Gentlemen" crew is right there with "Monty Python's Flying Circus" in England and "The Kids in the Hall" in Canada. But ... a warning. <br /> <br /> "The League of Gentlemen" are a step forward. It is not just a matter of dressing up and catching cultural ills, it goes deeper and much, much more obscure. I can tell many of you now - it will offend certain groups of people, it will make others angry. But remember, his only comedy. A dark and dark comedy. If that isn't your thing, don't look. If you think you KNOW the dark comedy, look at this - if you get angry and upset, then you don't know DARK COMMEDY well. <br /> <br /> These guys got it right, and right on the button. They are brilliant, they are excellent and I enjoyed every character creation. There is a COMPLETE story that is told here from episode one to the end. You cannot watch this episode at a time, willy-nilly, this is one of the strengths of this series. Look at it in order. See how these guys are creative, elegant and deeply disturbed. No one and nothing is out of bounds. That, my dears, is "dark humor". Good boy!
