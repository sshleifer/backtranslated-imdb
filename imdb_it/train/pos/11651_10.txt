WHEN FRIENDSHIP OF FRIENDSHIP, in my opinion, is a moving and very moving drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic. Whenever Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) vomited, I wanted to vomit myself. It is difficult to explain why. If you ask me, they should have been more cooperative about things. However, I enjoyed watching them do things together and get lessons from their parents. Before concluding, I would like to say, "If you ask me, when the FRIENDSHIP OF FRIENDSHIP really shows you how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a person's body." Now, in conclusion, I recommend this movie to everyone I haven't seen. You're in tears and having fun, so the next time you're on TV, relax with a friend and watch it.
