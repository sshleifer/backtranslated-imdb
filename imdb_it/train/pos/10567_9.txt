Wonderful. One of the best musicals ever. The three Busby Berkely numbers ending the film are spectacular, but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible non-stop patter and the natural acting of Cagney and Blondell. (Keeler is also adorable, although she may not have been a great actress). There is a freshness in the film that is not seen in the films of today, and much less in the usually thirty-year-old films, even if the plot, which includes the production of cinematographic prologues, is rather dated.
