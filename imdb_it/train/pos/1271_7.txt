Having never seen this movie, based on the fun novel by Nicholas Katzenbach, and taking into consideration the cast of first choice assembled for production, we decided to take a look. "Just Cause", although not a horrible film, takes too many liberties with the original material that Jeb Stuart failed in his treatment. Arne Glimcher has directed. <br /> <br /> The first thing we think about when a young black man is transported to the local area for questioning is police brutality. After all, Sheriff Tanny Brown and police officer Wilcox show no mercy in beating Bobby Earl, accused of killing a young white girl. We feel horrified by what the agents do to the prisoner. <br /> <br /> So the scene changes. Evangeline, Bobby Earl's grandmother is sent north to ask a distinguished Harvard professor, a retired lawyer, that the young man wants Paul Armstrong to defend him. The old woman is convincing enough to let Armstrong take a look at the case. He is also convinced of the young man's innocence. <br /> <br /> Things are not exactly what we thought we were. When Blair Sullivan, a man who is spending time in the same facility as Bobby Earl, comes forward to tell how he is connected to the girl's murder, and changes the dynamics of the case. The way it sounds in the film serves to confuse the viewer and divert Armstrong from arriving at the truth. <br /> <br /> This thriller is made fun by Sean Connery, who plays Armstrong. Laurence Fishburne, an intense actor, makes a good impression as the sheriff who, as far as we can see, is guilty of abusing his prisoner. Ed Harris has a wonderful opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and young Scarlett Johansson are seen in secondary roles. <br /> <br /> The film, even with its flaws, will not disappoint.
