I saw this film for the first time when it aired the late Trio Channel a few years ago, and I saw it again recently - without ads - on Sundance. I was impressed the first time and found it even more engaging in second sight. Yes, some segments are far from perfect - Amos Gitai's hysterical comment stands out as a sore thumb - but taken collectively, 11 09 01 is a total success. Best of show: the incredible final segment of Shohei Imamura, which contemporary critics like Mick LaSalle have misinterpreted as an attack on "terrorists", but now turns out to be a masterful polemic against the war; The opening piece by Samira Makhmalbaf that manages to merge the deep empathy for the victims of 9/11 with a prominent concern for the children of Afghanistan; and the entertaining crusade for children of Idrissa Ouedraogo for Osama Bin Laden - a hunt almost as serious and successful as the one for REAL Osama. The segment of Youssef Chahine is a noble experiment if failed that at least has the courage to remind the public that Bin Laden and al'Qaeda are basically creations of American foreign policy and the CIA, and even if the study of Sean Penn's character seems out place, it is still an effectively bittersweet piece of film-making. All in all, an essential vision and a damn better view of Oliver Stone's reactionary World Trade Center.
