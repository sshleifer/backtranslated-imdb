I recently found this movie on VHS after searching for it for a number of years, I was not disappointed. It improves every time I see it. Peter Ustinov is the protagonist and co-author of the original screenplay (nominated for an Academy Award). Among the other stars you've heard about are Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov plays an accountant / embezzler, just released from the infamous Wormwood Scrubs prison (he escaped from the conservative party headquarters, chosen because he is a liberal). He immediately starts the search for a new employer from which he can appropriate himself and discovers that computers are the wave of the future. Social-engineer makes his way into a men's club in London and learns the identity of the best computer experts in the city, steals the identity of a Cesare Smith, who has just left the city for South America to pursue his hobby of collecting moths in the wild. He heads for Ta-Can-Co, an American conglomerate led by Carlton Klemper (Karl Malden). Klemper assumes Smith and shows him the center of the computer, in particular his safety function consisting of a flashing blue light. Ustinov asks the computer how to defeat his security and the computer politely says, "Disconnect the blue light". Using hacking techniques for 30 years in the future, Ustinov breaks into the system and programs the computer to generate written checks in various fictitious companies. The scheme begins to unravel when Klemper's assistant Willard G. Gnatpole (Bob Newhart) notes the amount of business that Ta-Can-Co appears to be negotiating with Ustinov's scam companies. With the help of his secretary Patty Terwilliger (Maggie Smith), Ustinov manages to avoid the accusation and lives happily ever after. To tell you how to ruin this very funny, romantic, intelligent and avant-garde image.
