My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT * dizzying * CHOP} My - my - my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {MODIFY. CUT. Reproduction} <br /> <br /> I've never seen a director take so much breath for his style in the past. By now it is evident that most people do not appreciate the rowdy, flashy and dizzying editing technique of Tony Scott. If I have to choose between loving it and hating it, I'd say I love it. Sometimes he was distracted, but the end result was pretty good and it's nice to see a director with a creative touch to his style and a bit of originality (although he borrows heavily MTV videos). <br /> <br /> This stylistic side manifests itself when Keira Knightley plays the role of asshole bounty hunter Domino Harvey and even his dialogue seems strangely unstable. Otherwise she plays badly because I practically hated her character and I didn't sympathize with her a little, no matter how much she suffered. We follow Domino through his life as he joins the bounty hunters Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew gets caught up in the FBI and suddenly has a reality show contract with Christopher Walken's television production company (by the way, what is Christopher Walken doing in each movie?). I guess it's a clever film technique, because now Tony Scott is free to use all the montage footage from the MTV / Reality Show. Become a pastiche of MTV culture at this point. <br /> <br /> It then follows that the story is told at an incredibly rapid pace, with a very vulgar and violent language. There are some funny jokes; it's all very modern and surreal at the same time. It's a mess, but it's a pretty nice casino. In the end it is imperfect in so many ways (the actors try too hard to make their characters "cool", for one) but it works. Do I give him a weak 7/10 which may seem generous compared to the general consensus of film-goers who rated this film ?? but I feel he had good ideas and performed them well. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
