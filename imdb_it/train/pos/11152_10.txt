Watching Midnight Cowboy is like doing a master's degree in acting / directing / cinematography / editing / writing. I was too young to see it when it was originally published, and I only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has stood the test of time, and I've seen it several times since. <br /> <br /> Everything about this film is brilliant, from the moving performances of Voight and Hoffman (although I know this movie well, I still feel comfortable whenever Voight shows one of his innocently pained looks, or Hoffman coughs in his sickly and threatening way with his extraordinary cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that many of our contemporary directors are unwilling to risk making films that are visually and orally interesting like this. The night cowboy should be required for viewing in all film schools. <br /> <br /> 10/10
