The boys are working outside a recording studio when they hear "the voice of an angel". It would be Miss Van Doren, who would perform and go under the name of Miss Andrews because her father does not approve of her being a "radio singer". However, she hopes that a certain big wig, Mrs Bixby, a friend of her father's will hire her, and then she will have to give her approval. <br /> <br /> He leaves, but within minutes the boys are running amok in the studio causing chaos and having other musicians out to kill them after ruining the recording session. Finally things calm down. "Whew, we've eluded them," says Moe. "Yes, we also escaped," Curly replies. <br /> <br /> The boys then have fun in the studio, put on the Miss Van Doren record and Curly dresses in women's clothes and pretends to sing. Mrs. Bixby enters, she is impressed and hires "Seniorita Cucacha" on the spot! For an extra $ 500, he asked to come and sing at their upscale party that night. The rest, as they say, is a story in which Curly pretends to be an opera singer with some funny results. Oh, by the way, he was accompanied by "Senior Mucho" and "Senior Taste". <br /> <br /> What happens at the party is simply that the truth wins, but not before some antics happen. Overall, a pretty good episode. I liked it but I won't classify it as something special.
