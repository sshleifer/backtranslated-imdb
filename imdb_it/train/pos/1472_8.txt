Lots and lots of information to digest, and if you've seen Zizek, you know its rhythm. <br /> <br /> Even if you haven't seen most of the movies or at least some other films from the same directors mentioned in this document, you'll be a little lost. <br /> <br /> And the list of films is long. The director includes Hitchcock (Psycho, Vertigo, Birds), Lynch (Lost Highway, Mullholland Falls, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and The Conversation (Coppola) <br /> <br /> There are some movies like Segway, Star Wars: Espisode III, Matrix ... but these suspicions are lures. Of course, Zizek is never boring, but if you don't buy (or if you mind) psychoanalytic analyzes, then you'll be annoyed to the end. <br /> <br /> But you should not be, like the setting, the clips, the way the film intertwines with these clips, Zizek's points are never boring.
