I thought I should qualify my position after reading other reviews. The film is not exceptional, but it has many fantastic elements. The lighting and scenes along with the camera work are fantastic. The story is slow and weak, but fun. The acting is bad, but not worse than the one you'll find on SyFy Channel. The music is pretty good and the blood is good. It has a large leather face in the film and is produced by Bruce Campbell. I watched the full movie and, although mostly predictable, it was still enjoyable. Women are quite attractive and the leading actor does a good job of being thoughtful and disturbing. The film was extraordinarily clean for a modern film and the appropriate violence for children aged 13 and up. There were no sex scenes. I gave 7 out of 10 and I think that's right. I would look at him again if I had nothing better to do. The gay-sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the film, the devil is rather disturbing.
