FLAVIA THE HERETIC is a strange voice in the nunsploit genre: equal parts, feminist journey and "history" as we follow Flavia on her strange journey. <br /> <br /> Let's start with Flavia in a convent .. She's not too happy because she doesn't believe in all the "rules" dominated by men and in the machoism of the world that surrounds her and flees the convent with her Jewish friend, Abraham. Both are eventually captured and Flavia is taken back to the convent where she joins another "non-believing" nun to accelerate a Muslim invasion. Flavia appeared with the Muslims who took possession of the convent and became "engaged" with the nuns in a strange series of scenes. Eventually the Muslims launch themselves and Flavia is punished as a traitor to Christianity in another singularly brutal scene ... <br /> <br /> This has pretty much everything I like to see in an exploitative movie of the 70s - a bit of good blood, including the removal of the nipples, and a beautiful scene of neckline of the legs, some decent nudity - including the frontal suit and a decent weft. I will say that he was dragged in some places, but not enough to make us really bored. I highly recommend this exploit fan nunsploit / 70's ... 8/10
