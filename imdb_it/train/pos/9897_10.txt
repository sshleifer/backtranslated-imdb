Ok, sorry, but I loved this movie. I love the whole 80s kind of this kind of movie, because you don't see many like this anymore! I want to ask all of you people who say that this movie is just a rip-off, or a fake imitation, what does it imitate? I've never seen another movie like this, well, it's not horror anyway. <br /> <br /> Basically it's about the popular band at school, who like to make sure everyone lives in hell, so they decided to choose this nerd boy named Marty. It becomes fatal when it really hurts from one of their little jokes. <br /> <br /> So, it's like 10 years later, and the group of friends who hurt Marty start getting letters from the High School meeting. But ... they are the only ones to receive them! So they go back to the old school, and one by one they get knocked off ....... Yes, you probably know what happens! <br /> <br /> The only part that disappointed me was the end. It may have been left out, or thought better. <br /> <br /> I think you should give it a try and try not to be too critical! <br /> <br /> ~ * ~ CupidGrl ~ * ~
