Presenting Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a nice film, but I think it could have been better. Judy Garland is fantastic as always, but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the love story between her and Van Heflin develops too quickly. <br /> <br /> I mean, one minute he's ready to beat his butt, but the next minute he falls in love with her. I think this production, the editing of the film and the script (even if the photography was fantastic, the scenery was beautiful and even the costumes were beautiful) could have been a little better. It seems that the production was too hasty. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was also good, especially the little Janet Chapman as the second daughter Rosie. At the age of 11, she looks really pretty and it's a shame she didn't turn into a teenage comic actress. She is much better at this film than in her previous films like Warner Brothers in the late 1930s (except for Broadway Musketeers 1938, she's really good at that), when they tried to make her a Shirley Temple / Sybil Jason hybrid. Overall, this movie could be better, but in the end Judy gave it all.
