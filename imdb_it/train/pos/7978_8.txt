This film contains the ingredient that all revenge films should have and this is the real excitement. Pain, love, laughter, anger. There are so many emotions thrown into this movie. From beginning to end this film is immensely appealing. The plot on paper sounds like the usual garbage that is mostly thrown into the faces of the public but is not mistaken, this film is powerful. Washington as always puts on a great performance. <br /> <br /> The plot in short: the man suffers from depression, a girl brings life to him, children are kidnapped, the man wants revenge. It doesn't look anything special but it is far superior to any other similar movie out there. For a moment, TAKEN is a similar film, but when you compare them both, MAN ON FIRE wins hands down. The characters are engaging and everyone puts on a great performance and the direction is great. Mexico City feels alive, it looks like Mexico City, it smells like Mexico City. Everything is portrayed brilliantly. the style of directing was something that I liked and I brought the best of Mexico City <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you will pull out once a year to watch you again or a movie that you will beg family and friends to watch. From the beginning to the end you're cheering for the main protagonist, making it a roller coaster ride. There is enough action to make you happy, there is enough character development to please you and then there is Washington to make you smile. Watch this movie, you won't be disappointed
