This is a small film, few characters, theatrical. Yet he says something about Ireland that you will not find elsewhere. This film is IRELAND. In all it is dirt, it is sadness, it is self-delusion. The Boys, Master Doyle, SP O'Donell, Il Cannone, Senator Doogan's daughter, Gar and especially Madge. I know them. I'm in the pub with them or kneeling to pray with them. They are our sad story and they are our gift.
