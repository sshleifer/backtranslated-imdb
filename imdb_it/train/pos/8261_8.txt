Sentimental and naive, but undeniable, emotional appeal for the man-aid-man, in this case personified as German and French miners forced to be closed one after the other after the Great War thanks to a new border, which leads to German disillusionment, as the French are the leaders. But when the fire begins on the French side, the common decency of German men leads to assistance, security and even friendship. This was a plea that would fall on deaf ears in the decade, as a certain man on Pabst's side would break that piece and turn the Great War into a mere prelude. But it is obvious to me that Pabst really believes or at least wants to hope for this kind of fundamental humanism, since this film radiates this optimism while his most irreverent and cynical adaptation of The Threepenny Opera lacked the bite necessary to make that work work. Furthermore, his honest conviction is that the characters here are not mere spokesmen for positions, but real people, with real families of which we are aware even in our domestic lives. These are normal working class men who believe in the value of treating and treating just the next and on this day of individualistic opportunism, I will take some thinning in the plot to get a positive message that represents a point of view that I think we can all aim to. <br /> <br /> (Note: Apparently the ending is cut on most of the prints, where the French reconstruct the mining gate, closing the men again, a brutal turn of events, and could have made the film a movie overall better, but I would have complained about souring the positive vibrations of the final sequence, so, in short, I'm glad it was cut out.) {Rating: 8/10 (B) / # 7 (of 11) of 1931}
