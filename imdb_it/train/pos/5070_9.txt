Recently I was looking for the new Wide Screen DVD of FLY AWAY HOME and I found an interesting title I had never heard of: GRAY OWL. The fact that it was a Richard Attenborough film caught my attention (he was responsible for such beautiful films as GANDHI, CHAPLIN and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the script was by William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This "Special Edition" was full of interesting sound material and the price was just under $ 10.00, so I tried and bought it. WOW! What a great movie. Pierce Brosnan plays the role of Archie Gray Owl, a true trapper of life in the 1930s, who learned to love and respect the wild lands of Canada and worked to protect them. Brosnan (who starred in a James Bond film) offers a shady, warm and powerful performance like Annie Galipeau like the young woman she loves and influences her feelings for the creatures of the earth - especially the beaver. A beautiful soundtrack by George Fenton (THE CROUCIBLE) and the beautiful photography by Roger Pratt add great importance to the effectiveness of the film. And the extras on this DVD are something else! It includes two shorts made in the 1930s with the real gray owl and audio tracks by Attenborough and producer Jake Eberts; 2 featurettes; and many other nice options MORE for those who have access to a PC with DVD-ROM functionality. GRAY OWL was released directly on DVD in the United States - a fact that Richard Attenborough attributes to Hollywood's lack of interest in distributing something that is not full of violence and sex. This is a film that not only informs and entertains, but leaves you with something to think about. I had a very hot feeling at the end of the film - and a completely new love and understanding for beavers! GRAY OWL is a very nice film - it's worth a try! This is one I can't wait to share with others.
