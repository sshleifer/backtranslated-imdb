Family problems abound in real life and this is what this film is about. Love can keep members together through rehearsals and rehearsals and this is what this film is about. A man, dad, has the maturity and strength to support the family in the face of adversity. Children grow up, one is everything, the hard way, to realize that no matter how old they are or a parent, the parent still loves their children and is willing to provide them with a pillow when they fall. ALL the actors who portray their characters have made exceptional performances. Yes, I shed a tear down the road knowing I had similar experiences both as a young man and as an adult. This is true for life, one that every young adult and parent would do well to see, although some will not understand it until they too are parents. A must see for those who take care of their families.
