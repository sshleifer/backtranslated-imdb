"Hey Babu Riba" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed "Esther" after a famous American movie star), and four young people, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha and Pop, all perhaps between 15 and 17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are convinced and crazy friends for jazz, blue jeans, or anything American it seems. <br /> <br /> The very close relationship of adolescents is moving, and in the end a sacrifice is made voluntarily to try to help one the group that has fallen into unexpected difficulties. In the wake of the change in communist politics, they took different paths and met in 1985 (the year before the film was made). I liked the film with some reservations. Subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially at the beginning, there were a number of dialogues that had no subtitles at all. Perhaps the rhythm of the conversation required it, but I could not always read the text and absorb the scene, which led me to not always understand which character was involved. I saw the film (a video from our public library) with a friend, and none of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative. <br /> <br /> This Yugoslavian training film has effectively conveyed a sense of invulnerability, idealism and strong and loyal ties among adolescents. There is a main flashforward, and it was intriguing, keeping me guessed up to the end about who these characters were to the 1953 cast, and what really happened. <br /> <br /> I would rate it 7 out of 10, and would like to see other films by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991).
