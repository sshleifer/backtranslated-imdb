An excellent and accurate film ... McGovern works hard to find and document his writing and pay. He is not afraid to tell the truth, even though he might draw reviews and unfavorable comments from those who love clean, sweet and brilliant stories. <br /> <br /> Once again, McGovern brings in Christopher Eccleston, although not in a profile as high a role as he played at Hillsborough. I found this film accurate, well acted and well presented as Hillsborough and I applaud McGovern for his moving unrepentant writing. Well done and my hat goes to the writer, the actors, the production crew. A great movie!
