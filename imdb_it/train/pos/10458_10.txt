This film is one of the most feared geriatric diseases among today's aging. As one who has met a number of families who are facing the potential of Alzheimer's or who are in the formative stages, I would suggest that any treating physician would recommend this film to any family facing the trauma of this disease. The film is designed primarily to talk to the patient's family and reaches the very heart of the fight. The casting is excellent and the dramatic representation is exceptional with a very dominant plot.
