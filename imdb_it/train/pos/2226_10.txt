I'm surprised by IMDb's low rating of this movie. With all due respect, his low rating is representative of the IQ level of those who rated him so poor. They prefer to see a movie with cheap thrills, a bigger budget and more gore. <br /> <br /> The first misunderstanding on the part of the people is that this is a horror movie. Not so, nor does the film make you believe that it is one. It's a psychological thriller. It's for people who want an intellectual experience while watching a movie. The Reel.com review is the perfect example of how I feel about this movie. All the other negative reviews don't make much sense. It's almost as if trying to make an original film for a change - very rare these days - was something bad and not worth it. <br /> <br /> I will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and makes no sense. Martha was brainwashed and experimented with herself to be a caring mother while she was indeed an evil Nazi he killed without warning. The tests are all in the pudding and the fact that, at first sight, we are in solidarity with this cold-blooded monster throughout the duration of the film is a testimony of the direction and writing of the film. <br /> <br /> I definitely feel that this film should at least be rated in the range of 6 only on originality. I recommend this film to people on the other side of the IQ scale - smart people - since this film is obviously slaughtered by those who prefer to watch Scream or Freddy's Nightmare. Congratulations on acting too. For such a cheap film, you are surprised that this film has not affected your local cinema with great direction, writing and acting. Please don't be fooled by IMDb's judgment. This movie is worth it. Actually I recommend buying the movie since a first viewing on a rental will not do justice.
