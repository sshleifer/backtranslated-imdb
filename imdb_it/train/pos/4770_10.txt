The only show I've seen since 90210! Why did they interrupt it? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel part of it! The least they should do is release it on DVD! <br /> <br /> I checked similar shows, but nothing came close. The cast had an incredible chemistry and I looked forward to every episode. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake by pulling that show. If anyone has any information on where I can get a North Shore DVD, please post a few lines here. Thank you! Aloha!
