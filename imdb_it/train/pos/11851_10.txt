In an age when Hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses, desperation, crime, drugs and war, this film comes to us that reminds us of the concept of "Indomitable Spirit". If you feel downcast, this film will free your mind and make you jump. We all know how hard life can be, sometimes we have to remember that perseverance and courage will get us through. This is what this movie has done for me and I hope it will do it for you.
