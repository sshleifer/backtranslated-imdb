Excellent movie The whole picture was shot in Budapest, so I feel proud. My small problem was that the film's trains belonged to the Hungarian State Railways (M√ÅV), and it is clear that they were used in a large train, not in the local railway - according to the story Chikatilo picked up its victims at local train stations. Apart from that, the film is superb.
