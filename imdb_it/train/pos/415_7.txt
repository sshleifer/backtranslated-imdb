The master of cinema show Cecil B. De Mille goes to the West. Using three legends of the old west as protagonists (probably never met), Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill Hickock, James Ellison as Buffalo Bill and Jean Arthur makes a beautiful Calamity Jane. The story only serves De Mille to hang some wonderful action sequences, like the great Indian attack. Scenes like these are extremely well done. If you don't care about the somewhat exaggerated performance of the cast, this is very entertaining western. Look for a very young Anthony Quinn who tests the role of a brave Indian who participated in the battle of Little Big Horn. This part pointed it out at least in Hollywood.
