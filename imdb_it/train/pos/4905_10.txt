"An album of songs so old that everyone thinks they're new." This film has the elusive combination of rhythm and atmosphere that distinguishes some films from the initial moments. Why not? Towering talent of Dame Judith Dench as a widow who plays the saxaphone with a street musician to help him get the right songs, to Olympia Dukakis as the cheerful widow who lives in a Scottish castle on the food of countless marriages, to Ian Holm as drummer who loved all the members of a World War II swing band (more or less). But wait, there's more. Finally, add Leslie Caron to the bass and the incomparable Clio Laine to the lead vocalist, and the Blonde Bombshells are the most popular band in England since the Beatles. Well, OK, not really, but this film is a winner. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth (Dench) passes the entire film trying to gather the Blonde Bombs to play at her niece's school dance. And before looking up, imagine how difficult and brave it would be for a group of sexegenarian women to get on stage in front of the Britney Spears generation following an act called "Open Wound". <br /> <br /> the age at which the careers of the actresses ended when they were 30, the second album of most of the bands is a collection of great hits, and the music more than a month has almost no possibility of airplay, it's nice to see the real talent, the real music and the really good movie comes from, where else, the BBC. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, and I know that I will watch it many more times, and I will have more fun every time.
