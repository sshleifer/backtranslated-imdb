I feel a bit protective for this film because it was my introduction to the verse U.N.C.L.E. The year was 1972 and I.T.V. he performed all eight functions in a partial run (followed by a re-run of "The Persuaders" with Tony Curtis and Roger Moore) on Saturday night. 'The Karate Killers' was chosen to open the season. It began with a fresh action sequence like Solo's sports car and Kuryakin was attacked by a squadron of THRUSH mini-helicopters. I was a fan for life from then on. <br /> <br /> After the end credits (nice to see a sequence of special titles here instead of the usual practice of slowing down action movies) we go to the laboratory of Dr. Simon True (Jim Boles), inventor of a new formula to extract gold from sea water. True Amanda's wife (Joan Crawford) had an affair with THRUSH's agent Randolph (Herbert Lom). Truly a ruthless, he kills both the doctor and his wife, before looking for the formula. True prepared for the event - he divided it into five segments, each written on his photograph, and sent it to his five daughters, all scattered all over the world. <br /> <br /> Solo and Kuryakin set out to get the formula first, leading to a series of episodes in different places, and cameos of artists like Telly Savalas (as an Italian iron fist), Terry- Thomas and Curt Jurgens. One of the daughters of Dr. True - Sandy (Kim Darby) - accompanies the U.N.C.L.E. kids in their global search. <br /> <br /> After assembling the formula, THRUSH shows up and hands them over, before taking them to their secret base at the North Pole ... <br /> <br /> Of all the UNCLE feature films, this is what I should have created specifically for the cinema. It hurts to be a television product, even if a little more expensive than usual. Shooting positions were not taken and the various segments were repeated, usually culminating in a wreckage between U.N.C.L.E. and THRUSH. Of the cast, Joan Crawford is memorably friendly in her small role, and Curt Jurgens badly mixes like a sugar daddy. As a London bobby, Terry-Thomas is the most delightful of all, and Herbert Lom is as good as the bad boss. Kim Darby grateful however as 'Sandy'. He should have been told to stay at home. <br /> <br /> What is surprising about this is that it can be more fun and entertaining than many other official cinema releases of the time, including "In Like Flint", "Casino Royale" and "The Ambushers". I'd like to know how Solo and the company fled THRUSH HQ after Randolph's death though.
