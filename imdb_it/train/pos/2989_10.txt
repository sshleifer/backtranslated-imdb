First of all, I would just like to say what a great fan of Bette Midler I am. Stella is a great film with a wonderful cast (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason) This is one of my favorite movies of all time. This is a mother who raises a child alone, goes through a lot of things that are out of her way to raise her daughter Jenny wonderfully played by Trini Alvarado. This film is very good and I suggest you take a copy to watch it. Roger Ebert gave 3 1/2 stars! And he deserved 4! WONDERFUL! I give it 4 out of 4!
