This is the best dub ever heard by Disney, as well as the best adaptation from the biggest abuse of soundtrack, themes, characters, dialogues in Kiki Delivery Service. Urrrghhh <br /> <br /> This has a different atmosphere, especially the deviation from common heroin. This has both heroes and heroines (although in reality I do not support the use of the hero and heroin here, since Miyazaki is out of the stereotype and the common theme). As usual, after being presented by Spirited, surprised by Mononoke, troubled by Grave of Fireflies, and deeply touched by Majo no Takkyuubin, this starts with a little doubt in my part. I wonder if this will be the first Ghibi disaster. Well, in the end, just like Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart, I ended up giving 10 ratings. I would rate 9.8, but the additional 0.2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILER Somehow I see it as a sad film, people die in this, the lonely robot, the abandoned place, and ends up with destruction. It is as if humanity could not really live with too much energy. The collapse scene gave me the final metropolis spots. It's just sad somehow. The plot is evident in most reviews and even the rules of the soundtrack (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to the likes of Uematsu, Kanno, Williams. People who can bring a film, a game, an event to life, also to be moments of waiting with a stunning composition. <br /> <br /> This is a good feeling film that was part of American cinema in the classic days (it is a wonderful life etc. etc.). Well, things change ...
