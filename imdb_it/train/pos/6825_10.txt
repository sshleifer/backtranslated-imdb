I was absolutely blown away by the opening night of John Cassavetes. It's his first film that I've seen that seems to be on a bigger scale, so it looks more mainstream, but it doesn't feel like it's rooted any more than it did in his previous films. This is perhaps what makes it so intense. There is also something undoubtedly cathartic about watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It's about what actually made Cassavetes a staple in his career, an ideal he expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and this is where I'm expressing it in front. The character of Rowlands, the middle-aged actress Myrtle Gordon, fails to play her role in the upcoming production as written, so she impulsively follows the impulse after the impulse, producing what appears to be chaos on stage , until he finds the right one. It is a boldly abstract premise. <br /> <br /> This is a film that does not fail to capture the innate steering it goes through during an emotional cleansing. No one understands why Myrtle does many of the things he does, and is seen and even portrayed as something destructive, yet it may just be the best thing for her. It could be a cleansing rather than a break. A retreat, a cocoon, a rebellion, everything culminates in a merger. Cassavetes gives his character a brutally real touch, which is that, at the beginning, he is quarreling ardently that she has nothing in common with her character, yet she is in a quiet but emotionally corrosive fear that the opposite is true. <br /> <br /> The last scene, the climatic performance that Myrtle shares with a painfully estranged character from her acting with her, is one of the most interesting, hilarious, tough, enlightening and amusing moments I have ever seen in a movie.
