A very strange and compelling film. It is a very clumsy and hurt man who tries to navigate his life as a collector of door-to-door / seller funds. The director was able to capture a very disturbing tone that served the story really well. Original and disturbing, while also finding much humor in the pain that accompanies life. There is a sequence in a test facility that really stands out and makes me laugh out loud that is not something I do whenever I should. One of the most memorable films I've seen in a long time. He hasn't left my mind and I'm looking forward to Bronstein's future efforts. Fantastic shows all around. The simple line "I really appreciate it". it's now iconic for me.
