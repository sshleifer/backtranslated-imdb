Thre is not a single Scorsese film I will put on a list of my favorite films. But this is the best thing I've encountered in my DVD player in about five years. Scorsese's patient explanation of favorite movie moments and how Hollywood works is incredibly kind, calm and intelligent. <br /> <br /> It is a material worth 3 DVDs. It should be a British production, since everything about American corporate culture would have stepped on the silent, methodical, no-frills approach focused on the content that is adopted here. And an American production would have asked to say that he only liked movies that were popular favorites. I would like everyone to take a page from his love of movies. You should love movies you make for personal, idiosyncratic and specific reasons. Not only more "Me-too" votes for Il Padrino, etc. People have no idea what ideas have been explored in their favorite films. If they did, the movies would be more interesting than them. Scorsese KNOWs which ideas are explored and this makes him an engaging and involved speaker. I very much appreciate your articulate and generous interviews over the last decade. <br /> <br /> Negatively, Scorsese is the best when he is excited to show you some obscure films, rather than when he teaches you teaching something well-established about the history of cinema. And I'd like you to get those three hairs off his nose. It is very dispersive.
