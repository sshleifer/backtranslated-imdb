I have just seen 2 films by brothers Pang, The Eye and One take only. When I was watching The Eye, I was a little disappointed with these two guys, who had heard good things about them before. That film (The Eye) has a really bad script, in particular the ending (childish, clich√© and too coincidental in my opinion), but it's still good in photography and experimental images. So I decided to see One take only and it didn't disappoint me again. Still fantastic photos, extraordinary images, MTV-style editing, fantastic music and this time the story has a lot of independent, logical and beautiful spirit, you'll see some small holes in the plot, but it doesn't create problems with the plot. The only problem with this film is that I have a bad DVD.
