If this should be a portrait of the American serial killer, it definitely turns out to be average. <br /> <br /> A journalist [Duchovny] travels across the country to California to document America's most famous killers, unaware that one his white trailer trash fellow travelers [Pitt] is a serial killer himself. <br /> <br /> Quite predictable in all, this has its moments of action and Pitt and Lewis portray their roles well, but I wouldn't bother to see them again.
