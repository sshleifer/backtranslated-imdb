Well, maybe not immediately before the Rodney King riots, but even a few months ago it was pretty punctual. My parents said they saw it and the next thing you know, the police were acquitted and LA was burned to the ground. It only serves to show the state of race relations in America. The plot has white Mack (Kevin Kline) and African-American Simon (Danny Glover) becoming friends after Simon saved Mack's life in the black ghetto. Meanwhile, film producer Davis (Steve Martin in a serious role) thinks that gratuitous violence is really strong ... until he is hit. There is also some existentialism in the film: Mack and his family realize that they do not live as they really want. It seems that "Crash" has somehow renewed people's interest in race relations, but this came out much earlier. Perhaps we will never be able to have stable race relations in this country. But in both cases, "Grand Canyon" is a great movie. Kevin Kline claims as my favorite actor. Also played by Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard.
