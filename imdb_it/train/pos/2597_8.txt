Ulysses as a film should in no way be compared to the novel, because they are two completely different entities. However, having said that, the film still manages to retain many of the elements that made the book work, but since it is a visual medium, it is more difficult to pull the stream of consciousness. I think this is the best film they could have made with the material ... and this is from someone who regularly complains that the films are not like their literary counterparts. I recommend the book, but the film is still fun.
