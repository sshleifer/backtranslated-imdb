I totally agree that "Nothing" is a fantastic movie! I haven't laughed so much when I've been watching a movie for centuries! and David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are fantastic in this! they work really well together! This film may not appeal to some people (I can't really say why without ruining it!) But everyone on their own! I loved it and I highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> The direction is exceptional and some shots are very intelligent. It looks like they had a lot of fun during the shoot! <br /> <br /> Even if there are only two main characters in the film and not a lot of props, the actors manage to pull it out and make the movie look nice.
