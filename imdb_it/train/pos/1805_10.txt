I just saw this movie, I saw it for the first time when I was 7 and I could almost remember the end. so I looked at him like, 10 minutes ago, and (I might look like a child like 12 ha-ha) I started crying at the end, I forgot how sad he was. I think I was mainly sad about Anne-Marie because she said "I love you Charlie" and also: "I'll miss you Charlie", it really made me cry ha-ha. it must be one of my favorite movies of all time, it's just a movie that is worth watching. WATCH ha ha, that's all i can say XD <br /> <br /> but, i love this movie, it's a real classic. <br /> <br /> xx Maverick xx 10/10
