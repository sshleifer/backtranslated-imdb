"The Lady and the Duke" by Eric Rohmer. could have used a better translation for the title. "The English Woman and the Duke", perhaps, would have been more precise. While it is obvious that this film is not for everyone, judging by the comments on this forum, it is worth watching because despite the intricate model of the story, Mr. Rohmer created a film that could be seen as an art exhibition in a museum. The mixed technology used in the film, in the end, works well. <br /> <br /> The strange story of Grace Elliott, a noble lady who had been the lover of the King of England and the French Duc d'Orleans, holds our attention. The setting is Paris during the days following the French revolution. The country was in turmoil and power was in the hands of the people, who could not care less about the aristocrats. The images show the agitators who run with the heads of famous people immediately after their journey to the guillotine. <br /> <br /> The relationship with the duke was over, but she remains a true friend for the great man who is in danger, himself, of losing his head. Grace crosses all the horrors that surround it without being able to escape. He even has an enemy in his own house, in the form of the cook, Pulcherie, who would not hesitate to denounce it at the slightest provocation. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie sometimes gives the viewer the impression that one is doing on a journey through the Louvre by looking at those huge canvases that depict this crucial era of French history. Rather than finding the digitalization process that distracts us, we have found that improving the film in many ways. <br /> <br /> Lucy Russell, like Grace Elliott, does a great job of portraying this woman who has seen a lot during her life. His French seems to be excellent, since he seems to be talking about it fluently. Like the Duke of Orleans, Jean Claude Dreyfus made a fantastic contribution making us believe he was the noble himself without any effort. The supporting cast was also great. As an ensemble piece, Mr. Rohmer gets good performances in everything. <br /> <br /> For history lovers, "The Lady and the Duke" will be an interesting film to watch thanks to the vision of Eric Rohmer.
