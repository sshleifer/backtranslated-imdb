This film reinvents the term "Spring Breakumentary". The group's fat Hans, shows his talents as this generation Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, "the king of the $ 1 bet", shows he is no longer in Kansas, constantly increasing the stakes. Kyle's laughter is really infecting and also offers some fun for women (like Matt). The dwarves, despite having their moments, have not done justice to the Mexican hat that dances as it deserves. And finally, we have our protagonist, Ed. He gives hope to all of us, clumsy, stumble, ganglia, pale people who are still looking for someone special. And that hope, it's a small place called Cabo San Lucas. Although this blockbuster movie has been missed in theaters, this is a must, because we can all talk about one of these spring breakumentarions.
