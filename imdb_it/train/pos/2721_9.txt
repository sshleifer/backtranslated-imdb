The real story (which occurred in Kansas in 1959) of a murder (Perry and Dick, two former prisoners who broke into a remote house on a rainy night to steal and kill everyone they met). Richard Brooks directed Capote's chilling and disturbing book about the reasons that drove these kids to crime (are they Natural Born Killers?). The crime scenes are very brutal and haunting due to the lack of senses and reasons for what we have seen. Stunning black and white photograph by Conrand Hall, excellent country-road soundtrack by Quincy Jones, incredible performances in two main roles by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson and the first time in a film a sad commentary on capital punishment in the last moments before their death. Jones, Hall and Brooks (as a director and screenwriter for the adapted script) are nominated for an Oscar. Compelling, superbly direct and scary, one of the best films of this decade
