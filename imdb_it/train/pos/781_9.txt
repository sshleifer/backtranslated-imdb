"Crush" examines female friendship, mostly avoiding the sweetness quality that ruins so many films with the same theme (for example "Steel Magnolias"). At the same time, it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise. The events represented were highly unlikely, but the underlying emotional truth seemed very genuine to me. It is not a film for the crowd that explodes in speed and vehicle, but adult women are certain to respond with laughter and tears.
