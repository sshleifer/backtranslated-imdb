This procedural police procedure is no worse than many others of his era and better than some. Obviously he is following the steps of "Dragnet" and "Naked City" but emerges as a funny programmer. The best thing is the unadorned look it offers in a distant world ... the lower New York class of the late 40s / early 50s. Here it is in all its squalid glory, from the old tattoo parlors to cheap hotels to fat spoons. These old detective films are like travel diaries of a bygone era and very bittersweet for anyone who doesn't love the hygienic and soulless urban landscape of today. It is also intriguing the emphasis on the scientific aspect of nuts and bolts to solve the crime ... in this case, the murder of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car. Our main heroes, Detectives Tobin and Corrigan, take the steps, but without the boring and scrupulous efforts of the "lab boys", they would not get anywhere. Although the technology is not in the same league, the policemen here use the persistent persistence of a C.S.I. investigator to track down their man. <br /> <br /> The way some reviewers have written about this film, you think it would have been directed by Ed Wood and starred in his films. How beautiful! I liked John Miles when the ex-marine gangly turned policeman Tobin ... he had a carefree and casual approach to the role that is a positive change from the usual stone-faced histrionics of most of the cops of the period. Patricia Barry is as pretty and delightful as her lively girlfriend who helps solve the crime. Walter Kinsella is as rough and funny as old detective Corrigan. I rather liked the chemistry of these two and did something different from the kind of robotic "Dragnet" approach. <br /> <br /> The mystery itself is not too deep and the final chase and the shoot-out will certainly not rank among the classics of criminal cinema, but during the brief execution time, "The Tattooed Stranger" has more than aroused my interest.
