No other film made me feel this way before ... and I don't feel bad. Like, I don't want my money back or the time I waited to watch this movie (9 months) or feel bad about using two hours of a sunny summer day to be able to see this ______. The reason I say "_____" is because no matter how hard it is it torments my brain, but I can't find a word in any of the seven languages ​​in which the film is set to summarize. I have no idea what was going on all the time and in the middle of the film I needed a breather. No film has ever done this to me before. Never in my life have I wanted so much cauliflower, milk and baguette. Thank you. - Ed <br /> <br /> Uh. * clears the throat * No word. No thought I don't know. I really do not know. - Cait
