I looked at both sides twice. Enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an old Patrick Swayze as the hero. He was very credible as the hunter Alan Quartermaine and certainly improved the performance of Richard Chamberlain. I have to admit that I would have preferred to see someone else as "Lady in Distress". Alison Doody should stick to modern and non-vintage pieces. It did not look like a woman from the 1800s. The rest of the cast was exceptional and followed the plot very well. I'm glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try different characters and are not afraid to see them grow old. Age is inevitable, but let's not hide. A man over 50 can be much sexier (and, Patrick is really sexy), so a young green, no matter how beautiful. Hoorah for the character lines to accompany a big smile.
