Emma by Jane Austen is an extremely funny story at the worst times and this production of the story is the best I've ever seen. Emma by Kake Beckinsale is beyond reproach. Gwyneth Paltrow, (with the help of a good script and excellent cinematography) is able to effectively bring out the comedy, she can't make Emma nice. Paltrow is not helped by the fact that her hairstyles are simply "wrong" for the part (and I believe the epoch) and she looks decidedly sick in the clothes of the empire line. Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, handles the play effortlessly and is still able to show what Mr. Knightly (the most romantic of Jane Austen's heroes) actually sees in her. Mark Strong is a splendid Mr. Knightly with the right mix of good looks, appropriate age, chivalry, compassion and gentlemanly behavior. Emma and Mr. Knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite pleasant.
