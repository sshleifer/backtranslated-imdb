Very funny movie The classic fun movie Eddie Murphy from the 80s. I saw when I was a child and I have a good memory. Murphy's classic irony does not fail, the film is fun, well done. In the 1980s Murphy made many action films that represented a way for him to joke about everything that is dangerous. The result can only be appreciated by some but the films from 1986 to the present have changed. The atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a movie of the period. A nice film to see and have fun appreciating the ironic taste of Murphy, an actor who recently passed away. The final part is the anthologies, the sympathetic actor who plays the part of the Tibetan monk. That's all.
