I'm a big fan of John Denver. I have a large collection of his music on vinyl. I saw this Christmas special when it was originally on TV and I loved it. I have the original vinyl album and CD. I have the original CD and the next version. The next version however lacks several songs. I see it was released this year with all the original songs. To my surprise I found the original CD for sale for $ 75.00. WOW - to think that a Christmas CD would be worth a lot. For me this treasure is not worth selling. It's my favorite Christmas CD. I've never been able to find it on VHS or DVD. I'd like to have both versions. If anyone has one available, please let me know. Thank you
