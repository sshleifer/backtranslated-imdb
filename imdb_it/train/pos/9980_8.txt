Any film that shows federal PIGs (People In Government) are the powerful threats that are in real life has a lot to recommend to me. <br /> <br /> Alas, the supervision and editing of the scripts and even, sometimes, the direction is imperfect, so there will be people who will discredit the whole movie and ignore the good times. <br /> <br /> I saw the original when it was new and hated it, despised it, hated it. I thought it was a terrible and irrational piece of trash. <br /> <br /> Now, however, I don't remember why. <br /> <br /> I believe the two should not be compared or even linked. <br /> <br /> Consider it as two different films. <br /> <br /> Rate them as two different films. <br /> <br /> This "Vanishing Point" provides a place of battle, a banner for people who want to encourage individualism, who believe in human rights, who recognize the threat to freedom, the government can be and is , especially the federal government. <br /> <br /> "The Voice" wears a cap with the New Hampshire state motto: "Live Free or Die." Once it would have been the motto of most Americans. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious defects, "Vanishing Point" is a film to be enhanced.
