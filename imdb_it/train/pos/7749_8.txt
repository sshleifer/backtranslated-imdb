This movie makes your feet jump. This debut film by Tom Barman (known by the Belgian rock band dEUS) introduces you to 8 intriguing people, constitutive elements of an irresistible film mosaic. Both survive a day and a night in the metropolis of Antwerp. Barman paints his characters with great vivacity and competently interweaves their individual stories, a tour of the strength that recalls the best work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. The patchwork of anecdotes is surprising, moving, entertaining; the dialogues are so natural, they seem improvised. Some great performances by Matthias Schoenaerts, Natali Broods and the extremely entertaining duo of Ghent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam Louwyck is the memorable "Windman", a bizarre guy who dances throughout the film. Sam is also responsible for the splendid choreography and, of course, Tom Barman took care of the excellent Sound Track. We were very impressed: Any Way The Wind Blows is a movie that makes you jump feet.
