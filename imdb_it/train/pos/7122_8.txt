In the immediate aftermath of World War II, healthy Hollywood minds sought to distance themselves from the illustrious waving of flags which is a natural ingredient in a war effort. "Best Years of Our Lives" and even "Gentleman's Agreement" investigated how Americans looked at each other in the wake of the war, but Delmer Daves's "Pride of the Marines" beat them. <br /> <br /> The film is about the Philadelphia smart alec John Garfield going into a sailor's war and after a nightmare night in a trench, with Japanese soldiers strangely screaming at him and his friends "Mariine, tonight die! ", he is blinded by a grenade and dumps his girlfriend home rather than having to depend on her after returning home. <br /> <br /> Delmer Daves is uncompromising in his portrayal of these men who are brave, so to speak, almost by coincidence. They are there, in the trench, and when they shoot they react, so much for heroism, but they get the job , and then comes self-pity, the dark and gloomy sense of humor. of his blindness and the film makes no excuses: "There is no candy for free in this world," as his friend tells him. the ame boy, a Jew, played by Dane Clark, reminds him: "In a war someone understands it, and you are. Everyone has problems! When I come back, some guys won't hire me, because my name is Diamond". <br /> <br /> The great films are made with courage like these, and if the first half hour of "Pride of the Marines" fails to rise completely to the occasion, from then on it evolves into a real work of art: cry and meditate, feel pain and hope against all hope ... well, simply: art. <br /> <br />
