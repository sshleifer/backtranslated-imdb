This is a Noir movie "Serie B" and my vote reflects his belonging to that genre. I saw this movie last night in a cinema on the left bank in Paris, where he opened a two-week film noir. The film has some flaws, yes, but too many delicious elements to ignore. <br /> <br /> As noted by the previous review, the drum scene is incredible! (Series B movies can step on the forbidden entrance to films A)! And the plot is intriguing. As for Franchot's tone, however, I beg to differ: for me, it is appropriately mysterious; just the right creepy shadow. It must be borne in mind that a kind of German expressionism is taking place here (the director, Robert Siodmark, was a German who came to Hollywood during the war), so an exaggerated air fits into this whole film. At least it does for me. <br /> <br /> However, it is the beautiful Ella Raines who, only in her third interpretation, kept this spectator enchanted throughout the film. A "Girl Friday" guy with a strong resemblance to Gene Tierney, it's a wonder she didn't become a household name. But it's so good here that I've just ordered another film of yours ("Impact") from the Internet, and I'm looking forward to seeing it.
