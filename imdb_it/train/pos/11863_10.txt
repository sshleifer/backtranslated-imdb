Perhaps this could be the best film ever made and if it is certainly not one of those that are burned on your students like what Brian De Palma offers here is a great piece of cinema graphics. First of all there is the touch of the director of Brian De Palma who once again demonstrates that he could be one of the best directors of all time, there is the superb performance of Al Pacino who is offering an immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana), there are many different (violent) scenes you will never forget (the one with the chainsaw, the one in which Tony is sitting in a bathroom the size of most people's living room), there are many superb one-liners (like many times the word "f * ck" is used, there are the small superb details (the Pan-American globe that shouts "The world is yours") or the great unease of Giorgio Moroder. Nothing can be named that is not sublime here and is easily combined with "The Godfather", "Good fellas" and "White heat", one of the best gangstermovies ever made!
