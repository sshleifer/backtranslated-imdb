Pinjar is truly a masterpiece .... It is a stimulating film that makes you think and challenges our culture. It is without doubt the best Hindi film I've seen to date. This film should have been shown at festivals around the world and I think it would have been a serious competitor in Cannes. All the characters were perfectly expressed and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai were haunting in their roles. <br /> <br /> The story that the film tells of the partition is a very important story and should never be forgotten. <Br /> <br /> It has no prejudices and prejudices and has given the partition a human history. Here, no country is depicted as good or bad. There are evil Indians, bad Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious, meaningful and disturbing. Everything in the film was fantastic ... and the acting took my breath away. All were perfectly expressed.
