OK - you want to test someone on how comfortable they are with their adolescence and the embarrassing and manic changes - then get their immediate reaction by looking at this docile argument about kids making socially relevant horror films in the suburbs of the 70s. More than any film I've ever seen, the film deals with oppressive sexuality and the ego in a completely human way, never boring and reddened in the kind of innate goodness of youth that is faded by the adult world, full of fear, in which any strangeness in youth is credited to everything from madness to perversion. The mini-mogul Darren Stien seems to reach a deeper understanding of his triumphs and his doubts as the patriarch of the rigid world of children. What he finds in himself and in others is not always beautiful, but shows how one can improve and be reconciled with age. What does it mean to change without thinking. I love this movie.
