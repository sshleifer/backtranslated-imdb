This little movie had long been on my list of "keepers". Do people realize how stressed, menopausal women with emotional abuse (as well as mentally retarded) have been REALLY treated by the medical profession at the beginning of the century ?? !! All the pious Christian hard attitudes of that time were mortal to explore True emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace the suffering souls, not to mention what it means to embrace our humanity. Can you really imagine (according to today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books have been banned because he recognized that women have feelings and emotional responses as big as a man? Think about it! The sensitivity of this film still catches me and I give credit to the director for having captured it through his eyes.
