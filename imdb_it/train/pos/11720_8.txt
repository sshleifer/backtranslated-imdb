I didn't expect much, and to be honest, I didn't like this movie the first time, but looking at it again and I realized it's a bit cold. Sure, it's a joke movie but it's a fun gag. <br /> <br /> Someone posted that it could be written better and could be. I think this movie has the potential to be my exaggerated cousin Vinny. But with a horror guest instead of a lawyer. Unfortunately it is a missed opportunity. With a little more writing it could be a classic. Children are underused, there is no reason why they should stick to Elvira. In addition to the obvious reasons. It would have been nice to see their relationship prosper. I know it's a comedy but they are small differences that separate the good films from the brilliant. <br /> <br /> Elvira itself is always fun and engaging. Not to mention the coquetry. Every time you smile, you will too. It's hard to beat a movie when the main character is so charming. And it's really its charm, don't let its looks lead you to think it's a kind of tart. Well it is. But it's pretty. The kind of person you would let your children look after. You wouldn't let them cook for them, even if ... <br /> <br /> I would recommend you try it. <br /> <br /> Don't expect too much. <br /> <br /> She is much more than a nice set of tits. She is also an incredible pair of legs.
