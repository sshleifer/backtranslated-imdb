Pierce Brosnan, the newest but no longer James Bond, is a murderer. He's very good at what he does, but he's getting old and tired. Greg Kinnair is really good as a straight and narrow businessman. Now, when the story opens, the film shows these two people in their separate lives. Then one evening they are drinking something in a bar and they start talking. Then suddenly you find these two people attracted during a series of events. The story is excellent, the acting is top notch, and the humor is exhilarating. I never thought that Pierce Brosnan would be so funny, but he really is and I must say that this film is a must see.
