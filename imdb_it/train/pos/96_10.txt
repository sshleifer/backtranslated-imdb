I was reviewing some old VHS tapes that I found and I met the John Denver TV show and The Muppets A Christmas Together. This made me go to my computer and look for it to see if I could find a DVD version of this show to buy. I was disappointed that I couldn't find it on DVD yet. The show was broadcast in 1979 and was a delightful show. I have the album and the CD, but I'd like to buy a DVD version of this show. The tape is old and the image quality is quite good, but the fading, the sound is not as good as the CD. There are also some other songs not included on the CD. As a fan of John Denver and the Muppets, a DVD of this show would really be a good seller. If you don't have the CD, it's a wonderful collection of Chritmas songs from that show. The album is also good if you find it and you still have a turntable to play on.
