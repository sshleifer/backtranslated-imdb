A great start. I was a little surprised to find that the car was not as advanced: it should have been more raw, to match what we saw in the original series. The cast is interesting, even if Mrs. Vulkan turns out to be a bit too human. He needs to go to school on Spock who, after all, is the model for this breed. Too bad they couldn't have chosen Jeri Ryan. I like Mrs. Park, the Korean woman (?). The doctor has possibilities. I haven't solved the other males, except for the black guy. He is really nice. Bakula needs to find his niche - In QL his strength was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything. It's obviously big and strong enough for heroes. The weights were OK, although I didn't like their makeup.
