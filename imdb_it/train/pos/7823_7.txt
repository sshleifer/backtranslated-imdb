An exaggerated but compelling story of the friendship between civil rights leader Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the film is the strongest in which we see the bond formed between the two men, and how they help each other, but the second half is not so strong, due to the elimination of the character of Biko. Still, it's a compelling film with great performances by Kline and Washington, in the film that put the latter on the map. Washington was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor for the first time. Overall, a well-made film that could have been reduced a bit. 7/10 .____________________________________
