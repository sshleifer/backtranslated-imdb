This is a funny movie. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star who signs a sponsorship deal with Ned Beatty's Chicken Pit restaurants. The contract contains all sorts of humiliating clauses, like forcing Burt to wear a chicken suit during the race! Jim Nabors is his (not convincing enough) chief mechanic. Loni Anderson (oh yes!) He was assigned by Beatty to keep Reynolds honest and closely involved in the contract. This is a funny movie in which Burt shows he is not too proud. I like it!
