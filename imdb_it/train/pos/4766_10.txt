It is unusual to see a film in which the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest, if there is none, without his presence. <br /> <br /> Despite a non-exceptional direction - In fact, there are many scenes that seem to have been shot too quickly and carelessly - a seemingly low budget, a strange plot by a man who wants to take the place of a demented priest and other weekly points, the presence of Pierre Fresnay is so impressive that one is shocked from beginning to end terrible. <br /> <br /> I have never seen or can imagine for the future a better performance, even Paul Scofield who plays in "A man for all seasons". <br /> <br /> Actually the end could be considered ridiculous if Fresnay did not play the transtorned priest who returns to church with a crime. <br /> <br /> "Je suis Maurice Morand, prètre catholique" ("I am Maurice Morand, a Catholic priest") is said with such brilliance that one can forget the fool The other impressive thing about this film is a single scene in which Morand - who despite being a defrocked is a priest - consecrates an enormous amount of lives into a cabaret, transforming it into the blood of Christ. <br /> <br /> Gérard - the man who wants to return Morand to the Church or replace him alone - must drink if he does not want to leave him in the cabaret. He does it half-heartedly with applause and applause from people who think they simply drink three or four litters of lives. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, even the dialoque between Morand and a garbage man is remarkable. "Do you take men too?" he asks Morand, who hates himself for what he has just done. "It would be too much work" is the intelligent answer. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film does not deserve to be commented, but it is certainly worth seeing because of the very strong and strangely emotional atmosphere created at all times. <br /> <br /> I think "Le défroqué" is a very strange film, but it must be seen by all the spectators - if good Catholics are obligatory - because it is a very rare jewel in the history of cinema. <br /> <br />
