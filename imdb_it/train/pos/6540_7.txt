To be honest, I had to go and watch this movie backwards, I didn't expect much, but hey, I wasn't fooled, I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I would say that this film is a fresh breeze, despite some facts that have tried to modernize Nancy Drew, but this reminded me of these early 60s-70s films from Europe and Quebec. , where they manage to make children interact with adults. In this case, a 16-year-old teenager tries to do justice by trying to solve a mystery concerning the death of a dead actress 25 years ago. However, since his father had business in Hollywood, why not rent a house with a mystery behind the doors? Well, at least Emma Roberts does a great job here. A bit like the chubby kid, who at first is naively led to support his sister's jokes in Nancy, but in the end, he found Nancy nice enough to stay with her, even with his chores ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the supporting cast is fantastic, and he was happy to see Rachael Leigh Cook in a different role this time: a single mother (she did it in Family Rescue, but this time, she plays a mature woman ...) Anyway, don not do it, it's fun!
