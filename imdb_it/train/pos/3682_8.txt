Often movies of this nature present themselves as a mixture of great work together with a slight drivel to fill the runtime. Whether it's the big name or the project itself, Paris je t'aime never falls into this realm. I think I can really say that the film as a whole is better than its parts. Between the wonderful transitions and the fantastic ending sequence, merging the characters together in a last vision of love in Paris, I think the film would have suffered if any gear had been removed. True, there are certainly some people who overshadow the rest, but in the end I have a lasting image, even if only a fraction of a second of each short vignette. Love takes many forms, and talent here is up to it, to surprise and push the public through the caesura of poetry and the elegance of the many facets of emotion. <br /> <br /> Quartier des Enfants Rouges: Maggie Gyllenhaal surprises as a drug passionate about filming in Paris and meeting with her merchant. The revelation at its conclusion leaves you a little disagree while the infatuation between the two changes hands. <br /> <br /> Latin Quatier: Ben Gazzara and Gena Rowlands (recreating a report from an old Cassavettes movie?) They carry some great sharp spirit and sarcasm as they meet to discuss their upcoming divorce. Their conversation is true and what is right to make the other angry, it's all pleasant, leaving a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Quais de Seine: The director Gurinder Chadha gives us a moving portrait of love existing beyond religious and racial differences. It's a sweet story of shy love between two people who obviously feel a connection, but can't quite vocalize it. <br /> Tour Eiffel: I admit to being disappointed that Sylvain Chomet did not get an animated sequence together, however, this live story of mimes falling in love in a prison in Paris has the same bizarre nature as the his film Les Triplettes de Belleville. <br /> <br /> Tuileries: The Coen brothers stick to their strange sense of humor and have a good laugh. Steve Buscemi really shines and sells the performance without saying a word. His facial reactions to the verbal abuse of a discontented French are priceless. <br /> <br /> Bastille: Here is a harrowing portrait of a couple about love just to see it return to the tragedy. Sergio Castellitto and Miranda Richardson are moved while the couple takes care of the problems and finds out how strong the bond of true love is. <br /> <br /> Pére-Lachaise: A surprisingly funny little story by the horror master Wes Craven. A little humor from Oscar Wilde can add lightness to any relationship. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Alfonso Cuarón seems to practice the incredible long-takes that he perfects in Children of Men with this story of two people in love, walking along the road. While Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier come to the fore, we also find the true context of their conversation about "forbidden love". <br /> <br /> Porte de Choisy: a very surreal look in the glamor of Paris. This is probably the strangest voice, but so intriguing that you can't look away from the madness that follows. Don't anger your Asian beautician, whatever you do. <br /> <br /> Pigalle: an interesting look at a relationship that takes place in a role-playing game that seems to have been stagnant for years. A small variety from Bob Hoskins is needed to shoot. <br /> <br /> Quartier de la Madeleine: Even vampires in Paris can find love between feeding hours. I don't know whether to be happy for Elijah Wood as a result or not. Beautifully turned and deactivated to allow the liveliness of the blood red, this short is strange, but so is love. <br /> <br /> 14th arrondissement: let Alexander Payne's strange sense of humor add some depth to this dubbing story about an American in Paris to find out what love is. His hard, uneducated French is a stark contrast to the authentic accents we have heard so far, just offensive enough to be both fun and totally true to history. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: An interesting introduction to the process. Paris can be an insulting city for everyday activities like finding a parking space, but when love is discovered, it will take its prisoner anywhere to continue the journey. <br /> <br /> Loin du 16éme: Catalina Sandino Moreno brilliantly shows what love for a child goes through its subtle performance, since the fairy tale is suspended from its song to a child, but totally different each time . <br /> <br /> Place des Fetes: My favorite story of the group. Seydou Boro and Aïssa Maïga are simply fantastic. The cyclical nature of the story and the way in which destiny brings the two characters together twice so that Boro can finally ask for a coffee is hard to look at. Sometimes love in your last moment is enough to accept the departure of this earth. <br /> <br /> Place des Victoires: one of the best stories of a mother trying to face the death of her young son. Juliette Binoche is as devastating as her mother, desperate for a last taste of her son, and Willem Dafoe is strangely perfect as the cowboy who gives her the chance. <br /> <br /> Faubourg Saint-Denis: Sometimes you have to think you lost love to accept that you have not been fully invested in the relationship. Melchior Beslon remembers, trying to find out where they have gone wrong through a series of quick and sharp cuts since her meeting with Natalie Portman to "see" how much she needs her. <br /> <br /> Le Marais: Leave it to Gus Van Sant shows us a story about the gap in communication and understanding, as his films almost always deal with some form of alienation. His elephant photographer is an American who works in Paris, which is the catalyst for the digressions of love and soul mate of the artist of Gaspard Ulliel. Sometimes it is not necessary to know what is being said to understand what is happening in the breaks.
