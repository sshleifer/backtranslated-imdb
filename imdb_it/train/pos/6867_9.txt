I was born in 1982. Most of my childhood memories are in the late 1980s and 1990s. I saw the Groove Tube for the first time in 2001, when I was 19 years old. <br /> <br /> And I found it hilarious. <br /> <br /> So for anyone who thinks something "dated" can be pretty funny 30 years later ... think again! It's fun even if you have no idea what the 70s look like, and the thought of flared trousers makes you shudder. Who can discuss with a Bozo type the Clown who reads adult literature? There is a lot to laugh about. The scrotal puppet show at the end is the best.
