Well, after a while I got used to reading comments on these films that do not reflect my experience at all. For me, Amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous films. He was a very tough villain, a villain with no excuses. For me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his wickedness is not in any way an undercut. <br /> <br /> The guy who played Aryan was probably over his head with this cast. I think maybe the director could have done better. But to be honest, the best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel. She is an unsung heroine, a true veteran who is qualified for every role she is offered. But I must say that I appreciated his contribution as he played Virendra Sahi's wife. She could be given little to do, but she does everything with complete conviction. I'm sure he has sailed right over the head of most of the public. <br /> <br /> So if you are in the habit of settling for the Bollywood media, you won't get much from this movie. But if you are constantly looking for something more, this could give you a little of what you missed.
