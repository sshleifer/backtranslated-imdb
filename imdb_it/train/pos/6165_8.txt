Yes, some plots are a bit difficult to follow, and the Bill has a tendency to become violent, but in reality it is a compelling show, which I try not to lose. The vast majority of episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the acting is pretty good, although I miss Roberta Taylor as inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I must admit that I prefer the episodes before the most recent episodes and it is a pity that the program is now after the watershed, since I found it easier to observe when it was at 8.00. However, because I like The Bill it is because not only is it exciting, but the cliffhangers eventually make the next episode a must. It is true, however, that it is more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this program as a program that does not try to take itself too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox
