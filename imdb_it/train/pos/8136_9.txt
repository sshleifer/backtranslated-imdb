This film is a great documentary. Following is the rap group, NWH, composed of Ice Cold, Tasty Taste and Tone Def through their unique journey of high gangster rap, bass and back to highs. Through the problems with women, egos, policemen and whitey, this group arrives at the top of the gangster rap world, as this film goes on top of the documentaries. I know that all the favorite documentaries are This Spinal Tap, for good reason, but I think that, if in a good mood, this film is simply better. Laughter never ends, even for someone who is not part of rap culture. <br /> <br /> I am a white guy, who has no interest in rap music, culture or anything else associated with it, however I love this movie. Rusty Cundeif, who wrote the screenplay, the songs and starred in it showed great potential and it's a pity he hasn't seen it since Fear of a Black Hat. However, I've seen it once more than you , and that's what I recommend Fear of a Black Hat for you for a quick laugh. <br /> <br /> Remember, "Don't shoot yourself to see the whites! .... of their eyes? No don't shoot yourself to see the whites." <br /> <br /> FYM and enjoy the film.
