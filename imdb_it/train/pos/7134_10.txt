John Thaw is an excellent actor. I must admit I was struck by his role as an old grumpy old man who reluctantly agrees to take a displaced person from the streets of London (from the time of the Second World War). <br /> <br /> That said, the film is also excellent. A very moving story with a satisfying ending. Some of the characters are a bit underdeveloped (the teacher in particular), but none of them is essential to the plot. Basically, the story is about the old and the boy, and the film needs nothing else.
