Little Edie and Big Edie are characters for whom anyone can feel compassion. Even if their home was dirty, this is somewhat understandable considering their mental illness. On the bulletin board a poster wrote that "Little Edie has the coping skills of an eight-year-old child". This reminded me of when in the dramatized version of 2009, Big Edie tells Little Edie, "If you're stuck, he's alone with yourself!" These women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, firmness in their opinions and actions. Maybe if little Edie hadn't been so hard on herself the first time things didn't turn out, losing her hair, her work and the love of her life, she would have made it. This somehow binds to what I believe is his mental illness: his inability to recover when times are hard and see that the good times await us. The world will never know what happened if he didn't listen to his mother's plea, "Come home, Edie, let me take care of you!" <br /> <br /> However, these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant, heartbreaking and lovable, even in their extremely dirty home. These women were extraordinary and their mutual interaction brings humor and sadness. When Edie had one of her emotional meltdowns, focusing on what could be, or how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a child, she has the intense desire to hug her and tell her that "everything feels good!" <br /> <br /> Great documentary !! <br /> <br /> 9/10
