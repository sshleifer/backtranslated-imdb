While "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" has hired Raul Julia as a political prisoner in an unidentified Latin American country, this time he works for a dictator in a fictitious Latin American country. Specifically, the dictator suddenly falls, so Julia replaces El Presidente with a Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfuss) who is making a film in the country. From there, Dreyfuss must understand how to be a dictator, all the time in balance with his life. <br /> <br /> Is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in Latin America into a comedy? Well, "Moon Over Parador" does a good job with it. No matter what they do in this movie, they pull it out. It only explains why Richard Dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our era and what we lost when Raul Julia died. Definitely worth seeing. Also played by Sonia Braga (co-star with Raul Julia in "TKOTSW"), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> <br /> I agree: the first woman is sexy.
