Well, after all, it was a nice surprise. his trailer did not include a good movie at all, it was even a bit misleading. Especially the part of Jeff Bridges was a positive surprise, well written, sardonic and funny. Less real though, I don't think a guy who got where he got would show signs of such irreverence towards everything his current company represents. One does not become a suit, only to doubt it suddenly again. The ending of the film, during the screening of Dolce Vita, was too trivial, clich√© and rather disappointing. And of course a guy like Pegg's character wouldn't last his first week in a blitz of New York magazine like this. I hope that one day I will see a decent role written for Megan Fox, here she looked like a poor actress who plays a child. And by the way, I don't see why she is the "sex symbol" of the year, I see sexier girls on almost every cover of every magazine.
