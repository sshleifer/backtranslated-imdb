Season after season, the players or characters on this show seem to be people you would absolutely love to hate. Was this show rigged or were they chosen for the same? Each episode defames a single person in particular and ends up being killed. You enjoy seeing them cheat even if it's totally wrong and sick. You enjoy watching them screw others, get fucked by themselves, play dirty, retrieve it, run away and finally be kicked by Trump. The amount of tears also seems to increase during the season. <br /> <br /> Even the rewards that attempt to compensate for past humiliations and suffering are greatly reduced. In more recent seasons, it's like "You'll meet xyx who will teach you about uvw" ... like who cares? The characters are so unbeatable, collectively and individually, that you wonder if they are paid actors? The only sane can win. <br /> <br /> Watch carefully and keep your conscience. Those are your fellows in the line of fire.
