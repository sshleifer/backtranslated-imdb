If you've never heard of this Walt Disney Pictures movie, don't worry. It would be classified among other Disney films that are meant for educational purposes such as "Family Planning". <br /> <br /> It was co-produced with Kotex to teach pre-teen girls the Menstruation, basically. It is only educated on a superficial level, so it does not enter into the heavy details of the "Ram's Head" / Reproduction system animation sequence. <br /> <br /> The film shows "The Wonderful World of Disney" elements such as turning the page and using animation to tell the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is impossible to find, so if you can find the movie, I wish you luck and good fun.
