While not as famous as some of their other collaborations (such as THE BLACK CAT and THE BODY SNATCHER), this is a little dandy horror film even though the casting decisions were a bit strange. Boris Karloff plays Dr. Janos Rukh, a strange scientist who lives in the Carpathian mountains, near the birthplace of the character of Dracula. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Benet - whose nationality has never been discussed although the name certainly seems French. I really think it would have made sense to have the two switch roles, since the role of the Carpathians seems tailor-made for Lugosi - especially with his accent. However, despite this unusual breakthrough, the two did an excellent job. Karloff was definitely the protagonist, but Lugosi behaved well as a relatively normal person - something he didn't do very often in the movies !! It seems that Dr. Rukh is a bit of a pariah, since other scientists (especially Benet) think that his theories are bizarre and meaningless. However, during the film, Rukh was right and Benet is particularly generous in his new praise for Rukh. But unfortunately, the wonderful new element discovered by Rukh has the bad side effect of turning it into a crazy war machine (don't you hate it when it happens?). Although this may have been just a simple scientist turned into a crazy story, the plot was well built, the characters well developed and the crazy Rukh was NOT a one-dimensional killer, but complex and interesting. <br /> <br /> This movie is intended to be enjoyed by everyone except people who hate old horror movies. It can really be said that Universal Pictures did everything it could and made a film with a higher budget, instead of the cheap little quicks that both Lugosi and Karloff gravitated to in later years. Good stuff.
