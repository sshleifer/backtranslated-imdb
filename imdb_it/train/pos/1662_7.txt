Artemisia's film can be considered a betrayal or a real artistic license. <br /> <br /> What could it be? <br /> <br /> In documented history, Artemisia Gentileschi was subjected to the knurled screw, and claimed that it was transformed, as Mary Garrard and Gloria Steinem eloquently stated. <br /> <br /> In the film, under different tortures, she refused to condemn her lover / violator. <br /> <br /> How can a film deviate so much from the received story, but still inform the human heart? <br /> <br /> The answer is not so difficult to find. In the film, the director and cast have filled a void in the historical record, with the power of imagination. <br /> <br /> This led to a different conclusion from the record. <br /> <br /> So be it. I find that both the disc and the film are irresistible. <br /> <br /> Both in the film that (it seems) in history, Artemisia was a painter, first of all. <br /> <br /> that vision, framed in the composition of the enchanting film (sic), I am truly grateful. <br /> <br /> I have rarely seen a film that has so forced my eyes. <br /> <br /> David Broadhurst
