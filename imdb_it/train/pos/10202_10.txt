Personally I liked this movie and I am alarmed by the evaluation that some people gave. It's a movie based on a comic book and it's animated, now if you don't like comics or animation then obviously you won't like this movie, so why did you look and worry about evaluating that it's beyond me. Although, if you are a fan of Interesting, strong characters and heroic (sexy) women who kick themselves and save the world (hell), you will love this movie. I thought the story really attracted me and it was a fantastic movie. Rather anime-esque or more like some of the American films that follow this new trend in adult animation. Like Titan A.E. meet is the live action version of Punisher. In the end I highly recommend this fan the buff and super hero fans or anyone who has a fairly open mind looking for a funny movie.
