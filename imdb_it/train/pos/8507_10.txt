Well, take O.J. Simpson as an American soldier turned all the American bus driver who decides to save his passengers by himself, in case no one else came and Arte Johnson in an absolutely straight role as a tour guide who doesn't know what to do but doesn admit to being in trouble and combine it with Lorenzo Lamas as one of the three boys with the face of a child who intend to kidnap an heir and leave a load of people to die on dessert and you have to have action, twists and lots of drama. Everyone was good but seeing Lamas as the baddest of the bad guys really drove me crazy. He was too believable as the evil bully who not only wanted to kidnap the heiress but to rape the women and humiliate the boy who tried to stop him. Evidently it was long before he cultivated his image as a good boy. And believe me a 20-year-old Lorenzo in tight jeans that you absolutely don't want to miss!
