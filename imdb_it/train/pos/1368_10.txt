All right. This has been a favorite since I was 14 years old. Granted, I don't watch it several times a year, but ... This is not a movie for an older generation that wants a deeper meaning or a brilliant message. This film is FUN. It's rather dated, almost passe, but Parker Posey is so brilliant that it's incredible. If you want to be fascinated by a 90's Breakfast from Tiffany, frequented by rave from the 90s, or love Parker, this film is for you. Otherwise, don't worry.
