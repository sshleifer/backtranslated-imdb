CitizenX (1995) is the response of the developing world to Silence of the Lambs. Where "Silence" has terrorized our tranquility, the "Citizen" exhausts and saddens us instead. This dramatization of the Chikatilo case translates rather well, thanks to a westernized friendship between two Rostov policemen that become the same. <br /> <br /> CitizenX could also argue against (!) the death penalty much better than The Life of Kevin Spacey David Gayle (2002). <br /> <br /> Humans are the Machiavellian mammals, under which lie the limbic brains (logic of the lizard). Why did two children, who knew better, stoned to death a child they had kidnapped? Why do bloodthirsty women scream "li-lilililililii" to the acts of terrorism of OBSCENE? -My same term is the "limbic domination", the logical impulse of the lizard to dominate an "enemy". If you have the words "enemy" / "revenge" in your vocabulary, you are easily able to "limbic domination". <br /> <br /> In the Second World War, in the 1980s, Rostov (located at the mouth of the Don River near the Black Sea), nothing suppressed the impulse of Andrei Chikatilo for the "limbic domination" of overcoming his layers of civilization. The easy victims of Chikatilo (Jeffrey DeMunn) were poor, usually children, who rode the interurban train for fun, since they could not afford anything else. <br /> <br /> CitizenX reminds us that the denials of a rampant Soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such "lambs". The Rostov serial killer roamed free for almost 7 years AFTER the police arrested him and let him go. <br /> <br /> The politicization of crime is harmful everywhere. Although the police routinely suffer worldwide corruption in the West, the vote by politicians can create chronic rivalries between agencies, hindering a more coordinated response to crime. In the CitizenX Soviet Union, however, Viktor Burakov's Killer Department (Stephen Rea) suffered from a repressive bureaucracy. <br /> <br /> Geoffrey DeMunn plays the psychopagically inadequate Chikatilo with an impeccable authority but underestimated point of complete darkness. Even in real life, Chikatilo had the experience of a life that mixed and escaped capture. <br /> <br /> His pursuer, on the other hand, stands out like a strange bird, given to unreported outbursts of anger. Perhaps based on the design, Stephen Rea does a very strange performance as head of Burakov science. Rea's Russian accent is impenetrable; and his Burakov is devoid of humor and surly, in contrast to everyone. <br /> <br /> So it's Donald Sutherland who walks away with the photo. Col.Fetisov, the head of Burakov, Sutherland, and at first his only supporter, is a patient too patient militant, whose dignified carriage testifies to decades of bureaucratic machinations. His awakening as a policeman guided by logic but still passionate becomes the idealism of the cornerstone of the film. Joss Ackland makes another round as a showy apparatchik, Secretary of the Communist Ideology Bondarchuk, who oversees the investigations. Of course, he canceled the arrest of the most likely suspect, a communist, in 1984, a man carrying a rope and a knife in his bag, presumably going home: Andrei Chikatilo. <br /> <br /> Soon, he replaced Burakov with another Moscow apparatchik, detective Gorbunov (John Wood), insisting that the investigations now focus on "notorious homosexuals". The funniest scene of this sad, sad film comes during the institutionalized harassment of Bondarchuk and Gorbunov: a stupid policeman sincerely tells: "As I suspected, comrade, it is fornication. I made some drawings" - laugh me exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Five years after the bodies began to accumulate, in 1987, the police finally tried to solicit criminal profiles. The only cooperating Soviet psychiatrist was Dr. Aleksandr Bukhanovsky (Max Von Sydow), who called UNSUB " CitizenX ". Later he also observed to Fetisov and Burakov that" ... together they make a wonderful person ". We agree. <br /> <br /> The elaborate rhythm, distributed over a decade, captures perfectly the "institutional inertia of Glasnost -" opacity "- which was not. The contrast with Perestroika -" destructuring "- could not be greater for the case. Although Chikatilo was still wandering in the railway stations, the plans of the police avano to bear fruit. <br /> <br /> In 1990, Col. Fetisov was quickly promoted to General. His nemesis Bondarchuk disappeared from the scene, allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference. Staff, communications, advertising: suddenly everyone was available. In just one night of phone calls around, Fetisov got his access as chief forensic attorney to the FBI's Serial Murder Task Force at Quantico, where, Fetisov discovered, staff are periodically rotated by serial murder cases to drive away this psychological damage by investigators. /> <br /> Fetisov advises his recently promoted head of forensic medicine, now "Colonel" Burakov, of all these changes in an avalanche of confession which becomes the watershed scene of the movie's power plant. Fetisov is the most tender of excuses I have ever seen in a film: "In private, I offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife. I hope that one day I can forgive my ignorance", he almost whispers. <br /> <br /> An HBO production, CitizenX is a film of the highest level. Not only do the exteriors seem authentically gloomy (shot exclusively in the most degraded parts of otherwise spectacular Budapest), but the soaring Randy Edelman soundtrack is completely overwhelming - and often our only respite from brutal brutality. Those who speak Hungarian will recognize the many Hungarian accents and credits. <br /> <br /> Chikatilo's murders are described as a bleak and aberrant behavior born of defects of character and ignorance in an equally squalid world. This makes the murders not entirely out of place, but of course they were. As President Kennedy reminded us, "we all love the future of our children". CitizenX communicates perfectly that killing is far more gruesome and obscene than any fantasy of revenge can imply. Serial rapists rape to dominate; serial killers kill to dominate. So some soldiers. Such "limbic rulers" make human beings poor. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION SPOILER: ----------------------------- ---------- -------- The real Andrei Chikatilo was the most prolific serial killer in the world. Condemned, he was executed in 1992 in the manner of all death sentences of the Soviet Union: a blow, in the back of the head. Foolishly, these methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after death. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: ------------------------- --------------- -------------------- The best result is always the prevention of killings, not their procedure. Executions simply guarantee the society's inability to learn from the complex reality of victim deaths when we also send anecdotal evidence of HOW / WHY that died. Nor do the killers learn regret if they are dead. <br /> <br /> Revenge does not kill the victims. Baying for killer blood is nothing better than counter-domain - once it's too late. <br /> <br /> Revenge for mourning is not justice for the dead - it is appeasement of the living. (10/10)
