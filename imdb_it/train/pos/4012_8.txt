After some difficulty, Johnny Yuma arrives at his sick ranch to take care of daily operations, only to find that the old man was murdered by his beautiful wife with the gold diggers and the woman's bad brother. <br /> <br /> Good production values, a pleasant performance by Mark Damon and a screenplay full of combined action, make this addition fun, if not exceptionally profound, to the classic spaghetti western. <br /> <br /> star Rosalba Neri is one of the hottest European girls who has ever graced the screen. Here it is absolutely perfect as the cold (and abusive) user of weak men. <br /> <br /> Damon and Neri have appeared together in at least one other photo, The Devil's Wedding Night, a rather good horror film that is of particular interest to those of you who want to see what's under your clothes of Rosalba.
