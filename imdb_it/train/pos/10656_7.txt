What a beautiful film by Barbara Stanwyck that I happened to see last night. "Jeopardy" was fantastic. It was created in 1953 and probably due to the double effects, but it kept me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen, who with her husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and son (Lee Aaker) drive to an isolated fishing spot in Mexico for a vacation. The husband has a fall from the dock and the only way to save him is if Barbara returns to a garage for a rope. <br /> <br /> While bumping into a psychotic killer (Ralph Meeker - one of my favorites) and what follows is a cat and mouse game as Barbara tries everything in her power to convince Meeker to come back with her to free her husband. <br /> <br /> The film was so full of suspense and such a surprise - I didn't expect such a beautiful film. But I suppose I should have understood - is there something that Barbara Stanwyck does is anything but wonderful?
