Right now I'm watching this movie for the second time (on television) and for the second time I fell when it was already an hour (I think I saw 2 more minutes this time) where Goldsworthy looks at nature, changes nature in a way that you would never think of, it's really amazing. The whole film gives you a feeling of warmth, seeing him play with the world around him with so much love. Or just seeing his hands, covered with earth and with broken nails, he only touches you.
