This is 2009 and in this way the undervalued gem has lost none of the power it had 31 years ago. It connects a rather wide variety of characters and different stories without appearing cluttered. <br /> <br /> Clothes and music may have changed over time, but in the end this is a story that will never lose its "dateness." And above all this film does the job quite well. Of course, sometimes it is quite vulgar, but also very touching. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster's performance is amazing, and shows that she is a naturally born actress who showed her true potential, especially in her previous films. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this.
