A century ago, in Brooklyn, the rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and their competing volunteer fire brigades lead to Brodie's famous bet of jumping off the Brooklyn bridge. This is a story that will be familiar to many people through a parody of Bugs Bunny, "Bowery Bugs" from 1949. <br /> <br /> This generally very funny movie would probably be more widely available if it weren't for the infamous scene and disturbing that involves some inhabitants of the Chinese building - a time capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes, which I believe give the film a great deal of historical interest.
