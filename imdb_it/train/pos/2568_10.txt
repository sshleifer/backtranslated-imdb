In this sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic K-9, detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee return to fight crime, but this time they join another detective [Christine Tucci] and his partner, a bad Doberman named Zues who doesn't get along with Jerry Lee very well. Dooley also doesn't get along with his new partner. Everything changes when the film goes on. The film is intense because theirs is a guy who really wants to kill Dooley for the way he treated him in the past. There are some dramatic scenes that deal with the death of Dooley's wife that don't seem to be in the tone of the movie because the rest of the film are action sequences, dog poop jokes, fart jokes and jokes about dogs that bite the bad guys a certain area. I know it sounds very low humor, but in part it's very funny. I didn't see this movie for the lines, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is because I'm a big fan of James Belushi and the second is for action sequences. James Belushi is more fun than he was in K-9 and even the action sequences are better. It would have been nice to see other K-9 characters coming back, but it's still a fun movie. If you are a fan of James Belushi, you will love this movie.
