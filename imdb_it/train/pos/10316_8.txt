Remember these two stories with affection and in the first, set in a not too distant future, we see a young boy getting ready for the exam day, the i.q. The boy is a bit perplexed about his parents' anxiety, as some of his friends have already done and eventually goes to take the test. Upon arrival it is injected and it is curious why. The examiner smiles and tells him that it is right to make sure he tells the truth. The boy then asks, perplexed again, why shouldn't he? It is later and the parents are seated waiting with concern on the screen when a message appears and declares that the state is sorry, but the i.q level of their son has passed the national quotient and politely asks for a private burial. A cap of a final scene! A Message From Charity was a hot story about a mental connection between a girl from the past and a boy from the present. Exploring in a strange story of witchcraft accusations in the past and digging into the pages of history in the present. A beautiful story with a touching conclusion.
