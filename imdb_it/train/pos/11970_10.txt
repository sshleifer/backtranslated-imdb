Full House came to me when I was about 9 years old. I remember seeing the re-runs of America's funniest videos with Bob Saget, and one day my mother told me that she was also on a show called Full House. One day, I was lucky enough to catch an episode while I was visiting with my family. At first it didn't seem too interesting, but as I looked more and more, every night at 9:00 am, I'd like to get involved. <br /> <br /> This show really makes you want to be there yourself, go around with the girls, go with them, and maybe even join their little "chant". <br /> <br /> The thing I like most about Full House is that it is a great show for children and adults of all ages. There will be some parts that are more for adults, so parts that are meant for children, so that the whole family can enjoy them. No matter how picky it is, it's still a great show and I would certainly recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10
