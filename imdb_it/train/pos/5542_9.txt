Probably the best film Producers Releasing has ever made, this little horror piece draws attention from first to last. The director Frank Wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one and, more importantly, he knows how to realize his full potential of shock on the screen. Not only does the plot involve and the characters fascinated, but the setting is absolutely out of the world! Almost all actions take place at night or in the midst of a pervasive fog. This chilling atmosphere is enhanced by the inventive direction of Wisbar and by the completely convincing performances that it has drawn from all its players. The adorable Rosemary La Planche is an ideal heroine, beautiful, lively but vulnerable. Robert Barrat delivers his usual and absurd portrait of the local bigwig, although it is hard to believe that the nice and good-looking son who plays his son is none other than the later writer / director of Dullsville Blake Edwards.
