Narrative ?? if written, epic visual or poetic ?? generally it tries to avoid even the characters; readers and viewers, after all, can be too easily overwhelmed trying to keep track of who exactly who is. This is especially true in the film, I think, simply because we can't easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema. Viewers like me, however, don't have this problem because we see all our movies on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> A year ago I was introduced to Audrey Tautou, a French actress, whom I saw for the first time in Amelie Poulain's The Fabulous Destiny (2001) and later in A Very Long Engagement (2004) , both with sophisticated and complex stories with a cast of characters. This previous offer surpasses others in both ways: more characters and more complexity. <br /> <br /> Now other directors have already used these techniques: Robert Altman with The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001) and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer did it with A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963, a comedy of almost epic proportions. The difference with this film is that first the director lets us 'see' inside the head of some characters and secondly, some scenes are repeated as a means to refresh the viewer's memory like the flip-flops of the story between different time periods . /> <br /> The base ?? the core, so to speak ?? the story concerns a young woman, Irene (Tautou) who is told, by a fellow soldier on a train, that she will meet her true love on that day. This occurs in the first few minutes of the film. The smart irony at this point is that Irene does not realize that the young man in front (Gilbert Robin) could be "a true love". And, neither he ... <br /> <br /> They go apart, without realizing the potential significance of their close encounter. However, chaos occurs throughout the rest of the day, not only for the two young people, but for the rest of the characters that appear in a series of ingeniously constructed and intertwined cartoons that seem to go nowhere, yet ... < br /> <br /> If history were simply that, it could be boring and even quite predictable. Not like that. The script and the director challenge our expectations with a series of innovative scenes that are all too common, but that are transformed into extraordinary and credible events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again. For example, the next time a bird poop from the sky falls on a book or a sheet of paper, consider your alternatives; two characters make an obvious choice that must take place before Irene and her destiny man meet again. Or how about a sliver of stone flying over your windshield? Consider again what would happen ... <br /> <br /> This is quite interesting. The most interesting thing for me was the evaluation of every new man who arrived and tried to decide if this guy was ONE for Irene, or if he was, in effect, the young man on the train. This made me guess for a while. <br /> <br /> I'll make you think about this, you should see this delicious romp. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
