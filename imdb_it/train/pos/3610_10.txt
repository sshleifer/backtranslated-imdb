Girlfight is the story of a troubled teenager named Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). Diana is oppressed by the suicide of her mothers and a sexist father who lives in a sexist community. A bad temper and a lot of things to light the fire, you're going to kick out of school to fight. His brother, Tiny (Ray Santiago), is training with Hector (Jaime Tirelli) in boxing. Diana is told by her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), to deliver that week of payment for Tiny's training. While Diana is walking in the gym, she realizes what she wants to do. She wants to box. Diana asks her father for money to train, but he refuses because she is a girl and should do more "feminine" things. All Diana wants to be treated like any other guy. Not looked down upon because she is a woman. Steal money from his father to start training. <br /> <br /> Great movie. Genius, pure genius "effing". Recommend to all those who need to see a clean and good movie without "monkey business".
