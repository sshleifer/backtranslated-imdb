It's a little easy. That's all. <br /> <br /> The graphics are clean and realistic, except that some fences are 2d, but it's forgivable. The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are magnificent. Everything from spoken to SFX is pleasant and realistic. <br /> <br /> The camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, but it's the same for all platform games, like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. <br /> <br /> I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997 and since then I have dutifully gotten 120 stars 10 times.
