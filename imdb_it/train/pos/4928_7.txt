Given its release time, the story that unfolds in the 1950 thriller "Panic in the Streets" was no surprise. The corpse of a mysterious clandestine immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination by a public health inspector who claims that the corpse is suffering from a sort of bubonic plague. However, with the current drama in today's world, this strangely helps this movie to appear credible to today's viewers. The cast and crew are impeccable. Richard Widmark in his first role after his revolutionary performance in 'Night and the City', Jack Palance in his chilling film debut, also starred in this film Paul Douglas and a young (and rather pretty) Barbara Bel Geddes. A lot of non-professional and non-professional actors (typical of the Kazan director) fill the remaining spaces. Elia Kazan directs, Joe MacDonald's film (he would later work again with Richard Widmark in the "Pickup on South Street" of 1953) and the great Alfred Newman marks it. Almost all the people involved here have done a better job, "Panic in the Streets" is still a rewarding watch. Especially for the film noir enthusiast.
