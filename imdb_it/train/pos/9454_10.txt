In what is indisputably the best outdoor adventure film of all time, four city boys face the wrath of nature, in a story of survival. The setting is Georgia backwoods, with forests, mountains and wild rivers. <br /> <br /> The director, John Boorman, has chosen to use local characters, not actors, to portray secondary characters. These locals give the film a depth of characterization unmatched in the history of cinema. No central casting "actor" could ever come close to the faces, voices or actions of these people. I don't remember a movie where the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. More than anything else, it is this gritty realism that makes this film so extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Another strong point is the film's theme. Nature, in nature, can be violent. How appropriate it is that the setting is South American. Very few places in the United States are as violent as the land of rednecks. In a story about the Darwinian survival of the fittest, the film conveys the idea that human beings are part of nature, not separated from it. <br /> <br /> "Deliverance" is very much a product of his time when, unlike today, Americans expressed concern about wild desolation. The magnificent scenery of the film, the sounds of birds, frogs, crickets and the roar of the river rapids, together with the absence of civilization, all convey an environmental message. And this is another strength of the film. <br /> <br /> In terms of entertainment, the tension gradually intensifies as the plot progresses. Not even in the middle of the film does the tension become extreme, and therefore never let go of it, until the credits arrive. Very few films can sustain that level of intensity over such a long arc of plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, the technical quality of the film is top notch. Direction and assembly are impeccable. Cinematography is excellent. The dialogue is interesting. And the acting is fantastic. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Ned Beatty is perfectly chosen and does a good job. And Jon Voight should have been nominated for an Oscar. If there is a weak link in the film, it is the music, which seems shy to me. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Deliverance" will almost certainly appeal to spectators who enjoy outdoor adventures. Even for those who do not, the gritty interpretations, the acting and the tension of the plot are sufficient reasons to watch this film, one of the best in the history of cinema.
