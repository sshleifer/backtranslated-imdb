I'm 60 years old, I'm a guitarist, (lead / rhythm), and in the last forty years, I've been in four groups, it's all there, the fights, the disorders, the rotten food, the worst arrangement, always on the road, not much or no money, and everyone was drunk or high. But the clubs, the fans and the music have been worth it! Just like Strange Fruit! I'm too damn old for this now, and arthritis in my hands and hips doesn't mean swinging anymore, but for the duration of that video, everything is back, and it was all there! Birds, fights and alcohol! And I was young again! It's just like Billy Connolly's voice, God likes the things of the 70s! Rock On Forever!
