This is perhaps the best rockumentary of all time: a Brit, the better this is Spinal Tap. The characters are believable, the plot is fantastic and you can really empathize with some of the events - like Ray's problem with editing in the band. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is excellent. Really vintage things, even if it's in the same key, you'll hum some songs for days. What I liked was the almost British cast, with some of the favorite names of the families. Ray's wife is priceless ... <br /> <br /> The film never drags on, it just goes to the right rhythm and contains some really fun sections. A generator of some very beautiful sentences! <br /> <br /> It is a hidden diamond.
