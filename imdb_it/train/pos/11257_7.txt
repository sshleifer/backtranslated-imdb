The erotic cinema of the 70s has been tamed compared to the triple X romp of today, which is positive. Because there's a good story about rituals and nude sex scenes. Sure, I wish they had some vampire effects that they had over time and the sex got in the way of the story a little. Furthermore, some of the accents were difficult to understand in time periods, but it is worth looking at the new version and then the modified version which is called THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING. But if you don't care about the allocation of naked women who dance and have sex, then this is not the right movie for you. Anyway, I liked it and give it to him ... 7 STARS.
