A talking parrot is not an extremely imaginative idea for a new film, but Paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant and moving film that will delight the whole family. He manages to bridge the gap between sentimental garbage and raw hardness during the separation of Marie and Paulie, and all the events of the film lead to an extremely satisfying emotional conclusion. The training of animals is well done - everyone will be hit when Paulie spreads his wings and flies for the first time. Paulie is a great character and should have achieved much more success, although this film was not a highlight of 1998, unlike Saving Private Ryan. This hour and a half will certainly be pleasant and unforgettable. Paulie's story is moving, sad, happy and interesting - from the moment he was first seen when he joined his original owner, you'll have fun following him and watching him study friendship and sad reality of life along the way. Not one not to be missed if you have some kind of heart or emotion. 9/10
