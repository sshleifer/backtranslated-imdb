Zane and Beringer will keep you at the edge of your seats. I don't usually go for military / war movies, but it was worth it for me. <br /> <br /> He was serious, but he was fun too. The character of Beringer proved to be heroic and honest. No matter what, you know he turned his back on you. <br /> <br /> The character of Zane developed throughout the film. It wasn't just a suit, he definitely proved that he could be a hero and run a gun. <br /> <br /> The ending through me a little though. It didn't really go with the action throughout the film, but I'm glad I saw it, anyway. <br /> <br /> It's worth a try.
