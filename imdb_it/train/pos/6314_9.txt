I went to the cinema with two of my friends and I chose this film out of the choir, not really knowing what to expect. And it turns into a very fun experience, to die for laugh! It's an excellent film with a very unexpected story, very good dialogues and crazy humor. All the characters are obviously made in "Alan Ford" style (Italian satirical comedian), but this didn't bother me for a second. In fact, this kind of loser line up has made a movie quite unique and interesting. Sam Rockwell gave a very good and convincing role, even Willian Macy, Clooney is hardly recognizable and brilliant. But the real star is actually Guzman. He played a role in his life in this movie! The scene where his character Cosimo dies in the film is so funny that it made me choke and almost die with him! Highly recommended for all "Alan Ford" fans!
