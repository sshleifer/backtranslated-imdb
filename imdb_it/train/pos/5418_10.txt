Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McLaglen are three soldiers in nineteenth-century India who, with the help of an aquatic boy (Sam Jaffe) free the area of ​​Thuggee's murderous cult. The chemistry between the actors helps make this one of the most entertaining movies of all time. Sam Jaffe is exceptional as the outlaw water boy who is abused by everyone and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company. Freely inspired by the poem by Rudyard Kipling. Absolutely to see who enjoys this type of film.
