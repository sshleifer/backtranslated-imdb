One of the best (if not the best) screenings of Stephen King. Dark as darkness can be, surprising non-Hollywood end, terrifying atmosphere, extraordinary adaptation of the book, exceptional cast, educational (don't play with the afterlife), in short - all that an excellent horror should be ... <br / > <br /> My favorite horror movie, straight 10+.
