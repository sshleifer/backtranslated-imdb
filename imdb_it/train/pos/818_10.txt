Return of the Jedi is certainly the most action packed in the series and is a nice conclusion to the Star Wars saga. With Han Solo imprisoned by Jabba the Hut and the Empire building a new Death Star, the rebel alliance is facing a tough fight against the dark side, and only our favorite heroes can make it. <br /> <br /> The Opening sequence, set on Tatooine, we see Jabba's palace, a slavery and scum pit, and Han Solo's new home, while Luke and the gang prepare for his rescue, and with Luke's Jedi powers have the advantage. <br /> <br /> We also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end. Han, Leia and Chewy fight on Endor, in a desperate attempt to deactivate the shields that protect the Death Star. The Rebel Fleet led by Lando, fights with the Imperial Fleet while they wait for shields to burst, and Luke has a final showdown with Darth Vader. An epic end to a classic saga, and it's just the rhythm of the first two. <br /> <br /> 10/10
