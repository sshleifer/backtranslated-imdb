There has never been anything like that, that's for sure. This seemingly redundant trilogy really makes sense as a whole, and as such is not a film about the transverse sensation of Groovin 'Gary, Utah. It's a very conscious film about how the REACTS director to Groovin 'Gary. For Harris the whole project is clearly an extensive and spectacular twist of guilt and repentance. He is trying to atone for his sins - yes, Gary attempted suicide after the initial document was transmitted - through corrections, comments and conventions, claiming the Hollywood narrative banner as the best friend and provocative happy ending (two different, with a significant adjustment in the Glover version) and transforming them into personal uses. So, while at a thematic level it remains a film about the genre and the difference, the structure ensures that it is also a MOVIES film - but with an almost unprecedented level of complexity. There is so much to do; in telling and re-telling this story, Harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row, and doesn't miss the chance to do something about it. Immensely moving, and as deep as the field.
