After watching the TV series of the Next Action Star, I was glad to see the winners' film right away. I was wary of such a showcase of new talent, but I was pleasantly surprised and enthusiastic. Billy Zane, of course, was his usual big self, but Corinne and Sean stood by their side. It was also nice to see Jared and Jeanne (also in the competition) in their cameo roles. Sean's character, not Billy's, is the prey, and his frustration at discovering new rules in the game is well played. Corinne walks well on the razor's edge between her favorite Sean character and the fact of being there just for the money. I liked how the game was played until the last second. And then beyond! It's not a great movie, but it's fun all the time and a big window for two people on their first exit from the gate.
