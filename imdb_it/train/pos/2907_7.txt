In conceiving a splendid film, investigating the tensions that occur in family life in the idyllic setting of Galiano Island off the coast of British Columbia, the "Lotus eaters" is ruined by the fact that it was packaged as a film for the TV, decreasing itself with the addition of chirping music on potentially powerful scenes, as if preparing for the interruption of the commercials. Such a pity.
