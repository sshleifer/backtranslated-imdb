In a nutshell, Oliver! is one of the greatest musicals of all time. It's full of memorable songs - "Food Glorious Food", "Oliver!", "Consider yourself" and "Oom-Pah-Pah" to name just a few - and equally memorable characters. <br /> <br /> film is a musical adaptation of the classic novel by Charles Dickens and very similar to the story of Oliver Twist himself, it is a perfect film for the family. There are some terrifying moments - the evil Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed is pretty scary on his own - but overall, the film is aimed at children of all ages and adults. <br /> <br /> History - almost everyone is now familiar with this - revolves around an orphan named Oliver and his life growing up in London. At first he lives in the workhouse with the other orphans, but after daring to question Mr. Bumble, the overseer, he is sold to a family as a servant. <br /> <br /> After a series of misadventures and close shaving, he meets the Artful Dodger - superbly played by a young Jack Wild, who gives his all in the role - and through him, the greedy Fagin (Ron Moody), who trains young boys to collect pocket treasures he keeps for himself. <br /> <br /> The film was shot exclusively in the studios and stages of Shepperton Film Studios, but this does not translate into the film at all. The sets perfectly reproduce Victorian London, as well as the costumes worn by the characters. A multi-Oscar winner and a huge success in his release, Oliver! he is a worthy contender for the best musical ever and will delight anyone who loves cinema.
