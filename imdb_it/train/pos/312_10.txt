Based on a true story, this series is a gem of its kind. The slave who becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village. <br /> <br /> In the diamond mining town of Tijuco, Brazil, the diamond commander - appointed by the king of Portugal - is the supreme authority. Having grown up in the relative safety of her home, the beautiful young Xica da Silva finds her world threatened when she decides to sell her to a brothel in the city, refusing to recognize that a black slave could be her daughter. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Xica steals the diamonds collected by the diamond commander for the king, with the intention of using them to escape. The king's army arrives to collect the diamonds the next day, however, and when the loot fails, the diamond commander is taken away in chains, his family is expropriated and thrown into the street with only his clothes on shoulders. Martin, the son of the diamond commander, swears revenge. Xica and the other slaves, however, are sold at auction, and Xica ends up in the house of the sergeant major, an old man who bought her just to satiate his lust. In the city of Tijuco, instead, comes the new diamond commander, the elegant and ruthless Joao Fernandes. Immediately struck by the beauty of Xica, he manipulates the sergeant major in selling it to him. Thus began a love story full of dangers, intrigues and passions, between an obstinate nobleman and an astute slave who becomes the queen one day. <br /> <br /> The series is rich in rich details of the era beliefs, superstitions, politics, fashion, etc. etc. And it really manages to fascinate your attention for every minute. Sometimes funny with a sarcastic and dark humor, full of suspense and unexpected twists. "Xica da Silva" is definitely a must. I wish I could buy the whole series on DVD.
