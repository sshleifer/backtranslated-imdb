Jammin 'the Blues is an Oscar nominated short film since 1944 that is basically 10 minutes of improvised jazz played in a long jam. Marie Bryant sings "The Sunny Side of the Street" at some point for the film's highlight and then the jitterbugs with Archie Savage to bring this more fun "jam session" to its exciting end. The director Gojn Mili was a photographer and that experience shows in some of the double exposure shots of some of the musicians that make this one of the most innovative corners of the 40s. According to some notes, I read that one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in silhouette, reflecting the social attitudes of the time. What a pity. However, this most unusual film of the era is available on YouTube, so if you love jazz, I suggest you look for it out there.
