I haven't seen such a beautiful animated film for a long time. Having a healthy respect for Pixar, I must say that Ratatouille or any other film produced by them cannot be compared to this. The animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here. The graphics are amazing, the setting of the background is amazing, almost every object in every frame is perfectly designed. Sometimes I felt chills on my spine - so much I liked what I saw. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely romantic. Romantic as the plot of the animated film can be. The characters are adorable, especially Hector, the blue rabbit, he owns, pawns, stones and rules! The other characters are also very nice. Humor is of a high standard. <br /> <br /> In general it seemed that the creators did not invest much effort in this. I mean, it seems like it didn't take long, unlike the people of Pixar and Dreamworks who try to think of something new every time. And I am very happy that a product from the European animation studio was so extraordinary. They made a magnificent and moving film, a candy for eyes and heart. <br /> <br /> The only negative sign is the stupid beginning and that's why it's 9of10 not 10/10
