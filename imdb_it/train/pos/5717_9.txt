Omigosh, this is the scariest movie I've ever seen. To say that I love horror movies would be an understatement, and I've seen heaps (considering the limited availability in New Zealand, it's a lot), but never before have I had to sleep with the light on ... until I saw The Grudge. <br /> <br /> Some might say that it is a rip-off of The Ring (both based on Japanese horror films), both stories of similar (but different) stories, but Grudge holds its own as a terrifying film - seeing in the cinema , I even screamed at one point in the film. <br /> <br /> The acting is great, particularly from the supporting characters - KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, so is an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a real hottie, and William Mapother seems to be enjoying himself. However, while I'm usually a Clea DuVall fan, it doesn't really look like this movie. Among the supporting characters, her probably has the most profound and retrospective, but she doesn't seem to be all there. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, well, she's more or less the same in all her films and roles, isn't she? The ghosts were really scary, the music and the sound effects were chilling (in particular the noise that was emitted when KaDee Strickland's character answered the phone in his apartment), even the ending was nice. <br /> <br /> Super highly recommended. 9/10
