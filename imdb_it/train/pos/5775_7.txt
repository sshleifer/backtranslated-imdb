Come on, look at the title! LOL! I remember seeing this movie on Saturday Late Night Creature Features years ago. It's a fantastic, monstrous monster effect with an exhilarating acting and two incredible hillbillies that add to the schlock factor. The 2 boat charterers on the redneck are the movie! LOL, and you'll love the boat scene where the English boy and his wife talk about all the stars and it's sunny and noon. Damn hilarious !!! You can say that they didn't care about the plot, they just wanted to blow through the movie as quickly as possible. In conclusion, you'll like it if you love the 70s.
