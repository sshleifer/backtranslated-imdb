A good film with strong performances (in particular the two protagonists). The film is about two American girls caught with 6-pound heroin at an airport in Thailand. They are both thrown into prison and one of them signs a confession. Bill Pullman interprets the lawyer trying to get them out. All they have to do is find a Nick Parks who puts narcotics in one of the two girls' bags. So far for the story that is not so original (it has many similarities with the best Return to Paradise). <br /> <br /> The beautiful acting photography and Newton Thomas Sigel makes this film worthy of attention. A 7 out of 10.
