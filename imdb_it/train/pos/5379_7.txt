There is a lot to do in The College Girl Murders. A mad scientist creates an almost undetectable poison gas. Before he can reap the fruits of his discovery, the scientist is killed by a hooded monk with a whip. After a co-ed was killed in a church by gas, Scotland Yard is called to investigate, but the killing continues. Who can stop this crazy killer who seems to be able to come and go at will in and out of college? <br /> <br /> What works: <br /> <br /> - The Killer. What's wrong with a killer who sneaks on wearing a bright red KKK suit, complete with red gloves. The white whisk that transports and uses effectively stands out well against the bright red dress. Although the idea of ​​a killer in a flaming red, a pointy bird-like dress surrounding a girl's school is rather far-fetched, it is one of the most sinister-looking costumes I've seen. <br /> <br /> - Groovy 60s Music. I would really like to find the title music on The College Girl Murders. It has a jazzy, trendy and 60s atmosphere that I loved. <br /> <br /> - Strange touches. In addition to the red dress and the killer hood, the film features a sliding fireplace, an alligator well with a cage that passes over its head, bibles sprayed with poison, a strategically placed dummy, miniskirts, evening boots and hair tall miles. I would describe it as a cross between the 1960s Batman TV show and an Italian thriller. The College Girl Murders is a real treat for the eyes. <br /> <br /> - The End. Let's just say there are more twists on a mountain road. Just when you think the killer was discovered, here comes a twist? .. and another ??. And another ?? and another. <br /> <br /> What doesn't work: <br /> <br /> - Chief Inspector Sir John. I know the boy had to be a comic relief, but his funny character has too much time for the screen. <br /> <br /> - Why have alligators? Previously, I mentioned the alligators in the pit. And while they are a nice touch, they serve very little purpose. Why go through all the problems and not use them? <br /> <br /> - Plodding Plot. Some of The College Girl Murders have no rhythm or rhythm. There are too many moments during the film when things are inexplicably interrupted abruptly. A better rhythm would have made this movie a lot more fun. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen many of these German krimis, but of the few I've seen (Phantom of Soho, Strangler of Blackmoor Castle, Dead Eyes of London) this could be my favorite. This has a really funky look where I really go. If the plot had improved a little better, I could easily have given The College Girl Murders a 7/10.
