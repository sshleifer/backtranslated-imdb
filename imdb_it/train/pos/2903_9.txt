Tiempo de valientes is a very entertaining action comedy. After his great fist film called El fondo del mar and the spectacular television show Los simuladores, Damian Szifron has done another great job. Hollywood film. Diego Peretti and Luis Luque are two great actors and they have great shows here. The film is very funny and fun and has some great moments. Time de valientes is a very funny action comedy that I absolutely recommend if you want to have a great time. And I have to congratulate Szifron on all the talent he has. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9
