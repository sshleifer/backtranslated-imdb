A great movie, rather challenging than really funny. Unfortunately, there are no memorable quotes here, but this is my favorite: Alexandre: If you leave someone you loved, you have to say what I'm telling you now: "Goodbye, I'm going." But disappearing, hiding like a criminal is ignoble. (I didn't look at it with English subtitles) <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this expresses everything. There is a lot of tactics involved in the relationship between Alexandre and the others, yet everyone craves a little more. However, knowing the truth can hurt even more, as Alexandre proves. A common interpretation is that the film criticizes the mere possibility of "liberated love" describing the undesired implications on the people involved. In fact, this is demonstrated convincingly, but I would appreciate it if the reasons had been dealt with in a more in-depth manner: it is not that liberated love is in itself destined to failure, but people (especially men, I think) should work on themselves and try to overcome the dominant morality first and not through the practice of liberated love. <br /> <br /> That said, the film is realistic and really worth watching.
