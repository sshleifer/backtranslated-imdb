Ghost Train is a refined and entertaining film, typical of the best English chillers of the 1930s and the 40s. The antics of comedian Arthur Askey are not as funny as they once were, but this can be overcome by seeing it as a period piece or a curiosity. <br /> <br /> For a low-cost wartime production, Ghost Train is atmospheric, effective and provides real suspense. Great fun for a dark (and yes, stormy) night. Light up, take off the critic's hat and have fun.
