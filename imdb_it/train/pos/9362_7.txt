Greetings still from the darkness. How rare it is for a film to examine the lost soul of men in pain. Adam Sandler plays Charlie, a man who lost his family in the September 11 tragedy, and has since lost his career, his reason for living and, arguably, his sanity. Don Cheadle is the co-star of Sandler's former Dental School roommate who seems to have the perfect life (which apparently had Sandler before 9/11). Of course the parallels in these men's lives are obvious, but it's refreshing to see the feelings of men exposed in a film ... feelings other than lust and revenge, that is. Seeing how they actually help each other by simply being there is painful and felt. Writer / director Mike Binder ("The Upside of Anger", and Sandler's accountant in this film) gives the film a different look and feel. Some scenes do not work as well as others, but overall they are well written and well directed. <br /> <br /> Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent. Sandler's character is somewhat reminiscent of his beautiful performance in "Punch Drunk Love", but here brings much more depth. Cheadle always goes well and does a good job of expressing the weight he carries ... just watching him work a puzzle. <br /> <br /> The support work is excellent of Jada Pinkett Smith (as Cheadle's wife), Liv Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Burrows (in a strangely attractive role), Donald Sutherland as an irritated judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Sandler's in-laws. <br /> <br /> The film really touches how the tragic events of that day hit a man so deeply as to be fundamentally ruined. Besides the interesting story and some fantastic shots of New York, you have to love any movie that includes voices of Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Eddie Vedder who plays Daltrey. It is not exactly an optimistic film, but it is a quality film with an unusual story.
