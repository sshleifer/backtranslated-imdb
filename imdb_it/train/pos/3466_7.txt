this was a real sense of guilt ... I saw the trailer and all the commercials, so I thought 'why not take a look at this VH1 movie?' and, as was said in the t.v., "I can't believe I looked at it all!" quinn and harris were believable boys beatles and, although the accents were a bit exaggerated and difficult to decipher at times, I found the dialogue credible as well. the film touched the tenuous relationship of len / mc and showed how, after all, they were simply two boys who grew up together and shared a passion for music - reaching this, however, with different groups of problems and personal needs. you find yourself wanting to get into the taxi to make an impromptu meeting that would have knocked down the stockings of the world, but you also appreciated more why they didn't do it
