I chose to see this film the day it was opened nationally in France, as a personal way for me to reflect on what had happened a year before; the collection works as expected: it provokes a vortex of thoughts and emotions, working as an intellectual homage, without ever bending to economic sentimentality or an instinctive reactionary. <br /> <br /> There have been many accusations made that the film is anti-American: while I cannot speak for everyone in this sense, I am an American who has found such statements completely false. people make a lot of noise in the Egyptian segment, by Chahine, because it expresses the perspective of the Palestinian suicide bombers by stating that civilians in a democracy are "just targets" because they elect the governments that the bombers are trying to attack, but this ignores much more: different points of view are discussed, nobody is considered true, and the critics - if they have seen the piece - seem to forget the affection and the warm dialogue that takes place between the director and the ghost of the American dialogue, and the intense sadness of the director to hear the tragedy. <br /> <br /> practically all the films are beautiful, thoughtful and stimulating, in particular the brilliant work of Mahkmalbaf, Tanovic, Loach & Inarritu. Nair, as usual, effectively tells a true story of an injustice committed against a Muslim family in the wake of the anti-Islam hysteria that swept - and continues to sweep - the states. I found Gitai's piece a bit vulgarly strong and simple in his critique of media hysteria in the face of terrorism, and Penn's piece was too impressionistic and elliptical for my taste, although I expected it to please me. Borgnine is very good and brave. SPOILER NOTICE: a reviewer below has mistakenly read the fall of the towers as a happy moment for the character; my reading is rather that the fall of the towers is what, since the light floods his room, yields to the loss of his life that he refused to recognize. again this is a kind of impressionistic piece, because we know that if the towers would really block the light of this man's apartment, then there would be nothing but smoke and ash, not light, flooding his window.
