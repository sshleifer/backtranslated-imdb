This movie is fun to watch. If you liked "Dave" with Kevin Klein, you will like it very much. He thinks that "Dave" has become South American while Dreyfus plays Jack Noah, an actor in the works, who was selected by the head of the island nation of the Parador secret police, to replace the hard drunk of a dictator, Alfonse Simms, after he had a heart attack and died. Noah bumbles along, aided in his role by the dictator's lover, as they attempt to thwart Raul Julia's plans. Jonathan Winters also makes his appearance as a friendly American emigrant who turns out to be the CIA. Also played by Polly Holiday and Fernando Rey. <br /> <br /> There are some absurd moments like the body of the old dictator to freeze for a year, and the final scene, where Sonia Braga, who rocked Dreyfus's bleeding body, is seen moments later in a pristine white, with a stain on her. But all in all it's a nice romp.
