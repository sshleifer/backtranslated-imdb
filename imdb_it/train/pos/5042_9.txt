The synopsis of this film does a great job explaining what to expect. It's a great thriller. Well shot Hard to believe it was Bill Paxton's directorial debut, although some shots seem EXACTLY like a storyboard version. <br /> <br /> Again, there are some shots that look really beautiful and show some imagination on Paxton's part. <br /> <br /> It's a solid story with some great twists at the end, many of which, all believable, all fun and, above all, obscured well enough to make them real twists. <br /> <br /> Even the child actors in the film are very successful. I'm usually wary of movies with children in the main roles, because all too often they go out while Nickelodeon refuses, but both these guys do a good job. <br /> <br /> This film is not gory. It's not very scary. But it is very, very disturbing.
