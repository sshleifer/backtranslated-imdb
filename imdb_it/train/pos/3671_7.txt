"Hollywood North" is a euphemism of the film industry going to Canada to make films because of tax breaks and lower costs in a civilized city like Toronto, in this case, later in Vancouver. Peter O'Brian, the director, has probably seen many Californian invaders that this film seems to be the right way to deal with incoming personalities trying to capitalize on the economy that Canada has presented. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, "Moon Lantern", the successful novel written by a Canadian author is transformed into "Flight to Bogota", which has nothing to do with the original film. A great selfish Michael Baytes, obsessed with what is happening in Iran, is offered as the main part, which becomes a disaster. <br /> <br /> The film seems to say that too many cooks have spoiled the broth, which seems to be the case with the final product, which is saved by its producer, Bobby Myers. With the help of Sandy Ryan, who shot a documentary about the Toronto film, some parts of the film are finally turned into a cohesive film. <br /> <br /> The process of shooting is exhilarating, and acting is generally good.
