Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mediocre male colleagues. <br /> <br /> When they suggest that he needs an assistant it seems like the final insult, but when the first appellant is ex-Paul (Vincent Cassel) she takes the opportunity to change her life. <br /> <br /> Carla covers her mistakes and he, anxious to go straight, reluctantly helps her to get revenge on her colleagues. <br /> <br /> When Paul asks Carla to return the favor, he finds himself dragged into the criminal underworld, ruled by the ruthless lone shark Marchand (Olivier Gourmet). <br /> <br /> Recognizing his ability to read like a weapon, no one will. The two have decided to see justice. <br /> <br /> Jacques Audiard's third feature film "Read My Lips" is a piece that challenged the genre, moving from dark social comedy to full-throttle visceral thriller.
