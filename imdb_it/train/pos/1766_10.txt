I had a free pass for a preview of this movie last night and I didn't know what to expect. The premise seemed silly to me and I thought it would be a superficial and funny humor. What a surprise. I laughed so hard that I cried for a few lines. This film is a must see for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor. OK ..... this is not a movie to go with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or small children. The language is dirty, the lines are (very) rough and the sexual discourse is as graphic as you will find it everywhere. What is surprising, however, is that the film is still a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I both fell in love. Steve Carell is great, but (like The Office) the supporting cast really does make the movie work. All the characters have their flaws, but they also have depth and sympathy. Everyone pulls his weight and chemistry is perfect. I can't wait to get the DVD. I'm sure it will be up there with Office Space for replays and quotable lines.
