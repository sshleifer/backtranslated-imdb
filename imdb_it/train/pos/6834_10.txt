Let's get straight to the point: this is the film I would like to take with me to a desert island (with a DVD player). It's just perfect. If a reason you see a movie is that you like actors, you like to see them free to get involved in space and feelings, this movie is for you. Watch the scene when Myrtle (Rowlands) arrives on stage drunk and Maurice (Cassavetes) has to improvise because he no longer follows the script. If you are sensitive to the camera's movements, you will be fascinated by the way the camera moves on the stage, the particular flow that the camera gives you, follows the actors as if guided by the theatrical principle of "private space" ". .. Amazing. And the story is just a brilliant mix of narrative and realistic drama. Cassavetes is again discussing with Hollywood and the politics of the majors, but this time, he does it through Broadway, making one of the most exciting movies in the theater. , this film is a bliss.
