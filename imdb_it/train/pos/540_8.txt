actually ... that "camera" effect, this is it, it's a pretty good effect .. (you don't know much about directing a movie, do you?), this movie is actually BETTER than the original, it's very fun to watch, made for TV, it doesn't need to follow any rules. I find it difficult to look at the number 1 because of how it kills the first girl, it's disturbing. and for as long as we are driving for Judd Nelson to get away with it, we as spectators are on his side. I hope that one day we will see a third cabin on the lake, but I doubt it. Watching this film, you can understand how real films are made, because it's a bit like a movie in a movie. Judd is one of the scariest villains of all time, and he is more realistic, not only belittles people as senseless as in other horrors.
