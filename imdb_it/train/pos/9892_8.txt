This film is a kindness. <br /> <br /> A group of people trapped in an abandoned school. They start to be killed, they know they are being followed, so what do they do? One girl decides to take a bath, another decides to betray her husband (who is also there) with an old boyfriend so as to somehow find a bed (in an abandoned old school?) And go and do it. <br /> <br /> And it comes through the gore and the T & A. <br /> <br /> And it's also interesting from a historical / sociological point of view. Where the usual 80s slasher is a reflection of how we see ourselves, or how adults see young people, or how Hollywood sees the rest of the country, this has a unique perspective. This is an English film made to be an American slasher. It is fun to see how often British actors trying to speak "American" unwittingly enter the accents of the United Kingdom. <br /> <br /> If you like the 80s steamers (like the pieces), you'll like it.
