This film is based on the art of Frank Frazetta, the legendary fantasy illustrator. Some characters have come straight out of his paintings (the Death Dealer is the best example). Surprisingly, the animation manages to keep the feel of the original art. Bakshi is well known for his massive use of the rotoscope (the technique of tracing a sequence of live actions) and this film is no exception. However, since the subject of the film is quite realistic (all the characters are human), it works quite well. <br /> <br /> But what I really like here is the plot: for once we have a story with interesting characters and beautiful action sequences, a really horrible villain and a beautiful girl. This film has the feel of the best Conan comics, not surprisingly since Roy Thomas is the Marvel series writer of our favorite Cimmerian! This is far from the absurd Conan live action, not to mention all the B-movies of the genre. <br /> <br /> Definitely recommended!
