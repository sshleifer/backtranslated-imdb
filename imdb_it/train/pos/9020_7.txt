Theory Of Flight is an engaging study of the character of an artist (Branagh) eager to get rid of boredom and mediocrity, and a terminally ill (Bonham-Carter) in the final stages of the ASL, confined to a wheelchair, who wishes to do love for a man before he died. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham-Carter emanates wit, challenge and independence as an ASL patient who is practically dependent on the people around her to take care of her. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh, condemned through community service to take part in caring for her, complements Helena's charm with sad melancholy, creating a sentimental and compelling love story in which two people try to helping each other find the path to happiness, before time runs out.
