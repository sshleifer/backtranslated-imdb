Compelling and compelling story of the boycott of the captured American army that must prove its innocence to avoid the executioner. Paul Ryker dodges friendly fire in an attempt apparently intended to convince a military court that he was actually a US spy on a secret mission in Korea. <br /> <br /> In the vein of classic court dramas, "Sergeant Ryker" is an extremely well done mystery, skilfully driven by an exceptional cast, director Kulik's constant momentum, and effective twists. <br /> <br /> This film was originally made as a television movie in 1964, and subsequently reinforced for this review with the presence of many "named" actors and some action sequences. Dillman, taking up his role again, is apt as the questionable defense lawyer, whose sometimes vague attention to the personal situation of Ryker's supportive wife, though a little distant, played with ease with Vera Miles. Rounding out the front line is Peter Graves for the prosecution, and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton in key support roles. <br /> <br /> Marvin's interpretation of the character of Paul Ryker is a balanced representation of a simple but dedicated man, whose normal posture is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he is placed. Marvin passes perfectly from resigned indifference to passionate determination, giving a convincing, often intense performance that is the culminating point of this otherwise small-scale drama. It is this performance that should elevate the film to a platform in which it occupies a place on the list of the best court dramas. <br /> <br /> However, despite his apparent darkness, "Sergeant Ryker" still remains irresistible, like a book you can't put down. Highly recommended.
