The film never claims to be something spectacular like many movies do. The films are presented as a fun and entertaining time. And that's exactly what it was. It is the Korean version of a Bring It On male. <br /> <br /> From the beginning you can hear the rest of the film and how it will end, but the fun isn't in surprises and it's not the way the film is a carbon copy of another. Instead, the fun takes place in the journey of how the two remaining "hooligans" became full-fledged men. Therefore, the film is fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera, especially the dolly moves, was done very well. The script, being a bit weak, was overly funny that the characters weren't two-dimensional but full of life and desire. This film will not win any Oscars, nor any DVD sales, but a fun watch and a fun experience.
