Saturday 3 June, 6.30pm The Neptune <br /> <br /> Monday 5 June, 4.30pm The Neptune <br /> <br /> Few celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity have been as successful as the brilliant interpretation by Carlos Saura of Isaac Albeniz's masterpiece, Iberia Suite. As his centenary approaches, Saura has brought together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the Spanish performing arts community to create this love song par excellence in their homeland. The twelve "impressions" of the suite are presented without narration in harsh environments, allowing the power of each exhibition to explode in front of Saura's camera. The creative use of large apartments and mirrors, shifted throughout the set, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effects to the various selections of singing, dancing and instrumental performance. Albeniz's photographs reappear throughout the program, linking the passion of music to its great creator. Saura includes all the Spaniards on its stage from the beautiful elegance of old flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children who joyfully dance with their instructors.
