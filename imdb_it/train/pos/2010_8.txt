I thought this movie was pretty good. Some parts were trivial, but it is understandable since it was made over 55 years ago. I thought that the best interpretation of the film was given by Michele Morgan who played Millie convincingly. Jack Haley is also very good as Mike O'Brien. Although I'm not a big Frank Sinatra fan, I think he was very good at this movie. If you're in the mood for a stupid musical comedy, Higher and Higher is the movie for you. <br /> <br />
