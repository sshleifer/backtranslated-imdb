no, this should not be a brilliant high budget, but it is brilliant in itself. you have to watch it for what it is, a low budget masterpiece that involves a zombie rapist wielding a 12 inch love rod that keeps bumping. those who came to give this film a low review were probably looking for the next cult classic or "hidden gem" as they say and simply didn't get it. I like how everyone observes obvious observations like "the child of 5 cents attached to a fish pole" hahaha, well, yes. I don't think a film with a budget like this can afford "good" actors or effects, so they worked with what they had. the innards and innards were actually very convincing. the film was a bit discontinuous going from one sequence to another, but overall, this is one of the best films I've seen lately that doesn't follow any trend or predictability. very good for a laugh.
