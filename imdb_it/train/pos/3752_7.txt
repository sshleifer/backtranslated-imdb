This film is unusual and bizarre, and is almost unusual and bizarre in a very good way. I gave this short a 7 just because it's so unique and off-the-wall, but most of the time it seems bizarre just for the sake of being bizarre. If the film had managed to integrate its most bizarre moments into a semblance of plot, it would have been really fantastic. <br /> <br /> The main problem here is that it seems that the creators just mixed shit together on the spatulas, then threw a lot of other crap that seemed to sound fun from the mouth of a spatula. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth a try, but it is not the best from any lineage of wild fantasy creators.
