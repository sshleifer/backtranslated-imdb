I was one of many who expected to see a glorified dandy, danced by a Yankee, portraying a day that (as famous) should have lived in infamy rather than glory. How wrong I was. These guys were there, right in the middle, and the photos they returned are incredible and heartbreaking. Yet it all happened during a casual trip to the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> Two French filmmakers were compiling a documentary about the life of a New York fireman, particularly from the point of view of a young rookie arriving in the ranks. At the beginning we see a lot of this video, only to remind ourselves that there was no thought for the production of a film on terrorism. This was supposed to be a film about normal people who earn an honest life by helping others, and the beauty of the movie is that it never loses this advantage. <br /> <br /> While investigating a suspicious gas line (I think, my memory is a bit confused about this), suddenly we hear a plane flying overhead. The camera opens to reveal a commercial jet that sneaks into one of the towers. What must the cameraman have thought at the moment? Recognizing the importance of the movie in which the camera stays on, and perhaps realizing the same thing, the FDNY allows the camera to follow them in the building. <br /> <br /> What follows is a true vision from the front lines. We see the commitment of the FDNY, their reactions (the stunned silence after hearing that the first person to die is chilling) and the collapse of one of the buildings from the inside, while a second camera captures the events from the outside. <br /> <br /> Had it not been for the horrible event they were covering, only the film would have been the dream of every young docu-maker. Very simply, the movie deserves to be preserved forever. But what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity it brings to the viewer. We see firefighters charging themselves without hesitation, people of different races helping each other to escape the wave of rubble and also the concern of the directors for each other (they are brothers) because they cannot reach each other another in the confusion. There are wonderful things and incredible human stories in this film, something that Hollywood could never duplicate (even if it's trying). <br /> <br /> September 11 is not a film about politics. Nor is it a film about religion, nationality or even jihad for that matter. September 11 is a film about people and a true indication of the best and worst we are capable of. September 11th is simply one of the most important films I've ever seen and it would be the only film that will come out of this event if it depended on me. You can't duplicate it.
