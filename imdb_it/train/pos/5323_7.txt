There are a number of things that are not correct, although this is not too important since what happened to whom and when it is still under discussion. The most brazen freedom with the facts I think is when they start playing at Bruno Koschmidder's Kaiserkeller, when they actually played at Indra and moved later to the Kaiserkeller. I agree with Semprinni20 that the film was biased in favor of the Pete Best version, but if he is the history consultant, then I suppose you call the shots. I also agree with Semprinni that Pete Best's recordings say the last word on the reason for his dismissal. <br /> <br /> Although the film is not as sumptuous as the next film "Backbeat", I prefer this film because it is more accurate, and because it has a better script with a deeper characterization. <br /> <br /> In the film there is a lot of substance that is quite substantial - like Brian Epstein trying to hide the fact that he was "dumbfounded", only to find out that the band knew he was always gay. Little touches like the band entering a bar and ordering "Corn-Flakes mit Milch". My favorite scene, which has some basses, is where at an audition Stuart Sutcliffe has just bought his bass but can't play it, so he puts his back on the entrepreneur and tries to pretend, but he is captured. This is rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at.
