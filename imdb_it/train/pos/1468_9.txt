The person who wrote the review "is already enough to sweat and spit" has no idea what is cultural, literary or psychological. Ignore Zizek's interpretations because they don't seem "in line" with what the director had originally intended. So? The importance of a director's (or author's) intention is not important in critical theory. This is known as the "intentional intentionality" of the author and should be avoided. <br /> <br /> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_fallacy A text or film can be analyzed through a number of theories, many of which I disagree with each other , in addition to completely ignoring the author's intention. This is the most fundamental idea of ​​critical theory. <br /> <br /> For this reason, anyone who wrote that wall of text wasted a lot of time and effort to insult Zizek. In fact, anyone who studies the theory could immediately discredit this opinion of the boys (I suggest you do it too) since it is completely out of the question. <br /> <br /> Having said that ... If you are interested in everything that is Freudian, Laconia, or Kristevian's speech, this film is a must. Link these theories to popular films, making them much more palpable and pleasant than just reading or thinking about them.
