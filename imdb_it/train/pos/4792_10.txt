The Straight Story is a multilevel exploration of the goodness and beauty of America. At one level a slow walk through the heart, it is kind inhabitants and amber grain, to another level of aging and remembering what is important (and actively forgetting what is not). David Lynch gives us time in this film and helps me remember that we can say a lot with silence. An extraordinary film that will rest sweetly with me for some time to come.
