I'm going to keep this short enough not to spoil anything for you. This movie is fantastic. From beginning to end, it's full of genuine thrills. The fight scenes are fantastic, the hunting scenes are compelling and move at such a pace that in the end things only felt slow towards the end, but only because all that preceded it. Damon shines and has really proved to be a very solid actor, challenging you not to believe him in this role. He is this role. A welcome addition to the David Straithrain series (I hope I wrote it up close) as a CIA agent to kill Bourne. This is non stop and will really leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way. Some things towards the end are just an absurd smidgeon, thus denying a rating of 10. The ending is left open for sequels and I really hope they consider doing more, because no one has been bad. Great movie after all and a fantastic ending for a surprising trilogy. <br /> <br /> P.S. The shaky cam has not damaged any action, but I still think we could do without it. The good news is that you only notice it when people talk and not so much action.
