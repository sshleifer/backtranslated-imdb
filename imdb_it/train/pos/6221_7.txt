If this film had been put together a little better, it would have been up there with the best of Astaire and Rogers. As it is, it is a beautiful film but too long with a boring subplot, namely, Randolph Scott who traffics Rogers' sister, played by Harriet Hilliard (who is Ozzie Nelson's wife for you baby boomers). <br /> <br /> Astaire and Scott are two men of the Navy. Scott first met Hilliard when he looked like a stereotyped librarian, and later after Ginger Rogers asked his friend (a blonde but unmistakable Lucille Ball) to fascinate her. Meanwhile, Astaire tries to pick up where he and his old dance partner left off. The result is some wonderful dance numbers, with Astaire and Rogers both as a team and separately: "I'm putting all my eggs in one basket", "Let Yourself Go" and "I'd rather lead the band". Hilliard is sweet but a bit lethargic as a simple Jane turned the glamorous girl, even though she sings her two songs well, "But where are you?" and "Get You Behind Me, Satan" - a poster didn't care for that song, but I love the title. Rogers is lively, and Astaire is a young dynamo. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film comes to an end with "Let's do the music and dance", one of the most painfully beautiful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliantly performed by Rogers and Astaire. In it, they embody the charm and imagination of the 1930s. It is really to be appreciated and observed again and again.
