Obviously a film that has had a great influence not only on the genre of friends, but also on the kind of action. George Lucas had to be a fan of this movie as much of his Star Wars series looks like a tribute to Gunga Din. The characters that Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks play are only the precursors of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca. Sam Jaffe's Gunga Din also turned into C-3PO and R2-D2 and likes it or not: Jar Jar Binks. <br /> <br /> Today this film is seen as non-PC but there is a speech by Eduardo Ciannelli as Guru the leader of the Indian opposition to the British raj that could be echoed in the feelings of many today. <br /> <br /> For a boy this was a great film. Three strong male lines and just a touch of romance. There was a time when young boys thought of kissing the girl in the Saturday matinee movie. Not like today when the skin is welcomed with joy. Too late to complain about lost innocence. <br /> <br /> We hope that this film will not be forgotten and that some of those browsing the channel will stop at TCM and capture a movie with action, adventure and a cast of thousands instead of CGI actors.
