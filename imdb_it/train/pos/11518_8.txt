You can do a lot with a little money. Blair Witch proved it. This film supports it. It is no longer a sitcom in length and complexity. However, as he has John Cleese as Sherlock Holmes, he manages to be exhilarating even on a budget that cannot afford a minimum. The salient point of this film is Arthur Lowe in the shoes of the sincere and bizarre Watson, his darkness and slowness flies Cleese's wit. If you go through the movie, watch it for a bizarre laugh or two.
