I almost didn't go to see this movie because I remember that the penguin's march wasn't so exciting. I went mainly because Disney promised to plant a tree if I went to see it on the opening weekend, but after I saw it, it was just great; the fact that photographers can capture impossible images simply deserve your money. You can also see different habitats, different vegetation, animals and natural phenomena that not only shock you - simply because you would never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic - but also touch your souls and raise the question of humanity against the world , of how our lives have deviated from nature to such an extent that we take for granted the natural beauty and miracles that are the quintessence of our biosphere. You don't have to be a lover of the earth or an environmentalist who embraces the trees to appreciate the simple suggestion of this documentary. You simply have to be a curious soul that questions the value and the miracle of life. To enjoy!
