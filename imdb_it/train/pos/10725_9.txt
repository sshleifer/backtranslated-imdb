Space Camp is a pretty decent movie. The plot is predictable, but the actors do a good job, and the special effects are decent for the time. <br /> <br /> This film was originally published at the time of the shuttle disaster, and this really put an obstacle on how popular it was. <br /> <br /> The scene where the shuttle doors open into space is simply spectacular ... on the big screen, that is ... on a TV ... it just seems average. I remember this scene at the theater. It made you feel like you were really up there. <br /> <br /> This would be a good movie to watch on IMAX, but I'm sure it will never happen.
