I remember seeing "Gung Ho" as a child with my mother and wondering why he would always cry in the last few minutes. I obviously found the film hilarious, in particular the mannerisms of the characters. It wasn't until I was much older and I watched again that I realized how deeper this show is. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe shine in their roles as reluctant mediators. Keaton stops surprising me with his real lifestyle, and Watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix. I also thought that Patti Yasutake (Umeki) was simply fabulous in his role of comic relief. I think this film is one of the most undervalued films of the 80s. We can all learn a lesson from the fusion of American and Japanese workers in this film ... sometimes really * you can * have "the best of both worlds". And now I understand why my mother felt like her in those final moments. I'd rather have one of those machines, too.
