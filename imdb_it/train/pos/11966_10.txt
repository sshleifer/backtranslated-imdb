This is an excellent series. You will laugh, cry, these wonderful people will be part of your family. The way this family cares about each other and helps each other through the crisis is a great example of how we should live our lives. There are many good things they do, and a number of wrong choices, but they never turn their backs on the family, they work through problems. Michelle, the youngest daughter, is the cutest thing I've ever seen. Stephanie, the average daughter, suffers from the average child syndrome and with the help of EVERYONE in the family is better. DJ, the eldest daughter, is growing up if her father wants it to happen or not. One thing they all share is that their mother is missing. Danny (dad), Joey and Uncle Jesse love these kids so much, and it's evident in every episode.
