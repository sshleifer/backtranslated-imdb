A superb cast, please! <br /> <br /> If you can capture anything else written by Plater (or play in these wonderful actors). For those unfamiliar with Plater it has a real feeling for jazz, my recommendation is to see the Beiderbecke trilogy whenever you can. <br /> <br /> "There are three types of jazz: Hot, Cool and 'What time does it start?"
