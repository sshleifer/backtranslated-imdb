* !! - SPOILERS - !! * <br /> <br /> Before starting, let me say that I had both the advantages of watching this film on the big screen and seeing the "authorized version" of this film, redone by Stephen King, himself, in 1997. <br /> <br /> Both advantages have made me appreciate this version of "The Shining", even more. <br /> <br /> Also, let me say you read Mr. King's book, "The Shining" on many occasions over the years, and while I love the book and am a big fan of his work, the story of this story by Stanley Kubrick is much more compelling ... and SCARY. <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows how to transmit the terror of the psyche directly to the cinema. In the direction of the film E of writing the script, he himself acquired the title "Magus" beyond each question. Kubrick's genius is like magic. The world of cinema lost a great director when he died in 1999. Among his other outstanding credits: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; Mechanical orange, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many others. <br /> <br /> The Torrences (Jack, Wendy, his wife and Danny, their son) live in the Overlook Hotel for the winter; Jack was hired as a custodian. It is his job to supervise the maintenance of the hotel during the several months of hard snow, until the spring, when the Overlook reopens its doors. It seems that there are many rich and exhausted tourists who will pour into the mountains of Colorado for a summer holiday full of snow. <br /> <br /> The Hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging. He lent to the atmosphere, having a dark but at the same time "welcoming" atmosphere. The decor and furnishings were all from the period (late 70s - early 80s), and the filmography of the landscape that approaches the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant. Not only does it allow you to enjoy the Overlook approach, but it also fixes in your mind how desolate and isolated the Hotel is from the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the characters of Wendy and Danny was a stroke of genius. Get all the history of their past, "the imaginary friend" of Danny, Tony, and the story of Jack's alcoholism ended in this beautiful introductory scene. There was no need to extend the past to more than two hours of film; obviously, Kubrick saw it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Closing day. Once again, the overview takes the mountains up to the hotel (this time, with the family in tow), the interaction between Jack and Danny was exhilarating while also portraying a very disturbing exchange. <br /> <br /> The initial tour through the Overlook is truly breathtaking, even if the "personal" is moving things, you have the chance to see the majestic fireplaces, the high ceilings of the cathedral and the expensive furnishings, the sleepers and crown moldings in architecture. "They did a good job! Pink and gold are my favorite colors." (Wendy Torrence) The staff wing is also well designed and well built. <br /> <br /> The labyrinth was a magnificent touch, reminiscent of the Labyrinth in which the Minotaur of Crete was the Guardian. When Jack Nicholson is standing on the scale model of the maze and stares at the center, seeing Wendy and Danny enter, it is a magical moment; one that tells you right away, there are heavy energies in that house; there is something really wrong, which is already beginning. "I wouldn't want to go in there unless I had at least an hour to find the way out." (The hotel manager) <br /> <br /> Scatman Cruthers, like Dick Halloran, was genuine and open in his performance. His smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful. You could really believe that you were there at the hotel, going around the kitchen with Wendy and "Doc". His explanation of the "brilliant" to Danny was well presented, as was his conversation with the child about Tony and the Hotel. It was credible and sincere. <br /> <br /> The cutting and the panoramic scan of the hotel, with the mountains looming behind, the cold air that swirls, the fog rising from the warm roof of the snowy hotel, adds MUCH for the atmosphere of the film. It also indicates the point "halfway to hell", so to speak; the turning point in the film. <br /> <br /> The portrait of Wendy Torrence by Shelley Duvall was masterful. (So, WHAT if Olive Oyl also played?! Simply shows his wonderful diversity!) Honestly, before seeing the film on the big screen in 1980, I said, "What? Olive Oyl? * Lol * (Also Popeye was released in 1980 .) But I picked it up as soon as the film started. It's brilliant. According to Fiend's opinion, this is his best performance to date! (Even though I loved it in Steve Martin's "Roxanne", 1987). Br /> <br /> Once Kubrick has established the pearly information that you, the viewer, need to possess: the past of Torrence, Danny's broken arm, Tony, the story of the Hotel itself, the fact that Danny is not "mental", but rather clairvoyant, and the general disposition of the Hotel, which is obtained in the opening sequences 3, the film never ceases to scare you. <br /> <br /> The two daughters slaughtered by the previous custodian, Delbert Grady (the girls appeared several times to Danny, first through Tony n In the apartment before the family left for the hotel) they were icons with which Danny could identify and feared at the same time. They were haunting (and persecuted) themselves and showed Danny how and where they were killed, in a rather graphic and material way. <br /> <br /> Kubrick's Tony was written as an escort spirit, as a spiritual guide who acquired as a result of his arm almost torn away from his own father. He was ... "the little boy who lives in my mouth". He would show up at the end of Danny's finger and talk physically through Danny to talk to Danny. I do NOT like it in the book, I realize, in which Tony was intended by Stephen King as the projection of Danny as an older boy, trying to save his father. Kubrick omitted that little twist and somehow made it scarier when Tony "took ... Danny ... finished". The idea of ​​Danny's old self projecting his younger self is not ... scary. <br /> <br /> The scene of "Woman in the shower", made by Lia Beldan (on which I cannot find other credits for doing something before, or since then), as the younger woman and Billie Gibson (who also seems to suffer from a lack of credits for jobs before or after), was seductively hateful and completely disgusting. It was dramatic and scary. Aberrant and scary. When Nicholson looks at himself in the mirror and sees his decomposing flesh under his hands; the expression of pure terror on his face was so complete and REAL. <br /> <br /> Jack quickly embarks on his journey from "jonesing" alcohol to a certifiable mad person. The degradation of his character's mental state is carefully and accurately documented by Kubrick. Jack's immediate friendship with Lloyd the Barista (as only alcoholics, would-be mental patients and drug addicts do) paints his pressing NEED of the atmosphere that Lloyd uses; that is to say, the alcohol ... "the hair of the dog that bit me". (Jack Torrence) In the case of Jack, it is bourbon on the rocks, at no cost to Jack. "Orders from home". (Lloyd the Bartender) A nice word game. <br /> <br /> When Wendy finds Jack's "screenplay" it is nothing but a page after another of the same line typed over and over, even if in 8 or 9 different creative styles. .. when he asks from the shadows "How do you like it?" and Wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand ... it's so touching. It's the point where he realizes how messed up the whole situation is ... how messed up Jack is. It is very scary, dramatic and offers a strong presence. This, along with Danny's visions in the hotel lobby filled with blood, imposed on the scene between Jack and Wendy, and with the conflicting ending of this scene, make this perhaps the strongest scene in the film. <br /> <br /> "REDRUM" scene. Wow. What do I say? Which mother wouldn't have been totally crazy about waking up to find their troubled young son standing over them with a huge knife, talking with that strange voice, exclaiming "REDRUM" over and over? Even if it meant nothing, it would still be as scary as HELL's 7th level. It was something that everyone could (and have) remember (ed). Speaking of memorable scenes ... <br /> <br /> Nicholson's final assault on his family with an ax was perhaps one of the scariest scenes in film history. His advertising line, "Heeeeere's Johnny!" it was a stroke of genius and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. It also comes down in the history of horror movies. <br /> <br /> The ending ...? Kubrick's ending was perfection. I heard it ended beautifully. No smar, no blatant moans, no final tearfully idiotic for this film. Only epitomized perfection. This is all I will say on the subject of the finale. <br /> <br /> Who cares what has been eliminated?! Look what Kubrick IN has put. Rent it, look at it, BUY IT. It's a classic in the horror genre, and for good reason. RAWKS !! <br /> <br /> * Me being Me * ... Take this movie and insert it into your Stephen King collection, and take King's "Authorized" version of 1997 and place it in the kiddie section. Here's where it belongs. .: This movie marks a 9.98 from the Demon :.
