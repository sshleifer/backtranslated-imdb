I have always believed that David and Bathsheba were a film originally conceived for Tyrone Power at 20th Century Fox, although Gregory Peck is a good story about himself as King David, the monarch with a wandering eye. <br /> <br /> A lot of biblical arguments are covered in this film, adultery, redemption, sin, punishment and generally what God expects from his followers. <br /> <br /> When you are a king, even king in a biblically prophesied kingdom you surely have many perogi not open to the rest of us. King David has many wives, including a very bad one in Jayne Meadows who was Saul's daughter, David's predecessor. But his eyes see Bathsheba in his garden one evening. It turns out that she is unhappily married to Uriah the Hittite as David is to quite a few women. Uriah is one of David's army captains. David sends Bathsheba and he is the King, she runs to run because she too has had her eye on him. <br /> <br /> What happens, a relationship, a pregnancy and a death carefully organized for Uria in a battle. But an omniscient and conscious Deity has captured all this and is not only punishing David and Bathsheba, but the entire Kingdom of Israel is punished with drought, disease and pestilence. <br /> <br /> The sexist law of the day requires Bathsheba to have a death by stoning. David shows weakness in his previous actions, but here he approaches the plate and asks that everything be put on him. He even got his hands on the Ark of the Covenant which was an instant death, as seen in the film. <br /> <br /> My interpretation is that God admires courage even if you are wrong and lets go of David and forgives them both. Bathsheba becomes Solomon's mother and she and David are the ancestors of numerous successors in the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah until they are both conquered. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is a Bathsheba lust captured in a loveless marriage with Uriah played by Kieron Moore. The only thing that Moore can arouse is a good fight. I liked Kieron Moore's performance as a brave and rather stupid horse. <br /> <br /> No one can depose the law like Raymond Massey. His Nathan the Prophet is in line with the character of John Brown who played in two films, same intensity. <br /> <br /> So, when his own law demanded death, because God spared Bathsheba and kept David on the throne. Maybe it was the fact that he didn't want to train a third boy for work. He had already replaced Saul with David. <br /> <br /> But I think the Christian interpretation could be that this was a reference to the coming New Testament, that one could sin and receive mercy if one painfully requires it. I will leave the possibility of presenting interpretations to Bible scholars. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie and you could invent a completely new theory.
