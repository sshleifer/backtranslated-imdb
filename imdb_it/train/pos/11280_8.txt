A very interesting entertainment, with the charm of old movies. Tarzan faces the greatest dangers without hesitation if the moment demands it, and we all enjoy his success with him. The most interesting to me is a man without special powers who faces problems and only beats them with human abilities (he was a great swimmer and had a great scream)
