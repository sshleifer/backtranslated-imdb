OK. There are people who shouldn't see this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Don't see it if you don't like satire or black humor. 2) I don't like it if you got offended by The Guardians. 3) Don't see it if you want a serious superhero movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of you, run, don't walk, to see _Mystery Men_. It's funny, it's bizarre, it's a delightful passage to every bad superhero click known to man. Occasional incursions into youthful humor do not spoil the lowly ironic fun of Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller and Hank Azaria, as well as a couple of fun little parts of Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (It's also nice to see Louise Lasser working.) I laughed to the end. Absolutely not serious, rather strange, but good.
