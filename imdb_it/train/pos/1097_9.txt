I stopped giving "Mr. Blandings builds his dream house" 10/10 because of an aspect that makes us shudder a bit in the 21st century: the fact that a black man is a faithful servant (he reminds us of Stepin Fetchit). But apart from that, the film is a hoot. Portraying Jim (Cary Grant) of New York's middle class and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy) trying to build a house in Connecticut, this film has something for everyone. <br /> <br /> Grant is his usual flippant self, while Loy does quite well as just a wife. But Melvyn Douglas adds real laughter like Jim and Muriel's lawyer, Bill Cole, who seems to have more plans than he is clarifying. As for the house itself ... during most of the film, you will probably feel ambiguous whether or not you want to live there. Builders, contractors and others also provide their fair share of laughter. <br /> <br /> All in all, a classic of comedy. He also starred Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.
