this was one of the most moving films I've ever seen. I was about 12 when I looked at it for the first time and my eyes are glued to it whenever it's on TV. the acting and the plot are incredible. it seems so true for reality and touches so many controversial topics. I recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama.
