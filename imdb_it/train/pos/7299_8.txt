Very bad cast, terrible script full of holes, the hot blonde is eaten alive, The evil scientist has a seriously evil mustache, a man hires a trained gunslinger platoon and comes out victorious, terrible special effects, they solve the problem by blowing his head out of the monster ... Fantastic. The only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the murders. Haha. Good fun bored full of predictable twists and a ridiculous liners. I really enjoyed this movie, but before looking at it make sure you have a good laugh. I recommend this film to people who can watch a movie and not take it so seriously. I cannot, in my mind, think that this film was made for people to take it seriously. However, if you can watch it and sit and enjoy it, I really think you can enjoy this movie the way it should be enjoyed. Very simply. So grab some popcorn and a couple of beers and enjoy a fun night out with some friends and this movie. It brought a little joy into my life.
