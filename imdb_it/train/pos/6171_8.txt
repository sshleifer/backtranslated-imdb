For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly respected novel, this film will surely impress you, because of how honorable an adaptation is. With the exception of a minor subplot, the debut feature of Sturla Gunnarson is an almost definitive recreation of the book (up to the last line). <br /> <br /> For those of you who haven't read the novel, this movie could be a bit complicated. It is certainly not a great theatrical film story. Instead it has a strong element of realism, but I wouldn't do it in any other way. The best way to describe such a long journey for movie fans would be to say that it is a small-scale Hindu version of "Fiddler On The Roof". Instead of a Jewish / Russian milkman, the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970 in Bombay during the period of the war between Muslims and Hindi with Pakistan. He is forced to face a series of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his eldest son, a distant friend who involves him with some dirty money and an unhealthy neighborhood. The Ending is not happy, nor is it sad, but it is essentially what realism implies. <br /> <br /> This Long Journey is a nice little movie, but if you want to see it, then good luck finding it. Unlike the novel, it received very few versions.
