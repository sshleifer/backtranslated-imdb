For fans of 70s Hammer-type horror movies, this film should be a pleasure. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the fact that Peter Cushing was wasted in the worst episode. In general, however, this is a small and ghostly film. If this is not the best film of Amicus, it is certainly one of them. The best episode, which was saved last, is the one with Jon Pertwee as a horror film actor: it's really excellent. As Pertwee was in this role, it's hard to believe that he hasn't done more of these types of films. All in all, this is a funny film, which scared me since I was a child and which still gives me the chills to date.
