I really enjoyed this Sidney Lumet drama. The best word I could describe it with is crazy. Throw the observer around for an hour and fifty minutes and don't let yourself breathe until the credits start rolling at the end. Trust me, this movie will keep you guessing all the way through. <br /> <br /> The plot is very well done and almost brilliant. It's almost like a more complicated Tarantino type story. The acting is surprising from all the leads and even the small parts, excellent cast. I also loved photography, it gave me the real feeling of being an independent film. It was all fantastic. <br /> <br /> This film is excited, exhausting and heartbreaking. It's almost hard to watch, but you'll be glad you did.
