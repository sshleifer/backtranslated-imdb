this a great Disney flick.it is the story of an old high school baseball coach (Dennis Quaid), who was once on his way to series championships as a pitcher, but suffered an injury at the end of his career. But through a series of events, Jimmy Morris (Quaid) engages with an important team in the league and also makes the roster. This is a family movie. Great is inspirational, but it doesn't pour too often. they will appreciate this film as well as kids.it is based on a true story, even if I am sure that the directors have taken liberties in telling the story. Quaid is as sensational as the title character, very convincing. If you are looking for a movie for the whole family can enjoy, look no further.9 / 10
