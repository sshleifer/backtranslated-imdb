The real measure of any fictitious work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from somehow significantly altered experience (note that this change must not be positive or beneficial) in the end. <br /> <br /> With that measure, Enchanted April is a resounding success. As a film in general, it has had some success, an excellent ensemble cast, well-developed characters that you care about, a wonderful script and beautiful sets and settings. In short, the film is, well, lovely. Although all performances are first-rate, three must be mentioned: Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright. He says something when Miranda Richardson does his usual good job and yet is overshadowed by many others in the cast. The most highly recommended, especially if you are a romantic heart. Another exponent of Saith Not.
