This is one of the favorite movies of all time. The character of Parker Posey is very funny, and the librarian's motive will not be lost on anyone who has ever worked in books and will stack the world. <br /> <br /> If you are a student of the library, I RENT THIS. Then buy the poster and hang it on the wall. Even the soundtrack is highly recommendable. I showed this movie to more friends from the library than any other - they all fall in love with it.
