This is different from any other movie, the closest thing I can compare is a Woody Allen movie ... But where Woody Allen is constantly looking for human weaknesses, Bret Carr seems to be trying to figure out a way to deal with that is a paralyzing insecurity that tends to define us for good and for bad. In the case of Lou, it is the main cause of his stuttering, which can be traced to a singular childhood trauma that is revealed through flashbacks. <br /> <br /> There are so many strangely neurotic people in the world and I believe that everyone deserves a chance for redemption, even if the diversity of human character is after all what makes the world such an intriguing place, so maybe we shouldn't fix our neurosis more than we should adjust our nose or breast. /> <br /> This is an independent film shot for a long time, but the production values ​​are tremendous as is the purpose of the film. I feel like a bizarre gem for the self-help market. I can't wait to see what this director will do, I could imagine a career along the lines of Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, although usually when a guy like this breaks in, goes away and does "X MEN" and his humble eccentric the origins are soon forgotten or are ... X Men is a group of monsters if I remember correctly :)
