"GI Samurai" sees Sonny Chiba and some other boys being transported back to feudal Japan struck by civil war for no particular reason, and a great carnage ensues. It is a somewhat exaggerated essay between sword and machine gun which eventually leads to interesting results. <br /> <br /> The plot runs essentially along the tracks that might be expected from the title; initial antics of fish out of the water ("what is this flying metal box?" etc. etc.), "we are not doing better here," discussions and ultimately a huge battle. The latter is proof that the film is not taken seriously, the carnage occupies most of the second half while the samurai army fights against the Chiba platoon; a clash that one would fully expect from the title, but still manages to overwhelm with his inventiveness and extravagance. It is certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and does not drag on despite its extended length. <br /> <br /> Chiba makes a tough performance like Iba, initially a good leader but someone who finally finds himself questioning his own moral as the situation slowly has an effect on him. This is certainly one of his best vehicles from his terrifying CV. With the final act the two worlds had such an effect on each other, it is necessary to ask if it was a little nihilism on the part of the writers, since it seems that they are asking "wouldn't it have been better then?" But this is perhaps the way to read a little more from time to time can be described as a huge moment of two hours of action (almost) non-stop.
