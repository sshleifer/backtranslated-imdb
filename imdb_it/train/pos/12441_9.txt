This was the modesty we didn't know! It was mentioned and summarized in the comic for the unions to sell to the newspapers! Lee and Janet Batchler were true Modesty Blaise fans who were given The Dream Job - they tell a prequel story about Modesty that fans have never seen before. In their audio commentary, they admitted that they had made changes in its origin to make the story smoother. The "purists" should also note that we do not really know if all he said to Miklos was true because he was "stalled for the time". I didn't rent or borrow the DVD like the other "reviewers", I bought it! And I don't want a refund! I looked at it three times and didn't sleep! Great dialogue and well-designed characters that I care about (even the bad Miklos) just like in novels and comics! I too can't wait for the next Modesty (and Willie) movie, especially if this "prequel" is a sign of what's to come!
