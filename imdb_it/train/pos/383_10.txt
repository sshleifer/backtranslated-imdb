This film captured my heart from the beginning, listening to the first notes of Quincy Jones or seeing the wonderful color of purple flowers in the lawns. This is really a movie to cry and die for ...! The whole cast gives the best performance in a film I've seen for years and Spielberg has really outdone himself! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (oh lord!), Danny Glover and the others, all give us the best and you can feel it - almost touch it! Goldberg IS Celie, gives her that insecurity and the feeling of inferiority that is necessary for the character, and we grow with her, we grow strong with her, throughout the film, and we triumph with her. Margaret Avery is as wonderful as Shug Avery, even when she is more arrogant and shows us that "sinners", in fact, "also have souls". The always nice and charming Danny Glover does a wonderful job of making people hate him and the magnificent music of (I would say sir) Quincy Jones adds even more beauty to this wonderful movie! Photography, music, director and music make this film beautiful and full of emotions a life experience. You don't want to lose it! "Sista '... remember my name ..."
