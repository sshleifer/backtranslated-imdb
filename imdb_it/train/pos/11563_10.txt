I saw it many years after the television series and, initially, I didn't care. Then, as my memory of the series receded over time, I looked again, and found it absolutely hilarious. Based on the play by Neil Simon, it was not very "open" for the big screen, and this is one of its strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are as brilliant as Oscar and Felix, and the supporting cast is wonderful, especially John Fielder as "Vinnie". Even now, certain moments can reduce me to tears of laughter - Felix interrupts Oscar in the middle of a baseball game with a dinner request, Oscar making his way and chasing Felix around the apartment, the ridiculous "Sister Pigeons" put not to mention Felix's sobbing and, of course, the legendary coffee shop scene (later torn from "When Harry Met Sally" by Nora Ephron). Very clear dialogue. When the boys think that Felix has overdosed, Oscar says, "They could be vitamins! It could be the healthiest in the room!" Fantastic!
