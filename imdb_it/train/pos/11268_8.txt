The former love interest of Jane Porter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) and his friend Martin (Paul Cavanagh) arrive at Tarzan's hidden escarpment jungle in search of the ivory gold mine which is the "Cemetery of the Elephants" seen for the first time in TARZAN, THE APE MAN ... we will soon find out that both men have hidden intentions ... ie Jane. Will Tarzan support it? Not likely (in reality Tarzan will not tolerate any disturbance for the "Cemetery of the Elephants") and knowing that Martin tries to remove Tarzan from the picture, only after he will find himself in a world of trouble after him and his party (including Jane who he goes with them after he believes that Tarzan is dead) is captured by a native tribe intent on feeding them to the lions .. Will Tarzan be able enough to get to them in time? <br /> <br /> This film is an adventure full of scenes involving Tarzan and other wild animals facing down and a climax that grips the viewer's interest and does not give up. The cruelty shown to animals and the portrayal of native people can disturb some today, but everyone should remember that this is basically fantasy entertainment and should not be taken so seriously.
