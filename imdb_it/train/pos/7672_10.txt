I have to admit that Holly wasn't on my checklist for the Edinburgh Film Festival. However, after the Festival's artistic director specifically recommended this film to an audience of over 200 people before the screening of another film, I decided to go see it. Wow! <br /> <br /> This film is about the very difficult problem of child prostitution and it does so without any compromise. I found myself crying a number of times during the movie and laughing at others. Speaking of impressive roller coasters. <br /> <br /> The lead actor (Thuy Nguyen) is a Vietnamese newcomer (who was only 14 at the time of filming) and had to face this incredibly complex and difficult role. It reminded me of Keisha Castle-Hughes of Whale Rider, but the role here is much more challenging as she has to play a prostitute child. It is likely that he will win numerous prizes. <br /> <br /> The main story is about a girl sold to prostitution by her family and detained as a sex slave in a brothel in Cambodia. Meet an American (played by Ron Livingston in a dramatic role that we are not used to seeing from him), who after spending some time with her decides to help her. At that point, however, it is sold again and he is going to look for it in Cambodia. History turns and transforms and the public can never predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> The acting was strong in every respect with a very interesting international cast. Udo Kier (very convincing as a sex tourist), Virgine Ledoyen (moving as a social worker) and Chris Penn (one of his latest films). Even the Asian cast was superb. <br /> <br /> Although the film deals with this difficult topic, it successfully focuses on telling a compelling and powerful story. It was shot in Cambodia (some scenes in royal brothels) which adds the feeling of being almost watching a documentary. It seems that the DP used many hand-held cameras and close-ups and overall it made you feel like you were there as part of the story. <br /> <br /> After the screening, I was listening to other members of the audience as they left and it seemed they were all stunned. This is not an easy movie to watch and I greet the directors for not having made a "Hollywood movie". <br /> <br /> It is by far the best film I saw at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Opinion shared by my husband and a couple of other friends.
