This is a movie for entertainment; I didn't think the world made social comments from a small movie. Personally I find this film funny, bold and memorable. It is a fantasy not unlike an ash girl who becomes a princess. This film was very well done, I could add, in the 1970s, a moment of the best cinematographic experiments with the possibility of mentioning a person's sexuality. This film is not about a homosexual person or not, it's still love, in all its strange forms. This film shows some of the realities of being gay in the 70s in Hollywood, or California. Nice guys who were followed by older and not so nice men. Women who had to remain deeply enclosed in the emotional closet or risk not having a career. The bathrooms were an integral part of the gay community. <br /> <br /> THEN the fantasy starts !! We try to mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what do we have? Well, this movie, which in any case was better than that sad redo "The Next Big Thing". Maybe someone would have to ask the entire crew to watch this movie and then try to do better. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie when I saw it in the 70s and now it still brings a smile to my lips. I highly recommend anyone who wants a fun and tender movie to curl up with some popcorn and have some fun. Some people need to lighten up !!! And this is the movie you should do it with! <br /> <br />
