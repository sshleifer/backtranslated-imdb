The film is designed to influence the audience and this film left me speechless. Beautifully photographed and well interpreted with dialogues that come close to poetry, the film involves lust, hatred, murder, rape, theft and deception. An intense network tends to leave me unable to look away from the screen to the end credits. The story is radical. Leads the public from the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War to the human remains left behind. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors who command the screen. Supporting players are excellent and give a real sense of authenticity. Sets, lighting, set design and cinematography are wonderful. I love photography.
