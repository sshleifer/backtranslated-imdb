If there was a more masterful adaptation of this, it is not necessary to look for it; you will find more and more in this almost perfect presentation of Charlotte Brontë's masterpiece. <br /> <br /> I have rarely seen a film that would push me to read the novel on which it was based, but I admit that here. Although I have not read Jane Eyre, I am convinced that I have missed very little in the way of dialogue, of intertwining or of intensity and emotion. I just want to explore the novel because of the immense curiosity and emotion that this masterpiece has aroused in me. <br /> <br /> I don't need to disclose anything about the plot here. Let me say this: if you are unsure whether you should look at or read the beautiful story that is Jane Eyre, I beg you not to doubt it anymore! Every atom of strength and magic that has bred Jane Eyre as a famous classic in English literature has been successfully captured in this film. <br /> <br /> What Brontë didn't bring to herself, Clarke and Dalton managed to spotlight with stupendous intensity. The film's success is, without doubt, largely due to their acting ability. <br /> <br /> Love Jane Eyre or hate her, but appreciate the richness, the vitality, the truth of the story; I love the characters; love the actors; all just how you'd like what's great in cinema.
