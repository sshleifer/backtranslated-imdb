Brilliant! My wife and I joined the sprawling line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After seeing the movie, I can understand why there was such a long line. Holly is a moving story of an impossible connection between two people. She's a young girl, a worn-out westerner. The film grabbed every bone in our body. There are no graphic scenes or something difficult to look at - it is the surrealism of normality that really gets you into a fist. The film is beautifully filmed. Among others, we loved the scene where Patrick teaches Holly to drive a small motorcycle. Thuy Ngoyen's crudeness (I can't believe this is his first acting job) and Ron Livingston's performance stayed with me for a couple of days. Highly recommended.
