Let me tell you I'm a big Carrey fan. Although I admit that I haven't seen all his films * cough * the magestic * cough *. Bruce Almighty was pleasant. None of the other reviews has ever entered into the merits of pessimism towards the end, I don't know what the writers were thinking. Somehow I couldn't help thinking that this film was a miserable attempt to recreate Liar Liar. <br /> <br /> On a positive note, Steve Correl of the Daily Show is HILARIOUS, as is the rest of the cast. See Bruce the Almighty if you are a big Jim Carrey fan, or if you just want to see light music (soft piano music) that is pretty fun.
