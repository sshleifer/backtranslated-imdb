As in that film we follow the implausible adventures of the two protagonists, if they are always engaging. But while C + J shunned sex for a girly childhood journey, this couple delights in their carnality to the point of exploring homoeroticism. Most of the sex they acquire from reluctant or reluctant partners and yet, despite their profoundly non-PC behavior, all emerge smiling. How C + G, through all this remain innocent in the heart, rebels against the quotidien, the bourgeois, the restrictive. As someone else has commented, I would not like to know these 2 and it is a small miracle that their journey brings mostly comedy scenes and very few tragedies (and what is there that cannot be placed at their door) and therefore for that right, he left me deceived but with a sweet taste in his mouth. I dare say that only the French can get away with movies like this. And that's part of their genius.
