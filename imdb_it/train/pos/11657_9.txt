The surprise nomination for this year's best competition as an Oscar protagonist. It is an Irish film by heart, but it was co-produced by Belgium and Brazil, with, I imagine, animators working in all three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films of recent memory. The character design is somewhat reminiscent of the French animated film Persepolis a couple of years ago, with very simple characters with thick and black profiles. This film is not in black and white. Oh no What makes this film exceptional is the use of color, simply the most exaggerated and surprising use of colors I've ever seen. The general design of the images is also much more geometric, with characters that are basically rectangular or oval. Much of the film can be spent playing to find the circle - an important aspect of visual design is a circle in the center of the image. All these geometric designs have a purpose: the story is about a boy who is learning to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts (the Book of Kells is a true enlightened Bible, the art of the film is based on the drawings it contains) . The film's story is not particularly profound, but it is a pretty good fairy tale. Brendan is a boy from Kells, a city surrounded by huge walls, built by his uncle to keep the Vikings out. A newcomer to Kells, Brother Aiden, inspires Brendan to illustrate. It also inspires him to do things like leaving Kells and exploring the nearby forest, where a nymph lives. Bruno Coulais gives a fantastic score, almost as good as what he did for Coraline, which I consider the best of the year.
