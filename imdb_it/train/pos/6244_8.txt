Every country that has a working film industry has a healthy (and perhaps a bit crazy) artist who creates films that you can fully understand only when you are part of this country. I imagine that Hundstage is such a film. <br /> <br /> See the lowest level of Austrian society, dirty, disturbed, strange, hateful. But they still have enough money to afford tuned cars and big houses. And surely they are doing a lot of strange things here that may seem 'normal' to them because they do it throughout their lives. From a normal human point of view you can now easily follow the film, be disgusted or fascinated and watch a beautiful piece of Austrian art films. <br /> <br /> But if you live here and you know the people you see the characters in Hundstage like the cancer of society. A society that is becoming increasingly crazy from day to day, creating its own rules that no one else can understand, breaking the social system from within. And you SEE people. Sitting in the park, standing on the corner of the opposite street, queuing in the same row. Maybe you meet them in a bar or in a disco that you could visit. Maybe you also work with them in your work or live near your home. You begin to hate them without knowing exactly why. You will try to escape, but you cannot. Maybe you'll end up like them. But it seems "normal" to you because you do it through your whole life now ... <br /> <br /> Life is not so brilliant although Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. He has nice people ... but some are also ugly. There are a lot of people working hard while they are doing their best ... but there are also some who are riding others and destroying everything that the people of Austria have built up to now. <br /> <br /> A pessimistic film.
