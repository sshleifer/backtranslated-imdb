This is an extremely well done film. Acting, screenwriting and camera work are all top notch. Music is also good, even if it is mainly at the beginning of the film, when things are still relatively cheerful. There really are no superstars in the cast, although many faces will be familiar. The whole cast has a great job with the script. <br /> <br /> But it's hard to look at, because there's no good end to a situation like the one presented. Now it is fashionable to blame the British for putting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them in two countries. There is some merit in this vision, but it is also true that no one has forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did in the partition period. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between religions and were smart enough to exploit them for their own purposes. <br /> <br /> The result is that there is a lot of cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it was never painted as a black and white case. There is goodness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope of change in the new generations. <br /> <br /> There is a sort of redemption, in the end, when Puro has to make a difficult choice between a man who has ruined his life, but also really loved her, and his family who he renounced, then later came to look for her. But at that point, she doesn't have an option that is without much pain for her. <br /> <br /> This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave mistakes, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. . The reality of the division makes this realization even more shocking, since there can never be true reconciliation across the border between India and Pakistan. In this sense, it is similar to "Mr & Mrs Iyer". <br /> <br /> In the end, we were glad to have seen the movie, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the United Kingdom and the United States could handle their stories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better.
