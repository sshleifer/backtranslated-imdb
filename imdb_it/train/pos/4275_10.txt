I'm actually surprised that there have been so many comments on this film. I saw it as part of a Slavic film festival in a large American university. But no one in the United States has ever heard of it, which is a real shame! The dynamics between people are what make it both fun and sad. They are stuck together on a long bus journey - many of us have been somewhere !! But I've never had one like this !! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where they stop for the funeral. Then the man and the woman go away secretly to make love in the forest, but everyone follows them to look without them knowing! Just as she lifts her skirt and he enters her all the time - the consumer starts hacking and they realize that everyone is watching !! Let's talk about surprise! But ... you really have to try for them even if it's hilariously fun! When you see the ending it's ironic that they had fun while they did it! Serbian humor to the fullest!
