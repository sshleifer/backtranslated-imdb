I saw this movie after watching Practical Magic, and the old movie was far superior. I liked the way the lighting, make-up and costumes changed when Gillian changed history. Jimmy Stewart's mannerisms didn't do much for me in this film, but I suppose they served to highlight the reserve of the Gillian character. I was also struck by Nicky's and Gillian's behavior: it was as if the director wanted it to look effeminate and Gillian appeared masculine. The gestures that Nicky makes when he shows Redlich his powers have particularly struck me. I never thought that warlocks were effeminate, so it was an interesting way to counteract those characters.
