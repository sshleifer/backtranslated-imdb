I saw this film as a teenager and I immediately identified with the portrait of Reese Witherspoon by Dani Trant, a 14-year-old boy in rural Louisiana around 1957. He feels he will never be as beautiful as his older sister, Maureen (rarely one seen Emily Warfield), and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative Baptist education. Then seventeen year old Court Foster (Jason London), daughter of her mother's intimate friend (Gail Strickland), moves into the next room, Dani tries out her first crush, while Court enjoys her company and voluntary spirit. Dani manages to get his first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls madly in love with her, leaving Dani behind. The sisters' close bond is severely broken by the exploding rivalry, which only deepens when the Court dies in a tragic accident. The girls were made to realize how much they need each other. <br /> <br /> Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are perfect as loving parents, trying to balance the individuality of their daughters at the same time trying to keep the family together. The beautiful cinematography and the wonderful soundtrack of Elvis Presley, The Platters and many others contribute wonderfully to the atmosphere of the film of a simpler time. <br /> <br /> A touching training film with a timeless message.
