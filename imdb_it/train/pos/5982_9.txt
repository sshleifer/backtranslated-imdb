One of my favorite movies It has it all - the soundtrack of rock, the courtesy of Eddie Clark, the former Motorhead, a lot of action, lots of laughs, a totally ridiculous storyline and the most wonderful characters' 80s stereotypes . Eddie, the nice sympathetic man, who wants to be left alone to be different, Leslie (wet like them), Nuke (rock-burn-out), Eddie's (pathetic) mom, Roger (the geek) and Ozzy how preacher (surely it exists in America?). Then there are the boys (rich, vicious and stupid) and the girls (empty, vain and stupid). What more could you ask for? <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, there is Sammi Curr, the rock star, an amalgamation of every 80s rocker that comes to mind. What about that rocket guitar? Then there's the scene where Sammi drags the old lady through the TV screen and destroys it. And what does Roger do? Why, take the vacuum cleaner, just like a good geek would. My favorite scene is one in which Tim Hainey gets his long-time Sammi reward through the wet finger in his spine - magic! <br /> <br /> If you liked rock in the 80s or just love ridiculous movies like me, then check this out. It is available on DVD and very inexpensive then (makeup or) as a gift.
