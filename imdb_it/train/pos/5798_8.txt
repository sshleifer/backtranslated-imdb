I saw it for the first time when they showed it around Easter 1993/4 and I didn't think much about it, I bought it on DVD last summer when I started getting into Michael Jackson (I liked his music first) and I enjoyed it more now I'm older. It's a good movie, but it won't be this classic movie like The Sound Of Music, West Side Story, The Wizard of Oz etc. Michael Jackson as an actor was good, as were the other cast members. There were disturbing scenes like the girl Katie being slapped by the gangster Frankie Lideo played by Joe Pesci. The scene that scared me when I was younger was when Michael turned into a robot. My favorite song on the film was Smooth Criminal. I think it was better than Thriller in my opinion.
