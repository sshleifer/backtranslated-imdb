The first and second seasons began tremendously, with good episodes stuck between the middle ones and, sometimes, using clich√© stories. But once he started creating the universe in which he exists and started developing his characters more, it became a lot more fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The main reason why this show manages to do it thanks to four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard's dry sense of humor makes it much better to show, Peter's directing is excellent and makes every episode a lot more fun, and Joe and Paul never fail to make a fun and interesting episode together. <br /> <br /> Once you understand what the show is about and you know the characters, I doubt you won't like the show. For those who enter the show I suggest "The Other Side" of the episodes, a serious episode and "Window of Opportunity", a classic episode of comic relief.
