To those who have not followed the Anne Marie Fahey Murder case. You're losing one of the most sad and complicated murders of all. The murderer is the famous Delaware lawyer, Tom Capano and the victim is the programming secretary of the Delaware Governor, Anne Marie Fahey. Their relationship was a well-kept secret until his disappearance and murder. He wanted to leave him, but he didn't want to let her go so easily. On the other hand, he had a lover, a wife and four daughters. Where did you find the time to have two lovers and a family life? Moreover, the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a four-hour mini series. While the actress who plays Ms. Fahey does a great job, she doesn't have long, dark hair. His other lover is definitely more attractive than the real woman. Mark Harmon looks good and makes an Emmy-winning performance like Tom Capano. It would be better with the current Delaware and Philadelphia locations. With the executive production of Ann Rule, she adds accuracy to the organizational characteristics of Anne Marie and her personal battle with an eating disorder. This information could be overlooked by any other executive producer or director. If you haven't read the book, it's worth it. Ann Rule is a charming storyteller of real crime. It is ironic that Mark Harmon plays Tom Capano. He also played the former friend and subject of Ann Rule, Ted Bundy in another adaptation of the book many years ago. He was brilliant then and now. He does an above average job with an incredible story. Even President CLinton offered his assistance in the Anne Marie Fahey case. And now, former Governor Tom Carper is now the US Senator for Delaware who defeated the long-standing senator Richard Roth in the November 2000 election. If you don't think the film is interesting, then read Rule's book .
