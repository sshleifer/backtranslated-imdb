The Thief of Baghdad is one of my ten favorite movies of all time. It's thrilling without blood, it's beautifully filmed and the art direction is impeccable. The casting couldn't have been better. Rex Ingram made me believe in genes. And the epitome of evil is surely captured by Conrad Veight as Jafar. He set the level very high. <br /> <br /> ... I watch this movie at least twice a year ... and I never get tired. This film is an adventure for all ages ... not too old to enjoy it. The Bahgdad thief sends my memories forward for a more innocent time ... I was ten the first time I saw it and the United States was about to enter World War II. Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying "evil" a few years later in "Casablanca". And Korda collaborated, I believe, with Justin and Dupree again in "The Four Feathers" ... the great film making!
