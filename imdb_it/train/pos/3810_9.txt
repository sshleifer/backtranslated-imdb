this is my first review on IMDb, I didn't want to write one, but since there are only 2 for this great movie right now, I feel compelled to add my perspective ... and no, I'm not associated with filmmakers in anyway (yes yes how many times you did it before, -)) FYI are in my last 20s <br /> <br /> first of all I have to admit that I really like animated films, because what you see it is only limited by the imagination of the creators and have been rather imaginative about this. Not so much in terms of history, but in achieving a truly unique and fresh visual style. The characters look good but far from the truth and work well for the film, after all it is a fairy tale world. But the backgrounds and the world at large are full of fantastic images that my jaw dropped several times as I watched this. The blue mini-dragon, similar to a rabbit, leads the show and easily has some of the funniest moments in the film, it's already an instant classic, just like Ice Age Scrat. The story is not too surprising (a group of antiheroes has to go out and kill the biggest dragon imaginable) but who cares if the film looks and looks so good ;-) 1 what should I emphasize, imo the the film is not Suitable for a LOT of children, because it has some darker scenes and maybe scary for children under 6-8, I would say, these are only very few scenes, but it is worth mentioning. Anyway, I had a great time watching it and I can't wait for it to arrive in stores in high definition to look at it again and again just for the absolute beauty. <br /> <br /> 8.5 for me
