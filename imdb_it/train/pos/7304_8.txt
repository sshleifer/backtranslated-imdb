Every now and then a movie announces itself to be scary or terrifying, even though they usually aren't. Most modern horror films fall into this category. <br /> <br /> Then there are those films that don't simply cause tension and adrenaline to pump harder than usual in the veins. In reality they scare you to a level you have never experienced. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is such a film. It takes so many risks that could make most film producers shudder. But almost everyone works. "Halloween" is majestic in its simplicity and terrifying as a whole. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is babysitting some children on Halloween night, while a madman is at liberty after escaping from a psychiatric institution after brutally killing his older sister 15 years ago. Obviously, the madman, later known as Michael Myers, starts killing the local teen population, and eventually arrives after Laurie. <br /> <br /> It looks familiar, right? Just another brainless hench full of stupid, blood-studded teenagers. It's not a casuality. <br /> <br /> I think James Berardinelli fits it perfectly into his review of "Halloween:" "Because of its title, Halloween was often grouped together with all the other splatter movies that populated theaters around the world . late 70s and early 80s. However, while Halloween is rightly considered the father of the modern slasher genre, it is not a member ... "<br /> <br /> It has a point and, for a number of reasons. First, it's definitely terrifying, while most voices in the teen slasher genre are stupid blood battles (one could argue that many of the recent ones are ironic, but most of them fail). Secondly, there is almost no violence (very small of which is bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence is not the same as fear and it has very little on it (actually, the number of corpses is quite low). In fact, it can be argued that this is not actually a horror movie, at least not by today's standards of having the most deaths that can be crammed into a single movie, any more ghier and more sadistic than the last. He relies on ideas to scare and even skill. Third, while some characters can do stupid things (which sometimes seal their fate), they don't do them because they're stupid. The characters are real people, so instead of thinking that the characters die because they are idiots, we're scared because they're making a mistake. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why "Halloween" is so scary is because it's so easy to believe it's real. Nothing is hard to digest in this film. There is no supernatural, there are not ridiculously creative plot elements, or "inventive" murders, or whatever. Instead, all the sets and cameras work (save the opening sequence) are simple. Carpenter simply sets the camera and says action. What we get is the feeling that we are seeing a murder set right in front of us. <br /> <br /> Horror movies are probably the most difficult films to make because, to do something scary, everything has to be perfect, and ideas never work twice. It is a game not to be missed, and that is why if I had to tell you all the good ideas that Carpenter has (which they are not), they would seem primitive (especially because they have been repeated with a minor effect over and over through the years). <br /> <br /> Acting here is not an extra point because it doesn't need to be. This is a film about scary ideas, not a film about dramatic and conflicting characters. Actors behave like real people, not characters in a story. Nothing more. The exception to this is who will play The Shape, or later known as Michael Myers. It can be frightening that a person says nothing and simply kills, but it is difficult to pull out (and even more difficult to prevent people from asking why). But the boy pulls it out, and the result is terrifying. <br /> <br /> This is Carpenter's film. He directed, co-wrote, co-produced and wrote the chilling score of it. This is a brilliant man and his next film "The Thing" supports this claim, although The Thing is not as scary as "Halloween". Unfortunately, its success has dramatically decreased, as it happens when the call of big money for less freedom is exploited by big time producers "recognizes your potential". As good as it is, this film is not without its flaws. The famous opening scene is disturbing, but not very scary. And not many of the scares work for the first part of the film. It's not that it's bad, it's just that there are no good reasons to fear "The Shape". Fortunately, Carpenter mainly uses this time to establish a relationship between the characters and the public. While there is no intimacy in this relationship, it fits the purpose. We grow to know the characters, but not so much as to discourage when they die. But once the film arrives at Halloween night, that's when Carpenter kicks the high stuff and NEVER stops until the end. <br /> <br /> While "Halloween" can be imperfect, it's just a bit like that. It is an immensely terrifying film, and a must see for those who love scary movies. Attention, this film will scare the hell out of the living!
