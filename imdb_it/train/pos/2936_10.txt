If only Eddie Murphy was born 10 years later. Then we will all remember it. But even I was only 4 years old when it came out. If you haven't seen it yet, rent Dr. Dolittle, Showtime, I spy, Pluto Nash and all of Eddie's family comedy films - so watch this. Hands down, you'll be back 90% of the time. The other 10% will wipe the tears from your eyes. <br /> <br /> He really needs to be watched more than once to understand all the lines. From crude humor to joke for children! (If you saw him you'll laugh here) - you'll love his things. If you can, (or you're a big fan) try downloading clips from Eddie's actions. The shows are as different as you imagine and have even more fun jokes. <br /> <br /> But this is like the "best of" Eddie Murphy "X-rated" if you do. <Br /> <br /> And all I can say is, please, don't watch Delirante if you don't like comedy, don't have a sense of humor or be funny to hang out with. You can just put down this great Eddie Murphy classic and maybe make someone forgive you. <br /> <br /> If you want to know how Eddie got Beverly Hills Cop and became famous - Delirious is like that.
