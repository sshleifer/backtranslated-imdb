This film was fantastic. It is an inspiring piece of cinema. The characters are fully developed through the truth in which the director, Lucy Walker, leads to the film. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for that special film that shows humanity in the human condition. Lucy Wlaker showcases the beauty of the landscape. This film is a true example of man against nature and sometimes man against man. The inner turmoil and triumph are tremendous in its subject matter. The argument of how the Tiebtans consider blindness as a sign of demons is interesting. This film sheds light on a particular culture that has never been shown. Lucy Walker gave voice to Erik Weihenmayer when he was not normally listened to. Thank you Lucy for being loyal to your vison as a director.
