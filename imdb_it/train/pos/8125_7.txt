Things to How is the rarity of rarities, a film about ideas. Many films present a vision of the future, but few try to show us how that future was born. The first part of the film, when the war arrives at Everytown, is short but powerful. (Ironically, the film audience in its release year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking England - contentment was at its peak. Wells' prediction was confirmed too soon.) The assembly of an endless war that follows, while ruined by par model work, is more effective. The explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of German expressionist graphic design. The artistic director was the great William Cameron Menzies, and his series of ruins at Everytown are among his best works. Margaretta Scott is very seductive as a head lover. The Everytown of the 21st century is an equally surprising design. Acting in the history of the 21st century is not irresistible - perhaps this was a failed attempt to thwart the technocratic rationality of this period with the barbarism of the 1970s. Unfortunately, the working model, which represents angry crowds running on elevated walkways, it's ridiculous and could have been done much better, even with the technology of the 1930s. This is particularly irritating since the scenes of the giant aircraft are very convincing. This is redeemed by the magnificent speech by Raymond Massey which concludes the film - rarely has the ideal of scientific progress been expressed so well. Massey's last question is more relevant than ever, in a greatly reduced crew-era space flight. The scene is aided by the moving music of Sir Arthur Bliss, whose surname I proudly share. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the VHS versions of this film are absolutely horrible, with serious technical problems. Most versions have modified a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from 1970 to 2038. I hope there is a good DVD of the entire film.
