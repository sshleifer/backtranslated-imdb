Back in the 1940s, when the films touched on subjects not yet admissible in the "educated" society, they resorted to codes that presumably floated on the heads of most of the public, alerting those who knew what was happening. Probably no film of the decade was as full of insinuations as the strange dark Desert Fury, set in a small game oasis called Chuckawalla somewhere in the California desert. The owner of the Purple Sage saloon and the casino is the amazing Mary Astor, wearing a pair of trousers and a cigarette case; in town he drives his handful of daughter, Lizabeth Scott, looking at Technicolor as 20 million dollars. But listen to the dialogue between them, which suggests an older lesbian and her young, restless companion (one can only ask whether A.I. Bezzerides' original screenplay made this relationship explicit). Even more blatant are John Hodiak as a gangster and Wendell Corey as his insanely jealous torpedo. Add Burt Lancaster as the sheriff of the city, mix and sit. Both Lancaster and (surprisingly) Hodiak fall in love with Scott. It seems, however, that Hodiak has not only a past with Astor, but had a wife who died under suspicious circumstances. The desert sun warms these ingredients up to a boiling point, with abundant facial splashes and crumpled exchanges. Don't let this greenhouse melodrama pass, chock full of exotic and scary blooms, if it happens to you; it's an extraordinary film.
