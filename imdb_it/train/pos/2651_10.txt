Quite right. The film is better than the book. Don't get me wrong, I love the book. But the film is much better. This film has Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall at their best. (I haven't seen Scatman Crothers and of course Danny Lloyd in anything else.) Some of the ideas used in this film are better than those used in the book. But I've already talked about it in my commentary on the mini series. But I lost some. The film is shot in a better position than where the mini series was filmed. And the REDRUM scenes are more disturbing than those in the book. So, if you're looking for a fantastic movie, take Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. But he expects to have nightmares every night for 3 weeks
