The film actually has a pretty good story, but it gets bogged down in several key places. It's almost as if the director threw the film together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film. Dennis Quaid does a pretty decent job in his role ... but something is clearly missing from several key scenes. <br /> <br /> This 2.5-hour movie could have been reduced to about 2 hours of film. And it probably would have been a much better film if he hadn't had the impression of being thrown together. <br /> <br />
