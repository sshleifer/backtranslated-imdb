It's not as bad a film as I thought it would be. <br /> <br /> He has a good cast. It's nice to see Roger Moore on the screen and use other British actors. <br /> <br /> Would like to see more of Olivia D`Abo in future projects. Perhaps he will play the sexy Maryam D`Abo next to his cousin. <br /> <br /> Also a good use of invisible places like Luxembourg. <Br /> <br /> We hope to see more European-British co-productions like this one.
