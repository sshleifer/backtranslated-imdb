My son was 7 years old when he saw this film, now he is on a Russian fishing vessel and said that the film with which he was very impressed and that he remained in his mind all these 39 years is the Legend of the boy and the eagle. He asked me if it was possible for me to get this for him. I'm sure a lot of things go through his mind because he only has 3 hours of light and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have another 3 months before his contract expires. Since we have Indian blood, he links to this film. He will be 47 years old on January 27th and I wish I could get this film for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me get this movie? Thanking you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
