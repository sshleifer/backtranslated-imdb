A surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret in relation to paranoia. There is a lot to do in this to have a running time of just 74 minutes, but it works. The fears are very subtle, not the jumping fears that seem to popular the most recent Asian horror films. The way the "scares" are set is similar to the disturbing moments in "The Uninvited" (aka 4 Inyong shiktak, directed by Su-Leon Lee), but this is not nearly the same caliber. The film does a good job of balancing a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological. It's not perfect, but it does what it should do. I would recommend checking it if you had the chance.
