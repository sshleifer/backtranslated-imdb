I saw this movie last night in a special cinema that was showing in Nuremberg and it was great. I must admit that the original musical composition of the cello and the percussion / xylophone player influenced the atmosphere of the film, but the film itself also had strength in its portrayal of the tragic Nibelung saga. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in silent films or Nibelungs, I highly recommend this film. The costumes were fantastic and creative, the sets were opulent and exotic, and the acting was dramatic and breathtaking (as is typical of the "tragedies" of the silent film). Unfortunately, I didn't see the first part of this cinematic duo about Siegfried. The story of this second film begins after Siegfried's death, when Kremhild (Gudrun in the northern versions of the story) starts planning his revenge against his brothers. <br /> <br /> Also, I saw this film in German; I am a native English speaker and I have a basic knowledge of German. It was difficult to read the subtitles (what is it called in silent films?) At the beginning because of the old German writing style, so I advise you that if you look at it in German, make sure you can differentiate your "k", "f's" and "s's" in the old script. :)
