The alternative title of Ecstasy, is Symphony of Love; a title that appropriately describes the atmosphere and feel of the film. Ecstasy is one of the first speeches and could have been a classic film, if released during the era of silent cinema. This film is a visual pleasure, and is deliberately stimulated so that the viewer can enjoy his sensual lyric quality, which is presented in an artistic and low-key way. The director's style is decidedly European. The subject and approach to sexuality were far more sophisticated than what was produced in Hollywood at the time. Consider the censorship code in the United States during the 1930s, which sums it up very well. Hedy Lamarr, one of the great beauties of all time, was a perfect choice for this "Symphony of Love".
