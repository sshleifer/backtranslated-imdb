This film has a powerful philosophical ending. But that ending only makes sense if you watch the movie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The youthful alienation in the late 1960s, from the point of view of a young man and a young woman, is the obvious theme of "Zabriskie Point" ". Neither Mark Frechette nor Daria Halprin have had a lot of acting experience, a fact that really improves the message of the film. Having untrained actors conveys a sense of realism, as both players seem emotionally detached from the chaos that surrounds them. <br /> <br /> This is not a film based on script. Except for the first ten minutes, it is mostly visual, with an extraordinary cinematography.The beautiful naturalistic images seem in another world and perfectly in tune with the emotional detachment of Mark and Daria. <br / > <br /> I would have replaced the music Pink Floyd, thematically weak, with the most convincing music of The Doors Many scenes scream for "Riders On The Storm". <br /> <br /> Even so, I like this movie .It is different, it is unique, it is artistic and imaginative the desert gullies are beautiful. <br /> <br /> Over the years, "Zabriskie Point" seems increasingly attractive. It conveys the atmosphere of the late 1960s in America. It is extraordinarily artistic, in a bohemian way. And the last eight minutes of the film are philosophically hypnotic.
