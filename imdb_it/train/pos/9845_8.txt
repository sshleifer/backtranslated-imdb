I'm not going to lie, this is a great movie. I saw it about 4 months ago in my local theater. I saw it a second time, and got a little bored in the slow scenes. Sid (the sloth) is not so flattering, but Diego (a mountain lion, I think) is really good in the film. The animation is exceptional and the story has a final touch. It is worth bringing children under the age of 10, but boys would probably find it a bit boring. Moreover, the uniqueness of the characters is so interesting. As I said, it's a pretty good movie, but I'd say "Toy Story 2" or "Shrek" are higher. 8/10
