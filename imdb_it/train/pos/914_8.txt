Vivah is not a classic at all. However, in the days of hardcore action, puzzling special effects and complex textures (none of which have yet been mastered by Bollywood), it's rather refreshing to see a simple movie like Vivah. History, as we all know, is a journey from the first meeting of a couple to their final marriage after a few moments and moments of trial. Nothing more, nothing less. The music is not entirely similar to that of MPK or HAHK, but it doesn't even disturb your senses. Two songs stood out for me: Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane. While Milan abhi aadha and Hamaari shaadi were humble. Shahid performs sincerely and shows a lot of potential. It's nice to see him play something else, but the cool he normally does. Amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a docile little girl to perfection. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher and Seema Biswas are formidable supports and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job. The direction of Suraj is simple but effective. The main flaw of the film is the slow rhythm that could test the patience of many young viewers. But all in all a good, clean and respectable family film.
