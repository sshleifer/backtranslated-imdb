I've seen this movie more than once. He was on par with many of the ghostly things that were shown in the television movies of the time. The only problem I had was with the title for the obvious reasons ... We immediately think of the famous Drake's snack! Leaving aside the first part, "Hound of Hell" would have been enough. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna always manages to give a sense of seriousness to anything he does, however, whether the plot is good or bad. But this was a nice Halloween fare offered by the CBS network. I loved the part where Crenna takes a flight into some dark country to find the mystic who would help him conquer the evil beast. He asks the taxi driver how to find this guy. Great dialogue between the native taxi driver and Crenna in terms of cabby that dissent the ethnic beliefs of his own people. 'Aw, Mr. Barry, I left that stuff behind when I came down from the mountains ...' - referring to the mystic who rarely sees or advises people, and nobody really knows how to contact him. <br /> <br /> Regarding the supernatural rate, this film is still enjoyable.
