A chemist develops a fabric that never gets dirty or wears out, but is seen as a threat to the survival of various industries. In this delightful comedy by Ealing Studios, Guinness is wonderful as a mild but persistent chemist. Greenwood, with his sensual voice, interprets the love interest; Parker is his tormented father. Thesiger is fun as a textile industry patriarch. While telling a compelling story, the film also raises some intriguing questions about science, economics and politics. He is skillfully directed by Mackendrick, who would have continued to make "The Ladykillers" and the sublime "Sweet Smell of Success" in the 1950s.
