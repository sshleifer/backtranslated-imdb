Hot Millions is a great movie in every way. A fun and original story with wonderful performances by four of the best professionals ever in the business world. Peter Ustinov is brilliant, as usual, and Maggie Smith, certainly one of the greatest actresses of all time, is a total joy. Karl Malden and Bob Newhart complete the cast and are perfect. If you want a movie that has a perfect casting, this is it. What is so impressive is the way these people deal with each other so naturally and effortlessly, creating lots of laughs and funny moments. Peter Ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances. Direction, photography and editing are also top notch, and it is a splendid London time capsule from the 1960s. It's definitely on my all-time favorite list.
