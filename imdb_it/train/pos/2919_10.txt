I saw the film twice in the space of a week, both times in a cinema in Orpington, Kent, UK. The place was full of people and people had to be removed. From the beginning of the film with Henry Winkler injured on the football field, the whole audience was in turmoil of laughter, laughter that lasted until the end credits. <br /> <br /> For those who love the American fight this film is a must, but be ready to see Henry Winkler like you've never seen it before. Pay attention to a well-known actor, whose wrestling move is on his head but! <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to watch this movie, it is entertainment for family comedy at its best!
