"Pandora's Clock" is a compelling suspense / thriller that is a cross between a virus movie and a catastrophic film. This film, which was broadcast in two parts on NBC in its debut in 1996, is about an air flight that is infected with a virus when one of the passengers is in this disease. The US government discusses whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) try to figure something out to avoid disaster. I'm not a big fan of TV movies and miniseries, but I liked "Pandora's Clock". It's a thrilling journey. Jane Leeves (TV "Frasier"), Robert Loggia, and Edward Herrmann (as president) are the protagonists. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
