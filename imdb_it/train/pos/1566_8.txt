The somewhat sinister series of novels by Leslie Charteris of the adventures of Simon Templar ("The Saint"), was brought to the screen in the late 1930s with the advent of George Sanders as the Templar. He was a careful choice: Sanders usually played against the bad guys with occasional "good roles" (ffoliott in FORREST CORRISPONDENCE, the hero of the title in THE STRANGE CASE OF UNCLE HARRY, the "best friend" framed by Robert Montgomery in RAGE IN HEAVEN). Here his willingness to bend the rules and break a law adapted briefly to his "heavy character", while his good looks and gentle behavior made Templar a serene and fit hero like Chester Morris "Boston Blackie" and (in part) by Peter Lorre "Signor Moto". <br /> <br /> Films are not the best series of yellow films in series - but they are useful. Like Rathbone's Holmes series or the Oland's Chan series, the show often had actors playing roles or interpreting new ones (the anti-heroine in the film was played by Wendy Barrie, who would appear in a second movie of the series). This and some rather familiar movie sets make the series a comfortable experience for viewers, who listen to the buzz of dialogue (always showing Sanders' ability to keep one step ahead of the bad guys), without noticing the obvious flaws in the plot . All these mysteries have flaws due to the fact that even the best writers of the genre cannot avoid repeating the old ideas again and again and again. <br /> <br /> Here the moment when it happened was when one of the casts admitted his affection for Barrie, whom he knew for a long time. Shortly after he tries to protect her from the police. But since the film was about the identity of a criminal mind, it became obvious that this person was made so slightly noble that he deserved to be the mysterious mind (ie, the script considered him the least likely suspect). <br /> <br /> Barrie is after evidence that his father (who died in prison) was framed by real criminals in a gang of robbers. She has several people who assist her - cups like William Gargan - and get advice from the mind on planning embarrassing thefts that can't be blocked on her. The D.A. those convicted of his father (Jerome Cowan) are determined to take Barrie and his gang. The only detective who seems to have the chance to solve the case is Jonathan Hale, who is stalking Sanders but reluctantly working with him. <br /> <br /> The cast has some good moments in the script - Hale (currently on a special diet) is tempted to eat a hearty lobster dinner made for Sanders by Willie Best. As a result, he has a severe stomach ache, allowing Sanders and Barrie to escape from Sanders' apartment. The best must remind him (when he feels better) to go to a place that Sanders told him to go at a given time. <br /> <br /> There is also an interesting role for Gilbert Emery. He usually plays a good person (like the husband with eyebrows in TRA DUE MONDI), who plays a socially important debilitator here - whose disappearance is reminiscent of a Bogart film character. <br /> <br /> Overall a well-made film for the second half of a 1939 film billing. It will entertain you even if it doesn't remain in your memory.
