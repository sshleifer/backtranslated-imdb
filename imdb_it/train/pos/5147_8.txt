The first week of May, every year brings back the memories of the Holocaust, through films on televisions. Among the many films that they showed, this was what I had not seen. <br /> <br /> The story is about Hilter's life and how he came to power. It begins with its childhood and ends with its holding the most positions of power in Germany. <br /> <br /> The film was previously presented as a TV series and later converted into a cinema format. The Scottish actor Robert Carlyle plays Adolf Hitler with great courage, conviction and blaze to give a real portrait of this man. <br /> <br /> It is a good script and narrative, which educates the public about the main events that bring Hitler to power, and also tries to show the probable psychological trick of Hitler. The film is a partial point of view of the director Christian Duguay ?? who shows Hitler as a single track person, threatening, angry and screaming? who had such a strong grip on the Germans and the people around him. Hitler is not shown as someone who has charishma and attraction, and there the film fails to convince the portrait of Hitler. <br /> <br /> Even if the business was for TV, all the ingredients of the production are first class and on par with any main streaming film. The value of production, sets, costumes, etc. They were perfect. <br /> <br /> There is much criticism of this film, about the authenticity of the historical events that are presented. But the film is still compelling, engaging and fun. Robert Carlyle has the upper hand and dominates the screen like no other. Is he extraordinarily good ?? brilliant! I would have liked to have a more balanced view of Hitler's life, because I think that Hitler was able to bring out the dormant feelings of millions of Germans and that it was not only he who had to be blamed for the holocaust. As I have said many times, what ?? very sadly - our society loves garland or pursuing a person, respectively as a representative of the good or evil of society.
