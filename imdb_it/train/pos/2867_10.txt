I lost my father at a very young age. It is young, in fact, that I have no recollection of him. Over the years I've learned a lot about him. One of those things was that he loved westerns, and watching Bonanza every Sunday night was an absolute ritual for him. I, myself, remember the tail of the run of the series, being 8 years old when the show stopped production in 1973. Watching this show over the years somehow makes me closer to my long-lost father. It has all the right elements to make a show successful: laughter, tears, the suspense of the seat, and sometimes it makes you angry. the memory of the original run of the show, arrived shortly after the death of our beloved "Hoss" Cartwright, Dan Blocker. A particular episode, and the end of the credits, showed a photo of Blocker and faded into black, and I can also remember my older sister with a tear in her eyes at the sight of this. I can remember it as if it were yesterday. On behalf of my late father, who is not here to say it, we love Bonanza. Along the Cartwrights.
