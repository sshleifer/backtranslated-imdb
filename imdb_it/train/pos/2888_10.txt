Every child who is old enough to sit in front of a screen will be absolutely fascinated by the beautifully drawn images and wonderful music in this resounding and amusing rewriting of the Grimm fable. They will sing "Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo" before they can even formulate a complete sentence and will continue to sing it until their last days. It is a classic for all children, especially for those adults who are young at heart.
