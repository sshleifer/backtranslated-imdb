I read the book in fifth grade and now, a few years later, I saw the film. There are some differences: <br /> <br /> 1.Billy was oringinally suppose we eat 15 worms in 15 days, not 10 worms in a day by 7:00 pm. <br /> <br /> 2.Billy Suppose we get $ 30 after eating all the worms. In the movie after Billy eats all the worms, Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants. <br /> <br /> 3. Joe assumes he fakes some worms but he doesn't do it at all. <br /> <br /> Even if there are changes, this film is still one that will appeal to children.
