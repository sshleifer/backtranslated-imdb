I had heard some things not too good about this movie and I had probably seen the low score here in IMDb and that's why I had avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and since I had nothing better to do ... and as it turned out, I would have trouble finding something better to do. Vanilla Sky is a scary, sad and moving film, actually one of the best I've seen in a while. I was surprised how impressed I was to watch it. It's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings about the characters and your perception of what's happening changes and it's a pretty exciting journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a very rare way for a movie or any other kind of support. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend everyone to see this movie. Regardless of what you heard about it.
