the most incredible combination of love and psyche of two young people. It presents in the most sublime way and definitely touches your heart. A rare combination in which the sequel overcomes the prequel both in narration and in the intensity of emotions. The film re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation. the joy of seeing your loved one has no equal and everything can be sacrificed. Ethan and Julie have tested eternal characters with such simplicity that they give the film a pure joy and a love to watch. A film to see for all the people who believe in true love. by far the most romantic movie (at least one of these) of all time.
