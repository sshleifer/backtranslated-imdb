A critical and financial flop at the first exit, critics turned and declared that this film is the best of the director. The feeling of the film La Ronde develops rapidly while the guys from a detective agency (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) continue, fall in love and lose the most eccentric and beautiful women in the film (Audrey Hepburn, Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). Most of the script was advertised or rewritten on the day of filming, which gives the film a breezy look. Ben Gazzara is excellent as a chief detective who persuades Audrey Hepburn after dropping singer Colleen Camp and seeing taxi driver Patti Hansen on the side. John Ritter promptly follows Dorothy Stratten and immediately falls in love with her. Blaine Novak has some girls he is chasing (including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena). This film has some great performances by a supurb cast. Stands out Audrey Hepburn (she has no line in the first half of the film). Ben Gazzara has never been better (and a stimulating choice for a romantic protagonist) and Colleen Camp has one of his best roles as the manic country singer Christy Miller. It's a joy to see her as she shoots from her jokes in a rat-a-tat-tat. Highly recommended! ********* stars!
