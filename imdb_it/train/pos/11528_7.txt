I had seen Lady with red hair when it appeared, and I don't remember it as something to love. The truth is that, despite his base in a true story, his script is stupid and incredible. The real value of the image is the cast. A constellation of some of the best supporting actors of the 1930s and 40s are the backdrop to the delicate and intelligent work of the always underestimated Miriam Hopkins, and to the wonderful and spectacular performance of Claude Rains, who, as usual, is the best the picture. What an actor! He never won an Oscar, but he is in the good company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady with Red Hair contains her best work in movies. Watch it and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
