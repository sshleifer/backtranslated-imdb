This film starts at full speed, has some slow moments in the middle, but generally moves well, has some very beautiful moments, then comes out at the end of the third act. I was able to see it in Los Angeles premieres twice (with 2 different endings). Jason Lee is a star, but he is not the protagonist of tomorrow. He is witty and holds his own, but is better served as a support actor. Julia Stiles does 'ok' in a comic role, new to her, but she doesn't 'steal' this film, like a star of her caliber should be. For an actress who has so much potential (10 things, Save the Last Dance, O), it's hard to see her continue to make roles that are so "mediocre", and then not let her take the role and run away with the movie (as she has made Daniel Day-Lewis in "Gangs"). Selma Blair is also a good young actress and does an "ok" job. I did not expect an award from her for the academy, and she did not deliver one, but her performance was adequate. Chris Koch delivers another film that is "above average". Perhaps the problem lies in the script more than anything else. I liked this movie! But it's not a movie where you go away and you say ... "It was great!" ... This 'story' has been done so many times before and there wasn't much new here. The rehearsal dinner scene was probably the best in the film, and Larry Miller offers an incredible performance in a supporting role (it could be the best surprise of the film). If you want to go see a movie that will make you laugh a few times, and enjoy a pleasant evening, I can still recommend this movie, but unless they have changed the ending ... again ... you leave during the scene of the church, or you will surely be disappointed.
