The Invisible Ray is an excellent performance of both acting talents of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Karloff achieves an impeccable performance as a grumpy and confrontational scientist who seems to put his scientific results in view of his relationships with others, even with his wife. His already solitary personality becomes unbearable when he becomes paranoid. <br /> <br /> Lugosi interprets the consummate professional, who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain good relations with everyone, but seems to have no real close friends. This was one of his few good boy roles and he plays it very well. It is difficult, however, to listen to his accent and believe that he is French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the film was that everything was based on "junk science" but, in a sense, even junk science makes it work well. Since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic, today they are "relevant" as they were when the film was made. And they are also able to reach and always will be. <br /> <br /> This is a perfectly delicious movie to watch again and again. I saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and I could easily spend five more times. Acting is wonderful and science is fun. I highly recommend it.
