Midnight Cowboy made a stir when it was published in 1969, drawing an X rating. By today's standards, it would be difficult to get a rating. R. Jon Voight, who was better, is competent in his role as Joe Buck, an out-of-town asshole. who wants to grow up with the women of New York City. He meets a busy street smuggler named Ratso Rizzo, who tries to be friends with Buck for his purposes. The two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic. Like Ratso, Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman was often brilliant, but never more than this portrait. It is so in the character that everything else around him pales in comparison. Losing the Oscar to John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The director Schlessinger has a brilliant hand with his production, but this film has a rickety belly that leaves a bitter taste in the spectator's mouth. Only the performance of Hoffman is worth seeing.
