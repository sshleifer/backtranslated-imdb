This may not be one of the best films ever made, but overall it is a very pleasant and light piece of foam in which everyone involved seems to have fun. Highly recommended for its wellness factor. OK, so the "acting" of Frank Sinatra leaves a lot to be desired, but his way of singing is a great talent for redemption and the songs fit perfectly into the romantic atmosphere of the film. Sinatra has continued to make many other films in which his undisputed acting ability shone, but in this, his first Hollywood adventure, his voice, not his acting, is his main contribution to this film. I just watched it on TV again and this still raises my mood as much as the first time I saw it many years ago.
