THE VAN is a simple sensational image made specifically for the drive that comes out of its way to make you feel at ease, offering many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends. Danny Devito has a small but abundant role as a car wash manager and almost steals the show! All the protagonists are well recited, the complex characters and the director enough competent for this type of photo. An international version of the crown.
