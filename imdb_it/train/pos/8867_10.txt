I sincerely hope that at least once the first season of Cosby will be published on DVD. The episode of Hilton's eccentric sibling George, (played by the late Roscoe Lee Browne), is classic hilarity. It reflects the classic fraternal rivalry and love between brothers whose lives have taken different paths but both have ended happily. <br /> <br /> Cosby and Mrs. Rashad have brilliantly regained the chemistry they shared for The Cosby Show for many years and to put them in a bourgeois role they show the dimensions they can take as artists. <br /> <br /> The roster of comic dynamite ... Madeline Kahn, Phylicia Rashad and Mr. Cosby ... classic genius!
