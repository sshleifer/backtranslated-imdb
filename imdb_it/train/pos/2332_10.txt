"Imagine if you could bring things back to life with just one touch" As soon as I heard it for the first time, my attention focused on the Trailer, and after the first episode I fell in love with this show. A modern day fairy tale that brings my spirits up and keeps my attention during the whole show. I think acting and casting are just perfect, every character brings something unique to the show that adds to its perfection. Even the only time the bad guys can boil over with a unique sense, from Bee Man to Guy who can swallow kittens, they never seem to disappoint me. And the Deaths that normally lead to a Depressing Moment often end up being purely comical (such as an Exploding Scratch & Sniff book) <br /> <br /> Even with the huge amount of crime shows we now have a day, Margherite is one of the few that really stands out from the rest, being not only a mystery but a love story, comedy and a fairy tale with a dash of drama all cooked in a single wonderful cake ..... wrong show. <br /> <br /> What really shocked me was the fact that it was on ABC, for years that I never had a reason to turn to ABC, but this brought me back every week with a smile on my face. It was as if Pushing Daisies brought ABC back to life for me. But just like that, after two seasons, some prizes, a big fan base and positive responses from the critics, the show was abandoned. Looks like Ned touched the ABC again and killed him forever. I will always be a fan of this show, though, and I recommend it to all those who love to talk and love a lot from the shows they watch.
