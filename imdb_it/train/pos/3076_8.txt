Because Panic has never had a good exit in the hall is easily visible: it is too smart, and the public would have probably had a difficult time with it, comparing it with American Beauty in its probing a mid-life crisis, and Sopranos and Analyze this in his study of illegal activities in the midst of family life. Although panic may seem to derive from non-original material, Brommel's realistic characters, accompanied by skillful dialogue and observational direction, make the film a realistic aspect of the ruin of a middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy plays Alex, a hit man working on his father's contract killing business (Sutherland). He leads a double life, with his wife (Ullman) and the son unaware of his true profession. In his middle age, he becomes more and more disgusted by what he has done for a lifetime. Under his calm facade collects resentment over his father's control over his life. When he meets a young woman (Campbell) he feels invoked and decides it's time to leave the family business. <br /> <br /> The fact that writer / director Henry Brommel decided to make the profession his main character was trying to break disposable. He could easily have replaced it with any undesirable profession; his characters are so well developed and credible, the scenes are managed in such a fluid and realistic way and dialogues written in such an intuitive and natural way that the focus is on Macy's conflicted character rather than on his work as a hired assassin. Brommel's script seems like a Shakespearean tragedy, with a precise theme of destiny flowing everywhere. <br /> <br /> In Alex, Macy creates a tragic character, easily understanding, and turns into another looming, great interpretation, as always to be expected. Donald Sutherland is also abusive and abusive as his overbearing father, and Ullman's dramatic turn as Macy's wife is a positive change for the comedian. Consider a scene in a bicycle shop, where his mood darkens and delicately beats into an engaging scene of emotional confusion. <br /> <br /> Henry Brommel's first feature film, Panic is a well-made film in its sincerity. With a first-rate cast, a plausible script, a laconic dialogue and good direction, this character study will hopefully be just a taste of Brommel's ability to create characters that look real. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
