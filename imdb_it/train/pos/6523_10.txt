Of course, the story of this film has been "Hollywoodized", but it is far from being the only piece of history rewritten for the masses. Lafitte sided with the Americans because he considered himself a Frenchman and therefore hated the British, not because of a sense of patriotism for a nation that had conquered New Orleans only a short time ago; he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling, which caused his navigation to Galveston; he was more a little criminal and a villain than a hero * or * a swordsman. But who cares? This is a film that is pure entertainment - and to face it, we all wanted Jean to go for the exuberant girl rather than the governor's demure daughter. Brynner once again rises to write mediocre to give a fascinating performance.
