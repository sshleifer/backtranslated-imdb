As I said in my commentary on the first part: These two films are better than many science fiction confessors. <br /> <br /> The scenario of the second film is not so moving as we do not see the destruction of human civilization, but the consequences, thousands of refugees fleeing in small space boxes, protected by a single powerful spaceship. <br /> <br /> But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story warms up, bringing the battle back to the Cylon planets. Ok, it has a bit of Mad Max because all they fight for is the fuel for their spaceships traveling to find the Earth far away, but it works for me. It's an electrifying science fiction entertainment with excellent actors and decent special effects (even if those tend to repeat themselves, to say the least :-)). <br /> <br /> I would have liked a sequel with Starbuck and Apollo table. Instead, we had a second sequel without characters that proved that the story had worked before, especially because the characters were so well chosen ... <br /> <br /> So thumbs down for 1980 productions, but thumb up for the two 1978 films.
