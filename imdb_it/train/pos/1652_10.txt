This series led me to write and Deighton genre when I was younger and I love this story presentation. However, I would not agree with the comment above. From what I've read in the past, it's not Holm's performance that leads Deighton to refuse to publish the series, but the slaughter that all three books received in the translation on the screen. A great example of this is the rewriting of the crossing that ended Samson's career on the field. The scene is not in the book, the character who dies in the minefield has never been in any of the books and the transition to Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not from the Polish border. This whole plot is made of cloth. The changes in Set similarly damage the integrity of the story. My perspective on Holm's performance was to have excellently interpreted Samson's disorientation during his wife's defection and I think he performed well in portraying the elderly field agent desperately trying to overcome the class gap. Samson pays both for his father's idealism and suffers because of his influence on his life. As Clevemore comments, if he had had an education he would probably have run the department. I think the real performance loss is due to the physical aspect more than anything else. Holm is diminutive to the Samson of the book - a physically impressive man capable of using his size to impose a presence.
