The fourth of the five westerns Anthony Mann did with James Stewart, this involves a hard-bitten mountain dog named Jeff Webster who takes a cattle route from Wyoming to Alaska, passing through Seattle. He connects to Seattle with his partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) who he sent in advance to make preparations for the boat trip to the north. <br /> <br /> But first, it must endure insubordinate hands, cheat the captains of river boats and the charm of the timid, manipulative Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) who believes that Jeff could be a valid ally in the future. That's why he hides it on the boat while the captain is looking for the first (and justifiable) killing of a hand on the track. <br /> <br /> Jeff also has the misfortune of running into squalid Judge Gannon (John McIntire) who runs the city of Skagway, Alaska. Gannon blocks Jeff for disturbing his audience by hanging his cattle through the city. He inflicts his cattle on Jeff and Jeff just needs to eat the crow for now. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Jeff agrees to go to Ronda to Dawson to deliver the supplies. But this is just a ploy so Jeff, Ben and Rube can go back to Skagway and steal his cattle back. Obviously Judge Gannon finds out and is behind, but is delayed by Jeff with a gun while Ben runs the cattle across the Canadian border out of Gannon's reach. <br /> <br /> After avoiding an avalanche and another shooting with some other Skagway men, they finally reach Dawson where Jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder, who is just Ronda, who in turn promptly sets up a new gambling house to Dawson. Jeff then takes his money and buys a claim and starts looking for gold. <br /> <br /> But then Judge Gannon arrives at Dawson to participate in the golden action up there, and tells Jeff that he was getting a little bored with Skagway and wants to try his luck in the Klondike, himself. This involves bringing a hit man with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner's statements. Jeff and Ben now feel that it's time to sneak away while things go well, leaving Rube to defend himself as a more ineffective sheriff against Gannon and his gang. <br /> <br /> They look for a way out only for They lie ambushed by Gannon's men because Ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth. Ben is killed and Jeff is seriously injured but this does not save Judge Gannon from his debt. The final shooting at night on Dawson's muddy road deals with this. First Jeff kills two of Gannon's best gunslingers (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). Then, when Ronda comes out to warn Jeff that Gannon is trying to slip behind him, Gannon shoots her in the back and dies right there in Jeff's arms. Then Jeff kills Gannon as he hides under a wooden sidewalk. Revenge has spoken. <br /> <br /> This is another roaring western that is right there with THE NAKED SPUR and THE MAN FROM LARAMIE. Because the universal DVD uses pan-and-scan printing instead of the widescreen print that TCM uses, it's beyond me. You'll end up losing half of William Daniels' glorious Alberta cinematography. So, if you like well-written 1950s westerns, then this is an A list holder. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
