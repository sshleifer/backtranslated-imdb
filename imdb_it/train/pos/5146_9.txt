As someone born of a German mother and an English father (who spent five years in a prisoner-of-war camp) I come from a unique position. One to deal with the various Nazis on one side of the family and the winners of the second World War on the other. This miniseries cannot delve into every single part of Hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general taste of the situation at the moment and in the best way that one can take Hitler's mental state. In this the series does quite well. Carlyle is very good as O'Toole is, I would still have liked to have more information on party relationships because Hitler didn't do anything alone. He had people around him who followed him often and without questions and no doubt later in his murderous career. What was Goebbels, Goring and Hess going through? It would have been useful to see more of these reports. But I hope it will make people more interested in research. It could also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to continue in power.
