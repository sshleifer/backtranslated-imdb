If you like Cleese and all the British "Pythonesque" humor of the time, then this little gem is absolutely fun. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a real treat! <br /> <br /> I saw this with friends on TV when it first came out, and its classic quotes have formed part of our jokes for 30 years, and they will do it forever! I have it on the tape and it is continuously appreciated. <br /> <br /> Perhaps some reviewers take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> I can't believe it's now only available in the US (NTSC of course), and not in the UK, where it should be an essential part of the history of British humor !!
