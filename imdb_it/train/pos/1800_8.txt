All Dogs Go To Heaven is on par with Watership Down for scary children's movies. Both were dark and fairly sinister, but at the same time the most fascinating experience a child could have. This was one of my favorite movies as a child. I was in love with Charlie and at the tender age of about five or six, I will admit ... I had a crush on a cartoon dog. All Dogs tells the dark story of the amiable cad Charlie and his companion in crime Itchy. The story begins with Charlie running away from death row and getting scared towards the nearest club for gambling. Of course, as a child, I didn't understand the concept of this film. I loved the songs and the animation, but since I grew up I wonder why I wasn't bothered by this movie when I was young. These are pretty adult themes like gambling, murder, hell and prison, but in a world of quality Disney movies, it's something that every child should look at once. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a kind of crazy scene of disguised crocodiles and the infernal scenes scare me more now than when I was little, but they convey a message so touching that it should not be ignored by the parents!
