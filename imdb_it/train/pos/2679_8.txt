Delirious, close to a piece of atmosphere without plot and if it is more inspired by the Devil's LSD, then we must remember when it was created! After a surprising openness SM (which even itself is not what it seems) we move on soft focus and dream or imagine or remember ??. A lot of literary and cinematographic references and indeed this is Franco's film that Lang himself praised. Beautiful and mesmerizing, the film takes place calmly, but has a richness in every turn. A rare film to languish inside. Old Jess could do it when he tried. Excellent central performances also among the indomitable Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon. I didn't even mention the Lisbon positions - ah!
