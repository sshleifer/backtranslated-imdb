"Ship Ahoy" was probably made to showcase MGM's talent. The film is a fun journey on an ocean liner bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico, at a time when the country was involved in World War II. This was the typical studio fare, which gave the film a light amusement as a distraction during those difficult times in the country. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Eleanor Powell is best seen in some musical numbers where she clearly shows us that she was a dancer not to be underestimated. Red Skelton is also seen in a straight part with not too clowning, while chasing the beautiful Mrs. Powell on the ship that is taking them to Puerto Rico. The irresistible Bert Lahr has good opportunities in the film to show that he was a funny man. Even Virginia Gray is seen as a funny girl who is not fooled by anyone. <br /> <br /> There are good musical numbers with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, in which we see, among others, the incredible Buddy Rich, who has some solos with Mr. Dorsey and Mrs Powell. A young Frank Sinatra also appears as the lead singer of the band, backed by the Pied Pipers. <br /> <br /> This is a nostalgic journey that should be savored by fans of this genre, that MGM totally controlled.
