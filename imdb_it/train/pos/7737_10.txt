If you are a big fan of an author like I am of Jim Thompson, it can be rather risky when their works are converted into movies. This is not the case with Scott Foley's version of AFTER DARK MY SWEET. A classic noir of suspense and sexuality that closely follows and does justice to the original text. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward possibly give the best performances of their career. And the always phenomenal Bruce Dern could have even been busy with this. Like Thompson's book, this film creates a dark and surreal world where passion overcomes logic and the double cross is never far away. A must see for all fans of great film noir. **** !!!
