One of the best comedy series ever released from Britain. Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are terrific actors and performers who seem comfortable with drama as well as comedy. Skillfully supported by their writing partner Jeremy Dyson, they have populated the series with the most memorable characters of recent years. Little Britain pales in insignificance as a poor imitation of their ideas. Constantly original and innovative, I'm sure many people hate these series as lovable, but I'm equally sure that no one could have any opinion about LOG. I have yet to see the feature, but I've heard good things and bad things, so I'll reserve to judge. The original radio series from which LOG came was as innovative as the TV series has become. I don't know if the TV series has arrived in the United States, but I would be fascinated to see how the American public has found the strange English of humor
