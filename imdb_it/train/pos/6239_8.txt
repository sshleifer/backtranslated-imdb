A film / documentary about different people in Austria during the hottest weekend of the year. It follows what they are doing and perhaps more what they are not doing. The weather is very quiet ...... so you have to relax ....... inspire ... exhale before seeing it ...... <br /> <br /> Before you think .... but nothing is happening and you get a little angry about that ... and this is the problem, because it is the mood of the film and the beautiful realistic social photos that are beautiful in this film ....... .... a lot of people will say its disgusting ...... but it's not so bad ... I think it's more used for marketing .... and there are some really fun moments ... at 60 old woman stripping ..... I guarantee her most intoxicating striptease in the history of cinema ...... her film which is real..I think it's the word ...... right in the face ... .... and this makes it a little scary. Manipulation of the computer here ... its real life ... and as we all know films can conquer reality when it comes to doing sick things ...... .... so it's much worse in the real world .. ..... <br /> <br /> If you survive the movie you can start looking at your neighbors and thinking ... maybe they are like the people in t he movie ... I bet there are a lot of them there out ... sick ... crazy who live with a beautiful facade ........ after seeing the film it seems more interesting to look at my neighbors ........ <br /> <br /> But maybe you shouldn't see this movie on your first date .........
