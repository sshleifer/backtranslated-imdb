This could be a 10 if it weren't for the fairly predictable and Hollywood scenario. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms his position as one of the leading actors of our time (because I can't ask) and the rest of the cast is on a very high level. Personally, I was impressed by Hugh O'Connor who played Christy Brown as a child. The first scene I saw was really strong. Wow.
