Another film by Norman Lear that describes in detail the problems that African Americans have had to face in the turbulent 60s and 70s. <br /> <br /> With Esther Rolle and her husband along with 3 children living in a Chicago skyscraper in a predominantly black neighborhood setting, the show described what blacks were experiencing with an owner (the black agent Mr. Bookman) as well as the prices and everyday problems of just existing. <br /> <br /> The 3 children described how people seem to face their problems differently - from comedian JJ to militant Ralph Carter, their daughter who also aspired to success, this show was a perfect description of African American life.
