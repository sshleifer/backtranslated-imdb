This is one of the best "B" comedy / music I've ever seen (and since I'm 40 now and I only see it now, I'm not an expert but I've seen all the famous movies out there). When there are a lot of actors taking the lead for minutes at a time, usually the comedy interferes with the musical pieces, and very often the musical pieces interrupt the comic flow. Call me in a crazy mood, but when I saw it on TCM Europe, I was laughing out loud with pleasure! So who made the laughs for me? Undoubtedly Mischa Auer gave me some amazing laughs, which even stole the ending, it was great! By the way, I think the reason this film works is because even though L & H is a strong point (and because I was passionate about watching this (them and Hal Roach), I love them in their first Hal Roach stuff) , this continues to their minimum and remains exactly on the ADULT tariff (according to the standards of 1930, and not so far from today's standards if you read between the lines). Even Jack Haley is fantastic to see, I admit that I only know him from W O OZ and I loved him there, and I even laughed aloud here at his piece of waiter on the show. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" femme in the films of the 30s that excites me (something tells me she was a spitfire in real life); and the musical numbers have a quality of professional production (Busby Berkley'ish), which has upset me from what I am used to in this genre. I could go on and on, but rest assured, I really enjoyed this movie. 8 out of 10 I saw it on TCM Europe and I will register it to watch it again with my wife on TCM USA. Good stuff!
