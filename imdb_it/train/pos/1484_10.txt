"CASOMAI" was the last film I saw before getting married, just last year. <br /> <br /> It was also the first film I tried, after getting married, because we promised to offer a copy to our priest. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, reality is not that except fiction. To all those who have written that priests like "Don Camillo" do not exist in real life, I would recommend them to visit my priest Pe. Nuno Westwood, in Estoril, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> For all the others, I would recommend them only to see this film, before and after "I do!" day :-) <br /> <br /> Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
