Unlike HELLO's version of Tinseltown, DOLLY !, the film adaptation of Jay Presson Allen in Ira Levin's Broadway thriller could not wait for his incarnation on stage to stop before putting it on the silver screen, then the producers have wisely decided to make the most of Run White Way! The film's opening and closing scenes are shot in the intimate Music Box Theater in New York, where DEATHTRAP has been playing for almost five years. Even the final fading of the film on the theater stage is a version of the film's famous logo. (Although the markers decided to use a more fun icon than Rubik's Cube for the movie.) <br /> <br /> Now on a low-priced DVD version, DEATHTRAP looks just as fresh and inventive as ever. The cast is right (better than their theatrical counterparts) and location explorers should be applauded for finding a spooky enough home for our "one room, two act thriller". Open in surprisingly simple and innovative ways, director Sidney Lumet wisely marks every "new" material at the beginning and end of the film and leaves Levin's only evil center alone. <br /> <br /> The last scene of the film is a great departure from Hollywood from the boards, and slightly undermines one of these. The plot of Levin refers to the beginning of the film [Helga (about a dagger): "It will be used by another woman WHY for the game."]. As THE PLAYER by Robert Altman, however, our new ending helps the film fold back on itself once again and blurs the lines between stage, screen and (could it be?) Real life!
