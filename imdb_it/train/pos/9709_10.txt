I first turned LoG on accidentally while I was watching television: since then, I've never missed an episode. <br /> <br /> The humor is very strange, like a cross between the social commentary of Brass Eye, the Fast Show is excellent one-liner and a surprising plot that seems to develop every week without ever going anywhere. The best example of this was Hillary Briss' special material - what was it? <br /> <br /> Everyone will not like humor. Some will say that he is too sick, and it's easy to see where they come from. However, try it. If you don't like it, don't look at it, but if you like it, you'll be very happy that you followed my advice.
