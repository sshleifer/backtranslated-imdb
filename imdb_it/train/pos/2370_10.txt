It's a great American martial arts film. The fighting scenes were quite impressive for the American film made in the 90s. Obviously the fighting scenes are not as good as in the Hong Kong films, in reality only a few American films have fighting scenes that are as good as in the Hong Kong films, even nowadays. When you watch an American martial arts movie, you're expecting to see less impressive fighting scenes, but you still have some nice moves, which can sometimes be surprisingly good, or at least that's what I expect from these movies. I was impressed by this movie. Some fighting scenes were really impressive, the acting, the direction and the plot were pretty good, so it's really a movie to watch, if you like American martial arts films from the 90s.
