Start a bet between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist ... Poe bets that the man can't spend an entire night in a terrifying castle. Well, of course he can, but will he come out unscathed? Hard to say with all those strange people who shouldn't be there to wander, including the icy Barbara Steele. This is a rather strange film because the presentation is both in French and in English, and goes back and forth a few times. Perhaps this is possible because dialogue bits have been lost? It is also rather gloomy and claustrophobic, since it is not seen far beyond a small circle of light that candles and the like generate, as well as a feeling of terror and impending fate almost always. Also this version (on Synapse) is uncensored and I was wondering what could have been censored in a film from 1964 until I saw the topless scene, I guess it could be like that. Overall this is quite good and in dark black and white. Barbara Steele certainly makes the film too. 8 out of 10.
