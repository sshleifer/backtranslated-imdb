* SPOILERS * Four men, Ed (Jon Voight), Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Drew (Ronny Cox) and Bobby (Ned Beatty), decide to go rafting on the Cahulawassee river before it is flooded. <Br /> <br /> They wanted to have fun, have a nice weekend in nature. <br /> <br /> But when two mountain men cross their path and rape one of them (Bobby), everything starts in Hell in a Handbasket, and this "nice weekend" will also cost one of the four lives. .. <br /> <br /> "Deliverance", which in Italian is stupidly titled "A Quiet Weekend Of Fear" ("A Calm Weekend Of Fear '), is the grandfather of films like" Texas Chainsaw Massacre "," The Hills Have Eyes "," Wrong Turn "," Last House On The Left "and all the other subgenre films" Evil Nature / Revenge ", and one of the scariest, right next to" The Hills Have Eyes ". <Br /> <br /> Based on a book by James Dickey (which appears in the film as Sheriff Bullard), it's a chilling story about how someone can go into a situation thinking they know everything, when they don't. <br /> < br /> And the image of the dead man's hand rising from under the water, or the hands holding the rifle on the same sheet are disturbing images that will never leave your mind. <br /> <br /> Delivery: 9/10.
