... or was Honest Iago really smiling at the end, when he died? <br /> <br /> Loved as the iambic pentameter of Bardo has just rolled up on the tongue of Fishburne, with excellent clarity and emotion. <br /> <br /> And as Branagh did the honest Iago to celebrate his own evil ... <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful film. <br /> <br /> I have often thought that Shakespeare is not film-friendly at all: Use words to create images in our mind, which creates a perennial battle with the camera, which only knows how to show us what we must think and feel . Every effort to film Shakespeare really should be celebrated. It's not an easy thing to do.
