An extraordinary high quality film. <br /> <br /> Apparently based on real events that, as mentioned, have a clear ring of truth, this film is highly emotional and deeply moving. <br /> <br /> An abused and neglected child often becomes a rebel in adulthood, as one of life's failures, whether as a gangster, drug addict or a burden to society. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher as a young adult in the navy, is troubled. He is on the verge of being a loser. It is recommended in therapy by a psychiatrist and it is that relationship that occupies the center of the scene. <br /> <br /> In flashbacks and therapy, Antwones' source and remedies are revealed. <br /> <br /> Exceptional shows of the whole cast. History is indeed a family tragedy with an emotional and physical torment. All actors give full-blooded shows with conviction and realism. <br /> <br /> A message from the film is the importance of raising children decently. <br /> <br /> The real Antwone deserves success. Having endured wickedness like a child, but above that, shows a magnificent character. <br /> <br /> And to all those out there who have endured such torment but who have survived and succeeded: you are all winners. 10 out of 10.
