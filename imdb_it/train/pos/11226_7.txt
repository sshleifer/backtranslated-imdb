Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First of all, it is a fan-made series, available only on the web, and presents mainly friends and neighbors who have computer programs and video cameras and sewing machines at home, as Mickey and Judy once put on a show. You definitely are friends and neighbors, you can tell. Many of these people are not the most beautiful people you have ever seen, or the youngest or the most subtle ?? some of them stumble in their lines as if they were walking on marbles ?? some of them have thick accents, or just don't seem to speak well, first, whick makes it virtually impossible to understand a single solitary word they are saying. Yet, you have to admit, for all that these friends and neighbors have put together, it's really fun to watch. Yes, some dialogues are misleading. Yes, it's a bit weird (though a little too nice) to watch two Starfleet males kissing (even though some of the kissing scenes seem to go on and on.) Yes, they shiver a little when they clearly mention ST: TOS, TNG, other shows and movies, or when you listen to the Galaxy Quest theme played at the beginning and end of each show. All right. We can do it. Why? The graphics are top quality. Better than almost everything you've seen. And sometimes, does a show or two really stand out from the story? some of them are actually real tears. <br /> <br /> Is Hidden Frontier a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word ?? but you have to give people the credit in question where the credit is due. It takes a lot of effort to make a production of this magnitude. People, sets, costumes, graphics ?? it's a huge effort on many parts of the people. We look, we come back and we thank them.
