Good show, very funny Good martial arts acting. Good plot plot The entire main crew did a great job from Robert Urich, Chuck, Norris, Jennifer Tung, and above all a GREAT hand at Judson Mills. A particularly beautiful tribute to Robert Urich, in his last days. A GREAT ! actor who will be really missed.
