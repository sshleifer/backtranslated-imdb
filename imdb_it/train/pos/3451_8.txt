First of all, this film was not released to theaters (TESTED POORLY THEY SAY), I say they understood that the story of devoted police, politicians and journalists was done to death, just send them DVDs and cable TV> and take money and run. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I usually like this type of film, especially with this cast called. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, LLCool J, Cary Elways, John Heard and on the rock side, Piper Perabo and Roslyn Sanchez. <br /> <br /> The plot and the story was done to death, BUT the aforementioned cast gives life to this violent film and is actually watchable. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake is as good as the young reporter dedicated to a knockout newspaper edited by Morgan Freeman, The others are corrupt cops, politicians or decent kids, the 2 women are the girls of LL COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE and do what is required, it is quite violent, many killings etc., not for children. In no way is it a great movie, BUT for what it is and the cast is definitely good, <br /> <br /> votes *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
