I remembered seeing this movie when I was a child one day in the wonderful world of Disney. This film has been in my memory for over 30 years and I tried to do it. I should say that of all the children's movies I saw back then, this was more than all of them and after seeing it only once, I really hoped I could see it again. The history and images of this film have been burned in my memory. Until now, I've never seen it since that day in the 1970s, in fact, I never remembered the title until an Internet search revealed it to me. I loved it and I want my children to see it. Does anyone know where I can find it?
