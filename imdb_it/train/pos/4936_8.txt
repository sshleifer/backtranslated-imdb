When a stiff one presents with pulmonary plague (a variant of bubonic plague), Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark), an official of the public health service, immediately quarantines everyone she knows close to the body. Unfortunately, the victim was murdered and there is a good chance that the killer will start spreading the plague, causing an epidemic. He joins police captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who is drafted to track the murderer as soon as possible and prevent a possible national disaster. <br /> <br /> While Panic in the Streets is a quality film, it suffers from being slightly blurry and a little too large (the reason I brought the score to an eight). Wanders genres from the Noir gangster to medical disaster, police procedural disaster, thriller and even romance. <br /> <br /> This is not the best work of director Elia Kazan, but to say that it is a bit fake. Kazan is responsible for these masterpieces such as A streetcar Named Desire (1951), On The Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955), after all. This film predates those, but Kazan said he was already "without ties" from the studio. Taking this freedom too far can partly explain sprawl. The film is set in New Orleans, a city where Kazan "used to wander ... night and day, so I knew it well". He wanted to take advantage of the environment. "It's so fantastic and colorful: I wanted boats, steam engines, warehouses, jazz joints - all of New Orleans." <br /> <br /> Kazan handles all kinds of Panics well in the Streets, but could be better connected. The film would have benefited from being with only one or two of his moods. Sprawl in terms of setup would still have worked. Part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that Panic in the Streets was an attempt to combine two stories of the writers Edna and Edward Anhalt, "Quarantine" and "Some Like 'Em Cold". <br /> <br /> The material of the gangster, which ends decisively in a thriller territory with a prolonged chase scene towards the end of the film, is probably the highlight. Not surprisingly, Kazan said he believes the villains are "more colorful - I never had much affection for the good guys anyway. I don't like Puritans." A second neighbor is the only material that comes close to the "panic" of the title: the discovery of the plague and the attempts to trace the complaint, inoculate and contain the disease. While there is a lot of suspense during these two "moods", much of the film is also a fairly simple drama, with a more typical rhythm of that genre. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is excellent. The stylistic difference of many modern films could not be more pronounced. It is intelligent, delivered quickly and well stated by each character. Conflict is not created by "stupid" decisions but by intelligent moves; the events and actions of the characters are more like a chess game. When unusual positions are taken, like Reed holding the plague in the newspapers, he gives relatively long justifications for his decisions, to which other characters argue. <br /> <br /> In light of this, it is interesting that Kazan believed that "property, religion, ethics and the middle class are killing us all". That idea makes its way into the film through the changes to the norm, or the compensation far from it, made by the protagonists. For example, the gangster boss Blackie (Jack Palance in his first film role) receives a "Get out of jail for free" card if he helps fight the plague. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film are fine, if nothing exceptional, but the real reasons to look at are the performances, the intriguing scenario and the well-written dialogue.
