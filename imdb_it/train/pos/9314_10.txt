I have seen this show only a few times, but I will live in my memory. <br /> <br /> It is very frustrating that it is so difficult to find it anywhere for purchase and yet it seems like there are endless repetitions of things like Friends! Especially even more difficult to get in England, I guess ..? <br /> <br /> Do they say they were low grades or was it a complaint from the Bakersfield police itself? Maybe he was too smart for some people? <br /> <br /> However, almost the only comedy I'd like to see again but it's almost impossible to find. Did I hear that it was or was repeated on another network? But unfortunately it's not over here !! <br /> <br /> Summary: ingenious.
