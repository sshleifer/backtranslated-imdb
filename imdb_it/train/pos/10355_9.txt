Fascinating film, based on a true story, about an Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), accused of killing her daughter. He insists that a dingo has taken his baby, but the story is highly suspect. The film is about the media circus that took place around the case, how Australians interpreted what was presented in the media and the mentality of the crowd that eventually led to the woman's belief, based on almost all the evidence concrete. I love films that question the media, and even movies that look carefully at how people are stranded by the justice system. I always thought juries should show 12 Angry Men before they did their duty. It is not, as has often been said, a liberal film, but a clinical look at how we human beings interpret events based on our prejudices and our desire for revenge. Cry in the Dark is also clinical. Schepisi is careful not to make the film any melodramatic. Some may find the film boring or dry, but I found it interesting.
