Garam Masala is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Akshay Kumar is excellent as the womanizer who has relationships with 3 girls and is engaged at the same time. John Abraham is fun sometimes and this is one of his best works so far. Paresh Rawail is exceptional as usual in most of his films. Director Priyadarshan has made great films in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul are among the best. Garam Masala is his funniest movie I've done. The three new entry actresses are average. Rimi sen does not have much purpose in this film. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan made a film with a simple plot of a boy who has a relationship with 3 girls at the same time. All 3 girls have a day off on the same day and end up in the same house. Packed with lots of laughs, this is a non stop entertainer.
