I think a lot of viewers have completely missed the fact that this is obviously a parody of western movies. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie - it's a clever language that speaks of westerns. I don't think this movie was taken seriously for a moment. <br /> <br /> What makes this film even more unique is that it focuses on 4 strong and beautiful women, two of whom are black, an Asian, and a Mexican / Hispanic character. <br /> <br /> These are not the usual western women - they are tough - they can draw quickly and shoot straight. <br /> <br /> 'It's so hard that even the bartender is shaking when he pours their whiskey. <br /> <br /> The plot that moves this story is typical of westerns - in the tone of "you shot my brother - so I" will take you! "Only in this western, a woman's sister was hit and she is out for revenge of the gang that did it. <br /> <br /> So she goes and gathers her old friends from her robbery days into bank. <br /> <br /> One of them, Maria, is not so interested in avenging Rachel's sister, but is motivated by the fact that there are gold and jewels hidden in the city where they are headed. > <br /> There are a couple of scenes that don't make much sense, not that they interfere so much, they can be ignored, but I was wondering why they were there, so the film could use a little tension, but above all, this is a well made film that failed to find an audience that recognized what it is. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the film is a villain - "heroines" , one is obviously straight, the other sexual orientations are never revealed. <br /> <br /> 7 stars
