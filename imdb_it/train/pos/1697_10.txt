Basically, this film is one of those rare films that you either hate and think is on the verge of suicide as the best thing to do, rather than having to sit for two hours. Or, as in my case, you see it as a kult success, one of those films where humor, plot, acting are actually very hidden but for those of us who are willing to look for it, trusting the director, the reward is: U laugh your A .. of !! The fact that you have to find the things mentioned above makes the film even more fun, because you have the impression that the director is not even aware of how funny his film is, which does not seem probable and in which lies the intelligence at the helm of this magnificent project called: Spaced Invaders !!
