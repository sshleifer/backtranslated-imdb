OK, this movie was nice. I don't think it was the best film ever made, but it certainly was fun. My brother and I recite the scenes once in a while, and every now and then we take the film out of the closet, sweep the dust away and snap it. Pleasant to the end, but a great concept. This is a film that simply needs to forget the criticisms all together and enjoy them. Judgment is the victory of Robot Jox.
