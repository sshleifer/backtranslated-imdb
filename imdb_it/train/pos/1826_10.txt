I loved this movie when I was a kid. Today at 5 pm it's one of my favorite animated films of all time. Beautiful animations and captivating characters are just two of the things that like this movie. Although many people may not appreciate some of the songs, many of them are well done and follow the story. He focuses on Charlie, a handsome mischievous German shepherd who at first sight might seem unlikely ... but in the end he will win you over. <br /> <br /> It is not a film for children by any means. Often very dark and scary at times. A gift for Don Bluth fans and animation enthusiasts. But keep a handkerchief handy. ADGTH never fails to make me cry and will do the same for those who are sensitive to movies. Probably one of the greatest non-Disney animated films of all time. Along with Watership Down and My Neighbor Totoro. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: A heavenly masterpiece.
