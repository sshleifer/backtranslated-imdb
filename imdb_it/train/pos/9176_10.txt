This review comes nearly 30 years late. Nevertheless, it must be said that I came across a copy of this film in early 2008 and watched it repeatedly for 4 consecutive months! I just had to write about it! I was impressed and forgot that anything else existed once I saw this movie. How ironic it is to see the ugliest male protagonist of Literature portrayed by the most beautiful man! yet what a welcome irony! I was fine and above all because Timothy Dalton did justice to his role. He delivered a stunning and triumphant performance! I've never seen anything like it! All the other actors are also very good. The whole film was put together beautifully. I don't care what anyone says about this movie. I love it and love it! It made me happy and satisfied. It crushes me a bit to say it, but I prefer Jane Eyre 1983 at the P & J of A & E, which I think is the last mini series. <br /> <br /> Extracts from Jane Eyre scared me a little at school. I've never been able to read the book seriously knowing the plot so well. Seeing this particular production made the story come to life for me and led me to an almost total frenzy. The scenes and the voice of Mr. Dalton haunted me endlessly and eventually led me to read the book seriously, which, of course, is a masterpiece. Bravo to the whole team and especially to Mr. Dalton !! This film is now a part of me. <br /> <br /> I give him the evaluation 10/10.
