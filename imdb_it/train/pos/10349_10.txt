This is one of those films that made me feel strong due to the need to make films. In general, I'm a fan of movies based on true and true stories. And this is FANTASTIC! In addition to the performance of Meryl, who has received many awards and appreciations, the main resource of the film is the story on which it is based. The compelling story of a couple who suffers a social and legal torture, after having suffered a huge emotional pain for the unexpected and brutal death of their child is really a fairy tale that opens their eyes on the inhuman side of his fellows and reveals the barbarism a very refined and legal company. It is interesting to see how people who consider themselves kind and intelligent (the ladies of the emotional jury in the film, for example) are actually nothing more than selfish fanatics who, due to their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices, shut their heads to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all the facts that point very clearly against their opinions. The other side of the so-called "civilized" society that the film exposes is the apathy for the pain of its peers (needless to say that this is very general, even if this particular story takes place in Australia), which goes as far as becoming a true cruelty. He must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps stimulating.
