Interesting, fast and fun. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of those people who watch a lot of television. I came across this show while I was home sick with a bad case of flu one day, and I was immediately caught. I developed a nice crush on John Burke. Both he and Claire did a great job hosting the show together. You could really say that they both loved their work. <br /> <br /> The super-collector segments were excellent. I became interested in things I had never thought of before. <br /> <br /> What I'd really like to know is: what happened to Jack the dog? Did one of the hosts adopt it?
