I saw him when I was 17 and haven't seen him since. The 'CBS Late Movie' showed it regularly on a point. I remember how sad and upsetting it was, it really made my stomach hurt. The effects were not then what they are today, but nevertheless they conveyed the feeling of being alone in the Amazon, after having lost both parents and looked for a way out, very well. I remember most bugs and larvae, they were so realistic that they ate his flesh. It is a dark film that was controversial at the time, although it was probably heavily modified for TV. I wish I had remembered more details, and if I ever get a chance to see it again, I can comment more. I've been looking for this for years. I believe it could have been shown on CBS under the umpteenth title. I have no idea if it was ever published on video.
