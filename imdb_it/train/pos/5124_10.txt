This is a fantastic film that I don't think deserves enough credit as Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays a man in love with a girl, but he is too lazy to admit his feelings for her. Instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks he will show his manhood. Although it was built in 1980, it is still current. The soundtrack of great country music is fantastic. 10/10
