Anyone who has lived through the ages of Revenge of the Nerds and Girlpower will appreciate this movie. It's one of those movies that offers everything you want in a "spring movie" MORE he makes fun of the college genre. It's fun, it has a cast to die for (Amy Pohler! Rachel Dratch!, Sophie Monk!, Parker Posey! Jane Lynch! Amber Tamblyn! Missi Pyle!) And it's guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. The writer / actress Rachel Dratch is a comic genius and Sophie Monk is a great villain. Wilson Phillips! OMG! (I'm just repeating myself ...) She will live with girls who love Miranda July, but they want to eat ice cream and pretend to be stupid.
