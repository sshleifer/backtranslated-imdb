Hello. I just watched this movie today for the 14th time in 3 days. I'm a history teacher who has a lot of time on his hands. I need a life. I found the film that contained a striking resemblance to breaking the mountain. I also found that I look a lot like Jean Lafitte if he was white. besides, my favorite line in the entire movie was from Mr. Petey - "this child can shoot in the eyes of a 300-yard squirrel !!" oh, and my favorite scene from the movie was when the British were coming, and the only drummer who was so devoted to his work, and played to death, as if that drum could end the war altogether .. .but he wouldn't. well, that's all i want to say about this movie. OH, another thing ... blonde brown is a crazy bipolar physique that rocks BEEYOTCH. that's all.
