This film is exactly what describes its title: an attempt to convince you to buy what writers have to offer. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's fun to see the 1996 Toronto style that I remember with all its silly haircuts, sunglasses, clothes and attitude. He really hasn't changed anything; just a small urban refreshment, beautiful, safe, cheap, provincial, which is a great meeting point for international film types! It's also fun to see Kenny and Spenny go to LA and find out it's Toronto again, just with a weird assortment of beach wanderers, musicians, soothsayers and other high-end movies. <br /> <br /> I don't see Pitch as a movie to enjoy; it is not entertainment unless the spectator enjoys watching the aspirations of someone being trampled. I take Pitch as a warning about the fact that power and money are actually held by the executives and production houses of the studio. Writers, musicians and aspiring (and "successful") actors are still simple transients even when they reach the Big Time. <br /> <br /> So, Kenny and Spenny are trying to sell you a warning. Buy it or not, but the message is still there.
