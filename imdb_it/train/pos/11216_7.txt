The story is extremely unique. These are these 2 pilots who save the Earth from alien beings but have to use a special speed that makes everything around their age quickly. The whole series talks about the pilots who deal with the waste of time, friends and mentors. <br /> <br /> The COULD ending was fantastic. It started to end on a negative note and leave a real mark, but instead ended up on a superb Disney note and bothered me VERY badly. <br /> <br /> The animation is decent for 89 but cannot be compared to the present day. I also heard many complaining about the kindness of nudity. Actually I found it a bit decent. Nudity for the most part was justified except in episode 2 where there was an excess. <br /> <br /> Overall it deserves a look but the finish doesn't make it a classic.
