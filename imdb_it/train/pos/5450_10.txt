Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers. She is a waitress for her father's comparison in a small mining town. He also sells it to men. He flees to New York and literally sleeps to the top. <br /> <br /> I had originally only seen the 71-minute version, but it's rather extreme - for its time. Nowadays it is quite docile. The film moves very fast and has a lot of sexual insinuations - some of these are rather stupid (but funny) today. It moves so fast that you can easily ignore that most of it could never happen, not even in 1933. There is nothing classic or monumental about it - it's just a little cheerful, cheerfully dirty film that is a lot of fun. In the end it falls only with a small "moral" ending required by the censorship. Incredible and stupid (I saw him in a theater and the audience laughed - a boy rightly said "Absolutely not") I just saw the full 75-minute version that looks different, a little tragic and a MUCH better end . This version was thought to be lost until 2004 when it was discovered by mistake! I think this is the only one coming out - but be careful. <br /> <br /> The acting is good - Stanwyck jumps to his role and plays it very well. She makes you believe she likes to be cruel and sleep around. There are also strong supporting performances by the handsome Donald Cook and George Brent. Also look for a pre-star John Wayne in a hilarious way as a mild and gentle employee! Funny, dirty and fast. I give this at 9.
