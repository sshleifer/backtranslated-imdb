I was too young to remember when I first saw this film. But I saw it for the second time about 7 years ago. My sister told me I had to see it. Now my whole family has memorized it. We quote him at least once a day. I absolutely love this movie. I still laugh after all this time. Of course, this is a really, really drunk millionare who is irresponsible. The point is that he still has humanity lost in the others we see in the film. And who is willing to give up everything for love. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh. Lots of laughs It's a funny, sweet movie and, if you're a movie fan, it will really change your idea of ​​"Funny". Watch it with a group of your friends or your family and I promise you, you will never have anything to talk about with the Authur lines in your head. It will make you laugh for years to come. <br /> <br /> It is really difficult in my family to find a film that everyone likes. But this film, I feel, has made us closer. And I know he will do the same for you !!
