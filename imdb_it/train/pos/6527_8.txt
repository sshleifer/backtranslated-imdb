The documentary begins with setting the perspective for several light years. The traveler is traveling with our milky way with the sounds of our earthly lives, as a space monument for (possible?) Extraterrestrials. <br /> <br /> The documentary contains footage of Willy Dixen, Robert Johnson, Skip James and J.B. Lenoir. The film by J.B. has never been published before. The story is by "blind Willie" Dixon. However, it is done by an actor. The film shows the work of all these early bluesmen followed by covers and interpretations by musicians, such as Nick Cave and Bad Seeds among others. <br /> <br /> The Death of J.B. Lenoir (John Mayall's song) is a surprising event in history. Lenoir is engaged politically and is considered to be of the Martin Luther King league and peers. His political interests can be found in the themes of his texts. <br /> <br /> The blues is considered the "native American music". The blues is the roots and the rest are the fruits. <br /> <br /> The title 'Soul of a Man' is after a song by Willie Dixon.
