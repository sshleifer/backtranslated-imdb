I saw this Saturday night at the Provincetown Film Festival, and it's a "stick-to-your-bones" movie - it really stayed with me. Adapted very well from what is probably an excellent novel, it is a drama back and forth in time with completely rounded characters, reflections meditated on life choices and, I'm not exaggerating. one of the greatest casts ever assembled in over 100 years of film production. A wonderful job by everyone, led by a luminous Vanessa Redgrave as a dying and disappointed Newport matron, and Claire Danes as her much younger self. Meryl Streep's daughter, Mamie Gummer, is, like her mother, the real deal; Patrick Wilson resembles Paul Newman around 1958 and does not overdo the charm; and what a pleasure to see such excellent theatrical actors as Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins contributing with sharp and detailed cameos. Hugh Dancy, even from the stage, does not bring much advantage to the somewhat trivial role of an unfortunate rich unfortunate, and family issues are resolved perhaps more neatly than real life would allow. But it is a visually stunning meditation, deliberately about real life issues, and you can cry and not feel like you are being manipulated recklessly. Also, what a sumptuous parade of cars from the 40s / 50s.
