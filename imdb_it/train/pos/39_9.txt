This is apparently one of Shemp's first short films with the Stooges. (This excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the team). But the comic timing of the trio is at its best. Apart from the intense slapstick scenes, there are other more subtle, but equally entertaining ones. He looks at Larry when Shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot. Or look at the real object that recalls the exclamation of Moe, "Oh ... polished mahogany!" <br /> <br /> Emil Sitka is stunned in his confusion. And the goon might sound scary, but it's somehow fun. He looks frustrated and perplexed with the Stooges as are "normal" people in other short films. <br /> <br /> For Shemp fans, this is an unmissable episode. It will not disappoint.
