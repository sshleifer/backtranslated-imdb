The film really challenges your notions of identity and the society in which we live. It is well made and very powerful. The people in the film are honest and revealing of the world that exists outside the normative ideological perspective. I think it gives a great vision of a sub-culture that shakes the very ideas that the viewer has of society. Sometimes it's shocking and more powerful for this. Some parts were hard to look at, like most reality, but it's not over. It is good the first time you look at it, but the second or third time becomes even better; because you had the chance to wrap your mind on the same topics that discuss and challenge.
