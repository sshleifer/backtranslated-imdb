About two hundred members of a film company from Cleveland, Ohio, USA, called Cinematheque, gathered on August 19, 2000 to see a copy of Cinemascope by Michelangelo Antonioni from 1970, "Zabriskie Point". Filmmaker John Ewing, who does a superlative job of getting the best prints for his series, shared with the public in advance that this print was purposely piloted by Italy for this projection only. <br /> <br /> The audience was enchanted while the film was taking place on her big screen panoramic artist. Looking at this superb print, shown in the way he meant Antonioni, he realized that it is a modern work of art. It was all the more appropriate for the series to be hosted in the Cleveland Institute of Art at University Circle. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's compositions are created for the Cinemascope panorama. Its beautiful image balance, the surprising use of colors, the ample choreographic movements, are all the works of an authentic artist, who uses the screen as his canvas. <br /> <br /> Finally the public could understand "Zabriskie Point". As his narrative unfolded, it became evident that this work does not concern the story itself, but rather the impressionistic rendering of an artist of fleeting images of his subject. Setting some of the most turbulent activities of the sixties provides only a dramatic engine for the artist's overwhelming collage. <br /> <br /> Antonioni is not bound by conventional narrative standards and can stop at any time to creatively embroider an event with grand embellishments. The public went willingly with the flow of his remarkable imagination, since his enormous images on the large canvas held a person in great scruple. While the public may have been only tangentially involved in the relationships between the characters, he realized that the theme here is human re-engineering, the recurring theme of the director. <br /> <br /> It was also realized that no print smaller or lower than the original one in Cinemascope can do justice to this particular rendering. The audience was therefore much more grateful to see "Zabriskie Point" in its original and stunning format, and finally made a thunderous applause.
