"9/11", hosted by Robert De Niro, presents films from outside and inside the Twin Towers in New York, on 11 September 2001. <br /> <br /> Never too macabre and bloody, but powerful and moving. "9/11" is a real treat. Anyone who is not touched by this TV program is immune to anything. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
