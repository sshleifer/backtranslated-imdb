Before commenting on this film, you should realize that when I saw this film I expected the typical crap, horror, B-movie and I just wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is one that not only offers, but is actually one of the best I've seen in a long time. Scott McDonald is as big as Jack Frost, in fact I think he has a future in the role of psychopath in large films, if he ever had the chance. McDonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through some stupid accidental mix of ridiculous elements. As soon as that snowman starts to move and kill people, however, it will be difficult not to laugh. The lines that are said are completely delayed but really fun. The fact that the rest of the cast do completely over-act simply adds stupidity to the film, but it's stupidity that is brilliant. The scene in which the snowman is with the teenager is really classic in B-movie, the fashion of horror movies. I really hope there's a sequel and I'll be there to see it on any cable channel. Obviously it's fun to watch the first few times and it's not exactly a good job with film technology, but I like to see snowmen kill people. I gave a 7 out of 10, this is a great movie for dates and couples in late hours.
