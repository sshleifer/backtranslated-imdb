Someone has already said "be in the right place at the right time". It was so true for this documentary that I had doubts about the genuineness of the scenes and I thought it perhaps included some acting, but it is not. It's all true. History is nothing new to people in developing and / or poor countries. It highlights the manipulation of the people by the corporate media, the disinformation, the artificial polarization of the people by deliberately creating tensions in the streets, sometimes to the point that the army, the intelligence agency or even the government (many believe, guided from the United States) uses agents who attack "any" part to provoke the masses to violence and thus justify their coups. A naval officer in the film also mentions this. Who wanted to see peoples confronting each other on the streets. All these scenarios have been played in Turkey (US companion dog in the Middle East) in the course of its history that has experienced 3 coups and lately, secret plans made by the Turkish army have been exposed, ironically, through a pro-government government / conservative opposing the a-religious doctrines of the army, in which a very important mosque is bombarded by an army officer to provoke people etc. <br /> <br /> What makes this film unique is that they were shooting from the inside, perhaps by accident, when events happened. It is clear that the directors are pro Chavez. I don't know if this caused the directors to filter and manipulate events and information, I don't know. <br /> <br /> And if Chavez will defend the people of Venezuela against the dictatorship of the United States and the global economy without forcefully suppressing the opposite thought and eventually becoming a self-indulgent tyrant, history will tell. <br /> <br /> But at least Chavez is hope and I think it's worth taking the opportunity.
