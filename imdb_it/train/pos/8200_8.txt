Clint Eastwood has certainly produced better films than this one, but this does not embarrass him. Dirty Harry catches everyone's attention and, unless you want to look at romance, there's no reason why you won't like it. It's nice because it's dirty, it's great because it kills without thinking too much, it's perfect because it gets the bullet through your heart and a hero because it doesn't care. <br /> <br /> From what I've seen in the films Eastwood plays, the main character always captures the audience. In the heart of White Hunter Black, he is the crazy director, in "In the Line of Fire" is the "Old Man" while here he is the "almost" without work with his work, which is to say that he does the job alone , he doesn't care about his superiors who practically send him off for a holiday. <br /> <br /> Based on a rape victim, this film is promising for all the "senseless" movie watchers. it has nothing that deviates from the central plot, however, what makes it slightly inferior to Eastwood's best films is that although the character of the protagonist is captivating, the plot is not, since it is all too obvious from the beginning. movie that will make you sit in one place without moving, and there are too many more dirty people than Dirty Harry.
