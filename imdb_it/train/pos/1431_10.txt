This is simply the most amazing film you've ever seen. I thought it was just another documentary, but in reality it's something else. It doesn't try to teach you anything, it shows you how life works in nature. <br /> <br /> I will not talk about the quality of the images, because obviously from the other comments it has no equal. <br /> <br /> The earth is fun, tense and sad. It can make you laugh, it can make you cry. Sometimes both at the same time. This is the first film that made me cry, not because you feel sorry for the animals, but because you realize how fragile our planet is and what a treasure we have been blessed with, but we don't appreciate it a little. /> <br /> This film should be shown mandatory in schools. It's the most wonderful movie you've ever seen, so go see it. Who knows, maybe it's the last time we could see our planet like this ... <br /> <br /> 10/10, but I'd classify it easily if it were possible.
