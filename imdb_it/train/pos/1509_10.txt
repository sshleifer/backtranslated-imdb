The British horror film was in terminal decline in the early 1970s, but from the darkness came three films that were among the best produced by our island. The Wickerman, Blood on Satan's Claw and The House That Dripped Blood made the future look rosy, although many people knew that at this point there wouldn't be one. THTDB has the kind of cast that could easily form a wish list, if it wasn't actually assembled, in the desolate backcountry of 2008 you might find yourself expecting to wake up. Waxworks is the most overlooked of the four stories and is, of course, my favorite, Cushing's life and art are so tightly interconnected that you can't know where the performance ends and the pain begins. One can only imagine how this role influenced such a kind and sensitive man. Death and the girl. RIP Peter.
