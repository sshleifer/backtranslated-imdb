All I can say is that if you don't fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie, then you're not human! Even after looking at it for the first time, I was conquered. It is a fascinating experience that is difficult to describe, as I am sure the other fans will confirm it. After seeing it, you would cry to think that these two wonderful women are no longer with us. At least we have Gray Gardens to remember them! I think we crave to have the proud independence with which these two women have been honored. Although I have always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy, she does not remain in the heart like Big and Little Edie. What a rare surprise to have met these people; I just wish I had!
