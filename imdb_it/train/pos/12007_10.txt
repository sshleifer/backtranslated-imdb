This is one of the most spiritual films I've ever seen. I headed with about 150 people to San Giorgio and we saw this film in the visitor center of the temple of San Giorgio .. No one had dry eyes in the public. Moreover, in the public there were non-religious and anti-Mormon people who felt the spirit of the film and were touched by the captivating music and the reconstruction of the history of the pioneers and the difficulties they faced because of their beliefs. /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who wants to understand more about Joseph and the difficulties pioneers have gone through. After all, it's part of American history.
