The film is very realistic. Absolutely, it does not belong to the Hollywood Cinema genre where every line must be pronounced perfectly and where every move is precise. The actors who play the roles of lovers make a BIG job that represents the feelings and thoughts of the characters - their daily adventures. Overall, the film culminates the viewer in a state of depression. This is where the realism of the whole story is evident. Not everything happens the way we think it should happen. I can say however that the film does not end with a negative note. We look, we learn, we experience ourselves. This is probably the moral of this story.
