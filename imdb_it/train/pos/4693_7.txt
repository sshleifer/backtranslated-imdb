Johnny Dangerously falls completely into the hit or miss category with his exaggerated gags and the complete lack of a complete script or a story that makes sense. But that's the point, right? <br /> <br /> The cast is nice; Michael Keaton is an excellent comedian before taking himself too seriously over the years. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all perform enthusiastically and at least make me laugh a lot. But the complete thief of scenes here is Richard Dimitri (introducing the word "Iceholes" in the history of cinema) as a gangster who is better suited to the murder of English. <br /> <br /> I associate many childhood memories with this film, as I watched it very often so maybe I'm inclined to enjoy it more than most. Johnny Dangerously is at least a parody of the completely innocent gangster film that also conveys meaningful messages about the dangers of smoking (and sex). I like it but it's hard to recommend. <br /> 7 br /> 10.
