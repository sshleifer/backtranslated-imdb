The chameleonic performance by Kurt Russell, combined with John Carpenter's flawless film production, makes this, without a doubt, one of the best biotubes ever seen on the air. It also rises: the emotional foundation is strong enough to never grow old; Carpenter has preserved the power and extreme intensity of life of the only King of Rock and Roll for posterity. (I had been a borderline Elvis fan for most of my life, but it wasn't until I saw this incredibly moving film that I looked BEYOND the image of the man himself. It was a real revelation.) ELVIS remains one of the ten best movies for TV of all time.
