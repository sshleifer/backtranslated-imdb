I consider this 10 out of 10. Why? <br /> <br /> * Provides information on something I hardly understand - surfers navigate because that's all they want to do; Nothing else seems to matter as much for them as for surfing; Nor is it a temporary thing - it's a life for these guys * Buried in the film is a great surfing story; I've never surfed, but I love surfing movies and I've seen a lot of them. No one taught me what this film did * The film was very well taken care of. It flowed well Interviews were exceptional * It is interesting from the beginning to the end <br /> <br /> In summary, it is a valid documentary what I have seen, so I have to evaluate in terms of that. Then 10/10
