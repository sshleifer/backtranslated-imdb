This is an enchanting story of obsession with fault. <br /> <br /> Matiss, in a lonely night walk in Riga (?) Pass by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing. Pass without a word. Only the spray in the water followed by a cry for help makes him act. And then only too little and too late. <br /> <br /> The film tells of his efforts to find out more about women. On a troll of local bars, find his wallet. He increasingly divides his life together. His "look" changes as his obsession grows. He has to fix things. In a wonderfully filmed dialogue with the "ex-bastard boy" he forces Alexej to face the guilt they both feel. <br /> <br /> Haunting long take, a gritty soundtrack to accentuate guilt, barking dogs. Steps. Nice film noir with a lovely touch. A good indie finale.
