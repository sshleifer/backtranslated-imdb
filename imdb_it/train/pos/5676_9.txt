SERIE TRE - BLACKADDER THE THIRD "If you want something done correctly, kill Baldrick before you start." In the wake of the second series the show is back with the current owner of the famous name on his fortune and serving as a butler at the Prince Regent, a vain and stupid film for Blackadders' poison, played by Hugh Laurie. Baldrick is still in the wake of the other piece of the comedy puzzle. The format is similar to the previous show, after all they had now found the winning formula to change things. We see Blackadder trying to get rich from the back of the naive gullible in many more ingenious ways, trying to make Bladrick a M.P.o trying to spoil a suitable bride for the prince. In many ways this is one of the most accurate series in history, the regent prince took control of the throne during his fathers for madness and some of the bewitched characters tell a lot about the times. Samuel Johnson, William Pit and Wellington pass all the events and everyone manages to steal their scenes, it's not an easy thing with such a stellar cast
