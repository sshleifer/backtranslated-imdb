The great and underestimated Marion Davies shows her things in this late 1928 comedy, which also shows the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a kick from Georgia that crashes into Hollywood with Haines' help. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. A great lampoon on Hollywood and its claims. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team (too bad they never did a talkie together) and photos of Charlie Chaplin's guests, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are one hoot. A must for any serious cinema enthusiast or anyone interested in Marion Davies still defamed!
