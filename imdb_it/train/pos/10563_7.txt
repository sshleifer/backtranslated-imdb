Wow ... what ... a whirlwind. The 30s are a decade with a lot of movies of all kinds that I can imagine, especially during the initial phase of talkies. There were films that are painfully static and boring, like "Dracula" with Bella Lugosi, and there were those who didn't give him rest, sometimes in a good way and sometimes not. This is one of the films that does not stop for a minute, and is both a prodigy and a sin. Lloyd Bacon, who also directed "42nd Street", must have been the king of the Depression Era musicals and was probably excited by the possibilities that sound brought to the world of cinema because he filled this image with it. There must not be a minute or two whole without music or someone talking. He's completely crazy! I thought the film deserved a 5 (or a 6, the maximum) because the pace was very poor, since it was incredibly fast and sometimes I didn't know what was happening and what to think. The characters seemed to just run up and down the places, talk about things that didn't interest me and probably no one else. I thought I would be rewarded with a small headache. I noticed that Lloyd Bacon also played the female lead in "42nd Street", Ruby Keeler, and "42nd Street" was a movie whose ending was the best part. And you know what? The same happened with "Footlight Parade"! The finish is absolutely amazing! It has undoubtedly become the most impressive musical I've ever seen. The final part presents us with some musical numbers and those are, believe me, something that makes it worth seeing the other rest of the film. The numbers are impeccable! There are three great pieces and the most impressive is certainly the second. Suddenly the screen was full of fantastic and imaginative photographic works, nice people and a simple entertainment that made me forget my little headache.
