I went to this movie without knowing anything, and I ended up enjoying it. Lack of authenticity and credibility - Some of the things the characters said and did were completely bizarre, and most of the script seemed to have been violated (maybe this is typical of Woody Allen? Excuse my ignorance) but the whole audience in the theater was laughing like that strong. It wasn't even the jokes of the movie itself, but the whole movie itself. The acting reminded me of the acting of Seinfeld, where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes - they are trivial, but if you don't take the film too seriously, you can really appreciate the ACTORS 'humor, not the CHARACTERS. If you're looking for a random movie, and you like Woody Allen, I would definitely recommend it!
