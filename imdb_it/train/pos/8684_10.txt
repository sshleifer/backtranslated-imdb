This is one of the first and best Columbos, with Robert Culp and Ray Milland. Robert Culp appeared on another Columbo, as well as several other villains, including Patrick McGoohan, William Shatner and Jack Cassidy. Ray Milland also appeared later. <br /> <br /> In this, Ray Milland is convinced that his beautiful wife, played by Patricia Crowley, has a relationship, so he hires Culp to investigate. Culp has blackmailing business on the side, so he gives Milland a false report and threatens Crowley with the real one if he doesn't pay. They enter a huge fight in Culp's house and she ends up killing. Enter Columbo. <br /> <br /> Culp does everything it can to bring Columbo out of the case, even offering him a job, but Columbo is close to him from the start. <br /> <br /> Great episode.
