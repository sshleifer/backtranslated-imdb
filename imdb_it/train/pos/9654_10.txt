Stephane Rideau was already a star on his tour de force in "Wild Reeds", and is one of the biggest indie stars in France. In this film, he plays Cedric, a local boy who meets the Mathieu holiday (the newcomer Jamie Elkaim, in a breathtaking, nuanced and ethereal show) on the beach. Mathieu has a complex relationship with his sick mother, who requires aunt and sister (with whom she has a competitive relationship). Soon, the two are falling in love. <br /> <br /> The fragmented narrative of the film - which includes long flashbacks, fragments of the present and real-time forward movements in the future - - is a bit daunting. Director Sebastien Lifshitz does not indicate which period we are in and the plot may be difficult to follow. But take it out: the last 45 minutes of the movie are so compelling that you won't be able to look away from the screen. In turn shocking and encouraging, this film features "Beautiful Thing" as a cinema not to be missed.
