There was not a day in 2002 when I was not chased by a scarecrow. I heard that this movie was a serious problem well <br /> <br /> It brought back many memories because it was so realistic. > <br /> I still have nightmares on the cob today, and I can't even get close to the things in the box for fear of my life <br /> <br /> I have to admit that, at some point in the film I have to switch it off as it too close to home <br /> <br /> For those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow, watching this movie you could be instructed on how we felt victims <br /> <br /> this movie there teach me not to take life for granted or ruin the grain, believe me, I've been there and I have scars <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, it's amazing and educational
