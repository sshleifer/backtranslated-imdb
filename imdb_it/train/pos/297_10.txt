I'm glad the others enjoyed this movie, because I know it doesn't have the greatest reputation and didn't make any money at the box office. I thought it was fantastic and there are several reasons why - Bogdanovich director with the lightest touch, the cast (in particular Coleen Camp) is perfect and the Big Bad Apple has never been a better film. You've seen worse movies!
