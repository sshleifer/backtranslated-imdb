This movie is fantastic. The plot is very faithful to the book which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The film begins with a scene in which Hank sings a song with a group of kids called "when you put your toe on the moon". It reminds me of the Sinatra High Hopes song, it's fun and challenging. The music is great throughout and my favorite song is sung by the king, Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir "Saggy" Sagamore. For everything, a great family film or even a great movie of events. This is a movie that you can watch over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is wonderful. I love this movie !! If you liked Danny Kaye in Court Jester, you will surely like this movie.
