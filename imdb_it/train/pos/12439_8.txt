While the main story should take place in Morocco, this film was shot in the misty Romania in 18 days on a very tight budget. However broken their cards may be, the actors and the crew play them with remarkable skill and commitment, so I finally found the result both moving and graceful. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau offers a formidable performance as a villain. The script and direction provide some gems. Whether or not you like the movie, however, it will probably depend on your performance as Alexandra Staden in the title role. Other reviewers have highlighted Staden's inadequacies as Modesty Blaise. They might have a point, but I found his interpretation to be delightful and very suitable. Modesty manages to overcome terrible odds through discipline, innate talent and courage. Staden seems to do the same here.
