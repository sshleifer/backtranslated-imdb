"Now in the sunny climate of India, where I spend my time as a soldier in the service of His Majesty the Queen ..." says the famous poem written by Rudyard Kipling. This is the literal basis on which the movie "Gunga Din" is based. If you're lucky enough to watch this legendary Classic, you'll appreciate the movies the way they use them; for pure pleasure. Taken from the screenplay by the established novelist and poet, this is the story of a humble Indian native named Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) who works as "a regimental beast" during the British occupation of India in the 18th century. His greatest wish is to become a soldier. The water boy is part of a British Calvary contingent threatened with death by a notorious Kali blood cult called "Thuggee". Three particular soldiers stand out in this company known for their courage and their camaraderie. The first is handsome and casual, Cary Grant plays the sergeant. Archibald Cutter. The next is Victor McLaglen as a brave sergeant. MacChesney and finally there is the sparkling Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Sgt. Thomas Ballantine. All three of their comrades are surrounded by a group of mountain stranglers led by their fanatic leader called "Guru" (Eduardo Ciannelli). Amidst the chaos of war, there is the brave water boy who hopes to earn a place in the army by playing a trumpet he found. A solid story for an old black and white movie that needs a little fanfare for anyone who wants to enjoy a classic. ****
