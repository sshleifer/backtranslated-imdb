Well, this could be one of the most entertaining movies of all time, and Sandy offers a tour-de-force performance! Alas, his career never took off, but - in the end - he will always be remembered for his three first-rate photos: "The King of Comedy", "Dallas Doll" and "Without You I'm Nothing". She wears characters other than the New York socialite to Diana Ross to create a sharp and hilarious critique of popular culture in America. Sexy and fierce, tender and sensual, philosophical and melancholic, it convinces the public in every scene, and is actually "really pretty". Watch this (if you are not from Iowa), you will surely like it !!
