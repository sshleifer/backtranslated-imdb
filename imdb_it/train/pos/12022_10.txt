As a big fan of the original, I avoided this movie like the plague when the negative reviews started eight years ago, but I just finished watching this movie and found it a really nice surprise. <br /> <br /> Ok, if you're looking for a reconstructed original, you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking for something completely different, a little edgy and political, then this is the movie for you . <br /> <br /> Gregory is now thirty-three years old and works as a teacher in his old comprehensive school, where he is chased by a fellow teacher and has sexual dreams about one of his students. When the student insists on meeting with Gregory, this leads to a series of mishaps that include torture, breaks and income and all sorts of unexpected twists that made me feel euphoric and moved. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something original, then I highly recommend this movie. I just hope more people went to see this when it was released and seen for what it really is.
