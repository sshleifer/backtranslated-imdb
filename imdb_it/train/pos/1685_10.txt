I saw this film for the first time around 1990, and I absolutely died laughing about it. It has become a favorite cult with my circle of friends, and we mentioned it at the drop of a hat ("I go home in a bag!"). Needless to say, humor is still there 15 years later. It has become a tradition during Halloween to expose many of my new friends to this movie (still good you can buy it from Ebay!) I found that Halloween candies have a much better taste with your tongue firmly planted on your cheek. and this film provides everything - pathos, suspense, unrequited love, nobility and the list goes on. Royal Dano offers an incredible sentimental performance like Old Man Wrenchmuller. I remember seeing him in "The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao" as a bad boy who met a bad end. Here, you really feel for the old from the beginning. <br /> <br /> If you're not careful, you'll lose some of the levels of humor in this movie. The creators have become really imperceptible in many ways with impromptu comments, small costume shots in other science fiction films and even a scene torn from the pages of Wile E. Coyote! <br /> <br /> Do not spend too many thought processes trying to analyze a film, people - this is a fun rate without the need to be fussy, and it should not be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people , but will not know that they are mocked ..). <br /> <br /> - Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go get a "Zag-nut" bar .... <br /> <br /> -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, karaoke DJ / entertainer
