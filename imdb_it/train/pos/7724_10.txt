Sure Star Wars (a movie I've seen at least fifty times) beats everyone else in special effects, but this movie has everything else! <br /> <br /> He has horror (not graphic), romance, robot, witty answer and wit, intelligence, (surprisingly well) special effects and drama. <br /> <br /> I saw this film a couple of years ago in a revival with a new imprint, and I was surprised by how well I turned up today. I thought that old-fashioned 40s electronics would seem a bit cavernous, but somehow they looked futuristic and modern. <br /> <br /> Ann Francis here (mostly) short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence hard to beat a revival from me. <br /> <br /> The Krell monster that appears among the rays still scares the bejebees from me. <br /> <br /> Of course we all know that the "Great Bird of the Galaxy" probably modeled a lot of "Star Trek" from this movie. <br /> <br /> No one has yet beaten Robby, the Robot, in terms of personality <br /> <br /> (sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). <br /> <br /> This film, overall, is the standard that all other science fiction films will have to measure up to! <br /> <br /> Honorable mention for the disturbing electronic score that kept us all on pins and needles.
