This film was released the year I was born and will be, like me, 70 in 2007. I watched it again last night without having seen it since high school. While it was full of the feeling of the 1930s and the acting was a bit stereotyped, however, it was superb. The story of Pearl S. Buck came true thanks to the magic of chemistry by Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel that earned Mrs Buck the Nobel Prize for Literature comes to life under the direction of Sydney Franklin who along with an excellent script tells the story of the peasant farmer, Wang Lung, whose father gets a bride for him, a slave from the kitchen of a local landlord. In Buck's story, Wang's success is assured by his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time, and love of the land. In the end he understands that his wife, like the earth, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. Buck's stories have always had strong women expressed at a critical point to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. Luise Rainer, born in Germany, brings to life a tentative but determined peasant woman in her portrait of Olan. Muni likewise captures the naive but honorable Wang, eventually caught between the two worlds of the rich and the peasants. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin, Dorothy Gale's Kansan Uncle Henry of the Wizard of Oz, Walter Connelly as the wailing and encouraging uncle and Keye Luke as number one, but this time, not Charlie Chan's. <br /> <br /> A classic could be defined as a film that you can watch over and over again and never get tired. If this is indeed the case, this film is a classic, no doubt whatsoever.
