I heard about this film for the first time about 20 years ago, when I was a child of elementary school (!), It happened that I was looking through the encyclopedias in class one day, and under the voice for film (or cinema, I don't I remember), there were several frames for several mainstream films at experimental, and one of them shown on the page was an OffOn still. It really intrigued me, since it stood out more on the page (it was a catch from the movie of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed on it). <br /> <br /> Some 18 years later, the public library here where I live had the entire set of 4 "Treasures of American Film Archives" DVDs published by the National Film Preservation Foundation available for checkout. So, while I was reading the notes on DVD cases for the set, I was pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was on one of the discs. After all these years, I finally saw the movie! After seeing it, it wasn't a while that I expected it to be (it tended to be a more organic-looking film, not a bad thing, but I expected it to have a more electronic aesthetic), but it was still a movie impressive, IMHO, considering the techniques used by Scott Bartlett for the film, including the hand coloring of the film itself, and the use of video equipment for some scenes in the film (taken from a video monitor), giving it an anguished look, the -res. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, the techniques used in this film were quite revolutionary for 1972. That's why it's still one of my favorite short films / experimental films, and a creative inspiration for me too ...
