I lost most of the first season, but when the other shows went to replicate, I started watching. I ended up buying the entire first season of iTunes. This is now one of my favorite comedy shows. Patrick Warburton is the key. His dry sense of humor makes me turn all the time. David Spade is fun, but sometimes a little Russell does a lot. I like the other cast members better (but I'm not saying I don't add to the show). Do yourself a favor. <br /> <br /> If you haven't checked this, try. If you can capture the episode where "Jeff" goes to the seed bank, you will see how good this show is. <br /> <br /> I hope this series has a long run.
