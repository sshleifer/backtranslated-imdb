I found this movie quite by accident, but I'm glad I did. Kenneth Branagh's performance came close to stealing this film from Helena Bonham Carter, but their strong chemistry has made a much more fun movie together. This film reminded me of Branagh's excellent films with Emma Thompson. The Carter star turns here as a young disabled woman who tries to complete herself has been a good performance as I have seen from a female protagonist for a long time. Portraying a disabled person is difficult to accomplish, but basically just his eyes to show his pain for his situation in life, has made him so believable. If this movie came out after the current wave of movies with beautiful "ugly" women for roles (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I'm sure Carter would have had a strong consideration for an Oscar. If you happen to find this movie on TV late at night like me, trust me, it's worth sleeping.
