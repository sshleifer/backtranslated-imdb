This is a very rare example of a film about transvestism (of heterosexuals). The film deals with the taboo theme in such a way that even a general public that does not know transvestism at all strongly sympathizes with its main character. Adrian Pasdar is very credible as Gerald / Geraldine and should not be forgotten for this brilliant acting. Christopher Monger's direction is very sensitive, treating a theme so difficult in an excellent way, enclosed in a beautiful story. Not a great film, nor an "art" film, but a small, enchanting film!
