What a fun b-movie! Shepis is absolutely beautiful and the Scarecrow is a distinct and original. He really brought me back to the monsters of the 80s. The budget is obviously low and not everyone is Pacino behind the goal, but it doesn't matter because he never takes himself seriously. From the red garbage trailer to the Scarecrow's high martial arts marches, this is really a b-movie gem. Get some refreshments, snacks and a couple of friends and relax. I liked this movie so much that I came out with a purchase of all 3 Scarecrow movies. Of course, they are not for everyone but for everyone their own. Sometimes you just have to lower the thinking hood and smile.
