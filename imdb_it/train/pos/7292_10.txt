I got to see him this last Friday at the Laemlee's Los Angeles Film Festival on Beverly. This film received the most applause of all the films that evening. Considering that two music videos were opened first, I didn't know what to expect since they were very fast and attracted attention, I wasn't sure if I was ready for a short time. But to my surprise I really liked this. I thought the main demon of the actor was really good. I was so impressed with his performance that I checked his name. I was surprised to see that this was the Witchblade type. Since then he has become really good! Either that or he was given a bad role or he was pushed by the director really hard for this short. The girl did a good job. I guess it's tough since it was his first performance and being so young. Dad also did well. There was a lot of really nice CG work for a short film, both for this and for the short film after the "Mexican Hat" which was also nice, but I liked it better because it had the maximum depth and emotion and I really cared of the characters. The other was a very simple story. The story was rather illustrative and obscure! He has dealt with real topics using a more fantastic approach to keeping ADD people interested in me. We won't even talk about the last movie in the block I left. My only complaint is that I only wish I had seen more of the demon character and a little less to start with, which is why I gave a 9 out of 10. I also thought that the end credits went a little slowly. Otherwise it has been beautifully told, directed and modified. The timing was very nice with a complete change from the fast MTV editing done on everything today. There will be more from this director in the future and from the actor. Now I'll think of him as the Sorrows Lost actor, not the Witchblade type.
