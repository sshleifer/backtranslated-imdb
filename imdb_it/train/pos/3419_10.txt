Having just "hosted my 23 year old daughter in Iraq, Camp Anaconda's medical support unit, I felt compelled to take this DVD. I wanted to hear other feelings from returning vets to try to understand better his mentality upon arrival and not waiting until after something bad has happened. Regardless of your vision of war and peace, this film is a great start for all Americans to begin healing our returning vets. A fundamental claim of the entire film is "Act" on the problem. Incredibly exciting film. infinite. <br /> <br /> Forward forward almost a year later & My daughter saw this DVD She took her emotions into consideration and actually took the i commitment to re-up for another 6 years. His way of dealing with time spent in the sand is that she did good. The local children of Balad received top quality medical care for various common ailments that they normally could not afford for free with an escort and a translator. His look behind his Iraq tour was. "We changed some hearts and minds back there." Great DVD you have to keep an open mind and see all sides
