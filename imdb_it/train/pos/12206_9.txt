Of all the noir films of the 40s and 50s, this must be considered one of the strangest and most fun to watch. I say this because of the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> The first two names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two that made this movie so funny, especially Anders. His character, "George Grisby," is one of the strangest people I've ever seen in the film. His voice, and some of the things he said, must be heard to be believed. Slaone is not far behind in the "strange" category. Hayworth is not so glamorous with short, blonde hair but is still Hayworth, which means a lot to watch if you are a boy. Welles is as charming as ever. A tip: if you have the DVD, activate the subtitles in English. His character in this film is an Irishman and you need subtitles to understand everything he says. <br /> <br /> Welles also directed the film, which means you have great camera angles and wonderful close-ups. You also have a unique ending, visually, with a shooting in a house of mirrors. Big things! As bizarre as this film, I always thought that the carnival-like atmosphere of a buffoon during the process towards the end was too much and took away the seriousness of the scene. Apart from that, no complaints. <br /> <br /> This is great fun, which is the name of the game.
