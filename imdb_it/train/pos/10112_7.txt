Originally I captured it in 1996 in its one-week run at the cinema. I was impressed and my feelings haven't changed much. <br /> <br /> Documentary about the infamous Edward D. Wood Jr. which tells about his life and his films. There are interviews with people who worked with him or who knew him. They include: Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with movie clips or some bizarre recreations. Interesting (a little) but was it really necessary? I've seen all of Wood's films and they're just terrible. Wood had ambitions but not a little talent to carry them out. I wouldn't say he was the worst director ever, but he's over there. Do we really need a docu about a mediocre director? I like the fact that they didn't try to make Wood out a kind of saint. More than a few of those interviewed (in particular Lugosi Jr.) hated the man very much and he arrives clear and strong. They also totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 60s and 70s. However it is interesting if you are a fan of Wood. The best interviews are with Vampira (who weeps Wood apart) and Dolores Fuller (a long-time girlfriend).
