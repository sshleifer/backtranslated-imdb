I have no idea why this movie has such a nasty hit from so many IMDb users (someone is saying it's his worst movie ever.) Has anyone of you ever seen Cradle 2 The Grave?) My favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid, and just an excuse to hang all the action sequences. Duh! What the fuck did you expect from a Jet Li movie? Do you honestly believe that someone invented the story, then just loaded it with action? Obviously not! Black Mask is impressive, wall-to-wall action for almost the entire run time. It's also deliciously creepy, and we get a lot of cut arts, beheadings, and creative ways of looking at the bad guys (and a whole lot of innocent people!) They get slaughtered. Most of Li's other martial arts films are kindergarten compared to Black Mask; you cannot withhold gratuitous violence, bloodshed or action sequences! And this made me a happy camper. Again: if you go to a Jet Li movie waiting for a great dialogue and an intriguing storyline, you're going for the wrong reasons. Black Mask is probably my favorite of his films (though, watch out for the horrendous dubbing).
