I saw this movie with my family and it was great! This film is more than just a documentary (which offers no more cold facts) with long mono / duologue and many graphics ... The complete "power" of this film comes from the impressive images that are filmed underwater, in the air or the Arctic. With the vision of this film you can learn more about our planet that with the simple reading of a book, shows that WE are inserted in the circular flow of life. This film is not just for "environmental fanatics", although people who want to watch a good movie with a message should watch it. This film has taught me that we do not live alone on earth ... we live with and through the earth and all plants and animals grow and die with us.
