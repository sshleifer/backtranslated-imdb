This film struck me as a project that had many of the right ingredients, but somewhere along the way they didn't come together. I don't know who made it, but it looks slightly Disney. While parts of it are unlikely (such as when a pre-teenager runs for a public office) and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously, there is a healthy dose of normality (whatever it is) to keep things balanced and in perspective. Acting is fine. Strangely, the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a little ... outside. It is interesting to see how he must work hard to maintain a balance between his best friend, his grandmother and his two passions: ballet and baseball. Being a baseball player myself, it was pretty painful to see Frankie try to keep up with a team of guys, but he does a good job of showing the fight he faces. I read somewhere that she's not really a dancer, but the editing in this film did a great job of making her dancing look not only natural but beautiful. Overall, it was a good film about honesty and ambition, but his star Mischa Barton did not reach the level of realism we saw during his performances in "Lawn Dogs", "Lost and Delirious", and the his small but shocking performance opposite Haley Joel Osment in "The Sixth Sense".
