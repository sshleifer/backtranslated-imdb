Ayone whimpering about the way this movie sucked or had no plot had to look for "Jean de Florrette". HELLO! this film was made to be a casual comedy and in no way implies a plot in any way shape or form. I would also like to remind these whiners that if you are going to skin the shit out of this movie they seem to miss the point. This film is clearly made for people who do not appreciate the so-called "American humor", which seems to me only a bunch of junk. The point is that everyone has an opinion and you should be a little more appreciative of the fact that some people's sense of humor may not be in line with yours before you take your mouth off. <br /> <br /> Thanks
