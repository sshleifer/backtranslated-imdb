We showed this film to the local Film Society, and the art-house audience had time for their film lives. It is tasteless, fantastic and very funny in a sixties way. The sketch of the Kraft Kitchen recipe made them laugh like maniacs. The rest is a mixed bag, but the highs definitely beat the minimums. By the way, whatever happened to Ken Shapiro ??
