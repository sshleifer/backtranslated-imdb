Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. It is so interesting to see how a world leader (like Chavez) who supports poor people in his country, can be held in such low esteem in the United States. His worst "sin", in my opinion, worries about those at the bottom of the barrel. What can be wrong with that? I've always been fascinated by the US government and the media's reaction to Fidel Castro. At first, Castro was a good boy (around 1959) when he supplanted Batista. Soon, however, Castro began to turn Cuban societies towards the needs of the poor instead of fat cats. We are a decent country, but why do our media and the government have a problem with sharing with the poor? If these kids are "dictators", then we could use more "dictatorships", especially where the poorest of the world's poor live.
