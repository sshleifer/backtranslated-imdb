One of the most touching foreign films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The girl is an incredible talent. Stellar performances by her (Doggie), the old (the king of the masks) and Liang (the living Boddhisatva). <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) The deplorable treatment of children, especially females, is disturbing. /> <br /> I liked the music. The original Chinese dialogue intensifies the emotional intensity of performances and history. <br /> <br /> This is a MUST SEE - fun family movies, though not for very young children. He would have evaluated the DVD version even higher if the soundtrack had been better transferred to the DVD and the transfer included the widescreen version.
