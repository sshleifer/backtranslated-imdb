I loved this movie and so did the audience I saw it with in Los Angeles. After the film, many people cried and said how much the film had hit them. I can understand why it was a great success in his homeland, Sweden. The film is masterfully directed and each character is brilliantly designed in such a way that in the end you really know these people and you care about them. The music is very natural and the main song of the film is rather heartbreaking but stimulating. I would certainly recommend this film to anyone to see it, even to people who don't normally go on subtitled movies. The Oscar nomination for the deep themes of the film that are reflected unpretentiously in a community of small towns with ordinary people is absolutely deserved. It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit. MUST SEE!
