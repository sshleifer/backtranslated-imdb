The story is about a little girl who grew up in colonial Africa, but it is much more. <br /> <br /> Anyone growing up in the South would experience the same things. A desire for another, one of a different race, which cannot be consumed. Even a look is forbidden. There are no words needed. Their facial expressions say it all. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a black servant, Protèe (Isaach De Bankolé) and a white woman, Aimée (Giulia Boschi). Their mutual desire is so strong that they torture each other because they can't have each other. <br /> <br /> The girl, France (Cécile Ducasse) is alone and spends all her time with Protée. You really can't see this dance. <br /> <br /> One of the most annoying aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonials. They can't even undress to go to bed alone. There the world is about to end; they simply don't know it yet. Their racist attitudes will be erased by their presence. <br /> <br /> I think I'd like to visit this Africa. He looks so calm; especially at night when you only hear animals.
