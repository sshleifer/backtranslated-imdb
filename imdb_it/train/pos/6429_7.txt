If movies are to be believed, Chinese ghosts are much more beautiful and more mischievous than their Western counterparts. The plots of the three films of 'Chinese Ghost' are largely identical, but the direction is excellent and the detail and color are such that it is not a huge problem. As always, humor is an integral part of the film, accompanied, of course, by a great deal of aggression. For those who have not yet met the 'Chinese GhostStory' trilogy, this film offers an interesting detachment from the western horror / ghost genre; for those who have, another pleasant experience in the world of Chinese ghosts.
