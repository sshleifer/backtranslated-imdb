Snobs and pseudo experts consider him "far from the best of De Sica". Those who suffer from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem in connection with this masterpiece. De Sica spoke very directly. His Italian character does not have the complicated self-examination of modern Italian filmmakers, nor the bitter parody of himself by Pietro Germi, Mario Monicelli's bittersweet bittersweet, Visconti's solemnity or Antonioni's cold observation. De Sica told us the stories like a father sitting on the edge of his children's bed before going to sleep. There is no attempt to intellectualize. Miracle In Milan and, to a lesser extent, The Last Judgment are realistic fairy tales, or what we now call magical realism. The film is a jewel from start to finish and Toto is the kind of character you accept with an open heart but, of course, requires you to have a heart. Cinema in its purest form. Magnificent.
