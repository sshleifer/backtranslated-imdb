In light of the negative reviews - or car accidents - I feel I have to gear up and do a show to give credit where due, and do a service. I'm not sure people have the license to say that it was so bad, almost automatically. <br /> <br /> It is rare for a film to have SUSPENSE. This film has kept the suspense all along, for me, despite any flaws. How many movies can they say? Not even many large. Because of the simple premise, it is not known if people will come out of the life-threatening situation, which lasts the entire film. Yeh, the suspension was tight, and for some bumps the shocks worked. It's not just a TV movie, but an action movie; there is no point where it stops, or deviates, or becomes talky. It would be difficult to make a film like this, always on the road. Only Duel, or Speed, are what I remember. The best thing about them was the constant tension. <br /> <br /> ACTING is not bad: the judge is as good as ever, and the others are. <br /> <br /> SCRIPT is good. But the jury doesn't know if sometimes it can be - or seems to be - a little crooked. What seems unrealistic is not necessarily so. Your first judgments are not always right, but I think the main actor was right to be in this film. <br /> <br /> STUNTS are mostly fantastic, especially for a TV movie. Their only lack may be the remarkable, and still, apparent, low speed. But we all know how absurd the Grand Prix car can seem. <br /> <br /> I liked that THE BEGINNING said, "inspired by a true story". So you're not going to go as much as you do? You just know that the base is. The usual "based on a true story" makes me think that it should be mostly true. But maybe it's my mistake. <br /> <br /> HOW TO SAVE THEM: Good idea for the reviewer to suggest a tow truck to lift the rear wheels. A few inches would be enough. An acrobatic pilot could do it at 100 mph. Strange that they didn't call a car expert - or an electrician or mechanic - to see if there's a way. <br /> <br /> I hope this review has put in order that this film is a disaster. Or at least neutral. And help him become a runaway success. <br /> <br /> The quality of the pic is a bit soft for a DVD. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They would have been drawn by hand after the child was, but strangely that the lifesaving idea was intelligently treated in some playful conversations to vanish. I think we know why. End of the film The suspension of disbelief came out of the upper window with the child.
