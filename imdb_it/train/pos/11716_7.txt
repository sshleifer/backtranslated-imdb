Cassandra Peterson originally created Elvira as a television presenter of late-night horror films, and when the character turned out to be unexpectedly popular, she suddenly found herself doing everything from beer commercials to The Tonight Show commercials with Johnny Carson . It reached the peak of its popularity in the late 1980s and the result was the movie ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK. <br /> <br /> The plot is flyweight. Horror film television producer Elvira dreams of success in Las Vegas. When her great-aunt dies, she travels to New England in the hope that the estate will provide enough money to support a play; she is disappointed to discover that she has inherited a dilapidated house, a poodle and an old book. It happens that the city is puritan beyond description, and provokes the right indignation wherever it goes. It also happens that his great-uncle is secretly an evil sorcerer and very intent on getting his hands on "the old book". Put some teenagers, a muffin and a hateful woman with fakes and go. <br /> <br /> Nobody would accuse him of being a cinematic masterpiece, and he drags himself from time to time. But Cassandra Peterson shows a tremendous talent from start to finish: twisted, sexy, and mixing lowbrow humor with flashes of acute comedy, she dances through the film like a ringmaster in a circus of trivial and often self-deprecating jokes. From a FLASHDANCE disaster to sorcery madness, she is never less incredibly funny. It's a huge amount of fun, and the conclusion of the film even manages to generate considerable suspense. Will Elvira improve her bad uncle and save the day? Well, I don't want to give anything, so let's say you'll have a lot of fun discovering. <br /> <br /> The quality of the DVD is ok and there is little in the way of bonus material, but if you want something stupid, this is sure to respond to the impulse. And if you've never seen the whirlwind of the tassels, you're ready for a surprise. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
