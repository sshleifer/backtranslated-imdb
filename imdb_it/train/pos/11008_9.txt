You will notice from the stars that I gave this GREAT film that "... before seeing it the first time" is implicit. I had never heard of this film and I came across all this just because this week (and the last one) was a very slow rental experience (it didn't go very well). I'm not sure how this movie got out of hand, I also love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam. Yet he did it. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fantastic example of what to do if you don't have a large budget. He had the right amount of plot and dialogue to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark; just sufficient. The whole movie is you (the viewer) trying to understand the plots of many twists. I would have given this movie 10/10, however some of the shots were definitely fake. I don't think it's too much against this movie, but I don't think it deserves a perfect score. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think he is rather underrated as a serious talent. No matter its beauty (which is difficult), it takes its roles seriously and does not rely on its appearance to guide it through scenes of sophisticated emotions. And it may seem cold and even lifeless, if necessary, as well. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Jeremy Northam does really well as a rather geeky corporate rat, willing to run through any maze to prove himself. However, as it changes during the film, it is like night and day. I know some Clive Owen fans, Jude Law or other aspirants to become the next James Bond will hate me for it, but Northam would / could / should adapt to this project. He is sweet and cultured. He has a great posture and voice of Bond. I think he too can be cold if the situation requires it, and rather also with his feet on the ground. <br /> <br /> Great movie and surely this video recommends seeing it at least once if you like corporate espionage films.
