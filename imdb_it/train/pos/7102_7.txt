The other reviewers seem to think this is a horrible movie. It is simply not true and a little unfair. <br /> <br /> The acting is of good quality and the direction proceeds with a decent fluidity. I don't think there's anything wrong with the Tarantino-esquire way of telling stories together. Maybe it's just a new tool for filmmakers to try. I thought it made the movie much more interesting. Perhaps some elements of the script need to be strengthened, but this is the only flaw I can find. Nestor Cantillana gives a great performance as Sylvio, even Antonella Rios is splendid and worth the price of admission alone.
