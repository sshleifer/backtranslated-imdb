I must say that Higher Learning is one of the first 3 movies I've ever seen. He has a brilliant cast and an equally brilliant director. Singleton shows how life in the university can be. There are 3 main lines, skinheads, African Americans and homosexuals. I was fascinated by all the stories, but the one that struck me most was the plot of Kristen, who fought her feelings about another girl. The end was great. After watching the movie 25 times more, I still cry. I would have given this film an 11, but I have to settle for 10/10.
