This film is wonderful. What sets it apart from the other 50s from science fiction is the fact that the alien has no features, no face, no eyes, nothing, but it cannot be killed. I especially like the idea that this film does not take place in just a few days, it takes place in just one night, which is supposed to be past midnight. It's also scary that once the blob catches you, you can't take it off. you are stuck in it, as it dissolves your flesh and slowly devours your body. My favorite sci-fi movie of all time in the 50s, and what is sometimes considered the film par excellence. I can understand why this made Steve McQueen mad at celebrity. All this and a catchy theme song! How can you go wrong?
