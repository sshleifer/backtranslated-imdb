It is depressing to see where Jackie Chan ended up. It was an unstoppable hurricane of punches, kicks and incredible stunts. To be honest, he now has fifty and one would expect a slowdown. But with 'Rush Hour 3', where it takes a back seat compared to Chris Tucker (of all people!), And then there's "Kung Fu Panda" where not only has a purely vocal role, but his character has barely a dialogue. .. to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a colossal euphemism. <br /> <br /> It is at times like this, when the only solution is to pull out an old dusty VHS tape and watch Jackie kick her young ass editor's ass, days without Chris Tucker. <br /> <br /> Enter "Police Story". Jackie Chan plays Kar-kui, a policeman whose job it is to protect a witness before an important trial. Face the resistance of both the uncooperative witness and the numerous killers sent by the crowd to silence them both. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, who cares? We don't watch Jackie Chan's films for history. We watch them see Jackie Chan perform amazing stunts and generally punch and kick a lot of people who are less fantastic than he is. <br /> <br /> And at that level, "Police Story" doesn't disappoint at all. There is an impressive showdown in a shopping center that eventually culminates with Jackie slipping down from a giant high-voltage chandelier. Seriously, if this kind of thing happened more often, no male would ever need to walk around buying clothes. <br /> <br /> There is also a comedy, most of which involves Kar-kui who inadvertently upsets May (Maggie Cheung), his eternally suffering and apparently always indulgent girlfriend. The overall humor is rather subtle, but it works so I don't complain. <br /> <br /> Acting is not even too thin. In fact, I'm not at all sure that there was something subtle about 'Police Story'. Director Jackie Chan (yes, he does too) clearly has a deep understanding of why we watch his films, and knows that while we wait for the next fight, the last thing we want is to look for nuances and inner depth and meaning. <br /> <br /> So "Police Story" is an explosion. As with most of his films, the fact that Jackie actually does the things you see on the screen puts him on top of the competition. I mean, when Jackie Chan is really hanging on a bus at full speed by an umbrella, a whole new "Wow!" factor is added to the action.
