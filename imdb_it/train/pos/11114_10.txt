It is probably not fair that I have seen most of all the interesting reviews on Sopranos and then add what people have forgotten, but oh well ....... <br /> <br /> From the point of view of acting, how can an actor fail with these characters? Everyone mesmerizing and intense in their pursuit of life. Tony Soprano - while a boss "head" and suffering from mental illnesses, still sees his life in front of him and knows what needs to be done to survive. Each of his men sees their lives virtually from within as the truest form of voyeurism. Surely it brings out a sort of "nosy" in every single viewer, and I include myself in this! <br /> <br /> While some upstairs don't care about Bracco, I have to say that this is the coolest role you've had over the years from good friends. It is the part of Tony that makes him listen to reason, which makes him decent, which offers him respite when he treats his human emotions that he has not been able to experience for so long, if ever. It is simply mass, its savior. (Not speaking in religious tones) <br /> <br /> But the knockout performance here is without a doubt, Edie Falco. To see her role as a prison guard in the other acclaimed HBO series "Oz" and then see her as Livia is the latest compliment to any actor or actress. She has crossed the limits of a recognizable actress, something that only actresses like Merle Streep can get away with. A sort of chameleonic quality to transcend roles. But as I said before, with strong characters like these, how can an actor fail? <br /> <br /> Livia's strength is in her daily affirmation of faith in herself. She is a survivor, hoping that her husband and family survived. She is prepared for the worst because she knows the dangers of her husband's business, yet she knows that the lifestyle she has is more than most Jersey women. He is wise, if not wiser and more experienced than street, Tony himself. <br /> <br /> All in all, the Soprano family's biggest crime is that we viewers have to wait until January 2000 to see next season. This in my opinion is the worst thing in the HBO series. It was what brought the popularity of Larry Sanders Show, Sex and the City, Dream On and others on earth to kill them. Too much space between the seasons and very sporadic. Until then, I'll watch the replies with the hope that this programming gap is full.
