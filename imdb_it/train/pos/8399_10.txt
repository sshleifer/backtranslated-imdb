Love Trap is not a short film, it is obviously a feature film with a duration of 105 minutes. <br /> <br /> As I write this, I could also talk a little more about Love Trap. I am often asked what makes Love Trap different ... this is how I answer this question: 1) It introduces characters - one in particular - that have never been seen before in the film, period. <br /> <br /> 2) It reveals more truth about love, and deepens the very concept of love, than any other American film ever made, in my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> 3) Structurally, as in the way the story is told, it's different from any love story you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 4) It offers extremely current insights on various cultural issues, both inside and outside the black community. <br /> <br /> Over time, people will come to see Love Trap almost as an original work as possible in this era, deliciously refreshing, authentic and honest. It is a rare game of morality and full of food for thought. <br /> <br /> Visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate information on this film.
