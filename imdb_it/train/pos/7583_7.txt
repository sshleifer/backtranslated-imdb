The last chapter of the Hanzo the Razor trilogy provides a suitable closure for this fun samuraisploitation series. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) in the director's chair, but the style is pretty much the same, perhaps due to the role of Shintaro Katsu as producer, apart from the anti-hero title. <br /> <br /> Hanzo discovers a female ghost that guards a treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo is Hanzo, he is not discouraged by the fact that she is a ghost, so he proceeds to rape ... and interrogate her, using the now familiar rotating device. The plot passes through a series of blind monks who also have the double time of magician, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and the necessary cutting and cutting. The superior officer of Hanzo, Onishi, and his two servants, provide the typical comic notes, and generally, it is as usual. <br /> <br /> Significantly less twisted and easier to follow than the first (which is everywhere and a little confusing), less elegant, dramatic and bloody than the second (probably the best in the Hanzo series), but still fun and worthwhile in itself. Complete with brand training sequences, mandatory rape, sword fighting and a mystery that Hanzo is called to investigate, this will eventually satisfy fans.
