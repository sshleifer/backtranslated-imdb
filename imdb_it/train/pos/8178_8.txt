Not that many films have really exploited the fear of going to the dentist that many people have. Those in the profession have some really intimidating looking tools. It gives the screenwriters Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon and Charles Finch the merit of taking the maximum value of shock from your do-it-yourself-sheriff perspective from their premise. <br /> <br /> Corbin Bernsen, in a well-balanced performance, is Alan Feinstone, a dedicated dentist whose train jumps off the rails. A deranged obsessive-compulsive, begins to dwell on thoughts of decadence, even imagining where there is none, and even equating corruption with the corruption of society in general. Having witnessed his unfaithful wife Brooke (Linda Hoffman) who was doing it with his boyfriend in the pool, he decides to punish her. At the same time, it is under pressure from a miserable I.R.S. agent (Earl Boen, better known as Dr. Silberman of the "Terminator" series) to do a favor in exchange for the agent keeping his mouth shut about Feinstone's financial affairs. Feinstone begins to perceive all those around him as fallen in one way or another, and goes on like a murder while police detective Gibbs (the always welcome Ken Foree) resumes his tracks. <br /> <br /> Director Brian Yuzna clearly enjoys the script a lot. It allows you to create genuinely unpleasant and remarkably amusing scenes that are just as good at creating sympathy for the victims as they are to enthuse the public. The script gives the Feinstone character some subtle lines of dialogue and is on the whole rather crafty and amusing, with large doses of black humor like Feinstone ordering a victim to "take off his tongue!"). Brooke and I.R.S. character acting in particularly effective torture scenes. The effects of makeup are mostly quite good. And the film does a great job of keeping its momentum going, as Feinstone, with his tireless drive for perfection, shifts from a respected professional to an upset killer in record time. <br /> <br /> Foree, always nice and fun to watch, is rather wasted in a serial detective role, but there is some fun in seeing Boen play his part of slime all the way. Hoffman and Christa Sauls offer a very attractive eye candy. And a pre-fame Mark Ruffalo can be seen in a small supporting role. But this is Bernsen's whole show as he sinks his teeth (forgive me for using that expression) in his main part of plum with utter conviction. <br /> <br /> "The Dentist" ranks as one of the most original and interesting horror films released in the 90s. <br /> <br /> 8/10
