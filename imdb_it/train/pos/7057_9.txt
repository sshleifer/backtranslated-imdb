I really liked this as an adult. I looked at it with my 2 nieces and the 3 1/2 year old was fascinated and the fifteen year old giggled at the mice. <br /> <br /> Music is fun and the animation is wonderful. This sequel does what Return to Neverland didn't do. A good sequel to the Cinderella story; but what will become of Drusilla? Another sequel? I hope!
