In 1594 in Brazil, the Tupinambas Indians are friends of the French and their enemies are the Tupiniquins, friends of the Portuguese. A Frenchman (Arduíno Colassanti) is captured by the Tupinambás, and despite the process of convincing them that he is French, they believe he is Portuguese. The French becomes their slave and lives maritally with Seboipepe (Ana Maria Magalhães). Later, he used the powder in the guns that the Portuguese left to defeat the Tupiniquins in a battle. To celebrate the victory, the Indians decide to eat it. <br /> <br /> "Como Era Gostoso or Meu Francês" is another great low-cost movie by the great Brazilian director Nélson Pereira dos Santos. The script is very original and the story is spoken in Tupi. The film is shot with natural light most of the time and is very realistic. The actors and actresses perform naked and Ana Maria Magalhães is magnificent, showing a wonderful body and giving an extraordinary performance. The sound is produced by the Brazilian musician Zé Rodrix. This film shows the beginning of European exploitation of my country, concentrating at that time in Portuguese and French, trading with Indians and exchanging combs and mirrors with our natural resources. This film was awarded in national festivals, such as the Brazilian Film Festival of 1971 (Festival de Brazília do Cinema Brasileiro) with the best screenplay (Nelson Pereira dos Santos), the best dialogue (Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Humberto Mauro) and the best cenografo (Régis Monteiro); Association of art critics of São Paulo (Associação Paulista dos Críticos de Arte), with the best Revelation of the Year (Ana Maria Magalhães) and other awards. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Como Era Gostoso or Meu Francês" ("How tasty was my French")
