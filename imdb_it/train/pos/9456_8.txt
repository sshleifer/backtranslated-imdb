Unlike many other films, which are disturbing either due to their unpleasantness (Man Bites Dog) or their sheer violence (most of Peckinpah's films), Deliverance's shocks for its plausibility. Of course, the hangover scene is rather simple in its unpleasantness, but the effect of the film derives much more from its slow accumulation and from the tangible sense of isolation that surrounds the four leads, both before and after all it starts to go wrong. The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, which does not even recognize the men with whom he had previously played music, not to mention showing any sign of human affection towards them, is among the most sinister of modern cinema. The tension increases constantly during the canoe trip and persists even after the final credits - the ending makes the meaning of the characters' tests horribly real. The film's plausibility is greatly helped by the way the protagonists are played, in particular Ned Beatty and Jon Voight respectively as the victim and reluctant hero. Even Burt Reynolds has never been better. The film's cultural influence can be demonstrated by the number of people who will understand a reference to the "banjo territory" - perhaps only Get Carter has done such effective hatchet work in the tourism industry of a region. Only a handful of films come to mind that put me in such a serious depression after they had finished: Se7en's oppressive atmosphere is the best comparison I can think of. Although much of it is excellent in itself, Deliverance is a classic especially because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique.
