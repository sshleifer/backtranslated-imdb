It's been a few years since I saw it, but remember it and I'd like to see it again. It has become a "therapy" for me with my personal experience. <br /> <br /> A thirty-five-year-old man complains about a high school baseball game in which he "lost the ball" and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, "if only I hit that ball" and how his life would have been better for it. Then, he has the chance to find out ... and he gets a little more than what he's contracted. <br /> <br /> It reminds me so much when I was in high school, I tried the drill / dance team twice and didn't make it. This team was the closest thing to a sisterhood in my school. If you had taken care of it, you were "all this". I didn't try until my last two years of HS and after the second time, I took it really a lot. I had hit and severely injured my leg just before the auditions and was wearing tights to cover the bruise, and this forced me not to make it. It was 1987. <br /> <br /> Over the years, even now sometimes, I think "If only I hadn't hit my leg, I would never have worn those stupid stockings". Now I don't sit down and I think my life would have been better or even different if I had done it, but seeing this film made me realize that we never really know how things could be by changing a little thing in the past. Who knows, it may have changed the course of events to the point that I would not have met my son's father. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who has that moment in the past they wish could change. Pay attention to what you want !!!
