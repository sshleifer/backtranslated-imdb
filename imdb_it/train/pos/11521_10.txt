Wizards are a wonderful ride from start to finish, thanks largely to the magic generated by the stars. Alan Arkin has been fantastic in one of his best roles for decades. Like any truly beautiful film, it is a journey in which the theme is redemption and the result of the dream. I can't believe this movie is so hard to find - I'd buy it on DVD in the blink of an eye but I haven't found an outlet yet.
