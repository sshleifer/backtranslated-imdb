I think Sarafina is a tremendous effort by Whoopi Goldberg. Besides her, there are no other stars in the film and her role is smaller than the title character, Sarafina. Since I work in a high school with urban children, I think this is an important film to show the South African story of apartheid. Sarafina is a film about education and the teacher's relationship with her student, Sarafina. I bought the video almost for nothing in a video store. I looked at it and quickly pushed the musical numbers forward. But I highly recommend this film to educators and their students to understand. Now, while I don't know the other actors and actresses in the film, I assume they are very popular in South Africa and I'm glad they shot with a South African cast and crew except Goldberg in a small role but if people can see this film, Whoopi reaches the global appeal.
