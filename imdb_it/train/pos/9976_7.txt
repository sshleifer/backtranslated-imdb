Of course, he was mischievous and senseless and sometimes sloppy, but at least the filmmakers didn't try. While most TV movies are on the verge of mediocrity, this movie actually has some redeeming qualities. Cinematography was pretty good for a TV movie, and Viggo Mortensen shows the nuances of Aragorn in a movie about a man who played by his own rules. Most flashback sequences were poor, but the scene with the mountain lion was intense. I was a bit annoyed by the role of Jason Priestly in the film as a rebellious shock-jock, but then again, it's a TV movie! Despite all the positive things, the soundtrack was atrocious. However, it was nice to see Tucson, Arizona, star of the film.
