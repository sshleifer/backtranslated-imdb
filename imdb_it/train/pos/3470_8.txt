Even though I'm quite young, the Beatles are my ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE band! I never had the chance to listen to their music as it was released, but I loved them since I can remember. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie that is worth trying once. I can understand why it wasn't released in the cinema, but it's certainly a great movie to put on TV. I was leafing through my TV guide and I happened to see this movie, it didn't have much detail but something like that, "John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after the Beatles broke up, Jared Harris Stars." I had never heard of him (played John) or Aiden Quinn who played Paul. However, they are certainly undervalued actors! <br /> <br /> The film started off slowly but, as it developed, I could see how well Quinn but especially Harris played their characters. As a big fan, I know what Lennon and McCartney are like. The screenplay was brilliant and Harris highlighted Lennon's accent, personality and mannerism! Quinn played McCartney quite well, but he sometimes went into his Irish accent. The make-up artists made them look excellent. <br /> <br /> THIS PARAGRAPH CAN BE TAKEN AS A SPOILER *: <br /> <br /> As I said before, it started slowly but quickly developed and became a rather emotional film. I found the piece in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both musicians. As for the rough line of Lennon in the Italian restaurant, absolutely useless. The ending was very touching and reminds me of every time I look at it. <br /> <br /> It is very different from the other biographical films I've seen where we talk about how the Beatles came together and became famous, and they never really did the characters well. For example. 'Backbeat'. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would say that if you are a Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney fan, you give him a chance to have a pleasant surprise. Just about 95 minutes, it's worth waiting for the film to develop. <br /> <br /> If anyone really knew if the 1976 meeting really happened, please send it to the "comment page" for this movie, I would be very interested
