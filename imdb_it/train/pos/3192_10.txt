Yes, this gets the complete ten stars. It is clear as the day that this filling is brilliant. The universe has sent Trent Harris a young and wonderfully strange man one day and Harris has captured him on tape, in all that real glory that you can't fake. Too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man, if only an alternative ending could be written for that boy's story. The other two passages of the trilogy tell the story, with Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the roles of young people, respectively. The world is expanded and strangeness is contextualized by the story, giving us a broader look at the strange growth in vanilla America. Recommended to anyone and everyone!
