I'm giving it only 9 out of 10, because I need to see it again, in a more current mental frame to get a new perspective. What I remember is a fantastic psychological thriller that dazzled my brain and my eyes when I saw it. I watched him every time he came on HBO later in the day (probably in 1990 or so). I could have even recorded it, but that recording is long gone, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> I wrote to GreenCine to try to get this title, at the moment they don't bring it. I hope to find it in a local video store. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend trying it out if you find it somewhere. It's very interesting. If you liked movies like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo or anything else weird and along those lines, try this.
