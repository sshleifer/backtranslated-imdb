This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. All of you who consider this film as absolutely obvious are not smart enough to capture all the subtle humor that this film has to offer. It shows us that real life and "fictitious" action can produce a winning combination. Also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the smartest ways for two people to find each other. Call me another movie where you can see all this and Donald Sutherland singing a song like "They're going to find the anus on a mountain on Mars".
