The Gundam wing for me seems to be a good anime. A little slow (especially around the middle of the series), but above all pleasant. Now, before anyone jumps on my case and calls me "wing", I admit I saw all the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, the 08th MS Team and Gundam SEED. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that there were some problems in telling the story and some characters might seem like "rip-offs" (for example, Zechs Marquise at the original Gundam's Char), but this is an alternative show of the universe based on the original series, as is SEED. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this series make sure you look at the original Gundam first and then know that you are watching an AU series.
