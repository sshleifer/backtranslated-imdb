Strangler of the Swamp was made by the low-budget PRC and is certainly one of their best films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A man who was hanged for a murder he did not commit returns as a ghost for revenge on the people who accused him. He uses a rope to strangle his victims and after several deaths, including the old man who runs the ferry across the swamp, disappears. The old woman's niece takes the ferry and falls in love with one of the local men and they decide to get married. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of foggy atmospheres, which also makes it very disturbing. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as Strangler. <br /> <br /> Strangler of the Swamp is a must for old horror fans like me. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
