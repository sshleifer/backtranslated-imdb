Not seeing this film for about 20 years, I am still impressed by its strong impact and its stellar acting. Obviously, a certain Mr. Mickey Rooney is INCREDIBLE in his role as "Killer" who wears the ring. (Referring to another review here - none other than Orson Welles evoked the name of Mickey Rooney as the greatest film actor, too.) I also remember the jazzy-brassy score and the bare black and white photography. I love Mick's last line before he goes out for his dose of lead poisoning. (I think the Stranglers raised it in one of their songs - Get a Grip on Yourself.) This is a great movie and a movie unfairly buried. Let's get it out! Side note - a recent Film Review magazine has made a big contribution to Don Segal's "Babyface Nelson", released a couple of years before "Last Mile" and also starring Mickey Rooney. Another rave of the intense and comprehensive performance of Mick. Perhaps it is the beginning of a wave of appreciation for some truly superior film performances.
