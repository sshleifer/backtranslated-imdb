'How to lose friends and alienated people' is a fun, albeit free, adaptation of Toby Young's memoir of the same name. It's also a great title to help fill line requirements in IMDb reviews! The basic essence is the same as the book with some dramatized episodes, but a romantic plot is added and the ending is certainly Hollywoodized. Simon Pegg, despite having played an essentially irritating person, is usually the usual likable and likeable and practically carries the film. Strange to think that only a few years ago he was just a boy of the television sitcom and now he is touching with the names of Hollywood. There is a good supporting cast and it's a fun and easy watch - a sort of masculine but more fun "Ugly Betty".
