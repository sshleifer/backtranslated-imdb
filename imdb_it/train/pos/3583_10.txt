This was a great movie but it had the worst ending I've ever seen !!! The actors were fantastic and showed a wonderful talent. The whole story was distorted and unpredictable, which is what made it fun. As good as the film was, the whole movie is judged by the ending, which was terrible! Perhaps a sequel could eliminate this negative ending.
