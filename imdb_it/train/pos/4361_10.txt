This was probably one of the most well-made movies of the 1940s - Warner Bros. at the height of their style. Sol Polito's photography is probably his best result: wonderful compositions and lights with delicate shadows. Max Steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the epitome of his classic leit motif method. The music adds great excitement and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable. It is interesting to note that the same production team that made this film immediately went on to make "Now, Voyager" later that year - a beautiful film that has won awards and recognition and that has become a historic favorite, because it has starred in Bette Davis. In my opinion, "The Gay Sisters" is a much better film, better made in all departments and more interesting, complex and fun. An unusual film that entertains those who take it for what it is, rather than projecting their modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection. Everything must be judged in its own temporal reference and for what it is trying to achieve in its own terms. Most of the complaints I have read in these reviews are so childish and completely missing the point. If you are hungry for a perfect filet mignon, don't go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pasta. The art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population. Sorry folks - maybe if this movie had a Rolling Stones soundtrack and a hundred or so intricate and secondary plots, you'll all be happy and contented. I'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions one day of the week!
