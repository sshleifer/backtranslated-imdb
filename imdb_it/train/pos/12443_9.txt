I liked this movie. It was a joy to see a version so close to the vision of Peter O'Donnell. A certain number of people did not like the film, but must be seen in the context of the history of origin that it is. The film uses flashbacks to show young Modesty and the events that shaped her into the woman she has become. Before the network. Before Willie Garvin. <br /> <br /> The pace is a bit slow, and for my taste not enough tension develops in today's scenes. However this is acceptable only to get such a faithful version. <br /> <br /> If you like Modesty Blaise, you will also like it with its flaws, if you just want an action movie with car chases - forget it. <br /> <br /> It has the feeling of being the first of a franchise, but as I've never seen it promoted anywhere, I suspect there will be no more to follow. Unfortunately.
