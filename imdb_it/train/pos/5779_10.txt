For starters, I didn't even know about this show for about a year because of the Internet. I've never seen it on TV before in my country and many people don't usually know this show. It's a pity though, because it's the most original and intelligent animation I've seen for years. <br /> <br /> I don't distribute 10 points very much, but this is a show that really deserves all 10 points. Although at first glance it might seem like a typical cartoon, keep in mind that this is not a children's show. When the complete story is self-explanatory, you know that this is a real deep plot, with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of history is largely based on animal-spirits, an old Indian believer who has been preserved for many years. This gives the show an original touch that is not often found in animated shows. <br /> <br /> The general design is also something very different. Sometimes it looks a little bit like spawn in terms of gritty design, and at other times it takes a more comics approach. I think David Feiss, who also created and directed Cow and Chicken, animated a segment on the show (as he also designed that segment in the comic). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a show aimed at the mind, a show that takes various subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, so this is something you should not miss. Once you start looking, you will probably look at it until the end. A small fact may be that the show takes less material from the comic, but this is not too annoying. The only question remains, however, where is the DVD?!
