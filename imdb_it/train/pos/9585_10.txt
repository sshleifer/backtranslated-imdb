Wonderfully put together. I wish there was a following of this documentary to follow the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost ... there should be a part two ... a real one. It was good ... the film was not long enough ... I would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow !! this is so important for the community period ... well if you're reading this please consider doing another documentary like this ... I'm really tired of hearing from naive writers like AIDS and Men go together when they don't; in reality it is the hetero we need to look at ... this film has not even bothered to mention HIV or AIDS and I was very happy about it ... I also appreciated the definitions and definitions. Thank you for allowing this film to exist.
