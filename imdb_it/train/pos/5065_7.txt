All in all a good film is better for the fact that if the film had not been made the story could remain hidden from the masses. Brosnan does a good job as a native American with a hidden past and photography is stunning. For some, this may be too fanciful, for others boring - for me it is a gentle story, well told and perfect for family observation. Now it's not something that happens to you recently.
