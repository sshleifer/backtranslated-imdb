This made-for-TV movie is brilliant. This is probably the best and favorite role of the BAFTA winner John Thaw (Kavanagh Q.C. and Inspector Morse). Tom Oakley (Thaw) widowed man has lived for a while in a village since his wife and son died, and has now been landed with an evacuated named Willaim Beech (Nick Robinson). As he knows this child, he begins to develop a friendship. Until Willaim's Mum (Annabelle Apsion) wants it back. After Tom worries that William won't contact him, he visits him in London. Eventually Willaim gets his home with a loving family (or dad). Set during the Second World War, this is an excellent film. He was nominated for a BAFTA Lew Grade Award and won the National Television Award for the most popular drama. John Thaw was the number 3 of the 50 best stars on TV. Very good!
