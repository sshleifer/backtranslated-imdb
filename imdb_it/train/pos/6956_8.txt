I must say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. this movie was uber cute and i mean uber cute. It had all the "sexual" contents that most of Ivan Reitman's comedies have but with something more, CHEMISTRY. Both Uma and Luca both have a magical but credible aura that seems to transcend in every scene. Both seem to create this strange, twisted and interesting relationship with a powerful "sexual" tension that you laugh until you can no longer feel your face. Anna Farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to interpret each other's roles perfectly and even the rather small role of Wanda Sykes will make you laugh. Although this type of comedies are not for everyone, but I must say that I went with a person who usually does not like these films and who was laughing like crazy. This film is certainly not for everyone. especially the younger children, as some moments are too small ... well, let's say ADULT for younger viewers. All in all I was pleasantly surprised by this film, the ending I found was a bit weak compared to the rest of the film. (3 1/2 * out of 5 *)
