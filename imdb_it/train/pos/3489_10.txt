I love this movie. It was one of my favorite movies The action never stops. The whole movie was done very well. The finish is really good. Being full of action, they even have a surprise for you. When I saw what the film was about on the Internet, I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie, but I felt like a big Luke Perry fan, I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I gave it a chance because this was a very nice movie even though it was out. It was very original. Whoever designed this film receives a standing ovation from me. The acting was great. Luke Perry still did a great job. I give this film the highest rating.
