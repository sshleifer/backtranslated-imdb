Here is a favorite Tom & Jerry cartoon perfect for Halloween. I know he doesn't have much chills, but he has the 'trick' as in "Trick or Treat", as Jerry did to Tom with the blind window and the vacuum cleaner with a collar shirt hanging over it to make it look like a ghost; but I still like to put it on my list of Halloween cartoons. In this short, Tom was listening to "Witching Hour", a program of ghost stories on the radio, and he was scared of the horror story told. In the middle of the story, the dramas (the straight hair, the heart that jumps in the throat, the icy shivers on the spine) begin to happen to Tom. . . literally. And Jerry observed the whole thing and laughing to himself, he thought he had frightened Tom by frightening him. <br /> <br /> I love the ending, it was a bit strange. And you know, this short is the first of four cartoons in which Tom attacks Mammy Two Shoes; the others are The Lonesome Mouse, A Mouse in the House and Nit-Witty Kitty. And this short is also the first of twenty-five cartoons in which Tom talks. The others are The Lonesome Mouse, The Zoot Cat, The Million Dollar Cat, The Bodyguard, Mouse Trouble, The Mouse Comes to Dinner, Quiet Please !, Trap Happy, Solid Serenade, Mouse Cleaning, Texas Tom, Mucho Mouse and The Cat Above and the mouse under direct from Chuck Jones.
