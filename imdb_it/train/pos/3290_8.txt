Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is just on the verge of puberty, starts having strange dreams that begin to afflict her in real life - in particular by involving a boy named Mark (Elliott Spiers) whom she meets in her dreams. <br /> <br /> Very unusual fantasy with some really terrifying moments. Despite the fact that it is a teenage girl and has a PG-13 rating, this is NOT for children. Also, if you hate fantasies, stay away. But if you are looking for something different, this is the strong point. <br /> <br /> Well directed by Bernard Rose with a beautiful music soundtrack and some pleasant and scary shots. The only thing that prevents this film from being a great film is Burke - she is not a very good actress (not surprising that this was her only film) and it hurts the film. However, all the others are simply fantastic. <br /> <br /> Spiers is very good as Mark; Even Glenne Headley (feigning the British accent very well) is as good as Anna's mother and Ben Cross is both frightening and sympathetic like Anna's father. <br /> <br /> A stroke of sleep when it came out in 1988, has vanished. Too bad: it's really very good.
