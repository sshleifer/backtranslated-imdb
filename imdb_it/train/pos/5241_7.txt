Excellent film by Thaddeus O'Sullivan with strong performances by numerous British and Irish actors. The film treats a thorny theme well and effectively captures the despair and gloomy atmosphere of 70s Belfast. Surprisingly realistic, it does nothing to glorify both sides in this conflict. On the one hand, it shows a young Catholic father who tries to raise his family without being dragged into trouble. On the other hand, he is in charge of a loyalist gang intent on propagating violence. Very interesting and, fortunately, funny. Don't expect any laughter, though. 7 out of 10.
