"I looked into the eyes of this island and what I saw was beautiful", proclaims one of the main characters of the award-winning ABC television show "Lost". The series could be summarized as a theatrical story about a group of survivors of the shipwreck stranded on an unknown island, but this would have made the show a disservice. "Lost" follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island, each other and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their new way of life and their dependence on each other. The situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear that this is not even a common island - and that they may not be alone. <br /> <br /> My initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories that could tell us after a while, but this turned out to be unfounded. The narration flows in a natural way, the dialogue is witty, the characters are memorable and the execution is superb. The island is a character all to itself, and to understand this comment you should see the series for yourself, which only goes to show its originality and greatness. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing this review, only the first two seasons went on the air, and they are full of strong episodes. My only mild criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a little in the middle, but then fortunately back in admirable form for the final episodes. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend a television series that you should follow well now, it would certainly be this. If you like excitement, adventure, character-driven stories, an extremely strong cast and crew, wonderful places and an island that feels more spiritual than natural, "Lost" is for you. Make sure you start at the beginning.
