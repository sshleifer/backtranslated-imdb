The budget was extremely low (some scenes seem to be recorded with a home video recorder). However it has a good plot, and it's easy to follow. 8 years after having shot his sexually violent stepfather, Amanda is released from the psychiatric ward, with the help of her doctor with whom she has a secret relationship. The doctor ends up renting a house and buying her a car. But within the first 20 minutes of the movie, Amanda kills him and buries him in his backyard. Then he sees his neighbor Richard staring at him and he stops at nothing until he has reached him. He behaves innocently, but after another neighbor, Buzz discovers that Amanda killed that doctor and attempted to kill Richards's wife, Laurie (this is after Amanda and he got him into the hot tub). Then he stops behaving innocently and kills Buzz and then tries to kill Richard who she presumably loves and cares for him. And you will have to rent the movie to find out if Amanda dies or not. Overall a good movie, it reminds me a lot of my life, you know that the whole fall for the next and not stopping at nothing until you make it separate.
