This was one of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes, mainly for portraying two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic environment. <br /> <br /> The shops littered with cobwebs and the rubble-filled streets are disturbing that particular way that the Twilight area does best. <br /> <br /> Although the parable can be a little heavy with today's dramatic standards, it is excellent: use the setting to make a statement relevant to the human experience, as well as geopolitics, in a so that is timeless. The whole drama is based exclusively on the shoulders of Mr. Bronson and Mrs. Montgomery, who do not disappoint. (May they both rest in peace.) <br /> <br /> A true classic.
