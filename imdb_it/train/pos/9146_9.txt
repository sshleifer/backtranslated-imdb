This electrifying musical has more than a breath of selfishness from its star, the musical genius that is Prince. The film has about 90 minutes of installation, but in reality it is easy to understand why it is such a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Just like the other movies focused on the struggling young musician trying to be great, this has a bit of drama to add a dimension to the musical numbers. While this movie is not as good as 8 miles as a recent example, this is still fun and the soundtrack is much better. On the dramatic side of things, the story revolves around the Kid (Prince), a young artist and a permanent place in a club. The club owner is frustrated by the Kid's arrogance and the child knows he may soon be fired and replaced by a rival. On the one hand, Kid's parents have problems, with his father violently abusing her. During the course of the film, the child learns some lessons in life and learns to appreciate his friends more. That's all we've seen in dramas of formation, of course, but this is combined like a musical, a very stylized musical. <br /> <br /> The cast is good. Prince is pretty good on the dramatic side when he's not doing a pose. It looks human and unstoppable. Clarence Williams is also good as an abusive father. Appollonia Kotero makes a good debut as Princes sexy love interest. <br /> <br /> The strength of the film is however the superb soundtrack. The musical numbers are well staged and electrifying. Prince is undoubtedly a musical master, although very eccentric. When he is inspired he is great, but on the other hand he often sings songs exclusively for his taste and occasionally his experimentation may miss the shot, but it's the same for many music geniuses. The soundtrack of this film is excellent, with only Sexshooter which is a weak point. The Purple Rain exhibition is still exceptional. It's one of my favorite songs of all time. *** <br /> <br />
