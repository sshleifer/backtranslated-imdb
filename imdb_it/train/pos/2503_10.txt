I'm extremely picky for the movies I see. I had heard of Moon Child completely by accident. I have been a fan of L'Arc En Ciel for some time and a fan of Gackt and Mizer only recently. <br /> <br /> I finally discovered that the film had been republished and I picked it up without Second. <br /> <br /> Being as critical as movies are, I admit, action scenes can be quite embellished at times ... but they are too important, as suggested by another user, it is the quintessence of calm before the storm, quoting Gary Oldman of Leon ... without getting into the spoilers, the film hit me hard, because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are unlimited and as they often say, true friendship is loyalty and marriage , it is till death you separate yourself. <br /> <br /> Hyde and Gackt give shows that show why they are able to devote such depth to their song lyrics, their passion for music happens on the big screen and in the process creates an exemplary film that will reach the own soul and will evoke the response emotionally. <br /> <br /> Seeing the film for the film The First Time, I realized that it will probably remain in the heavy rotation for my collection. I want to encourage anyone reading this post to take the film if you want to get away from the current Hollywood trend in the movie ... this takes a completely new direction using the classic elements of the Yakuza movie and how you can go wrong with a cameo by Ryo Ishibashi fame of "Audition" and "Suicide Club" of Takashi Miike? <br /> <br /> Man ... I can't say enough about this movie, but I'll stop here. <br /> <br /> 10/10
