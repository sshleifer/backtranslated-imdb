I don't usually like Emma Roberts very much, but after seeing Nancy Drew it was like she changed my mind. The film's actors made it all exciting and fun. Most of the time when you watch a mysterious movie you can solve it before the middle of the show, but in this movie it's like you're actually there. The clues must all fit together until you can finally understand the whole crime. I'm still amazed how he discovered it. The whole movie was really smart and even the people who saw it with me loved the movie. The clothes were my favorite part of the movie, it was so cute. I don't think there will be another movie like this until the sequel comes out. I give him a nine because the popular girls don't seem to have the right part, but they still make me laugh. It was a fantastic film and a great mystery. I highly recommend watching it.
