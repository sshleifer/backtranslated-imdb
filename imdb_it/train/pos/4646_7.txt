I didn't know what to do with this movie. I guess that's what it really was about. I've never seen a movie like that and I doubt I will really do it again. Glover puts together something that is unique to him. I think to appreciate it you have to read some of his poems, maybe see one of his presentations. I really like this guy, he's so weird I can't help it. Note: I saw this film before its final editing, so maybe what I saw and what others saw was different. I will know, I suppose, if I choose to review the film. I think I will have to be properly influenced by the drug ...
