I saw an advanced projection for this movie tonight. I absolutely loved it. The film kept me on the edge of my seat all night. Cillian Murphy is extremely scary as the villain. For those of you who have seen Batman Begins, his character has been much scarier in this movie. He played his character very well. The worst "bad boy", I've seen him for a while. Rachel McAdams was great. Everyone in the audience laughed, panted and cheered at the same time, as if we were at the right time. The suspense is kept throughout the film. The surprising part is that the end was not anti-climatic. I was not disappointed at the end. I felt satisfied. The trailer does not do the film justice. The film is much better than the trailer shown. Don't wait for this movie to be released on video. Go see it. Even though I didn't have to pay to watch this movie, I would have gladly given 10.75 to see it. To enjoy!
