A major financier of RKO Radio, Bombardier plays Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott as trainers in a school for bomber pilots. O'Brien and Scott discuss teaching methods, while their students compete for the affections of Anne Shirley. O'Brien's methods prove valid during a bombing of Tokyo. Scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the Japanese, but the mortally wounded Scott manages to set fire to a gas truck, providing a perfect target for his fellow bombers. Stylistically, Bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic films of the war, with moments of subtle intensity (the death of student Eddie Albert) that alternate with scenes of ridiculous melodrama "Yellow Peril" (the Japanese whistle literally while they torture Americans powerless). Although he can't help but seem dated today, Bombardier remains an enjoyable propaganda effort (the film is sometimes mistakenly listed as Robert Ryan's debut, which actually appeared in front of the cameras from 1940. <br /> <br / > Anyone interested in getting a copy of this film, please contact me at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com
