This is something new. <br /> <br /> There is a coup and a couple of Irish filmmakers are right inside it. <br /> <br /> A democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read the constitution has been slandered by the private media openly as a dictator, mentally unstable, new hitler, etc. without repercussions on the part of governments (as, let's say, by silencing them with bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods). Oh, and they continue to claim that they were suppressed, of course. <br /> <br /> See how the media gloats over their role in the TV coup after overthrowing the government with the help of general rouge (how much more stupid can you get?). <br /> <br /> And see how the people of Venezuela march towards the palace, holding the constitution in their hands, and re-installing the elected government. <br /> <br /> It looks like a Hollywood fairy tale, but it really happened against the explicit wishes of the United States. The documentary is a historic masterpiece, shot from the center of the action, sharp and totally embarrassing for the first supporters of the coup: the good, democratic, freedom-loving, benevolent United States (which still channel huge sums of money to political opponents of Chavez). <br /> <br /> Also very fun and exciting. 10 points.
