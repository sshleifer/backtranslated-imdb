These are one of the movies that don't require brain or thought, it's a very fun pastime that you've forgotten in the next hour. I was really surprised by the acting of John Abraham, who usually plays the gangster as a character with an emotionless face, then from that to play the opposite and does it successfully, managing to shine among the genes of comics like Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was also quite surprised by the 3 girls of Akshaye because the roles do not require much talent but above all they complain about the disappearance of Akshaye (for the other girls) I was surprised when they managed to establish and the real person and you could distinguish between them which is a good thing, even most of the songs are good, it's colorful and fun so on a boring Sunday night this will definitely lighten your mood.
