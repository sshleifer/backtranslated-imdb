I have to say that I loved the film. He had funny moments, some moving parts, all right. I personally really liked the film because it's something I can finally connect to my childhood. This film, in my opinion, is more oriented towards the young gay population. Shows how a young gay boy would be treated as he grew up. All provocation, nickname and not knowing are something that I, like most other young female boys, will always remember, and now finally a film that illustrates how difficult it is to grow up gay. So, I highly recommend seeing this movie. You probably shouldn't really look at it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it
