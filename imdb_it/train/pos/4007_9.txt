A proud and incredibly intelligent work by the talented British writer Hanif Kureishi who wrote "My Beautiful Laundrette" (this is the best thing he has done since then). These are intelligent people whose lives do not add up to much. They have squandered what has been given to them and are largely empty. The only character on the screen who is alive is the mother of the title yet she feels dead inside until a rough handyman shows her a little affection and awakens her to the joys of sex. He has his reasons but Kureishi treats him with a good dose of compassion. This is a film where people and places feel familiar, where the characters exist beyond the boundaries of the screen. In some ways it's a bit like "Sunday, Bloody Sunday", but it's a harder job. The director, Roger Michell, allows the scenes to build instinctively. And it's beautifully performed. <br /> <br /> Like the mother of the same name, Anne Reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture. There is not a false note in his extraordinarily lived performance, and that excellent actor Daniel Craig shows nuances to his character that even Kureishi has not exploited. If the film hits a false note it is perhaps, in the character of the talentless daughter, involved in a disorderly relationship with the man her mother seduces (or should be the other way around) and even the most disordered life, but she is so well played by Cathryn Bradshaw, she attacks you anyway. The film is also extremely beautiful to watch (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and must be classified, without hesitation, as the best British film of the year.
