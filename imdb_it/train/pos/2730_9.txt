I saw it at the theater during its first release and this disturbed me because I'm sure it would still be. It was the first part of '68 and this was still making the rounds in the cities of all America and there had recently been a mass murder in my hometown, where I saw this where a man went on a rampage. The freshness of that close event combined with this dramatized true story made for a very disturbing theatrical experience. It really brought to life the excellent acting of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I knew the novel based on the real Truman Capote event and Richard Brooks' script and direction intertwined Truman's event and interpretation in a compelling cinematic adaptation. Quincy Jones's music effectively marks his story. I've only seen it a couple of times since then. It was too real. Almost like being a witness to the crime itself and riding along with the killers. I would give this to 9.0 of a possible 10. The society is so desensitized to violence and crime today that this probably seems slow and meek and could be seen with less effect but to all over 50 this will be a hallmark in the criminal psyche.
