I found this movie a lot of fun, I really liked how modern politics did it. This movie is not as fun as South Park, but it's pretty funny. And since I'm a sports fan, I loved how they made some of the most ridiculous things in sports fun. This film is also great for non-sports fans, probably better for them as they have to go through life wondering why people follow sports so closing when there are so many crazy rules and complexity for the sport and the fact that it means absolutely nothing . I also discovered that the real game with which they came out is interesting, it's a kind of horse with bases and psyche (for the person who shoots). In general I highly recommend seeing this movie and I think you will end up loving this movie. However, if this style of comedy is not your favorite you probably won't like it. (but this is with any comedy movie)
