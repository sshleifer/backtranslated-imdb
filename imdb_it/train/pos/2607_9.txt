The season finale sent mix messages, I experienced feelings of joy and even feelings of being lied to and deceived. Roseanne tells all her spectators that the entire season nine was a lie because her husband, Dan, was dead. He also admits that the family never won the lottery, and which season 9 was a lie just because of the way he wanted or wanted it to be. I'm still confused about when he said Becky ended up with David, and Darlene with Mark because Becky and Mark admit they're pregnant. So I guess it's just how he wanted it to be, but it wasn't. So the season finale was good, but sent mixed feelings. I will always be a fan of the show. :)
