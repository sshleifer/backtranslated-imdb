Before seeing Show People, my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick and only slapstick. I could not imagine how the screen comedy could be possible without relying on the words spoken or the numerous problems. But this masterful film made me wrong. Davies, in my opinion, was probably the greatest comedian to come before Lucille Ball. I mention Lucy mainly because Davies' mannerisms and facial expressions reminded me so much that I wonder if Davies was not one of Ball's main influences. This comes from a twenty-one year old who had never seen a silent comedy, and I must say that no matter how much of the specific period references are actually obtained (I didn't, apparently), you won't be bored by this movie. You will probably laugh even more than you would on most talkie comedies. This is not just my favorite silent comedy, but easily one of my ten favorite comedies of all time.
