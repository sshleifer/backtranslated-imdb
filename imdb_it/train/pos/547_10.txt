I don't know if I'm just weird, but I really enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> Return to Cabin by the Lake is obviously the sequel to another of my favorite Cabin by the Lake movies. In fact, I think I liked this movie even more than the first one. I also thought the cast of this movie was fantastic, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also liked the plot as a whole. I liked the fact that this second film focused on filming the Stanley's Cabin by the Lake script - it wasn't a completely redundant Stanley movie that grabbed the other girls and drowned them. - If you are looking for a deep meaning, then this film is probably not the right one for you. However, if you're looking for a fun way to spend two hours, go ahead and watch it. I've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this movie. :)
