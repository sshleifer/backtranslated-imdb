"The case of the scorpion's tail" contains all the elements necessary to make an effective yellow film. The story is standard yellow. When a man dies in a plane crash, his wife (Ida Galli) collects a $ 1 million life insurance policy. The widow goes to Greece for payment but a series of gruesome murders follow her. There are a lot of suspects, including a tenacious investigator (George Hilton) from the insurance agency and the widow's lover. Director Martino keeps the story moving at a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer. Anita Strindberg (also memorable in "Your vice is a locked room and only I have the key" and "Who saw her die?") She is a striking-looking heroine. It is one of Martino's best films.
