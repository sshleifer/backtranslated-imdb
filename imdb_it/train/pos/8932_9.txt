The film is not visually stunning in the conventional sense. It does not present a series of beautiful photos. Instead it is a visually interesting film. It forces the viewer to constantly or perhaps imagine the context of the various shots. This kind of thing is easy to try but hard to get. The film refuses to use a genus crutch to help the less busy viewer understand what is happening. Instead the film touches and moves through a number of different genres. The trick to loving the movie is being able to enjoy this playfulness. I suspect that 99% of North American viewers will not understand it. If you try to define the narrative of this film, or the philosophical message, or the symbolist structure, etc. You'll lose time. There are none of these. The movie just pretends with these genres and sometimes others. The only unifying force in the film is the perception that Claire Denis has of what fits. There are so few feature films that come close to satisfying Kant's description of what art is, namely the enjoyment of the power of judgment itself rather than simply assimilating experiences under concepts. The film usually takes the easy way and opts for the simplest pleasure of understanding what is happening. Most films are not art. Most films don't come close to art. When a film does, like this, and is still enjoyable by a wide range of viewers, it is something of a miracle. My negative comment is that sometimes I find the movie too simplistic to buy it in the various narrative threads that run through it. The father-son narrative of Tahiti, even if it is not exactly conventional, ends up making things a little clear and simple. Dominate too much.
