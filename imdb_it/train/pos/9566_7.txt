The ultra-dark criminal drama of Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of "Home Sweet Home". Tonally, it reminded me of "Run and Kill" by Billy Tang, even if it is not so polished. However, it is a captivating and spoiled chaos on a solitary Cambodian, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While he escapes from the scene, he kills the cop's companion Sam Wai, who, to add insult to injury, is in the middle of his relationship with his dying father, so Sam starts a mad and obsessive manhunt for Pang that results almost a dozen corpses and relentless violence. Lately there must be something in the air because I've never seen so many humans beat the pulp from one another like I've been doing lately. These are bad and bad things, which is why I am so partial and I appreciate its negative vibration. It's visually appealing and the sound design is truly unique. Dramatically, everything moves down until each character finds himself in a world of screaming pain. A subplot involving Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and generates a fourth surprise act that boasts a beautiful gesture of grotesque surgery.
