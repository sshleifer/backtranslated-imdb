The tighter the drama, the better the sister rivalry movie! This little gem was mainly promoted as a comedy on its release in Sweden, so I'm happy to find out that it wasn't the case. The fun parts of the squabbles in the city are there to have fun, for sure, but the drama is the center of attention, as the story progresses. And not just the family drama, it also raises touching questions about respecting people's differences in life choices. <br /> <br /> Large group of characters with many superb and moving dramatic scenes that gain points of credibility; and they are not just scattershot, but they keep everything in place. It makes me assume that if Ingmar Bergman had done this (the drama would have suited him!), Probably international attention would have been immediate. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 of Ozjeppe.
