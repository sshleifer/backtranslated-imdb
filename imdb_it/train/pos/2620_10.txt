What a pleasant surprise: a sequel to Disney DTV (Direct to Video) which is actually GOOD. "The Lion King 1 1/2" is a comedy that involves the meerkat and everyone's favorite warthog, Timon and Pumbaa. He starts with them watching the original film and making comments, until Timon complains that "we haven't arrived yet". After fighting for the remote control, Timon and Pumbaa decide to tell the public "their story". The new film begins and the laughter begins. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was losing hope in Disney. Most of their direct-to-video rate was terribly bad, with the lines of the desperate story of cashing the original. "1 1/2" decides to try something different: it tells the original story from a new point of view. Ok, add some things, like where Timon came from and how he and Pumbaa met, but it's an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella perfectly reflect the bond and friendship that made us love in the first film. There are also some clean film parodies (including a scene that parodies "The Good, the Bad, and Ugly" and "Cool Hand Luke" at the same time), and the script is full of fun memorable lines. <br /> <br /> Added to the cast are Julie Kavner ("The Simpsons") as Timon's mother, Wart-Wart, and Jerry Stiller as Uncle Max, a little crazy about Timon. Matthew Broderick introduces himself as Simba, and his "teen" scene reminds me of Ferris Bueller. Everyone does well, especially Robert Guillame (is this how you write?) Like Rafiki, who exudes more and more Yoda in this film (Timon comments several times). <br /> <br /> 'The Lion King 1 1/2' is a perfect alternative choice for those of you who get tired of animation shrekification. 10/10
