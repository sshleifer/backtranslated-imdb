When I heard about this movie it had to be the funniest thing I've ever seen, yes, it was fun. I mean, I liked everything until the end, where ........... Oh no, I can't tell you that you should do it. It's funny except vulgar language. That's why I say that if you like movies that are fun in sexual ways, look at them, but if you don't, don't spend money renting it or buying it.
