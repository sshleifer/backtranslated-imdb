"Rich in Love" is a "slice of life" film that leads the viewer to deal with a somewhat extravagant Charleston, SC family. Very romantic, beautifully filmed, well written and recited, "RIL" envelops you like a summer breeze while its meandering meander breathes life into the characters so that at the end of the film you will feel like an old family friend. > <br /> A film by the director of "Driving Miss Daisy", taken from the character of "Driving Miss Daisy", is a "dark little sleeper" that will appeal more to the mature public.
