I saw this film for the first time when I was little and I immediately fell in love with it. The sets are breathtaking and some of the scripts are damn hilarious: "You children of a thousand fleas". <br /> <br /> It is always shown on TV late at night or really early in the morning I woke up at around 3am once and had just started. Television companies need to show a little more respect and put them in prime time on Sunday so that everyone can have the chance to see this good work. <br /> <br /> 10/10
