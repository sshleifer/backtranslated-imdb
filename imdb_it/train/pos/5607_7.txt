I once saw The Tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie. He uses many of the tropes of this kind: the left apartment, suspicious neighbors, apparitions, mysteries, hallucinations. The hero's life, Trelkovsky, seemed to be surrounded by evil and secret forces trying to drive him crazy. <br /> <br /> The last time I saw him I challenged this initial interpretation. If this film is a horror film, it's just horror in the sense that a Kafka novel is horror. In reality, this film can be understood on a literal level as a solitary man who is slowly going crazy without any outside influence. <br /> <br /> Polanski has made three films in his career that deal with madness: Repulsion, which are not particularly like because the development of madness in heroin has never convinced me; Rosemary's Baby, in which the heroine is maddened by the forces of evil; and The Tenant, which could be the best study of paranoia ever made in cinema. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky is a young man who rents an apartment where a woman killed herself. She becomes obsessed with her and slowly starts to become her: she wears her clothes, wears makeup, speaks like her. But is he possessed by a spirit, or is he simply letting his wild imagination get the best from him? It is this hesitation between what is real and imaginary and that Polanski never solves, which makes this film so fascinating. Many events in the film can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as they can to normal causes, and it is up to the viewer to decide what to believe. <br /> <br /> Although this is not my favorite Polanski movie, however, it is a good example of his ability to create suspense and portray madness in very convincing terms. And technically speaking, it is also a marvel. Suffice it to say that he is collaborating on this film with the film composer Philippe Sarde and legendary cinematographer Sven Nykvist (Bergman's DP). A slow pace and sometimes uninteresting segments can make it difficult to watch this film, but it's still an experience.
