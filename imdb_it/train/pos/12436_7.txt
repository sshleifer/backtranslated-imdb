I read modestly Blaise for several years, collecting numbers from the strip. After the fiasco film made many years ago based on the first book "Modesty Blaise", I was surprised by the result. <br /> <br /> What I got was a film not based on action or violence. The director had focused on history and psychology. How modesty was created based on one's own history and what parts of her life were influenced by her non-childhood. I think this thought will give greater understanding to the next film (I hope). I simply loved the old-fashioned style of movies. <br /> <br /> However, all was not well, gambling was not so good. almost boring and unreal. Even the acting could have been improved. I don't think the villain of this movie is real, the only reason he was there was that Modesty could have someone to tell his story. They could also have expanded the film, showing more about when it builds "The network", but I imagine it will be the next film. <br /> <br /> And please forgive me for my bad English
