******** Spoiler - Careful ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I'm biased when it comes to Urban Cowboy. I like it a lot and I've seen it countless times - and I've usually discovered something new with every vision. <br /> <br /> I think one of the things I like is that Urban Cowboy is about the people who work in the classroom, not the rich who live in LA or New York. Well, it's true except for Pam. <br /> <br /> Travolta plays Bud, a Texas guy who moves to Houston to work in the oil fields. And this is when Travolta actually played in good dramatic films like Saturday Night Fever instead of playing bad / good guys stereotypes in big budget movies. This is a really beautiful film - the mechanical bull riding competition and the two-step dance can be nonsense, but you have to enjoy it for what it is. <br /> <br /> Bud meets Sissy (played by Debra Winger with slutty brilliance) - and soon after, they are married and live in their dream trailer park. But their relationship becomes a real battle of sex life. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to be with a real cowboy. But in modern times, the roles of men are not so clear. Where can Bud prove he is a real man? He can work his dangerous work by day and ride the mechanical bull at night - he can be an "urban cowboy". But Sissy wants to drive his pickup, and he also wants to drive the mechanical bull. So where does this Bud come from? While Sissy asserts her independence, she lies atop the bull and flirts with the ex-con rodeo star - a real bull rider--, Wes (played wonderfully oily by Scott Glenn). Bud is threatened and Bud and Sissy leave. <br /> <br /> Sissy takes care of Wes, who abuses her. Moving further, Bud becomes the toy of Pam's boyfriend, a rich girl whose father is in oil and all that he implies. Sissy comes from the trailer to clean it up - Pam doesn't do that sort of thing. He writes a make-up letter to Bud, but the evil Pam tears it to pieces and takes the credit for Sissy's household chores. <br /> <br /> Bud's uncle tragically dies at work when lightning strikes and causes an explosion. Bud and Sissy have a chance of reconciliation, but they are too stubborn. Later the bull riding contest is in Gilley, and you know that Bud will win. Pam realizes that Bud doesn't love her, but Sissy - did it for her. Wes tries to rob Gilleys, but you don't know that the urban cowboy, Bud, saves the day and wins the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> Of course, you might wonder why Bud and Sissy would go to Gilleys every night and "live like pigs". Perhaps this contributed to their bad marriage. Or why Bud didn't stay with Pam - it wasn't so bad and he had money. Or why they had to kill Uncle Bob. Or why Bud and Sissy had such stupid friends as Marshall and Jessie who always tried to tear them to pieces: Marshall tells Bud, "She {Sissy} rides that bull better than you!" But part of the fun of Urban Cowboy is to take it a little and say, it's not Bonnie Raitt on stage!
