The film sings and dances absolutely fun with Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson. <br /> <br /> The film won and Oscar for the soundtrack of George E. Stoll, and received nominations for best film, best actor for Kelly and Best Cinematography, as well as a nomination for the best son of " I Fall in Love Too Easily ", sung by Sinatra. <br /> <br /> It was a good story about Kelly helping her friend Sinatra take a girl and fall in love with herself. The adorable Grayson (The Toast of New Orleans) dazzled us with his singing, and we had a lot of great songs and choreographies by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the artistic skill of pianist-director Jos√© Iturbi. <br /> <br /> A classic Hollywood music of a bygone era.
