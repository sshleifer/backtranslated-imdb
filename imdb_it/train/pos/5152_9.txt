"Hitler, the rise of Evil" is clearly produced by people emotionally lightened by the horrors of the Second World War. Which makes the vision of a refreshing experience. <br /> <br /> I think its greatest value lies in its clear revelation of the Nazi mechanism. Completely corrupt ways in which Hitler used to get to the top. Arrived there, this movie ends. <br /> <br /> When at the top, the "Fuhrer" (= German for "leader") led his Germany to the largest and most devastating war in human history. It ends six years later in the total defeat of Germany. As a result, Germany lost its eastern provinces (= about 35% of its pre-war territory), and was forced to accept a 44-year division of its remaining territory. Both West and East Germany had to be rebuilt from the wreckage, their reputation badly damaged by the many Nazi-inspired racist atrocities. <br /> <br /> As I said, "Hitler, the rise of Evil" makes a good watch. Set in an acceptable 1930s environment, with (more than) competent acting. In particular the role of Peter O'Toole stands out as the old president von Hindenburg, also adds an extra dimension. <br /> <br /> My copy of "Hitler, the rise of Evil" also provides a second DVD with two good film documentaries. One concerns Hitler's personality, the second concerns the falsification of Hitler's journals. In 1983 this fake caused a hilarious scandal in England and Germany, damaging the reputation of several historians and journalists.
