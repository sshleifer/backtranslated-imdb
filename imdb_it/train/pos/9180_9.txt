I felt compelled to watch Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke's 1983 adaptation of "Jane Eyre" because I had just written an article on the 2006 BBC "Jane Eyre" for TheScreamOnline. <br /> <br /> So, I approached observing how I approached my homework. <br /> <br /> At first I was irritated. The lighting in this version is bad. All / all has faded into a brilliant white light that, in some scenes, casts shadows on the wall behind the characters. <br /> <br /> And the sound is poorly recorded. I felt like I was listening to a high school game. <br /> <br /> And the pancake trick is too heavy. <br /> <br /> And the sets don't fully convey the gothic atmosphere of the novel. Martha Stewart is too fussy. I really can't see Bronte's Rochester complying with Martha Stewart's domestic agreements. Orson Welles's Rochester lived in a cave-like darkness, very appropriate to the gothic mood of the novel. <br /> <br /> Yet ... with all those objections ... not only is this the best "Jane Eyre" I saw, it could be the best adaptation of any novel I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This "Jane Eyre", despite its technical flaws, brought back the feeling of reading "Jane Eyre" for the first time. <br /> <br /> Critics of this production say it's too close to the book. For me, someone who appreciated the book and didn't need it to be less "wordy" or less "Christian" or more sexual, the loyalty of this version to the novel that Bronte actually wrote is his best asset. > <br /> Bronte wrote a good book. There is a reason why they lasted more than 150 years, while others, clearer, sexier and easier texts, have disappeared. <br /> <br /> A long time fan of "Jane Eyre", I had prejudices against Timothy Dalton as Rochester. Notoriously, Rochester is not beautiful; Jane and Rochester are the famous ugly couple of literature. And Timothy Dalton is nothing if not extraordinarily beautiful. <br /> <br /> But Dalton gives a hypnotic performance like Rochester. He simply blew me away. I've never seen anything like his absolute devotion to the role, the text, the dialogue and the love of Rochester for Jane. Dalton brings the page's Rochester to shake the life on the screen. <br /> <br /> Rochester wants to be a little scary. Dalton is scary. Welles also has a frightening streak, for example, when he shouts "Enough!" after that Fontaine plays a short piece of piano. But Dalton is scary more than once here. You can't really tell if it will hurt Jane, or himself, in his despair. Rochester's imperiousness, his humor, his anger, his vulnerability: Dalton transmits everything, sometimes within a second. It is surprising. <br /> <br /> And here is the fundamental thing: the actor who plays Rochester must communicate that he has spent more than a decade of his life in total despair, alone, living with a bad secret that destroys life. <br /> <br /> No other actor I've seen attempting this part transmits that black hole of despair like Timothy Dalton does. Toby Stephens' favorite fan doesn't even try. Dalton hits him outside the park. If I saw Timothy Dalton perform in a singles bar in Rochester, I'd say "That guy's a problem, don't even look at him." It is radioactive with compressed anxiety. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is not alone, on the whole, the best Jane I have ever seen, is one of the very few Janes that the producers were willing to throw while the book was launching Jane. . No, people who know "Jane Eyre" only from the 2006 version, Bronte did not * describe * a statuary, robust Jane with finely arched eyebrows and pouty lips. Rather, Charlotte Bronte's Jane is, in fact, poor, simple, dark, small and NOT cute. <br /> <br /> Zelah has a small mouth, close-set eyes and a little nose. She is really "small". You are not a fashion model. And she is the best Jane, the most real of the book. <br /> <br /> Some described it as cold or boring. No, she is faithful to the book. Bronte's Jane is not a hot mother, she is a protected and private teenager, whose inner passions come out only in key moments, as Zelah does here. Jane of the book is a person you have to watch slowly, carefully, patiently, carefully, if you really want to fathom her depths. You have to see Zelah here to find out who he really is. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see more fire in Zelah in a key scene, but that's a five-hour scene in which she is, otherwise, very good. <br /> <br /> Despite its proximity to the text, this version, like every other version I've seen, moves away from fully expressing openly Christian themes in "Jane Eyre." Christianity is not an incidental subtext in "Jane Eyre", it is central. <br /> <br /> Helen Burns instructs Jane in Christianity, thus giving her a subversive, counter-cultural way of reading and living, apparently doomed, pinched life. It is Christianity, and a Christian God, who convinces Jane, poor, simple and obscure, of her equal value, her need to live according to her ideals and her rejection of a key marriage proposal. This is not made completely clear here. <br /> <br /> In any case, Charlotte Bronte has written an excellent, complex and rich novel, and this adaptation of all those I've seen, mines and honors the best novel of any adaptation I've seen, and this says very. <br /> <br /> Other versions, which do not completely honor the book, end up being a task to keep an eye on in many places. If you don't care about what Charlotte Bronte has to say about child abuse, or the hypocrisy of a culture built on looks and money, your adaptation of much of the book will be something that people will move forward quickly to get to kissing scenes between Jane and Rochester. <br /> <br /> This version, like Bronte's novel, understands that all that Bronte wrote - about Jane's experiences at Lowood and her relationship with St. John - are part of what makes the relationship Jane with Rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is.
