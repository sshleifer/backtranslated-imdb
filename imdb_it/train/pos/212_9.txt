Just like the comic duo of his title, "The Sunshine Boys" has become a forgotten classic 30 years later. It is just mentioned along with other great movie comedies of the 70s. This makes no sense given the singularity of this film, perhaps the best Neil Simon I've ever written. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau plays Willy Clark, once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as Lewis and Clark, now bitter 73-year solo act that can't find work in a French fries spot. His nephew and agent Ben (Richard Benjamin) is sure he can get a job if Willy agrees to reunite with his former partner Al Lewis (George Burns) for an ABC-TV celebration of show business nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia is what "Sunshine Boys" started hitting, from the beginning, when a series of films from the twenties showed various entertainers of old flashes before us with the accompaniment of "Be A Clown "by Cole Porter. Then there is the setting of today's film in Manhattan, where flared trousers and large polyester ties abound. The periods clash in Willy's glorious confusion in a Manhattan apartment, where framed pictures and long-dead celebrity cartoons stare out the walls at scandalous headlines and empty Zabar shopping bags. If you were alive in the 70s like me, you might even feel like you're in that apartment. Willy has clearly lived there too long. He sleeps in front of the TV when the kettle boils in the other room. Willy wakes up and picks up the phone. <br /> <br /> "Hi, who is it?" A pause "It doesn't matter, it's tea." <br /> <br /> Older men who live alone can be a sad material in the hands of anyone else, but Simon's skillful intelligence and his infallible feeling for the character transform this comedian of his 1972 theatrical success in a gold comedy. The amazing thing about "The Sunshine Boys" is how much you rub your nose in Willy's almost existential condition without ever getting discouraged. "89 years old, he dies from scratch" "says Willy of an old composer friend, before deciding that the man was probably dead for writing a song that rhyme" lady "with" baby ". <br /> <br /> Burns won an Oscar for his understated performance as the gentle but elastic Lewis, but it is Matthau who brings this home, his make-up and his proud but brazen bearing that really convinced you of the idea he had already 73 years old when he did this Willy is hateful to the extreme, fully deserves the description of Ben "crazy old fool", but you root it all the time, enjoying his little victories even when they come at the cost of the patience of others His lines also kill you, especially when he tries to kill Lewis, for whom the televised meeting turns out to be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> "You're out of the world!" Willy tells Lewis at one point . "I am still in great demand. I'm still hot! "<br /> <br />" If this room were on fire you wouldn't be hot, "Lewis replies. <br /> <br /> Director Herbert Ross turns everything so casual and sober, with shots low light and medium level even in emotional moments, to leave room for comedy and the overall zen message of grace through a quiet acceptance.You never have the feeling of watching a movie, one of "The Sunshine Boys" many spells, and Ross's direction, like the recitation of the three main ones, is very important to achieve this purpose. <br /> <br /> Comedy is difficult, especially when the subjects are people who look at life passing them, but "The Sunshine Boys "makes everything a pleasure, because, for us, it's just like that.
