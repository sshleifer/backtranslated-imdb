This show will be successful because it is aimed at all adults, regardless of where they are in their relationship. As a married man for 26 years, I identify with the character of Patrick Warburton: he loves his wife, but assumes he knows it. I also like his monotonous delivery; never too excited or too low. A nice group of characters. This will be a nice addition to the Monday night line-up. <br /> <br /> I don't know what David Spade will look like in his role. It is best to savor it in small doses. It also looks a little old to still be trolling for women. <br /> <br /> I liked the pilot and can't wait to see how the series develops.
