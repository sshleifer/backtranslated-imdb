I really enjoyed this movie. I've always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this film only emphasizes it. It portrays a housewife in an African-American family who is going up the social chain due to the success of her husband (Danny Glover) as a lawyer. She moves to an all-white neighborhood where people are friendly, yet a little embarrassing to her. The various events that occur during the course of the film make SOME laugh, but above all they attract other emotions. This film is not so much a comedy as a drama. I give him a strong 8/10. I highly recommend taking it on TV or renting it soon.
