Surprisingly good. The acting was fun, the script was fun, the music was fun, the plot was incredibly fun. This was a fun movie to watch and give your brain some rest. Parts of the plot and quotes I found very creative. 7 out of 10. In fact, for what it was, it deserves a 10 out of 10. It is not supposed to be compared to an auteur film or a bloody slasher movie.
