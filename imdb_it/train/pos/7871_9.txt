Madhur Bhandarkar does everything possible to touch on the taboo issues and provides the most realistic image of modern society. One also gets the director's impression from his previous films like Satta and Chandni. The issues just mentioned in this last film are explored and exhibited in their entirety here. The casting is incredible and you can see the judgments on each scene from many points of view. Mostly, the movie leaves you asking a lot of facts around. When you start to guess things, you will eventually find yourself at close range, but lose your mark in many scenes. In the end it leaves a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> The actors to watch out for are Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni, among others. The dialogues are well written and you feel you have lived around these people. There are still some scenes that make you think of more depth. The songs are in the background to save time and Lata's voice in a very significant song "Kitne Ajeeb" leaves you feeling left alone in the midst of modern society!
