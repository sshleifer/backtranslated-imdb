I never understood why the song of the swan MacDonald-Eddy has always been so mercilessly discredited - not just by detractors but by almost everyone. For me, "I Married an Angel" is more lively and imaginative than all the most famous releases of the duo. The sets and costumes are as luxurious as those found in a MGM musical, the script is entrusted to the reliable Anita Loos ("San Francisco", "Women", "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", etc.), The Rodgers and Hart's songs (albeit slightly altered by MacDonald-Eddy's regular customers, Bob Wright and Chet Forrest) receive a heavenly treatment from Herbert Stothart (Oscar winner for recording "The Wizard of Oz") and, above all , the "singer lovers" seem great in their contemporary clothes and seem to enjoy the bizarre procedures. Try to show "Rose Marie" or "Sweethearts" to today's non-experts and may also have difficulty staying still, but this unusual and hectic fantasy is destined to entertain.
