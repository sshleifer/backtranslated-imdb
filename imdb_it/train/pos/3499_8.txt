Raising Victor Vargas is a film you absolutely must see. It was very heartfelt and had a lot of humor that got you sucked directly. It is very similar to real life with what teenagers have to go through. Victor, an arrogant teenager, but with a good heart eventually takes care of love in all the right places that deal with girls and family. In the end, Victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with an old grandmother and a girl he wants to use uses it too. I recommend people to watch this movie because it will be like looking at a real family. Here's how this movie feels. A moment when he felt his heart was when Victor's grandmother threw the winner on something simple. Victor really was a heart and couldn't believe he would do something like that. It made me feel really sorry for him as if it were real. Overall I give this film a B +
