Moonwalker is probably not the movie to watch if you are not a Michael Jackson fan. I'm a big fan and I enjoyed most of the movie, the ending wasn't great but the first 50 minutes or so was - if you're a fan. <br /> <br /> I personally believe that the first 50 minutes are reusable many times. The dance in each video is breathtaking, the music is fantastic to listen to and the dialogue is fun. <br /> <br /> Includes many of his best Bad videos and fragments of his previous videos. Also includes some live concert images. <br /> <br /> If you are a big Michael Jackson fan, this is a must, if you are not a fan / I don't like Michael Jackson, keep it clear. <br /> <br /> 9/10
