The dialogues written by Simon are really thrilled by Matthau and Burns. You can literally hear the script crackling. There are a few movies out there that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the script. For example, the famous meeting scene could have been much more boring with poor quality actors involved. Matthau seems to have been born to play Willie Clark (obviously, Oscar moreso in The Odd Couple), and with all the little idiosyncrasies and mannerisms that Matthau stipulates in the character (the line in which he is claiming he's with him since he lives in the city while Lewis lives in the country where Lewis is "out of the world" is the example par excellence of this) makes this one of the best performances I've ever seen of any actor in any role, be it comic or dramatic or anything else. Period. Matthau and Burns work very well together; the contrast they portray accentuates Simon's extraordinary ability to create comic conflicts. This film is simply one of the last "must-see" and requires a legitimate prestigious place in the history of cinema.
