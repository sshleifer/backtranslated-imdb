This is a nice movie, even if the premise is stupid. It was a kind of guilty pleasure to watch. Meg Ryan seems to be able to play roles in this type of film (another example is Joe vs the Volcano). This is what makes it a star, in part. Walter Matthau also had this ability and he really put himself in the role, making Einstein a fun, kind-hearted person. I suppose we can say that they are both good at portraying lovely characters, although lovable in different ways (lovely young women against lovely musoni).
