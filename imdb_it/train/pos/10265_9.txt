A unique film about the confused woman (Lindsay Crouse) who gets involved with acute fraudsters. Joe Mantegna gives an Oscar level show as the brightest in the group. Absolutely enchanting first hour, as Mantegna shows Crouse "the strings" of his games. The plot unfolds a little later, but still stands as a unique portrait of an innocent captured in a dark world. Definitely worth a try.
