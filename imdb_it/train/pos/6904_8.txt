This is one of the few movies I can watch over and over again. If you've never seen it, give it a shot. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are wonderful together and although the film really amuses me, it reminds me of Julia's premature death. It is a good opportunity to sit down and laugh at the international plot that is too much with us in this moment of terror and fear.
