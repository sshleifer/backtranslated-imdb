Deliverance is the fascinating, disturbing and sometimes disturbing tale of James Dickey, transformed into a brilliant John Boorman film. They are four businessmen, driven by manhood and macho behavior, who are spending a weekend canoeing in the mountains. Up there, they face every darker side of man and every worst form of human misery ... poverty, sodomy and even physical harassment! These four men intended to travel along the river for adventure and excitement, but their journey soon turned into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountain land, completely estranged from all forms of civilization. All these elements make Deliverance one of the most nightmare movies I've ever seen. Almost everything that happens to these men, pray that you will never find yourself in a similar situation. Pure talking cinema, Deliverance is also a very important film. The best of John Boorman (closely followed by Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film and contains several memorable scenes that have already been presented in countless other films. Just think of the extraordinary soundtrack of "Dueling banjos" and, of course, of the unforgettable homosexual scene of "rape like a pig". All actors offer (haha) perfect recitations. Especially Jon Voight. A must see !!
