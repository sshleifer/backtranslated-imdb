Chloe is mysteriously saved by Dr. Caselli, the corrupt doctor responsible for transferring patients with skill from Belle Reve to Project 33.1, and a fraction of a second later Clark arrives. He discovered that Bart Allan returned to Smallville and met at Kent Farm. When Bart is captured by Lex during a break in a LuthorCorp facility, Clark discovers that the Green Arrow has also hired Bart (a.k.a. Impulse), Arthur Curry (Aquaman) and Victor Stone (Cyborg) to investigate the Project 33.1. Clark agrees to join the trio to save Bart and invites Chloe to participate in their mission. <br /> <br /> "Justice" is the best episode so far this season six. In this episode, the Justice League begins its saga with the association of five heroes: Clark, Green Arrow, The Flash ("Impulse"), Aquaman and Cyborg. Chloe's participation is spectacular, completing the organization necessary for teamwork. In the end, Oliver breaks with Lois based on the importance of fighting against criminals and Lex's secret labs around the world. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Justi√ßa" ("Justice")
