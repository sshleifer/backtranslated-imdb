The new David Lynch short is a very "Lynchian" piece, full of darkness, tension, silence, discreet but very structured background music, and still presents two beautiful actresses, a blonde and a brunette, a recurring theme in her work. > <br /> Both characters create a very intriguing slave-friend relationship that could be seen as a direct follow-up to the same type of relationship as in Mulholland Dr. <br /> <br /> Beautiful. For Lynch fans. <br /> <br />
