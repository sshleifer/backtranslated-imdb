A film by Frank Capra WONDERS OF LIFE. <br /> <br /> Keeping the blood flowing in our veins is the responsibility of the hard-working HEMO THE Magnificent. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1950s, AT&T and Bell Science teamed up with the famous Hollywood director Frank Capra to produce a series of CBS science television films to educate the public about the universe around them. Far removed from the monotonous black and white forages that were often spread among young scholars, the films Capra would teach and entertain with lively screenplays and captivating images shown in Technicolor. The four films - OUR MR. SUN (1956), THE STRANGE CASE OF COSMIC RAYS (1957), HEMO THE MAGNIFICENT (1957), THE UNCHAINED GODDESS (1958), quickly became the favorite of the schools, where they were shown to infinity in 16mm format. <br /> <br /> The star of the series was Dr. Frank C. Baxter (1896-1982), an affable English professor at the University of Southern California. This avant-garde pedagogue proved to be the perfect film instructor, brilliantly imparting to his audience the sometimes complex facts in a way that never made them boring or boring. Dr. Baxter, who won a Peabody Award for his achievements, continued to make high quality educational films after the Capra quartet ended. <br /> <br /> HEMO THE Magnificent, produced, written and directed by Capra, tells the story of the human heart and blood circulation system, using gentle animation and humor. Movie star Richard Carlson appears as the Fiction Writer, energetically helping Dr. Baxter tell the story of Hemo. <br /> <br /> The film mavens will recognize Sterling Holloway as part of the television crew and the voices of Marvin Miller, Mel Blanc, June Foray and Pinto Colvig as various cartoon characters, all uncredited. <br /> <br /> The devotional Scripture that begins the film is completely in tune with the tenor and tone of the production.
