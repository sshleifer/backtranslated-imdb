Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by the unconventional film Samuel Fuller, contains an extraordinary opening that establishes a double complication. The painter Subway Candy (Susan Peters) clashes with the pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark immersed in the shades of Sinatra cool). He is not aware of having a precious microfilm; McCoy is not aware of giving it up. Both are not aware of being watched by two federal agents. In this way the drift sets in motion a certain degree of knowledge. Candy is doubly guarded (Skip and the police) and therefore doubly naive; Skip, the petty thief, is singularly unaware, dragged by federal agents; the feds, all knowing, are ultimately powerless. They cannot stop the "passage" of government secrets or the spread of communism.
