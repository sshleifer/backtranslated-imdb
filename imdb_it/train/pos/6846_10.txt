The film gets my approval mark. The scene in the museum requires acting without dialogue. This is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of cinema. Dickinson's character, Kate, is very well developed and his interpretation is felt throughout the film. The best work Angie Dickinson did from Point Blank!
