From the beginning you see that "Anchors Aweigh" is a great comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a fun team! The songs they sing together are pure fun. Kathryn Grayson is beautiful and really sweet. Dean Stockwell is the smallest child actor I have never seen. If you are a piano fan, you will be surprised by Jos√© Iturbi. This film was the first to combine animation with real actors and did it wonderfully in an unforgettable dance number. Undoubtedly one of Kelly's funniest films.
