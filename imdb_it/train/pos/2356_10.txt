Pushing Daisies was a wonderful show. Very similar to Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, you can say it was created by Bryan Fuller. I can understand how people who do not like theater, cinema, musicals and so on would be annoyed. This is not a typical TV program and the fantastic is too much for some. These people seem to need a slightly more linear and silent tone to make them happy. This program bursts with colors, winks at old movie scenes, hums with incredible music and talented performances. There is nothing random about the choices made by the leitmotiv costume. The story takes many twists and turns, but they are all very accessible because the conversations are about love, honesty, courage, loss and so many other things we face every day. The only unfortunate aspect was the show's finale and this was rushed because Pushing Daisies was canceled. Do not approach this as a typical television program. Think of an evening at the theater, so sit back and have fun!
