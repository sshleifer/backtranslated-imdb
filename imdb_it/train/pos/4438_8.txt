Director Edward Montagne does in just over an hour what other more expensive and exaggerated films do. Mr. Montagne shows us a detective story written by Phillip H. Reisman Jr. which, although not one of the best of its kind, keeps the viewer involved in everything that is happening. <br /> <br /> This is clearly a type B film. In fact, the best thing for "The Tattooed Stranger" is the opportunity to take a look at the way New York looked in those years. The crystalline cinematography of William O. Steiner, has been maintained over the years, or has been carefully restored. <br /> <br /> There are fantastic views of New York in the opening sequence. Later we are taken to the Dumbo section in Brooklyn and later the film travels to the Bronx and the Gun Hill Road area with its many monuments shops in the area. <br /> <br /> John Miles and Walter Kinsella have made a great investigative team. Patricia Barry is perfect as a plant expert at the Natural History Museum. Jack Lord, who went on to more important things in his career, is seen in a non-speaking role. <br /> <br /> It was great fun to look at a city, as it was, because it no longer exists.
