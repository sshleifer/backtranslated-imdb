The Snowy River II Man does not reinvent the wheel but is a beautiful and pleasant film for the crowd that hits some important notes. <br /> <br /> For those fans who want the elements that made the original film Man From Snowy River hit, (breathtaking scenery, score, sweet romanticism and crackling action) this movie really offers. This story resumes some years after the end of the first, Jim (Tom Burlinson) was away collecting his fortune in a brood of escort horses. Return to resume from where he interrupted his adorable girlfriend Jessica (played by the divine Australian lady Sigrid Thornton) who is still trying to break the cursive breeding in the cattle station of her feather (Harrison is now played by American Brian Dennehy). The slogan of Jim and the character that shakes the plot is the wealthy snout of the high class Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie) who has his eyes on Jessica. Add to the mix some social tensions surrounding land properties and the stallion with a negative attitude from the first film and this is the plot. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film is acting. Tom Burlinson adapts perfectly to Jim's wide-brimmed hat and laconic humor. Sigrid Thornton is a lovely heroine and the two run true chemistry on the screen. Filling Kirk Douglas's solid shoes would never be easy and Brian Dennehy tramples and screams but never feels very authentic in this part. <br /> <br /> The music is wide and luxuriant and the cinematography could be a roll from a reel of Victoria tourism. However, there is a moment that feels very self-indulgent, like the director who just wants another helicopter ride of the knights to show how beautiful the landscape is without some personal human drama. A little more grit would have been enough here, we are Australians, we can take it !! There are some very JAWSish moments with the stallion that challenge beliefs. However, the funny thing about this movie is that among some dazzling clich√©s, there are some really imaginative and moving scenes. Jim puts the saddle on the stallion (VERY whispered horse ahead of time) Jim and Jessica get home, the fabulous scene where Jim shows Alistair riding with his trusty whip. I can understand why this character is such an icon. <br /> <br /> Overall a very nice sequel. We hope that everyone involved wants to do another. the Man From Snowy River III: I CRAIGS. I'm sure we'd all like to see how Jim and Jessica are on their farm. <br /> <br /> The Australian DVD contains a couple of extra scenes. It's worth it if you're already a fan.
