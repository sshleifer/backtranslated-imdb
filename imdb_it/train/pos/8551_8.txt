Ti% s and As *, many tits. Some great characters, funny jokes and well put together teen action in this spin off of the Amercan Pie series. This really looks like OLD SCHOOL. Seems a bit like Porkys for the 2000s. Some great funny characters combined with some very funny situations make this a real surprise for me. <br /> <br /> While the original cast is almost finished except one, I found this movie really fun. Let's not get too excited, you have to take it for the booby teen comedy that it is, but for what it is, it excels. The characters are funny and fun, the girls are hotter than hell. Fun and games are hilarious, with some things I've never seen in comedies before, they make me shiver but at the same time laugh. <br /> <br /> So ignore the haters and give a run and see what you think. Don't expect the classic American Pie, but wait for something that should make you laugh and turn your attention for about an hour.
