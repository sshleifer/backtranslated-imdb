When you usually watch in a short film, you always fear that the person who creates the film will try to throw too much into it. This is not the case with this. A good story about a girl who has had enough and other worldly forces trying to help make things right. Eric Etebari does a wonderful job of representing the spirit of convoluted justice and helps convey the complexity of the blurry line of right and wrong. <br /> <br /> Both the young girl and the father give great shows in this wonderful short film, but Eric's performance is certainly the heartbreaker of the show in this story. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film for its complexity, its performance and its great history.
