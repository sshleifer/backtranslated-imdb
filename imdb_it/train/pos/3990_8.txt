Maggio and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren. The visit is embarrassing because the grandchildren and the "children" do not seem to know each other as one would expect. The heat that should be missing is missing. After dinner, May's husband says he does not feel well, blames his daughter's kitchen and says irritated that he wants to go home. He dies that night. <br /> <br /> May, now a widow, is lost. He clearly didn't have a passionate or very interesting marriage, but he had a purpose. She had someone who needed her, and even though her needs had been unsatisfied for years, she had something to do with her days. <br /> <br /> It is depressed and unmotivated. She goes to stay with her daughter, Paula, who shortly after her mother's arrival, lets her mother know that she never heard that her mother gave much of herself. He gets rid of anger at his mother's lack of nourishment. May looks disarmed and surprised, but she also doesn't seem to have the energy or the desire to do it really well. "I am your mother and I love you." What does it really say? (I heard this from my mother too often and I still have to figure out what it means.) Paula is a little (well, more than a little) neurotic. Both women are needy, even if they show it very differently. <br /> <br /> Paula was involved with a friend of her son, Darren, who is a handyman who works in his son's home. While Paula works during the day, May starts having conversations and lunches with Darren. Darren is a married man who stayed with his wife because of their autistic son, Nicky, but presumably does not live at home with his wife. <br /> <br /> He can be attracted to Darren because he is manly and she enjoys the connection they seem to have. Darren has been attracted since May because it offers a kind of peace and understanding that she doesn't get from the other women in her life. (He too becomes too interested in the money that May says he can give him to "get away from it all", even though he is clearly not interested in his desire to join him on such a journey, ending up sleeping together in the guest room during the day , and May enjoys fulfillment as a woman she has not known for years, nor had she ever expected to know again. As her daughter Paula had often told her that she would leave Darren married, this is part of the May rationalization that what he is doing is ok. <br /> <br /> In a group of writers who brings Paula, May is introduced, rather forced to be together with a widower she is not attracted to. sex with the older man, who clearly can barely perform, and is really painful and disturbing when we see the total disgust on May's face as she bears the horrible liaison. <br /> <br /> In the end, Paula discovers through some schiz very graphic zi made by his mother, which in fact was his mother and Darren having sex. <br /> <br /> This film will undoubtedly be seen by many in a myriad of ways. The sympathies will be divided. At one point, during Paula's writing group, May reveals through a short essay that she used to feel as if she hated her children by the end of the day, and would go to the pubs after sleeping, making sure to return home before her husband. <br /> <br /> Clearly, a good mother does not think of leaving the children alone while going to the local pub. May, however, also revealed earlier in the film that her husband didn't like her having friends, so she didn't have any. He did what he wanted her to do. He was unhappy, but he endured it because, as he said, "it was easier". So, while May was not the best mother, for those who were inclined to sympathize with her, one could see May's actions as the act of a woman who wants to be only sexually and live for "a few minutes" in her life. . A woman who only wanted someone to listen to her, who knew her as a human being, who had a friend and a lover. <br /> <br /> Paula, although neurotic and unhappy, may have become so thanks to the distant parents who raised her. Of course, it's not hard to understand why Paula feels completely betrayed by her mother. <br /> <br /> It is a well-made film, with more complexity than the ones I mentioned, and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many reactions, perhaps contradictory. It is a film worthy of being discussed and debated and, above all, worthy of being seen. <br /> <br /> One thing the film leaves us with is the horror and fear of a lonely life. Regardless of who is considered "right" or who is considered "wrong" by every viewer, that theme of old age and loneliness, which evokes a sense of terror in most of us, is inevitable.
