When it came out for the first time, my father brought it home - we were stunned by it - it was so different from everything we had seen before. I was looking for a specific movie last night, and found 'The Mind's Eye' again. The box is falling apart and I'm surprised the tape still works! Although it is not the quality "Finding Nemo" graphics, it is still very good. They should sell it again, it's a benchmark for computer animation images. Highly recommended!
