I thought it was a wonderful movie. Touch every fiber of a human being. Love in the film is very intense. I thought it was Will's best performance to date. Great direction. I liked the editing. The music was great. Good use of flashback. This is the kind of movie that everyone should see. I hope people will get something wonderful out of this. Overall, an excellent film. I think Hollywood should make more films with the substance. Action movies can also have a thoughtful history. I like the fact that Will was very subtle in his acting. It had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see. I would suggest looking at it alone or with someone you really care about. For me, I discovered that the world stopped and my only goal was the film. The outside world has been suspended for a moment. It was a great feeling with all this chaos going on in this world. And with this generation of me it was nice to see something (someone) that cares about other people more than itself.
