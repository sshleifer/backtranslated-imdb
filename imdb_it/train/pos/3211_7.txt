this movie is ok if you like senseless actions, corny acting and a very small plot! The special effects are decent considering that this film is from the director of "Event Horizon". The costumes are like something out of a maximum crazy movie. None of the soldiers talk, so the others tell them what to do. Eventually it will turn into a great shooter movie with explosions everywhere. I personally really liked Russell in "tango and cash" "getaway from / new york" and "executive decision". Must see this movie leave your mind at the door for a mindless action science fiction movie !!
