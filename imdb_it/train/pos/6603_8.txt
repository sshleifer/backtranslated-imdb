I must mention two failures to make you understand that this film succeeded brilliantly where they failed: "A Scanner Darkly" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". If you've been excited by the concepts of these two films and felt sadly disappointed (like me), you'll probably appreciate the Renaissance. It immerses you in the world of a future Paris. It's not dystopic enough. They did the animation so well that I thought it was rotoscopied, but from what I can tell, it wasn't, it was just motion capture. Facial expressions are fantastic! Not since I saw a fantasy world so well seen in a hybrid live / animation. The medium in black and white is used to slowly direct attention to the subject of the scene; my favorite effect was what they did with the headlight beams, look at it. The director plays with your attention and confusion, but in the end you are satisfied finding the thread he wants you to find. The overall effect is a tough and gritty urban world full of little surprises. <br /> <br /> The plot is secondary, but it's not terrible. It's noir-ish. There is a backstory for most of the main characters that gives them some depth. There is time There are "sets" to make you feel like you're in different places in Paris. There is some action, and even a car chase. I'll have to see this again to get everything. I also recommend a very large screen to view it while the "sets" are detailed and the credits are small.
