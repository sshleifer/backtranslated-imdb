If the first film by Jean Renoir "Whirlpool of Fate" brings us to the world of the countryside for the first time, the rivers, the lives of the peasants that will continue to explore, it seems right that his second film represents mostly the rich and privileged , the upper classes and those who are trying to make their way to the top. Put together the characters from the first two films and you have the seeds of his great "Great Illusion" and "Rules of the Game". This film is beautifully filmed, with the restless camera that takes full advantage of the enormous apartments and backstage areas that dominate the interiors of the film, and the acting, although often exaggerated, also offers great moments, especially Werner Krauss's Muffat. But the seductive and charming Ms. Hessling, who at first seems as if she could give Louise Brooks a run for her money in vampirism, never goes beyond a selfish, selfish harlot representation. Perhaps this is partly a problem with the script, which seems to go mainly for high points and indignant emotions; not having read the novel I did not understand if the choices were well done or not. <br /> <br /> However, the differences between Nana's suitors are well designed, and I particularly liked the relationship between Jean Angelo's Muffat and le Vandeuvre - the tragic agreements that each one seems to have of his last destiny and their mutual sympathy, particularly in the scene at the bottom of the enormous staircase where Vandeuvres warns Muffat, and we wonder if the violence will explode - this and other corners of the ridiculousness of the idle rich help to give the film the depth it has. <br /> <br /> Far from its greatest results, and for me it is probably just shy in the "Whirlpool of Fate" complex, this is still worth seeing for Renoir fans or those interested in cinema dumb in general.
