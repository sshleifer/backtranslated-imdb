My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Comparable to today's film without brains (only action and special effects and nothing new about ideas), "Soylent Green" asks for something that no longer exists today: Thinking. <br /> <br /> Well, it would not be a big surprise one human day eats "cookies" that are created with the human body. With all that happens on this planet and to see how people are so indifferent to everyone, this kind of future is possible. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film requires a certain age, but the idea behind the film is real again. Rich in Paradise, more in hell. Good luck today is TV and idiocy as "Reality Show". <br /> <br /> TV is a good washing brain. It is a pity to see that human intelligence does not progress as technologies do. Since everything ends. <br /> <br /> If you like reality, this film is not for you. If you also believe all politicians. If you don't like to ask yourself questions about now and in the future, never watch this movie.
