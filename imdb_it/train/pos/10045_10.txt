I find it so surprising that even after all these years, we're still talking about this movie! Obviously this film was not so bad, otherwise people would not even have BECI to talk about it. I personally enjoyed this film immensely, and I still do it! I imagine this film is not for everyone, but it certainly touched the hearts of many. <br /> <br /> As for those who think this film is "overrated" or "over-hyped" ... well, we only have the cinema audience to thank for that! lol * See, they are not CRITICAL / article writers who make a "HUGE" film or a "HIT" with the general cinema audience. PEOPLE make the film a huge success. With Titanic, everyone was in awe. Let's face it, a film like this has never been made before. At least not with the kind of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so precise that even James Cameron has planned the true sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL that sank that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for the sake of God was up to it! <br /> <br /> Give this movie a break you guys! Critics have thought that this movie would have wasted a lot of time! When this movie came out and people started listening to WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertising you think) that this was a good / respectable movie, then everyone started flirting in theaters to watch this movie. .. not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So, I really wouldn't say that this movie was "overhyped" ... at least not like the reload for the reloaded MATRIX or the HULK is "overwritten". ah! The critics did not even think that Titanic would have earned enough to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that was needed to make this film movie. However, the film money has taken care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more! <br /> <br /> Personally, I LOVE this movie. However, this film may not be suitable for everyone. Don't say this movie sucks just for romance! It's the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Don't like a movie just because it has romance in it! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it ... the real star of the movie was not Leo or Kate ... it was that GIGANTIC ship! I think all the actors, including DiCaprio and Winslet, did a great job. It's not their best job (I've seen a lot of BETTER work from both of them) but it wasn't the WORST I saw on the screen before. Give him a break! <br /> <br />
