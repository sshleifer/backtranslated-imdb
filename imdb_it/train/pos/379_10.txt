1985 was a good year for the films - maybe even great ones - but what lost a gong was a long way to convince fans that Ol 'Oscar is a bit more an ornament for party members. <br /> <br /> 11 nominations and not a single title: such was the contempt of the Academy for one of their greatest directors; and one who had to wait another 8 years before any prejudice had prevented them from giving him the statue before allowed him to give him 7 for Schindler's List, which is arguably not good (and I'm half Polish). <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, Schindler was a classic. And I'm not even beating 'Out of Africa' (which won that year); but it was, in my opinion, a class behind this: an epic story of suffering and hope that made me cry - and I'm not a big cry. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was music (superb), or cinematography (sumptuous), but more likely simply acting: Whoopi, which showed us all to be more than just a comedian; Danny Glover, whom I had never heard of before; and, of course, Oprah. <br /> <br /> The rest is history; but at the moment: who knew?
