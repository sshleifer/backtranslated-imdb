In the rapid economic development of the 1990s in China, there is a revival of traditional Chinese culture, partly due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth and, above all, by the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post-Cultural-Revolutionary era. <br /> <br /> However, the revival of traditional Chinese culture, namely Confucianism, was not without disasters, because the Chinese adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part, and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film it is an excellent example. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, not only the part that should be discarded has been inherited, the good part that should have been inherited, like the traditional work and its technique, like changing face, was ignored in the resurrection , and in the face of extinction. <br /> <br /> The director used this film to criticize the problem of embracing the tradition of contemporary China and this is the deepest meaning behind the film.
