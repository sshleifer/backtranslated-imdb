"La madre" tells of a mother of two adult children (Reid), recently mid-60s, who, after her husband's death, wakes up from a life of sleepwalking while having an affair with a young carpenter who is also he is the married lover of his daughter. The film focuses on the silently passive mother, her tenuous relationship with her grown son and daughter, the silent needs that she tries to soothe in bed with her young lover and the resulting spiers. A rather antiseptic drama with rumblings of psychodramatic background, "The Mother" does a great job of dealing realistically with uncomfortable questions and avoiding free sensationalism. It will come best with a more mature, possibly female, audience that could empathize with the central character, his needs and problems. (B +)
