I read Schneebaum's book (the same title as this film) when it was first published and was deeply touched by his ability to see through the many ways of "otherness" (his and the people of Amazonia with which he lived and loved) to a way of living a decent life. His subsequent books were not so powerful, but they showed his continuous research. His description of his sexual relations with the tribesmen was way ahead of his time in the early 1960s, but his honesty and openness were welcome. This film magnificently transmits both the originality and the generosity of man, but also provides a glimpse of the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive term, in this case) that occurs when "civilized" men intrude in traditional societies. Even so, Schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of superior innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness.
