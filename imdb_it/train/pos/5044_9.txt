Bill Paxton is the protagonist and directs this very original film. Having seen the first time I was of how beautiful it was. The reviews I had heard were OK. Consequently I expected a maximum average thriller. However, due to Paxtons, it is worth watching the excellent directing and acting, especially if you are a fan of the horror film. The film is also helped by the twists that continue to come until the closing credits. The strength of the film is the plot that I have to say is very original and it's like I've never seen it before. Well done also to the 2 young conductors who perfectly convey the emotions if these kids get confused. I give this 9/10 movie and I highly recommend that everyone catches it.
