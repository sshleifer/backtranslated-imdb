What is more disturbing than this film is not that the nonsense that kills the school as described has actually happened, but that the truth is that they are performed by teenagers like Cal and Andre ... normal children with normal families. Using a hand-held shooting technique in the Blair Witch, Ben Coccio manages to take us into the lives of two friends who have some problems with high school, even though we are never told exactly what is behind those problems. They look typical - many people hate high school, so? A part of you does not believe that they will ever complete the well thought massacre on Zero Day. The scenes of the surveillance camera in the school during filming are made even more powerful for this reason. You can't believe it's really happening and it's really happened. The manual video camera technique also creates the illusion that this is not a copied film, a brilliant idea given the subject.
