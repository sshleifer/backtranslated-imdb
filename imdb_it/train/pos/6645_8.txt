An ultra-modern home in an affluent neighborhood seems to be the cause of every bizarre (and deadly) behavior of each of its inhabitants. Or at least that's what supports the character of Lara Flynn Boyle, Col Kennedy. After a series of deadly events in a giant house next door, Col knows something must come. Mark-Paul Gosselaar is also the mysterious architect. <br /> <br /> My opinion: The House Next Door works because of Lara Flynn Boyle and the places (beautiful house) and stylish sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, not to say absolutely extraordinary. It gives credibility to his character and makes the film intriguing. Without her, he would have failed. "It is so alive" declares a potential buyer in reference to the house. Yes, it's alive. But the story itself is not so much. <br /> <br /> Presence of Boyle's presence, not much happens, as a huge amount of film is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners. The results are predictable But I liked it anyway. Cinematography gives the film a refined appearance. 8/10 on behalf of Boyle, the premise of a wicked ultramodern house, the places and the cinematography, the decoration and the wardrobe.
