In Iran, women are officially banned from men's sporting events. In June 2005, the national soccer team of Iran has an important match against Bahrain in the Azadi stadium for the qualification of the World Cup. A group of Iranian girls and football lovers dress up as boys and unsuccessfully attempt to enter the stadium that is being arrested. <br /> <br /> Football (and the Flamengo team), beach and movies are my biggest passions; so I loved this little gem on a group of girls and their passion for football. Director Jafar Panahi, from "The White Balloon", "The Mirror" and "The Circle", shot this film on the day that Iran defeated Bahrain and qualified for the World Cup in Germany. The dramatic and fun adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
