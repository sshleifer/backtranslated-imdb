I have seen many Saura films and have always found the way in which it assembles music, dance, theater and great cinema in his films fantastic. Ib√©ria shows an even better Saura, dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music. Another thing that caught my attention is the fact that, in this film, dancers and musicians, dance and music, are equally important: the camera shows various aspects of musical interpretation, examining not only the technical problems but also the emotional experience of playing. Saura's interest in the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is another ingredient in turning this film perhaps the most aesthetically exciting of his other works. That's why I strongly recommend it to those who love good cinema, good music, good dance, great art.
