After playing a Nympho in WRITING ON THE WIND, Dorothy Malone finally said goodbye to her sweet sister / wife roles and demonstrated the ability to play the mantra with the best of them. She and Gloria Grahame played the same kind of tramps - and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role, Malone won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. <br /> <br /> The film in which it is located is not up to Oscar standards, but it is a fairly strong melodrama under the skilled hands of Douglas Sirk. There is an almost noir appearance to the explosive opening scene and sets the tone for the rest of the dirty fireworks in a story that has as its headline ROCK HUDSON, LAUREN BACALL, ROBERT STACK and DOROTHY MALONE. <br /> <br /> Domestic quarrels among the inhabitants of a wealthy family with a background of oil are the main focus of the drama, with an emphasis on strong supportive players, Stack and Malone. Both grab the opportunity with both hands and even Stack, he should have been rewarded for his excellent work as the weak, alcoholic brother driven to despair by his own motivations. <br /> <br /> Nominal stars have less impressive work to do, but do it with the usual skills and conviction - Hudson and Bacall. They play their most comprehensive roles with calm authority and understanding. <br /> <br /> The use of color is particularly surprising (as is usually the case in a Sirk film) and yet it does not prevent me from thinking of the film as a Technicolor film noir in the name of LEAVING TO THE SKY. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at with some interesting interpretations of the entire cast.
