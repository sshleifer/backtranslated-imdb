I have a 19 month old and I'm really tired of looking at Care Bears all the time. Rooney is a great dancer, who cares if he's gay. This guy must have been a cheerleader or something. <br /> <br /> Beats Barney, I can't get the songs off my head .... I have to ... stop singing ........ Doodlebops songs. ....... NOW. <br /> <br /> It must have 10 lines of text, so I have to continue ..... and when to say Canadian stuff like OOOUT Aboooot. Whacky Canadians ..... Jazmine rhymes too much, must be Dutch. <br /> <br /> Knock knock, who's there, Dee Dee, super Hottie <br /> <br /> Bus driver Bob can't dance, take lessons from Rooney
