I liked the movie. I love the two families that cross paths in history. The only question is if Sam is killed, then how does his family line continue? Is he the son of Madame Zeroni and Zero should be related but does not mention any other child? Hmmmmmmmmm. Never mentioned other children or wife before talking and falling in love with the teacher? Maybe he had a son before he became the kiss of Kate Bandit? Even with the errors in the film. I loved it. The acting was great. I don't know where the story with Mr. Sir was, Marion being a woman at the end, but it makes her character even more fun. The other "consultant" seemed worried about children but, of course, maybe not so much. Poor Warden must have had a really smelly childhood to be so mean when he grew up.
