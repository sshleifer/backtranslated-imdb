I just saw this version of "Samhain", and although I still like it, it doesn't look like the "rough cut" version I have. If you check the message board, you will see the director's apology for this reduced version, 79 minutes. He says he had nothing to do with this change cut out in an R scale with a completely new ending. Christian does not really need to distance himself so much, because the basic elements of the gore continue to stand, even if cut very well. This is a real shame, because this has had the potential to be one of the most glamorous and best films of recent years. It still has porn stars and blood relatives, and some of the extreme gores can be seen at least partially. I'm glad to have that "rough cut", because for me it's a gem for any gorehound bookstore. Christian Viel certainly has the skill and vision to deliver goods, and we hope his next project will be better produced. The idiots had a near-classic in their hands and they screwed him for everyone. "Samhain" could be one of the most controversial and abused horror films ever, and too badly the gurus couldn't see what the director meant. <br /> <br /> *********** ******************************* *** Just so you know what you missed, this is my review based on the "working press" of SAMHAIN. <br /> <br /> The film lasts just over 90 minutes and has no chapter breaks. There is absolutely no soundtrack to the music, and some of the scenes have no audio in the dialog box, because I think they are meant to be inserted later. However, most of the film has sound with sound effects, and when an effect or scene is missing, a message appears as a cue for insertion when the film is completed. It is exactly as they say, a "Rough Cut", but the only uncut version of "Samhain" that you are likely to see. Reason, because the gore is extremely graphic, much more than an NC-17 would allow. Yes, there are some porn stars, but they are there just for the murder and to add some sugar and spices. The story is pretty standard, American tourists on holiday in Ireland and end up staying in a house in the woods. An area that is heavy on folklore, involving the ancient Druids and the celebration of Samhain, or as we call it Halloween. (ghostly) <br /> <br /> The film begins with a huge dose of blood, as a pair of campers is attacked by one of the local inbred mutants. This is a great gore scene, as the boy finds his girlfriend hanging on a cliff, with her looking for help. All he sees are his head, his arms and shoulders hanging in front of him and when he pulls it up, it has been completely cut in two. This is what I would call EXTREME GORE, with entrails, blood and limbs cut everywhere. We are in the territory of Herschell Gordon Lewis here folks, apart from the much more realistic effects. I'll skip the story, because it's your standard stem and kill the plot. <br /> <br /> The next gore scene is something to see, as the boy from the first murder is taken to a cave as a place (Roba TCM-2) and tied to a table. This geek then cuts all the limbs (out of the camera, with a cue to insert a scene), and then we see his bust on a barbecue pit, slowly turning over a fire, and the bust has an erection (if can believe it). Yes, very tacky, coarse, creepy, you find the right word, and it probably fits too. <br /> <br /> Then later Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and all the rest, is cut from the neck to the groin, and all her innards are extracted in a graphic joy, and her blood drains into a pot. Yummy, a real breakthrough on huh? <br /> <br /> But the best gore scene happens inside the house, and I have to admit, this is one of the best gore scenes I've seen. This guy (no matter who) gets caught by a geek from behind and opens up his asshole. The geek then puts his hands inside and tears out all the guts of the boys, the intestines and what the hell else is there, right from his asshole. This continues FOREVER, while the boy is screaming and more and more integers are pulled out of the bathroom floor. This is so extreme, so over the top, that I found myself laughing all over hell. Obviously, you will NEVER see this scene on a real DVD, IMO, along with most of the other really extreme gore scenes. <br /> <br /> So, what to think of all this. Well, first of all, although I doubt that this film was ever released in this totally integral presentation, it makes this "Rough Cut" a rare jewel for the Gorecos. Yes, at first it is a bit difficult, with no soundtrack, some scenes still to be included and credits with missing names all over the place. But this is what makes this so unique, and I wouldn't change it for anything at the moment. Extreme gore, yes yes, extreme extreme taste. This makes "Haute Tension" a Disney movie.
