This is one of the great films of the 80s in my collection that I always think of. <br /> <br /> The Running Man is one of Arnold's best and most diverse films to date and when I first saw The Running Man I was so excited to see a movie like this. I love all the fights and this is really a special movie. It also has Jesse Ventura, the legendary Professor Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, the beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr. which always seems like death in his films because he was killed in film as Universal Solder, The Lost World, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2 and, among others. All Arnold fans should love this movie from beginning to end because it is full of action, full of stars, and is one of Arnold's best to date!
