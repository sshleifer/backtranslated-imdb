In another extravagant Bugs Bunny shorts, the famous leporide * works in a store window, when the owner Gildersleeve decides to stuff it. Of course, this turns out to be almost impossible, as Bugs apparently knows the shop better than Gildersleeve (and knows when he crosses transvestites). As always, they keep everything at top speed, so you have to ask yourself how funny this cartoon could have been when it debuted for the first time! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is a fine example of how the Looney Tunes looked in the 1940s before the Termite Terrace crowd polished them. But don't get me wrong, the cartoons were still very beautiful after the arrival of the refined shapes. <br /> <br /> However, this is fantastic. <br /> <br /> * The leorids are rabbits and hares.
