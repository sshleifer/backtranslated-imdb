This is a generally beautiful film, with a good story, great actors and great songs. The cinematography has unfortunately been bad. One of the weakest points in the film is the annoying chain of sequences copied by Pretty Woman. Why? Does it hurt to try a little originality, Abbas? Mustan? Anyone? <br /> <br /> The film is about a married couple, Raj and Priya (Salman - Rani). Priya cannot conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy, and eventually they decide to use a surrogate mother, who will bring their child. They choose Madhubala, a vulgar prostitute played by Preity Zinta. The film is not very realistic, I mean, isn't it easier to adopt? And even if they choose a girl, does that mean the man has to sleep with her? Have you heard of insemination? However, I suppose if the writers had heard of all this, the film would not have been made, so the concept is apparently intentional. <br /> <br /> Salman acts very well. It's nice to see him play a serious character. But his character suffers from useless and inexpensive dialogues about his great love for his wife and how difficult it is to find him sleeping with another woman. Come on, it's poor and unrealistic. Rani is simply OK; it is generally effective and tries to do something with the role, but is completely obscured by Preity Zinta. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Preity, which steals the show in style with its impeccable performance. It makes the transformation from a noisy prostitute to a sensitive woman easy and natural. He lives the film, emote and makes you love and at the same time admires it, partly for his role, partly for his magnetic and positive personality. This is one of his best career performances. There is no doubt that he is more talented than his contemporaries in the field. He should just do more of these roles. <br /> <br /> The ending of the film highlights only what I said above. It is heartbreaking, exciting and very well acted. Watch it for Preity. <br /> <br /> 7/10 for the movie! 10/10 - for Preity!
