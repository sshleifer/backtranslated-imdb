This is a great documentary film. Any fan of motor racing should have a copy of this exceptional film. The director "Stephen Low" did a great job, as did the protagonists of the film, Father & Son, Mario & Michael Andretti. The DVD looks and looks incredible. And above all it's IMAX! Excellent home theater test disc.
