The most beautiful film by John Singleton, before successful successes such as the remake of Shaft, this is a film that stimulates reflection with great acting and a superb balance between the stories of 3 main characters, each with identifiable youth problems. <br /> <br /> What I have The thing I like most is that it also covers the problem of authenticity among young blacks, a problem mostly ignored by the media and other films that focus mainly on partner problems -economic and on racism of whites. This film shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist. <br /> <br /> The masterful thing about this film is that it deals with many topics without being superficial. It is not just about racism, but how difficult adoption in a new world (college) can be, the date of rape, the discovery of sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson offer excellent performances, and the supporting cast is equally interesting with Jennifer Connelly as lez (yay) and with Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes as university vagabonds that cause minor disturbances. <br /> <br /> The only downside is the caricature of a Laurence Fishburne professor ("Peppermint?"). Surely, many professors are crazy. But they are not so flat. Skinheads are also a bit caricatured, but I guess they are like that in real life too. <br /> <br /> Overall an undervalued film, if you liked the American story of X you'll fall in love with it. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10
