Hi guys, I'm really in this movie! I didn't even know it was on this site until I looked at it a few years ago and I was so surprised! I played Pete, the son of the main characters. It was a great experience and I enjoyed every moment. During filming they needed me to be in two places at once, so they used my twin sister as a double body! The finger pushing the radio button in the car is not mine. I act and I still do some TV, but not so much. Oh, and if you want proof, my name is the first one at the top of the page. <br /> <br /> Review: I thought the movie was ok but if I wasn't there, it wouldn't be one of my favorites. I thought acting was really good, but the plot was just so-so.
