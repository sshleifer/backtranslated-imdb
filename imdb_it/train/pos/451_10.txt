If someone is wondering why no one produces films as they were used to, with a conversation, a character and a simple theme of friendship that struggles to evolve into something new, better and different, those people have to take this movie and see the writing of before quality, directing and acting that blends into a wonderful evening of observation about how things were in Italy and England. Other days, sometimes channeled into a formidable entertainment comedy, made in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson and Michael Kitchens in the lead roles. Under the direction of Mike Newell's paintbrush, these actors perform vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye. Remembering the bedroom theater farce of the beginning of the century, this film could be called a farce friendship that becomes a useful experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character, and also of the spectator. An artistic telegram on the importance of caring for those around us.
