He rented and looked at this brief work (<90 minutes). It is by far the best treatment Modesty has received on the film - and its creator, Peter O'Donnell, agrees, participating as a "Creative Consultant". The character, and we who love him, are treated with respect. Spiegel's direction is the best I've ever done so far, and the casting was done very well. Alexandra Staden is almost physically perfect to match Modesty's original Jim Holdaway illustrations. A magnificent discovery by anyone who has chosen it! Excellent also Raymond Cruz in the role of young Rafael Garcia. I hope Tarantino and co. I'm going to do more in the series - I'm particularly interested in seeing who will choose to be the matchless Willie Garvin!
