I can't believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! He was my favorite guest on the show, hands down. I hate celebrity gossip and generally don't like talk shows, but when Hal Sparks hosted Talk Soup, it was necessary to watch TV for me. I rarely missed an episode during his run and I was saddened when the host's hosts started pouring (although most guests did a great job anyway). <br /> <br /> However, for all people who do not like Hal Sparks, I imagine they have never seen weekend specials. They were an hour-long episodes of Talk Soup that included the best clips of the entire week, and were filled with comic sketches. The original pieces by Hal Sparks were hilarious. In one he was possessed by a bad comic demon, and in an exorcist scene his head was spinning as he told airline food jokes. An episode was dedicated to teasing Multiplicity, as a group of cloned Hal Sparks kept multiplying throughout the episode, passing the study. <br /> <br /> OK, maybe these don't sound so funny when I describe them, but all I know is that, in addition to Talk Soup, the only other two shows I've seen consistently in those years were The Simpsons and Late Night with Conan O'Brian. So if you like the comic styles of those shows, then you'll probably like to talk about soup during the Sparks years. <br /> <br /> That said, even Henson and Tyler were both great hosts. All three hosts brought something different from the table, but in my opinion they were all excellent comedians. Of course, during the years of Tyler and guest stars, my interest in this show began to decline, but every now and then I take The Soup, the show's spiritual successor, and sure enough, the new host can bring some unexpected laughter from time to time. <br /> <br /> OK, I spent enough time talking about a TV show that is no longer on air and on a channel I generally disregard. Go and look at something else!
