This film has some things that are quite surprising. First, it should be based on a true story. This in itself is surprising that more tornadoes would hit the same city at night in autumnal Nebraska. I wonder if the name of the royal city was near "Blainsworth" (which is the name of the city in the film). There's an Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there's also a city that starts with Blains ... something. <br /> <br /> Shows the slowest tornadoes that register at the point where the kids are at home. On the other hand, the scene where TV becomes confused is actually based. Before Doppler radar and weather radio, we were taught that if you turned the TV on a particular channel (not on the cable) and adjusted the brightness in the right way, you could tell if there was a tornado. The problem was that at that point you would be able to hear it. <br /> <br /> Because I know something about Midwestern tornadoes, it made this movie fun for me. I like it better than Twister. I mean, give me a break - there's no way to do it and F5 chaining you to a pipe in a well house.
