For all Has-Beens or Never Was or for the curious, this film is for you .... Have you ever practiced a sport, or wondered how it felt after the lights went out and the crowd if it's gone .. This movie explores that and more. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams (Jack Dundee) is a small banker from the city of Taft CA., whose life was plagued by a mistake in a BIG rival football game 13 years ago when he dropped his pass that would have conquered Bakersfield, their Arch-Rival, which has the great pleasure of beating the Taft Rockets, season after season. Kurt Russell (Reno Hightower) was the quarterback of that famous game, and it's the local legend, which is now a van repair specialist whose life is fading into lethargy, like the city of Taft itself. <br /> <br /> Williams has an idea to reconstruct the story, repeating the game! He runs into a skeptical resistance, then embarks on a terrorist campaign for a man, and literally paints the city, orange, yellow and black, to increase the anger of the residents to recreate the game. After being successful, the players of that 1972 team get together and try to get fit to practice, which is hysterical. The game is active, Bakesfield is loaded with all the high-tech gadgets, game strategies and sophisticated training routines. Taft draws games in the mud, with sticks, stones and bottle caps, what a fight! Taft overcomes the odds, Robin Willians eliminates demons from his guts, Kurt Russell rises from torpor, looks at "The Best of Times" for one of the best viewing experiences ever! <br /> <br /> One of Robin Williams's best performances, the chemistry between Robin and Russell is magical. And who is Kid Lester ??? <br /> <br /> Holly Palance and Pamela Reed give memorable performances like Williams and Russell's wives. It can be done on many levels. A 10!
