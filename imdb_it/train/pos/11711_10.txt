Patty Duke's story about her life and struggles with manic depression were like my life struggles. I saw myself acting like her. I was so amazed by the similarities of our lives to include the sexual abuse that we both suffered as children. <br /> <br /> I saw the film when it was first presented in 1990 and I loved this movie so much. Anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get so much out of this movie. It doesn't matter if he showed his rewards or what they were for. This is not the problem here. The problem is how Ms. Duke had an illness and fought to survive and win. Ms. Duke has a lot to be proud of in her successes with her struggles for the survival of a disease that often leaves many victims hopeless. <br /> <br /> Unless a person has personally struggled with this disease, the hell with which they have to live does not know. The film was a success for me because it showed the real problems and as a depressed and manic person. It was so real ... so, so, real. It was like watching myself on the screen. <br /> <br /> I wish I could thank Ms. Patty Duke personally for having the courage to make her illness known to the public. Bocka
