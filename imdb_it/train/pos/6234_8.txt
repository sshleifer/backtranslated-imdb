This is my favorite movie of all time Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The dialogue between the two is so cute, funny and very intelligent. Not to mention this film contains some of the best songs recorded by the two; as I am putting all my eggs in a basket and facing music and dance. If I remember correctly, this was the film that made me know Fred Astaire, so I suppose that for this it will always remain a special place in my heart (I'm sorry for the sentimental cr * p but I'm a woman, so pass me over) All in all this movie gets an 8/10 from me. The choreography was superb and even the fact that Lucille Ball is there makes it even more fantastic.
