breathtaking, this is undoubtedly the best cartoon ever made. I first saw a castle in the sky in the late 80s as a child and left a lasting impression. it's been years and I forgot the title of the film, and only by chance browsing the internet did I find this masterpiece again. after reading reviews and other people's reviews, I'm not surprised he was so successful and was so touching that he left an impression. a real fantasy adventure, not to be missed for all children and adults. it is better not to give the plot, so I would say that watching this film will be a clear and open mind. if you have children who treat them, I promise you they will love it. there's not much to say about this piece of art, but if you haven't seen it look at it and have fun.
