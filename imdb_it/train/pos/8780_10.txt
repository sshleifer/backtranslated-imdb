This is one of the biggest sports movies ever made by Hollywood. What a wonderful story of one of the great sports figures in American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett particularly interesting is that Mr. Corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues today. In this regard, James J. Corbett was truly innovated. But back to the movie, all the performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. In fact, he looked like Nicole Kidman. And although it is a vintage piece, the story resists the test of time; did not go stale. The portrait of John L. Sullivan by Ward Bond must be one of the great portraits of a sports figure in the history of cinema and the boxing scenes are realistic, well staged and very effective. This coupled with a great script makes this film a must.
