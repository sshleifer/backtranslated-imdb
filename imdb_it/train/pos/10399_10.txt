This was one of my favorites during my childhood - I remember seeing it on television every time. Now that I grew up and have a child of my own, I wanted to introduce him to this classic movie. We looked at it last Friday and liked it. During Abu's fight with the giant spider, my son's hand crept in and grabbed mine - he was genuinely scared. "Are you going to beat the spider, Poppa?" Look, you'll see. It has no historical reference scheme to talk about (eight years), so Baghdad under Haroun al-Raschid's nephew could also be Oz under Ozma. <br /> <br /> I think he was particularly pleased with how much the heroes and the archers were perpetrated by the thief and not by the adult king. In fact, if you deconstruct the narrative of the film a bit, the king is the thief's companion, not the hero - which must be very satisfying for imaginative and adventurous young people. <br /> <br /> It is certainly a period piece - I suspect that when he is eleven or twelve, my son will find it "trivial" or any other word the next generation will use at that point. The love story is barely one-dimensional - as a cynical friend commented, "Why does Ahmad love the princess? Because the narrative requires it". Abu's willingness to put himself in jeopardy (repeatedly) for the king deposed in the dark and in love with love is equally unlikely. But to quibble over such things while accepting the flying mechanical horses, the genes of fifty feet and the Temple of all he saw would be fatuous in the extreme. The satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the peak of the film is tremendous, as is the final shot of Abu flying triumphantly on his stolen magic carpet, looking for "a bit of fun and finally the adventure!"
