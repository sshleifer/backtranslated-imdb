No, they don't because Coburn has a mission of revenge. To kill the peace officer who involved him and in the process killed his woman. <br /> <br /> That peace officer is Charlton Heston who is now retired and knows what Coburn is looking for.

It is not something he is proud of, he was a collateral victim in a manhunt. <br /> <br/> In order for us not to feel sorry for Coburn, it tells us very well what an evil man he really is. Heston is his usual brave hero, but the honors of the actor in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. Shoot all others from the screen when it is on. <br /> <br /> Coburn has the brilliant idea of ​​making sure Heston follows him by kidnapping Hershey and taking her to an Indian reservation where the white authorities can't touch him. He knows that Heston has to make it personal then. <br /> <br /> The Coburn band includes, Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum, who is his son-in-law. <br /> <br /> The Last Hard Men is a brutal and brutal western. Andrew McLaglen directed it and I think it may have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh. It certainly shows much of its influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate violence. Of which there is a lot. <br /> <br /> For a bit of Peckinpaugh lite, The Last Hard Men is your movie.
