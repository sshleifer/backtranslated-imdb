Anton Newcombe makes the film and he is the main subject. Watching him throw a song down if not an entire album quickly showed the guy to be a real talent. He thinks he is god but he is so prolific and interesting. The DWs aren't all that interesting compared to music or anything. "Hey, do you have a driving license?" , Anton tells the cameraman, "Well, let go of this piece!" Excellent use of archive / home video material. It's nice to see the rock documents still made. A nice document on the creative process. If you like it, go see Nirvana Live! Tonight! Sold Out! on DVD. A good Anton experience is this film. 8 out of 10
