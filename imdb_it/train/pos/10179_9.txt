De Grot is a great film. The big plot comes from the novel by Tim Krabbé, who also adapted this story for the screen. Some very high level acting, not only by Van Huêt, but above all by Marcel Hensema, who mostly did the television work before his performance by Axel van de Graaf. The film seems to kick in like a thriller, and creates a great mood. So let's get to know Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story unfolds little by little in a very compelling flash-back structure, which adds to the more romantic look and drama based on the movie's character. In the end all this culminates in an emotional ending, which will draw the audience with their throats. Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you see this movie. A must see, especially if you liked "Spoorloos" (the original adaptation of The Vanishing screen).
