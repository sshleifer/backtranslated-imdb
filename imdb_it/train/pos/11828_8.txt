"Dick Tracy" is a favorite of our family - the actors are fantastic - the art direction is exceptional - the music is magical. It shouldn't be "To Kill A Mockingbird" - it's a fun experience. <br /> <br /> Stephen Sondhemim's songs are stellar: "Back in Business" is energetic, "Sooner or Later" is right, "What Can You Lose" is disturbing - even songs like "Live Alone and Like It "add to the story <br /> <br /> I must love the exaggeratedly exaggerated performances of Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Preso, Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, supporting the bad guys ... The list it's too long. And yes, even Madonna and Warren Beatty are fantastic. Written with a small smile (how many times have we looked at each other and said "Wait a minute - I have a thought - it's gone!"?). <br /> <br /> However, one of the most interesting things about this film is that everyone involved seems to have fun, and this especially increases the fun for the viewer. So, if you haven't already, why not give "Dick Tracy" a chance - accept it for what it is - a Sunday strip that comes to life - and in a wonderful way !!
