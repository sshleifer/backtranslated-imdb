If you have trouble suspending disbelief, this is not for you. Consider: a woman already in the late Middle Ages finds a newborn in a cabbage hole and raises it like his own. Think about it; she makes no attempt to locate her mother, who could be a confused teenager who needs medical care and apparently no one from the Italian equivalent of social services makes any attempt to put the child in "care" (no social service? KNOW is a fantasy). Before you know it, young Toto has a dozen and his adoptive mother dies leaving him at the orphanage from which emerges a HAPPY man who loves everyone. In nothingness, not only did he give his suitcase to the man who stole it but organized the local homeless into Shantytown residents in good faith and for the encore he leads them into a fight against capitalism in the form of business that buys the land on which the Shantytown stands when oil is discovered there. This takes a while to swallow without the subsequent "miracles" that begin with the dead mother of Toto (the old one who raised him rather than the biological one) that appears to him and gives him a dove that also acts as a magic wand that allows him to grant modest desires and end in which the hobos fly away to a better place presumably somewhere beyond the rainbow. <br /> <br /> On the other hand the film is up to here with Fascination and it is easy to surrender to. On balance a small masterpiece.
