Great Woody Allen? No. Good Woody Allen? Definitely. I found myself, together with the present audience, laughing often and often in some of the best Woody Allen lines we have been listening to for a while. Allen's aging has created an appropriate role for himself as Scarlett Johansson's "father" ... well, a little. Some have said that Johansson plays "a young Dianne Keaton". I beg to differ. He plays the dialogue of Woody, who, in his plays, always has a very similar feeling ... like, well, a Woody Allen comedy. Okay for us Woody appreciators. He certainly made Woody's dialogue much better than the young cast of his latest comedy, Melinda / Melinda. Some may find Woody's humor tiring, but for those of us who love it when it's done right, we can't wait for the next one.
