A realistic representation of the young love for the college set, but also attractive for an older viewer like me. It has ups and downs and twists and made me shed a tear or two. We rarely see films with black urban characters that could attract older and not black audiences and show a more real representation of life than black young adults. <br /> <br /> This film takes place on a university campus and in a city where two people meet and fall in love. In the background there are various acquaintances friends and situations that influence them for better or for worse. A typical plot someone might say, but this was really unexpected. <br /> <br /> I found myself rooting for the survival of the couple's relationship, seeing my past in their story. Moments of profound thought and revelation came from the actors' performances. <br /> <br /> It is a luminous film that I would like to support for the young at heart and in love or who have never been in love. Great movie. I will look for a copy to add to my movie collection.
