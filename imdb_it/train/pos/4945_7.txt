It is a difficult film to classify "10 elements or less". In general, I'm not interested in defining genres, but there is something in this film that makes you want to put it in a specific category, in order to convey your feelings about it, even with a single word. I absolutely recommend this movie to anyone and, if you really like the cinema and if you like life, you will want to do the same as soon as you finish watching it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film and call it beautiful and delightful, admitting that it is not perfect but does nothing wrong. I don't want to sound like I'm at odds with myself, but I think writer / director Brad Silberling knew exactly what he was getting into when he finished writing this inspirational script. I'm sure he wanted to make a product that had nothing to do with perfection: a product that would be as simple, captivating and uncompromising as its title. Well, he did it. <br /> <br /> Silberling, director of long, complex and dramatic films such as "City of Angels" and "Moonlight Mile", shows with "10 Items or Less", which closes in just 70 minutes, the passion that he has for his work and also the faith he has in it. Putting an actor (Morgan Freeman) in front of a woman (Paz Vega) in a grocery store and taking them exactly to the places where ordinary life would take them is what Silberling proposes here. <br /> <br /> I can't tell you more because in the apparent simplicity there is a stimulating background that should not be underestimated. Because here everyone is exposed: the camera focuses directly on the two main characters, who share endless conversations in a car ride with stops that are not infinite just because life is life. And let me express how much praise is the way in which Silberling manages the situation by saying that it reaches, in less time (not only in the duration of the film, but in the only day when the film develops its events) and in a smaller place, the kind of connection between two characters that Sofia Coppola generated in "Lost In Translation". <br /> <br /> That movie, set in Tokyo, also met an actor and a woman, and they also have conversations about the times when they were living their lives. It is in conversations in which we perceive the provocative quality of "10 elements or less" and, just like in Coppola's film, the naturalness of each situation is never lost and images with all the music and without words do not seem forced or included in the photos to 'buy time'. <br /> <br /> In this aspect, the collaboration of Silberling and his director of photography Phedon Papamichael. The man who filmed the splendid scenes in "Sideways" and focused on every emotion in "Patch Adams" delights us with visual passages of true natural beauty. <br /> <br /> But the absolute beauty of "10 elements or less" is found in the cast (of Avy Kaufman), in its two protagonists. They are the ones who transmit this feeling that I mentioned at the beginning and I cannot specify; we feel their connection and we can say that they are having fun and could even improvise things. Oscar winner Morgan Freeman, also an executive producer of the film, simply remains there and confirms the status he has today in the world of cinema, and what he deserves: a quiet man, full of wisdom who can easily make you cry while you can make yourself to laugh. And the beautiful Paz Vega (well, I said she was good at "Spanglish"). Here it proves to be a real bargain and Hollywood is not small for her.
