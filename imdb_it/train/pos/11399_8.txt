Ok, so the plot is on unstable ground. Yes, that's fine, so there are some random dance songs and / or sequences inserted (for example: Adam's concert and Henri's theatrical act). And Leslie Caron can't really, um, you know ... acting. <br /> <br /> But somehow, "An American In Paris" manages to overcome this as a refined and first-rate musical ... largely based on Gene's incredible dancing talent and choreography Kelly, and the load of charm that seems to matter in every scene with Caron. (He needs, because he seems to have a ... problem with emulation.) <br /> <br /> The most complete and technically impressive number of this musical is obviously the 16-minute ballet towards the end of the film . It's incredibly filmed and Kelly and Caron dance beautifully. But my favorite number should be the character of Kelly who sings "I Got Rhythm" with a group of French school-age children, to then break into a host of American dances. It simply demonstrates how you don't need special effects when you have real talent *. <br /> <br /> Not at the "classic" levels with "Singin 'In The Rain", but rather at the top, however. Worth watching
