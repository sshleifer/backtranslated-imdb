Well, I was a teenager when I saw the movie ... the songs were a big hit but the elite class skipped the govinda movies and then coz watching govinda and karishma (aka karizma) movies were not the right thing to that 'class' but still a lot of people liked it a lot because the series of these films shook the 90s and most of them were successful ... today i was watching it again after a long time and i remembered that c 'It was a long series of people and the revolt they created when the song or song came on the screen .... the govinda and karishma clothes were complementary to each other (the worst duo of stripped of the time) well karisma in the late 90s transformed but govinda was still very faithful to its designer as its sense of dress remains the same ... but at that time everything was mixed all was good ... everything worked and slowly the elite class realized how much they were divas rtente and therefore ..... did not look back for this jodi while he continued to make Indians the ones who carry on series ... from few but loved by the masses. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good time with nothing to do rent it or watch it on TV I don't think you'll regret it ... but remember it's the worst at its best ... <br /> <br / > I watch those movies when I have time coz I can't stop laughing ... so I say go ahead and have fun because there are times when we all love stupidity and especially when it's done by the kings of their times it's definitely watchable ... advice to all movie lovers ...
