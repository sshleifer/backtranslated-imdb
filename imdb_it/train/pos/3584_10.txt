My name is Heather and I'm the girl this film is based on. I want to thank all of you who saw this film and had fun. As rough and tough as some of the things that have been portrayed in this film, they have not even come close to describing how bad things actually were. not to mention the effect it all had on my mother and my little sister. thanks again for the great comments that everyone has, I really appreciate them <br /> <br /> Hi everyone! <br /> <br /> This is Heather's mom. It is hard to believe that many years have passed since this film was made. Even more difficult to believe that people were still watching it a year ago. For each of you out there who has gone through the same or similar kind of situation, know that there are people here in cyberspace who completely understand how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone of you.
