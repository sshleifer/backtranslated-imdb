Neil Simon has a lot of work, but it's the strange couple that brought him to fame. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthaw have excellent chemistry. The supporting cast for this film is also stellar. <br /> <br /> There are about 2 men living together who come from opposite planets. The script is fraught with humor from this situation. This had been done in some forms previously. This is what brings everything together in a great package. <br /> <br /> Simon did another decent job, but this is really his best work that made the rest of his work possible. It is difficult to imagine that Simon has ever exceeded this limit.
