I really enjoyed this film because it's a true story set in the Amazon, a part of the world that has always intrigued me. I believe a condensed form of the book was published on "Reader's Digest" immediately after the actual event. <br /> <br /> Because I'm a "baby boomer", the character and the actress are my contemporaries, and that's why I'm referring to the film. I also believe the film is valuable for teaching survival skills if the observer observes the character that follows the flows leading to the river and coastal settlements where he can get help, as well as other survival techniques. The most important thing was his willingness to survive and maintain a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope viewers will learn something from this, as well as see it for entertainment. <br /> <br /> I would like the film to be released on VHS and DVD soon because I would like to add it to my video collection. It should also be shown more often on satellite movie channels.
