Someone has learned the difficult task of merging sports with romance. In reality, sport and romance go together like oil and water. So, to put the two together on the screen ... well, it's the equivalent of dividing the atom. I never thought it could be done. I'll be the first to say that in general I don't like romantic comedies ... but I like sports and most sports films. This film was a good mix between the two. Being a baseball fan, I could really appreciate the comic ordeal with Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Falon) being a huge Boston Redsox fan. Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the curse of the Babe who harassed Redsox for 86 years, and they know how crazy a lot of Redsox fans are for baseball. The Farrely brothers did a great job and made it a good comedy. This was a great movie that many might like.
