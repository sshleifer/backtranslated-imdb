You can also read about how I grew up in homes here in Detroit and the criminal activity in which we allowed ourselves. My book, Identity Schemes is available for sale on Amazon dot com or on Identity Schemes dot com. But believe me, it's much better than Paris is burning, because it's a 2005 brand.
