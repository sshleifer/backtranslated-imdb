I'm kidding about the weight loss thing; well, you could lose weight you never know. Anyway, what can I say, I love this movie. He has the same sense of youth and innocence in films like Stand By Me and The Goonies. Jake's Closet illustrates the beauty of the simple things in life and how often we neglect them. The film reminds us of what it means to see the world through the eyes of children and all the magic, mystery and horror they perceive. Jake's Closet presents a uniquely human tale in his compassion that anyone who has had a childhood can relate to and fall in love with both. Watch it with friends; watch it with your loved ones; build a fort - optional wine.
