This is a romantic comedy with an emphasis on comedy for a change. As usual the lovers - Sally Field as the queen of the almost-over-the-hill soap opera, Celeste Talbert; and Kevin Kline as marginally employed and marginally talented actor, Jeffrey Anderson - are working cross-over, seemingly unaware of being madly in love, etc. A bit of Margo Channing in All About Eve (1950) by Bette Davis and a whole lot in the slapstick theatrical tradition, Sally Field goes beyond the summit to hilarity while she malaprops her way to love and happiness. Kevin Kline, one of the most undervalued men in recent years, is also very good and very successful while managing to be handsome, vulnerable, selfish and lovable at the same time. <br /> <br /> The center of the mishaps around Celeste's fear of losing her audience when she entered forty, and reach the crisis point with the arrival of her niece, the aspiring actress Cori Craven (Elisabeth Shue ) that turns out NOT to be his niece, with consequent plot complications. Cori manages to get a small part in the soap opera as a homeless deaf before discovering his true relationship with Celeste (and with Jeffrey Anderson) - but it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> As a romantic counterpoint or lead they are Robert Downey Jr. (director of the soap opera, David Barnes) and Cathy Moriarty (Montana and Nurse Nan). David Barnes is so hot for her, but he only cares one thing: getting rid of Celeste so he can shine more intensely on the set. To this end it forces Barnes to do all sorts of things to destroy Celeste's career, but through randomness and / or perverse logic, all his attempts go wrong, much to the joy of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Whoopie Goldberg plays Rose Schwartz, the main writer of the show and the alter ego and confidant of Celeste while Carrie Fisher has a modest part as a hard-on-chi producer of the show. <br /> <br /> I thought it was more fun than just another parody of the soap opera world that I saw (Young Doctors in Love 1982 which burglarized the general TV hospital and was pretty good). Soapdish is more fun with a daffy script and a lot of loud laughter and amazing performances by Field, Kline and Downy, Jr. But watch this for Sally Field who is awesome.
