I loved this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely wonderful. Play the role of the modern wizard to the end. (And it's absolutely adorable). 2) The film helped me inspire a role-playing game that I really enjoy, Mage: The Awakening. I've shown it in various LARP afterparts, and it's always a big hit. <br /> <br /> D & D love and Jeff-squeeing aside, it's not exactly a masterpiece, but it's well done and very enjoyable. The plot is fast moving and engaging in its simplicity, the special effects are good enough for such a low budget, and the script, while nothing stellar, was not overly done, and cheese in all the right places. A good way to spend an evening.
