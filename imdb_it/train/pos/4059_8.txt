The first of Ghibli's official films, Laputa is very similar to his predecessor Nausicaa, but while Nausicaa was a science fiction epic, this is more of an action comedy adventure with a rather weak SF premise. <br /> <br /> the first half hour of the movie I thought I would like it. Once again you will find yourself with admiration for Miyazaki's attention to detail and his ability to evoke an imaginary world in a meticulous, beautiful perfection. The animation, although not yet in the series of Ghibli's later films, is a little better than that of Nausicaa. <br /> <br /> I mentioned in my review of Nausicaa that a character is drawn in an anime more "Lupinesque" style. Here there are a lot: pirates. They provide the comic element in the film, although it is not certain that it needs a comic element. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it would have been better. Yet. Dola, the pirate leader, is undoubtedly the most memorable character in the film (although he is basically a female of Long John Silver. Don't be surprised if you are sometimes reminded of "Planet of the Treasure") and is well voiced by Cloris Leachman in American dubbing. <br /> <br /> The English vocal cast lends itself very well, actually. However something started to get pear-shaped for me on this film of about half. I think the best way to describe it is that the characters are swallowed up by the vast scope of the story. I'll come back later. <br /> <br /> There is so much to admire about Laputa, and so many people obviously love it, which I almost feel sorry for having given it only 8 out of 10, but for the keyword here is "admiring". It was more impressive than the personal accident, and in more than two hours he started to drag. <br /> <br /> The key thing for me was this: I really found out that I didn't care much about any of the characters. Disney would take care of developing the characters, making you really fall in love with them, rather than leaving them as relatively two-dimensional pieces to move, while watching the amazing views of the film. Even that would have been tolerable if there was a bit of SF in the story to fix it, but it was basically a lot of sprites on Princesses and magic crystals. That's where Laputa falls as far as I'm concerned, and that's what keeps him from a potential 10 out of 10 films. Having said that, it must be admitted that Miyazaki was leagues before Disney in general in 1986, when they consider that their film of the the same year he was the terrible "Great Detective of mice". <br /> <br /> Laputa is a good movie in some ways a fantastic movie, and you should definitely watch it, but I think it's overrated. I definitely prefer the previous "Nausicaa della Valle del Vento". <br /> <br /> BTW, if you can see them in chronological order, look at Nausicaa's fox squirrel, which opens briefly in Laputa.
