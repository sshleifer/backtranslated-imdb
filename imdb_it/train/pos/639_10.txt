This is a good family show with a cast of actors. It's a nice break from the reality show recently. There is nothing else on the television today, unless you consider Joan of Arcadia similar because he also has a main character. However, Clubhouse is worth a visit because Jeremy Sumpter gives the main character (Pete Young) a kind of sympathy and ingenuity that is attractive without being too sweet and tender. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms complete the rest of the main cast members, and everyone is exceptional in their role. I really like Kirsten Storms as Pete's sister, Betsy; she's a real pill, but she still cares about her mother and brother, even if she hates to show it. It may take a few episodes to really find the legs, but Clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to do in a long time, so check out the people - you'll be glad you did!
