First of all, I liked this movie. It was well played by everyone. <br /> <br /> However, I don't understand the comments I've heard from people about a surprise ending. I knew nothing about this movie in circulation except for some "must see" recommendations, but I knew where the plot went in less than ten minutes. (I won't say what made me understand so as not to ruin a good film for others.) However, despite it seemed obvious, I kept watching it. It was great to see how everything went, filling the character's details and motivations in the following scenes. <br /> <br /> I don't hate it when I guess the ending at the beginning of a movie. I only hate it when the road to resolution is full of boring scenarios. <br /> <br /> The character of Will Smith is nice, even when he plays such a restless character. He is energetic and credible in everything I saw him do. Seven Pounds is another good show. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson is a solid artist, who portrays a bizarre, rather optimistic character despite terminal heart conditions. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and with Rosario, if you don't find it splendid, you should think about replacing the eyes. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Woody Harrelson on the screen. I haven't seen it much lately, but it could just be me. Woody didn't have a huge amount of time on the screen, but he sold his cheerful pianist and blind character for everything he was worth. Excellent. <br /> <br /> A little research on box jellyfish tells me that his poison is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pets and the plot. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to recommend this film not for the plot, but for some excellent performances, and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions we generally try to avoid.
