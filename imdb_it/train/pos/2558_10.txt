I married a Japanese woman 14 years ago. We are still together. <br /> <br /> However in the 1950s it would never have been so easy. <br /> <br /> Army life had been drawn for action, drama and comedy for years from this point. Extracted to death. Mixed reports gave new ground to cover. This is an old hat today, but then ...? Marrying an Asian meant that you either owed someone or that you were a monster of some kind. This touched both possibilities together with the third. Maybe it's love? <br /> <br /> Brando did his usual good job. Garner did a better job than he usually does. He's fine, but this has shown how good he can be. Umecki-chan had a hellish debut here and while I think he earned his statue, he didn't really stretch. It was a role that no one who was not abroad would have recognized and the novelty was the cork. <br /> <br /> The real thief of scenes was Red Buttons. Red was the best thing about this movie. Bank on it. And even Japanese lifestyles have been shown in an admirable light. <br /> <br /> A classic.
