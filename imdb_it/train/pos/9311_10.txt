This was the worst movie I've ever seen, yet it was also the best film. The original Sci Fi movies should be bad, that's what makes them fun! The phrase "I like my dinosaur meat well done!" it's probably the best quote ever! Furthermore, the plot seems something of a vase-induced dream. Now I can imagine it, the writers wake up after a long night in which we get up and play the dance revolution, so ideas are put together for this: space marines arrive on the alien planet, which is infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses , to protect a scientific team that studies the planet. The best idea ever! In fact, in complete form the checklist of the original Sci Fi movie: dinosaur guns medieval times terrible space travel acting <br /> <br /> So go see this movie but don't buy it.
