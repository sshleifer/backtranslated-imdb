I saw him at the Hautefeuille MK2 Cinema only one night after his first public screening in Paris. A very nice film about three 15-year-old kids, all almost at the same stages psychologically. Many scenes allow us to return to our adolescent age and to our first feelings about sexual relations. it is possible to imagine that the director wants to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of the girls to lesbianism, but even in that case it does not corrupt the probability of the story. Sometimes you can find the film a bit slow but that's what creates this intimate atmosphere. Financing of talented young actresses, special mention with Floriane and Marie, very convincing. There are many small details but this film also allowed me to find out what synchronized swimming is: awesome!
