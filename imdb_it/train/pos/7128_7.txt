This is undoubtedly the best performance by John Thaw in which he manages to shake off any part of his Inspector Morse character and brings a perfect adaptation of Tom from the pages of the book to the television screen. This is a well made production that maintains its atmosphere of family vision despite some very mature themes like the outbreak of the Second World War and the physical abuse suffered by the child. <br /> <br /> However, it is the relationship between Tom and young Willie that is the heart and soul of this story. It is beautiful and moving to see this bond between the boy evacuated from London and the grumpy old man with whom he came out with development - a true connection between grandfather / grandchild. <br /> <br /> Too bad that this story has not been made with a bigger budget with a more established director as it belongs to the big screen, it is not shown once or twice every ten years on a Sunday afternoon. Given the right guidance, John Thaw would be celebrated worldwide and awarded many awards for his brilliant performance in this film. A great actor and a great role that should have been honored more than it was at that time.
