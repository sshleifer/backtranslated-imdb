I found 'Still Crazy' to be wonderfully fun, and not just for those of us who lived in that raucous era of the late 1960s, in the early 1970s. My 15 year old daughter looks at me every time I drag the DVD out (don't worry, it's only been three times) and she loves it too. <br /> <br /> It is a true love, moving and exhilarating, at the time, and every actor hits his notes with perfection. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I'm glad that his turn in some ways like "Love Actually" brought him more attention. Bruce Robinson was incredible as Brian, bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the stereotype of the drug-damaged rocker. It was interesting to see that Robinson made a name for himself as a writer. <br /> <br /> I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie, I ran into Billy Connolly local mall (he lived here at the time) and told him he was one of the my five favorite movies of all time. He invited me to sit at the food court with him and we discussed the film for some time. We even talked about the idea of ​​a remake oriented towards America before denying it wisely. Why joke with the original? <br /> <br /> My only problem with "Still Crazy" is that it wasn't very popular in theaters and too many people have lost a wonderful experience.
