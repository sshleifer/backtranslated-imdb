I loved the movie, but as everyone said, there were some bits that were not quite developed. I personally thought that the girls were very vapid before ending up in prison; of course, they must have been innocent American girls, but still ... I felt that the bond that the best friends should have was missing. For example, in the montage where you see the view, the way they held each other for photography was very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> So, there are some parts that were very ambiguous. I think it's pretty clear that the character of Danes didn't do it, but I can see how this can be confusing. Also, why did the camera focus on Manat with a very grim expression after putting the bags in the trunk of their taxi? I thought he was suggesting something, but it turned out to be nothing. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the film was great. I cried when Claire Danes took the blame; she is a GREAT actress. <br /> <br /> Besides, I wanted to see that sick Thai prisoner get his ass kicked. Talk about lack of closure ...
