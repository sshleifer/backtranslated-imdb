And yet another South Park race comes to an end. It wasn't an episode as strong as I had hoped, but Night of the Living Homeless was a stronger strength than Stanley's Cup, Tsst, Bloody Mary or Erection Day. It still can't stand comparison with Woodland Critter Christmas and Goobacks but few episodes can. <br /> <br /> Night of the Living Homeless is a parody of the zombie genre, done in a way that only South Park would have thought of. Instead of eating zombie meat, entities are homeless requiring change and seem to survive outside of it. <br /> <br /> Randy and the other residents are locked up in the community center, even if this time on the roof, where they can probe the scene. A particularly amusing moment is when a member discovers that his house has disappeared, and becomes homeless, leaving Randy with no choice but to shoot him. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the four boys set out to solve the problem, with the whole story behind the acquisition of homeless people trying to convey a message, but to be seriously uninspired. South Park is at its best a lot of times when it's ridiculous. Matt and Trey were safe this week, and they didn't criticize the homeless problem, they just blasted him. <br /> <br /> The shock moment of the episode comes when a scientist shoots himself in an attempt to avoid the homeless. This is the first time a suicide in South Park goes wrong, and we look at the poor man who lacks his brain and then tries to shoot himself many times while dying painfully. Another moment inspired by South Park. <br /> <br /> Overall, the episode was fun, but it was kept away from being fantastic by holding back any real comment about the homeless and sticking directly to the zombie shtosh. The finish is pretty funny, but nothing new. <br /> <br /> Now we have to wait until October for the next series of episodes. It's a long journey, but South Park must be applauded for its run. The show seemed to have run out last season, but is now back in full form.
