"Prodigal Son" and "Eastern Condors" are my favorite films of Sammo Hung. The Fat Dragon is more fat in this release than "Condor", but is no less sure as a director or actor. It is, in fact, at the top of its shape and offers a devastating and brutal action that boasts half a dozen incredible sequences and also manages to tell a compassionate and sweet love story. Love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but serve as curious additions to the action, and ensure that viewers do not hit the fast-forward button between physical confrontations. <br /> <br /> The opening scene, which features a fun duel with a light saber, sets a solid but deceptive tone. A sequence in which Sammo's pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and softened with a sharp and comic tone. The fast and furious struggle between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a model of a dazzling choreography and a keen and superb direction, and easily one of the best of its kind. The violence of the film intensifies slowly until, finally, when the clout comes, we suffer some of the most brutal altercies ever seen in a Sammo production. The assault of director / actor to Billy Chow and a house full of angry and threatening enemies is a bone-breaking, physically punitive delight. <br /> <br /> Terrifying on every level and one of the best martial arts films ever made. <br /> <br /> Great score too.
