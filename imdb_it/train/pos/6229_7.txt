One of the many musicals on licensed sailors, is the usual sailor who meets the girl, complications arise, happily solves the plot. It proceeds smoothly but it also drags on in some places. Dialogue is not as fast as "Top Hat" for example and Randolph Scott seems out of place. <br /> <br /> There are rewards. He has some of Irving Berlin's best songs, including "Let Yourself Go", "I'm putting my whole egg in a basket" and "Let's do music and dance". He has Fred and Ginger that when they dance they wear any movie in heavenly peaks and they don't disappoint here. They make a snappy tap dance, a surprise comic dance and a graceful dance, all in the same movie! Great versatility and artistic ability. <br /> <br /> He also has Harriet Hilliard, who is quite good at his role. He has had a varied career, becoming the most famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzie. Here he is touching without being sentimental. His two songs are simply and effectively delivered. It makes a good contrast to Ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the movie. <br /> <br /> A further tightening made the film even better. Pretty good though.
