I was completely involved in this and couldn't wait for every episode. Acting has brought to life how emotional a missing person in the family must be, along with the effects it would have on those closest to them. The only problem we had in the family was how in the end it was all "explained" at the end. Couldn't we hear clearly what was said and have no idea what Gary was in the whole thing? Why did Kyle call him and why did he go with him? Having invested in a series for five hours, we felt cheated that only five minutes were held up for the conclusion. I asked around and none of my friends that saw him would be wiser. Very strange but maybe we missed something crucial ????
