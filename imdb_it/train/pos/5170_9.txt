I rented this movie when it came out on video tape and I loved it. I had the opportunity to buy it on DVD a few weeks ago and I've seen it several times since. I should agree with the others when they said that Indian Summer was a nostalgic film. When I look at him I wish I could be 10-14 again. I think that's why we all love the film to a certain extent. Sometimes we want to be able to relive our lives as children with the wisdom / knowledge of adults. Wouldn't it be nice to have all your friends / parents again? To avoid having to worry about your work, being a parent etc ... ??? I know I'd like to jump into a De Lorean and go back in time. While I enjoyed the film very much, my favorite movie of all is Polpette with Bill Murray. I wish they could do an Indian summer version of this.
