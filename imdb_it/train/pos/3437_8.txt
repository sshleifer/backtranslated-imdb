Some genre films must be masked. This was an exception. Taken for its merit, it is a dressed version of the horror genre film. With minimal special effects, she manages to be a psychological study of sorts, with a simple but existential theme - who gets hit by the bus, and why she? It is not a great film, yet, since there is little invented, the plot works. Subtle, and everything related to character interactions. In reality, there is a ploy in the opening scenes, but it may have been put there simply to set the tone for what's to come. I greatly appreciate the balance between male and female energy and I would not recommend this story to anyone interested in anything more than to people who react to a physical and psychological challenge. You will enjoy the movie if you have empathy, appreciate the need for a little adventure in your life and ask yourself "What would I do in this situation?"
