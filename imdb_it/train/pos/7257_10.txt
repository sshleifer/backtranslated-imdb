The reason I say this is because I wrote the script and knew very little about what was done until I was asked to watch the film. I wrote it for some producers who sold it without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was my friend, I heard about it. I had only written a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard he was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, if he could like me to do another draft. I also asked if I could see my original script because I had lost it. I was told, too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and I took away my name. I had no idea what they could do to my script. Then I was invited to see the finished film. I was so impressed that I quickly asked to get my name back. It is a beautifully done piece, from a first draft written in haste, I expected him to be asked to do much more work on it; maybe if I had it it wouldn't be so good. Would I like to see my original script again if anyone knows where it is? I would also like to see the film again, I only saw it once in a small observation theater in Soho.
