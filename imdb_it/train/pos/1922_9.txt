Let me tell you before that this show was of a high standard when John Ritter was there. At his death, the show dropped a bit, but the producers did not give up on the show, adding James Garner and David Spade to the regular cast from 2003 to 2005. <br /> <br /> The exhibition centers around the family Hennessy, Paul (John Ritter, may rest in peace), his wife Cate (Katey Sagal), their daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson) and their son, Rory (Martin Spanjers). When Ritter was on the show, I screamed out loud (and proud to admit it, I am), but now that he's gone, I'm going to reduce myself a little with an occasional laugh. I am very happy that I fell in love with the trance of this show after Ritter's untimely death, because he made the ep with Ritter much better. <br /> <br /> The character of Ritter is so well acted and well rounded that you can Help but love him. He's always checking out the girls, but he really wants them to be happy. He's the last dad who hates boyfriend entertainment. <br /> <br /> Even Katey Sagal is fantastic and she too is a nice character. After Ritter's death, his character has such influence and strength not only for his children, but I believe Sagal has shaped the lives of Cuoco, Davidson and Spanjers, because she and Ritter have been friends for a long time. <br /> <br /> The funniest person on the show should be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco. She is the last blonde: splendid, slow, dull, yet she is an intelligent person. He's out of the wall, funny with his innocent "blond" humor and his presumption. <br /> <br /> Amy Davidson can be as irritating as Kerry, but that's the purpose of her character. The only flaw in the show is that the show never really gives Kerry anything to be happy about. He's always looking for Bridget, and his character feels like he's just thrown in there. <br /> <br /> Martin Spanjers as the solitary son of Hennessy is hysterical, and when Ritter is on the show, he is mostly comic material. On Ritter's death, the show provides some narrative lines for Rory. David Spade and James Garner are nothing but laughter, with the occasional story of C.J., the character of Spade. Garner plays Cate's father, like some basic information. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this show a great review because it's a great show that has had a tragic event that has paralyzed it. You will like it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 - spy
