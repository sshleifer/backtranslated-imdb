Timeless musical jewel, with Gene Kelly in top form, elegant direction by Vincente Minnelli, and wonderful musical numbers. It's a great show from beginning to end, one of those films that people look at with a smile and says "they don't make them like before!" But they never did that right. The 25-minute musical sequence without dialogue is among the most beautiful in the history of cinema. Magical film, clearly derived from the heart and soul of all those involved. A must see!
