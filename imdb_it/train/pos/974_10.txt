One of Miike Takashi's best is the director. It is so beautiful that it is difficult to put into words. At almost fifteen years older than the target audience, I was thrilled from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Remember similar films for children of the 80s in the sense that (unlike today) those films were not afraid of scaring - there is a lot of unpleasant details that I initially found out of tune, but soon I realized that it is nothing different from what I grew up with. The film is a collection of conventions on children's films from the 1980s. You call it, it's there: a young hero driven by his unhappy / dysfunctional world in another, inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins; a quest to save both worlds from an evil force; a beautiful heroine who has a crush on; a sadistic woman (Go-Go Yubari by Kill Bill Vol. 1); a bad lead who draws his evil power from something everyone can refer to in the world. But all these gender conventions are given a new twist and greater depth. <br /> <br /> Start one of the IMDb reviews "Where was this movie when I was a kid?" and it is a feeling that I agree wholeheartedly. Even as I watched him, I complained that I hadn't grown up; which was not part of my childhood as Labyrinth, Masters Of The Universe and, to a much lesser extent, The Neverending Story. Those films, and others like The Goonies, are remembered but never copied - Miike relentlessly offers us a new version of things. <br /> <br /> Poor CGI is a product base of many of his films, sometimes due to budget constraints but only as often an artistic choice - the desire to present things in a bizarre way. Here the CGI is mostly in the media, solely due to budget constraints, but nevertheless does a great job in creating a show. The CG effects combine with traditional puppets, animatronics and truly extraordinary tricks to create a world full of rich characters (and characterizations) that often borders on the visionary. <br /> <br /> This ranking is one of the greatest films ever made. Not for younger or more sensitive children. <br /> <br /> Simply fantastic. Watch it for yourself and if you think your kids can handle it / appreciate it, then show it to them. Let them grow in the Great Yokai War as a small reward for the fact that you can't.
