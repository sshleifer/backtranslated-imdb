Writing something genuine and true is a challenge. Knowing how to shoot it and put it together without making it trivial is even better. Ishai Setton's film is one of those where you can recognize life in all its simplicity and beauty. I was touched by "The big bad Swim" and from now on I will promote it as far as possible. It's just a pity that it can't have something to show to my friends (you know, for example a DVD ???), because talking is nice ... but giving something to see is better. Everyone can't go to the festivals to discover pearls of the genre and this film is really worth being put out there! A big THANK YOU to the staff of this masterpiece, and I wait for it to be distributed.
