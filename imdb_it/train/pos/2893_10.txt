Walt Disney's CINDERELLA takes a story that everyone knows and embellishes with humor and suspense, while retaining the essential charm of the fairy tale. Disney artists provide the film with a captivating fairytale look that exudes a delightful fairytale atmosphere. It is magnificently, if conventionally, animated; the highlight is the captivating scene in which the Fairy Godmother transforms a pumpkin into a majestic coach and Cinderella's rags in a splendid dress. Mack David, Al Hoffman and Jerry Livingston offer delicious songs like "A dream is a desire, your heart makes" and "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" that improve both the scenery and the characters. <br /> <br /> Although the story of CINDERELLA is predictable, it provides such an electrifying melodrama that you share the worries and anxieties of the titular heroine and her animal friends. Both the wicked stepmother and her terrible cat Lucifer present a formidable threat that threatens the dreams and aspirations of Cinderella and mice. It is this threat that gives history a strong conflict that holds the interest of the spectators. The suspense of the film, however, is well balanced by a serene sweetness, especially in the musical numbers. It is in these segments that the attractive personalities of Cinderella and her friends are revealed, moving the spectators to take care of them. Overall, Walt Disney's CINDERELLA is a wonderful family entertainment that has held up very well for half a century.
