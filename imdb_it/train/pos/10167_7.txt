I was not at all a fan of seeing this movie, but when my boyfriend called me and said he had a free advanced screening pass that I tagged just for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at gelson biggs antics. <br /> <br /> overall it was actually better than I expected, but not by much. this was like a hybrid on how to lose a boy in 10 days and just like heaven. a typical romantic comedy with its moments, I think. the film was quite short (about 85 minutes), but it was enough to tell the whole story, build some character development and have a decent happy ending. the whole idea of ​​a ghost pursuing her ex-husband was an interesting plot to follow. eva did a good job keeping sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast (especially jason biggs) kept the laughter at a regular pace. <br /> <br /> overall I liked the movie only because I had a good dose of laughter to let me go otherwise I would have given this movie a lower rating. hey is a girl movie and i'm reviewing this movie from a perceptive guy, okay, it would be a fairer fight if the women reviewed this movie and gave us thoughts about it.
