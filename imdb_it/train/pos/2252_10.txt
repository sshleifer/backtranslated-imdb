Henry Hathaway was bold as well as enthusiastic about his love for the people of early American history. However, to criticize the historical inaccuracies of his film on Brigham Young and the Mormon people they are not necessary or useful in commenting on this film. In my opinion, Hathaway has made a superb direction that conveys what a Mormon people was in the early history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the time period that begins with the martyrdom of Joseph Smith until the release date . In filming and often delicate dialogues, he covered Mormon philosophies and teachings in many segments and scenes. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this movie many Saturday mornings during my youth in the early 1950s. It had been a little over 10 years since the films were released and before the Los Angeles temple was completed, something I saw more curiosity about who the Mormons were built and instilled. I recently purchased this film and will appreciate the following messages that Hathaway played in his film. <br /> <br /> 1. Love for all people, regardless of their personal convictions, 2. Charity towards the needy or not, 3. The family has a high importance, 4. Listen with respect and attention, because even the opposite messages have important points to consider and adopt, 5. Work hard, both individually and in community, 6. Prepare and preserve for future days of need, 7. Hope is a binding bond with a higher being and for the our daily lives, 8. And that there is a unique quality for each group, and appreciate those that are identified as benefits.
