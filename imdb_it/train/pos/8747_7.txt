* Possible spoilers * Even if done first (and best) in 'Midnight Express' and 'Return To Paradise', Brokedown Palace continues to beat me. <br /> <br /> Here we have the story of two young girls who travel through Thailand and are arrested on drug trafficking charges. Was it Alice of Clare Danes? Was it Darlene of Kate Beckinsale? Was it the beautiful stranger they met on their journey? None of this is important, because this is a story of friendship and trust and the limits to which they can be strained. Throw Bill Pullman as an unenthusiastic lawyer and Jacqueline Kim as his Thai bride (and best lawyer of him) and we have a beautiful story that draws the attention of the public. <br /> <br /> The Brokedown Palace is nothing extraordinary, or infamous for any reason - it is not an original concept, it does not show a sensationalist violence that leads to the crowd of aspiring avant-gardists who talk about "gritty realism" or "Hard truths" - it's simply a good story with some nice performances. Bill Pullman is the weakest with his lazy momentum and his heavy talk - I was pretty bored with the character. <br /> <br /> Kate Beckinsale, although decent, is nothing spectacular. It performs well, but it's not exactly a memorable performance. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Kim, however, is in great shape, creating a nice and defined character in which, really, there isn't much to work with. <Br /> <br /> But make no mistake: this is the film by Clare Danes. I have long been a fan of his work, and this has not changed. She fascinates in every scene that appears, and if it weren't for her, the film would probably fall into a boring fare. I particularly appreciate his performance in the scene between her and Darlene's father. <br /> <br /> The film also has a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
