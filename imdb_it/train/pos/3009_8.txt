Another example is the moment when the photographers comment on the girls' legs at the beginning of the film and she comments that "I am not the trophies" gives the film a more gentle appearance, on the floor, because these were the spectators that Warners was taking aim in the great depression. (ironically, Columbia and Universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 1950s when their involvement in television changed their fortunes - they would have produced something similar cheaply and without the polish and the great talent) Curtiz has created by an excellent movie script that moves at a rapid pace keeping the viewer with great shooting angles and quick editing. <br /> <br /> Thank goodness, there is no interest in the secondary plot of loving love, so the fun can keep flowing.
