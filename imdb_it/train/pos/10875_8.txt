The first mainstream slasher film in Australia hits the screen with a bang. And a stab. And a slice. And a scream or two. And a lot of blood, fright, herring and lots of laughs. <br /> <br /> In fact, there's a lot of things surrounding Cut - it's Dave Warner's first script to be produced, even if it has several other options or in negotiation; is the first major film by the director and former Hoodoo Guru Kimble Rendall; and it is also the first film by producer Martin Fabinyi. And for a group of guys who dip their toes in this genre for the first time, surely they know their stuff. <br /> <br /> Cut tells the story of a group of Australian film students who hear about a slasher film, Hot Blooded, which was never completed because its director, Hilary (Kylie Minogue), was killed by the actor who plays the psychopath in the film. <br /> <br /> Despite their lecturer (who was assistant director on the night Hilary died) warning them that whenever someone tries to start production of Hot Blooded someone dies, director Raffy (Jessica Napier ) and producer Hester (Sarah Kants) decide to go ahead and complete the film. They put together a crew and managed to bring the original star, Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwald), back to Australia - in fact, to the original position - to complete Hot Blooded ?? 14 years after shooting. <br /> <br /> Obviously, being a slasher film, it follows a lot of bleeding ?? long with lots of laughter, some beautiful scary and an Australian rocking soundtrack. Cut shows that Australia can make a good mass horror film as much as Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It is a finely crafted feature, with excellent special effects, a tight storyline and a killer - Scarman - this is a welcome to the ranks of Michael, Jason and Freddy.
