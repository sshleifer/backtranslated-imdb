This was surprisingly smart for a TV movie, and quite faithful to my experience of bulimia. It was actually well researched, and I can only assume that it was written by someone who had a similar experience, because he had all the little details. The characters were well designed and the performances of Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman were great. I think the thing I like best about them is that they make them specific and intelligent, and there was no way to downplay the reasons for Beth's bulimia (she wasn't a bit of an out-of-control diet, caused by the pressures on girls from media, pressures that in reality we do not intend to address ... "). His mother was not completely in the dark - too often on television they take a problem that EVERYONE has a certain awareness of and they try to tell us that their protagonists are the last people on earth who don't ("Diabetes? Oh my world it's all wrong, doctor, please explain everything as if I were a small child ", etc.). It was brilliant that her mother was a psychologist and she also didn't see the signs. And the scenes in which Beth was throwing up were NOT VERY melodramatic and sensationalist, and they focused more on the bulimics' need for secrecy and their out of control. The scene where Beth tells her mother that she is bulimic would have made me cry if there were no other people in the room. <br /> <br /> Ok, so I liked those pieces. What didn't work out so well for me was the finale, which returned to the territory of the TV movies we know and don't particularly like, but I think they should end it. "You too can cure your child's eating disorder, if you have a lot of money and live in America ..." And I can only repeat that I really like Mare Winningham. She is big.
