It is difficult to find a real historical drama based on the life of any number of British monarchs. Take a respectable British or Australian actor, make things look good and you are guaranteed a formula for the success of the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Young Victoria is no exception, achieving practically everything, striking and beautiful cinematography, with soft lighting and lush colors and fabrics. Starring Emily Blunt in a role she can finally fly, the film begins with Victoria's 18th birthday and goes through the intrigue and issues surrounding her accession to the throne and her famous marriage to Prince Albert ( friend Rupert). As the young Victoria complains, she moved like a chess pawn from a series of parties when she finds her way to stay and her voice as one of Britain's most influential rulers. <br /> <br /> While this moves around the chessboard quite typical territory, it is the development of the relationship between Victoria and Albert that makes the film slightly more interesting. I confess: I have a degree in history with specialization in the Victorian era, so I am a little attached to these figures. Despite their many faults as rulers, Victoria and Albert were some of the first leaders dedicated to improving civilization for their people. They left their legacy in the arts, public health and education, and in the conservative views and culture of Victoria's mourning after Albert's death. But these things are only briefly mentioned during the film. <br /> <br /> It is quite clear that Victoria and Albert were not only madly in love, but they had a level of mutual respect that was not usually seen among monarchs in arranged marriages. Although it occurred behind the scenes, theirs was certainly one of the best known. Blunt and e Friend have the right kind of chemistry to make the famous justice couple, the right mix of moderation and despair. It's a different love, usually not shown on the screen, especially in this type of film. It is encouraging to finally see a relationship where men and women are on the same level of play. <br /> <br /> But we don't see that love enough. While filmmakers try to adapt to the political traps, they do not develop the kind of impulse needed to maintain tension. Moreover, without going deeper into the important public work more advanced than the couple, things are felt a little in limbo, superficial rather than intimate and sometimes confused. It's not such a big problem during the movie, but later the effects fade away rather quickly and you find yourself trying to remember what you just saw, despite the protagonists' perfect performances, the most obviously Blunt that captures even the famous monarch . <br /> <br /> As much as you look for, Victoria succeeds on many levels but lacks a certain sparkle that would take him from the solid to the classic.
