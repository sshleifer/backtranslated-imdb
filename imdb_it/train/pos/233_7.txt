Actually I found this movie 'interesting'; finally one is worth my time to watch and rent. It's true ... some scenes were exaggeratedly exciting, screaming, etc., but which movie doesn't underline its program, genre or "ax to grind"? Almost no one! What surprised me is that I read a review elsewhere made by a reviewer of S.Fran on another review site, but I found his negative review instead a more accurate description of his "own" review of the film; not film at all. Anyone watching this movie will realize that it is nice to recommend to relatives and friends; no car chases, yes !! Being myself "in" an Italian family, I can relate fully to the environment portrayed on the screen. The film also has its tear-jerking parts. It is what real life can be in such an environment. Nice film.
