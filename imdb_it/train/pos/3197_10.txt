If you are a fan of Crispin Glover, you have to see it. If you are a fan of Sean Penn, you have to see it. If you are a fan of cinema in general, you have to see it. If you have no idea who Crispin Glover is and you have no idea who Sean Penn is, this film will probably still have a lot of value, but the more work you've seen previously from Crispin or Sean, the better. <Br /> <br /> This movie is so funny, but it's also pure genius. There is nothing I know that looks like this movie. It is one of its kind. I doubt that something like this will ever be done again. I can't say anything more about why exactly without partially ruining it, and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job of doing so. <br /> <br /> In response to all the reviewers who gave a negative review, I ask to review the film. In reality, there is no point at which this film can be called quite "boring". This is perhaps the funniest, funniest and least boring movie ever made. And it only improves with age and repeated views. A timeless classic that, unfortunately, very few will be able to claim to have seen. <br /> <br /> Beaver Trilogy is the brilliant work of director Trent Harris, also responsible for the extraordinary Rubin and Ed, who also Crispin Glover stars in. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, copies of this film are rare and hard to find. I managed to find a VHS version after some diligent research, and there are a couple of ways to find it that I know. But I really wish someone would put it on a DVD.
