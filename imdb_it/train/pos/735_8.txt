Wonderful cult film of 1979 in which the students of Vince Lombardi High School confront each other with a new dictatorial principal named Miss Togar (Mary Woronov). Togar is a music hater and blames students' musical tastes for their transgressions. Leading the charge against her is the funny Riff Randell (PJ Soles), the Ramones fan n.1 who, more than anything else, wants the rock band to record its songs. <br /> <br /> Now * this * is an impossible film to resist. First of all, the soundtrack is incredible, with songs by artists such as Alice Cooper and the Velvet Underground plus the infectious non-stop assortment of Ramones songs. "Teenage Lobotomy", "Sheena is a Punk Rocker" and "Blitzkrieg Bop" are just some of them. Subsequently, the cast really gives everything, with Sues an ideal choice for the role of Riff; she is a real treat. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are as serious as Tom and Kate, Woronov is well chosen for the contemptuous and contemptuous Togar type, Clint Howard has one of his best parts ever as Eaglebauer, bath entrepreneur and New World goons like Dick Miller, Paul Bartel (particularly funny as a music teacher Mr. McGree) and The Real Don Steele are fun as always. And, of course, it's a pleasure to see the Ramones play alone. <br /> <br /> The film has a true spirit. The energy level is high, with the author and co-story director Allan Arkush who brought a lot of talent into the process. There is also a great sense of humor. The gag paper airplane is a superb example of this. This extends to the "erasable" style of scene transitions. There are even hilarious giant mice created by special effects of the future, Rob Bottin, in one of his first concerts. <br /> <br /> A film as good as a film that defends authority, which defends itself from the right apart can get. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is simply a wonderful cult film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
