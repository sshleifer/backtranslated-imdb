I saw the trailer for this movie in the 70s when I was just 16 while watching another movie. Oh!!!! how excited I am and my best friend. we couldn't wait for the month or so until it arrived. I saw this movie 17 times that year at the theater. I love, I love, I love it. Kris is so perfect for the film. It's cheeky and a little scruffy, but also shy and uncertain with Babs and it's so captivating to watch it again. When they sing evergreen in the studio and play with her hoarse voice so very different from the perfect notes that come from her, but I always thought it was one of the best scenes in the film. The way he looks at her and he is so proud. I could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress like I also had the long sweater and the cap that looked like what he was wearing. this came on TV on time and I had my daughters watching it they were teenagers and they loved it. Maybe it's just that I was so taken in an age where everything was extreme I don't know. The ending has always left me in tears today.
