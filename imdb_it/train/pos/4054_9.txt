The first time I saw this movie was in the 80s as a kid. My father actually recorded it on TV. I must have watched more than 20 times, before the relatively recent DVD version. <br /> <br /> I obviously bought and watched the DVD and was surprised by how much the dialogue had changed. In the first version, which I still have on VHS, the atmosphere of the film, thanks to dialogue, was actually very dark. However, the new version, with Van Der Beek and others, is more comical. <br /> <br /> To put it another way, it's like watching the original US version of Akira with that dubbing, before looking at the remastered version with the literal translation of Japanese. <br /> <br /> I don't complain at all, the story and the quality of the animation are not diminished, but it raises the question of whether Miyazaki meant a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film .....
