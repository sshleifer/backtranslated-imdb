This is the story of the Australian commandos captured by the uniform after a raid. Since they are without uniform, they are rightly treated as spies. As such, they are tried, sentenced and sentenced to death. The Japanese martial court, for the admiration for their heroism, authorizes that he is given the death of a warrior. Obviously, under the Bushido code, this means that they must be beheaded. A destiny for which, as Westerners, they are unprepared.
