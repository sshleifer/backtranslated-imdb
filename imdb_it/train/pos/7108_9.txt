Do you like solving mysteries? Do you like complex narratives? This is for you. Brilliant and intelligent film by Francis Leclerc (son of a legendary French signer Felix Leclerc). A flashy photo and intelligent editing are the words of Leclerc, strongly aided by Roy Dupuis who is the dythirambic in the lead role. <br /> <br /> The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, a 40-year veterinarian who has just woken up from a coma after being disconnected from someone unknown. Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him while the suffering of a deer on the road was about to end. During the fight, he has a strange behavior and something seems to have taken him. <br /> <br /> Film not disturbing, but very mysterious and well interpreted. I have my hypothesis about the ending (I think the Indian caused the accident) but this ending was open to any explanation. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend 9.5 / 10
