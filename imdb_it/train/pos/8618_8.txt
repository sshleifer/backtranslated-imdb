Pop quiz: you are part of the modern military in peacetime on routine maneuvers and you find yourself going back in time with the possibility of changing history. What are you doing? Well, if you're a Hollywood studio, change the Japanese G.I.s to G.I. Samurai (aka Timeslip) to the crew of an American aircraft carrier, discusses the arrest of the attack on Pearl Harbor for 90 minutes and then returns home and hopes no one will remember that Japan did it earlier and with more balls in 1979 with this movie by Sonny Chiba. But unlike its Hollywood counterpart The Final Countdown, this sees its premise through: thrown back 400 years in the Japanese feudal wars, its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope to return is to provoke the story by trying to change it by joining a warlord conquer the country ?? shoot lots of tanks and helicopters against the samurai action, including an impressive 25-minute non-stop battle sequence with a cast of thousands of people inflicting serious damage on each other. And yes, there are beheadings. <br /> <br /> Obviously, things do not go as planned, and even higher firepower does not hold water and hopes for thousands of soldiers. Even earlier, soldiers are falling into each other in those who want to go home, those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and pillage hell. Impressively direct and surprisingly well thought out, soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction, especially when they present English texts sung by Japanese singers who cannot audibly speak words and speak the language, but it is a forgivable flaw in a amazing science fiction actor. <br /> <br /> The Optimum DVD in Great Britain is a good transfer of the full 138-minute version.
