I really like this film, but it's a fact that you can't understand it, unless you're from former Yugoslavia. Most of the actors died and those were the best actors of the former Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this movie is now on Divx and I can have it in my collection. Fruit salad. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegowina. Croatia. Slovenia. <br /> <br /> All this was the former Yugoslavia, a melting pot of Balkan nations. It could be a dream land, if Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists would not poison the nation's mind with their sick ideas.
