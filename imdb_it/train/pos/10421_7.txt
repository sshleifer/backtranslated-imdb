This is a very nice movie. Color photography is beautiful because it shows the richness of the Metropolitan Opera House in bright colors. Other indoor scenes in various homes, etc. They are equally brilliant. As for the music, what else can we say apart from the fact that Lanza's voice was at its peak while he sang so many of the most famous and beloved airs in the world. The wonderful Dorothy Kirsten is also a joy while her soprano voice blends with that of Lanza in a delightful harmony. Obviously, Hollywood has taken its usual liberties with the story of Caruso's life. There is a small precious in the plot that refers to real events. For example, the facts related to his death are totally invented and have no relation to the truth. There are some excellent websites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain several photos of him. These websites can be found using any valid search engine. There are also several books available on his life story. But the narrative plot does nothing to ruin this beautiful film. The voices of Lanza, Kirsten and members of the choir are the real protagonists of this film. Have fun, I know I did it.
