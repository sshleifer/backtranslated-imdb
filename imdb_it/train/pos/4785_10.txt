[No Spoilers] <br /> <br /> Being a film by David Lynch, one could have the idea that portrays his enigmatic mind like most of his films. But it is a very simple story as the title might suggest. All you do is get stuck in the usual Lynchian emptiness of incomprehensibility that usually occurs after seeing the Lost Highway. It's a simple film but it's really a great movie. This is both from an innovative and fun aspect. It's innovative because it's not Lynch. But maybe it's IS Lynch. He loves to turn our minds and then puts together a film that might seem very mainstream and far from Lynch himself. Being a very avant-garde director, he could simply make a film like this just to tease his regular audience because he knows what they expect but doesn't give him. It would be smart. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the film is slow. I would almost say the speed of the lawnmower ... Don't expect an orgy of action, but the film is really fun for those who follow the flow of the film. Look carefully at the little details that Lynch made during the movie for our entertainment. Look for the great cinematography that brings this film to life. And listen to the soundtrack of Badalamenti and the main theme that really animates the Iowa and Wisconsin landscapes shown frequently. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth stages one of his best performances in this film, making him one of the nicest men ever represented in the film. He doesn't have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts. His cheerfulness shines right through him and his acting earned him an Oscar nomination. Should I say that his weak health in this film was not played? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself immediately after the film was completed. This knowledge puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes more a tribute to Farnsworth. <br /> <br /> All this is a very nice film suitable for all types of people who love a film in the way they should be made. One could ask for homilies that are not so obvious and a little naive, but they do not spoil the big picture, since it is a memorable film. 9/10.
