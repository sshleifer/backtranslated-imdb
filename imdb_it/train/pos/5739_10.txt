Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce shine in this exceptional example of fraternal love and commitment. Hulce plays Dominick, (Nicky), a slightly mentally handicapped young man who is putting his 12 minutes younger, his twin brother Liotta, who plays Eugene, through medical school. It is set in Baltimore and addresses the issues of fraternal rivalry, the indissoluble bond of twins, the abuse of minors and the ever winning good over evil. It's captivating and full of laughter and tears. If you haven't seen this movie yet, please rent it, I promise, you'll be amazed how such a wonderful movie might not be noticed.
