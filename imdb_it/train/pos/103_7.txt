when I read other comments, I decided to watch this movie ... <br /> <br /> First, I specifically chose Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli; good enough ... <br /> <br /> Film, very intelligent and interesting because, the cast has a lot of international actors and actresses especially European like Turkey and Russia ... <br /> <br /> Second, the story is basic and you can guess it, but if you like the interesting action, you will like it in my opinion ... <br /> <br /> Third, the final chapter is not special or interesting, it's normal like others action movie .. . <br /> <br /> Finally, I recommend watching this movie ... And I hope you enjoy having fun: D
