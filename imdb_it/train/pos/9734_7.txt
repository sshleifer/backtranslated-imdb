Well here comes another romantic comedy, but unlike all the other films of this genre, this is by far the best I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> I admit, at first I wanted to see this movie because of Megan Fox, and a little because of Simon Pegg ... <br /> <br /> First of all, if you saw a fair amount of films, you will know that Sidney and Alison would be together with and of the film, one way or another ... but from the beginning to the end of the film you won't know how ... <br /> <br /> Ok, now this movie is just made for Simon Pegg. I can't see any other actor as Sidney, and I'm sure this would be a much weaker film if it weren't for Pegg's excellent performance. <br /> <br /> There are a number of great gags and jokes in this film that made me laugh very hard, courtesy of Simon Peggy's Sidney character ... but I think everyone in this movie is good. For example, Kirsten Dunst is really solid in this movie (usually not thinking of her as more than an average Ress act, but she was really good at it), then there's Jeff Bridges, there's Gillian Anderson, and obviously Megan Fox who plays the spoiled bizarre star Sophie Maes ... a great role for her ... <br /> <br /> All in all, although I usually don't agree with her ratings on IMDb, this time I would completely agree with them ... <br /> <br /> Go see this movie, it's really carefree and positive, and I recommend it deeply ... My vote 7 out of 10 ... well 7.5 actually ...
