worth watching, especially with the nice touch of a journalist with integrity, you expect a great plot to defeat while Gray Owl is exposed as a fraud, but it is not and adds to the generally optimistic and uplifting theme and drama of the story and of the film. <br /> <br /> This must be Brosnan's best performance to date, it convinces admirably as the English guy who plays the Indians. The leading scene is the return to yours? Zie? where Brosnan and the two elderly actresses make a wonderful scene filled with the feeling of nostalgia and a life lost with so little dialogue, only with expressions and good direction. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The story is so little known and the message is so universal and important it is really a pity that this film did not get a better recognition, perhaps with time it could become a bit classic and dormant. I hope. <br /> <br /> Well done, Dickie Attenborough and the cast.
