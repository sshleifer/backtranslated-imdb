Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. He takes his problems from his older sister, who kills at the beginning of the film. This is just the beginning of things that will come from Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays the doctor who has been studying Myers for years. He knows that there is something different about him, something mysteriously evil. This evil will not be contained, and cannot be stopped. <br /> <br /> After an escape from an institution, Myers tracks down his younger sister. If he kills her, there may be an end to this misunderstood boy's problems. But he seems to have trouble finishing his sister while the others get in the way. He manages to take them out while still looking for that girl he needs. <br /> <br /> There have been a lot of those horror movies that involve teenagers being torn to pieces by a masked or creepy killer. But this started it all, kind of. If you think about it, most of those horror movies we all remember are those that have Freddy Kruger or Jason chasing half-naked girls. Well, if it wasn't for Halloween, those characters wouldn't haunt our dreams when we were kids. <br /> <br /> The Halloween director, John Carpenter, got a lot out of the 50s horror movies and combined everything he knew into a movie that scared the lives of many people in the late 1970s. This film solidified him as a director to watch and he also started the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl persecuted by the masked killer. <br /> <br /> This film may seem a clich√© today, but in those days it wasn't much out there like that. It was copied from and ripped off, but Halloween will always remain the horror movie par excellence for teenagers. It still gives you chills by listening to Carpenter's electrifying music as we see another victim pursued by that dark Michael Myers.
