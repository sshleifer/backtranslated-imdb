To all the miserable people who have done everything to complain about dialogue, budget, this and that .... who wants to hear it? If you have missed the point of this extremely beautiful film, this is your loss. We all care deeply about this film and don't care what you think. I am a thirsty thirsty boy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this is in its very entity, in my book. It wasn't meant to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most beautiful love story ever attempted. I know they are the cynical 90s and the millennium has everyone in turmoil, but come on. Someone on this comment board complained that they had made too much money! How much is lame? He made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet and is the highest grossing film on the planet. I will be happy to side with the majority this time. Ok, cynics, it's time to crawl under your rock, I'm done.
