I haven't seen this movie in years so my knowledge is a little rusty. I remember thinking that this film is double the Braveheart film. It is simply more realistic and has more credible characters. Ridb Roy looks as if he imagined Rob Roy as a messy, with dirty hair and beard and simple clothes. Even the Liam Nesson has a Celtic appearance on him, he looks like a Scottish and, above all, looks like Rob Roy. It is a comparison that angers some people but compares it to Mel Gibson as William Wallace. Gibson is supposed to play a man whose legend led him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant while Gibson is almost a foot shorter. The story contains a bit of romance, conspiracy and a lost story. Does it sound something like Braveheart? But instead of a film that shouts "freedom", freedom and nationalism we get a film that says honor, love and justice. This makes it a more interesting film. Much like Gladiator. The cast is fantastic and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this effort. The story is great with how it is about heroism and humanity. The scene in which Mary is raped and she comes out of the house on fire with a look of true Scottish strength is followed by her washing the sperm from her groin in an extreme panic. This is something that a Braveheart heroine would never do. Overall this is a surprising and almost perfect watch. Go see it!
