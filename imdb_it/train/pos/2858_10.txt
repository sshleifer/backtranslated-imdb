Bonanza had a cast of wonderful actors. Lorne Greene, Pernell Whitaker, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker and even Guy Williams (like the cousin who was brought for several episodes during 1964 to replace Adam when he left the series). The cast had chemistry, and they seemed genuinely similar to each other. This has made many of their weaker stories work much better than they should. He has also turned many of their best stories into great western drama. <br /> <br /> Like any show that ran over thirty episodes each season, there are certainly some of the weak ones. However, most of the time each episode had an interesting story, a kind of conflict and a resolution that usually did not include violence. While Bonanza was a western, the shooting was never described as the main attraction. While I'm a fan of The Rifleman and Wanted: Dead Or Alive; those shows usually ended in a firefight. The shootings were the way many westerns solved every conflict, and Bonanza was very different in trying to find peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing. <br /> <br /> In the early years of Bonanza, there are some interesting episodes that present many firefights. These episodes are in contrast to the rest of the series, but they are quite good by themselves. In 1964, when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave the show, Guy Williams was taken to replace it. Williams was playing the role of a long-lost cousin. Unfortunately, Whitaker decided to stay another year, and so Williams was written out of the series when he moved to marry Adam's old girlfriend. If Williams had remained for the entire duration of Bonanza, one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965, when Pernell Whitaker left the show. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, once Pernell Whitaker left the series, the stories centered more on comedies and country hijinks. Whitaker has often played in many episodes and his absence has left a gap in the cast. Little Joe always wanted to play the good guy and Hoss always wanted to play the good old man with a heart of gold. Since Ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family, this didn't leave too much room for gunfights. <br /> <br /> At one point they took on a ranch hand called Candy (David Canary) who became their fourth cast member, but Candy was never the protagonist of shootings, and it was no longer a previous version of Little Joe. For a year or two, they also took Ben to another lost cousin (Jamie, played by the objectable Mitch Vogel) who was a teenager who was usually having problems with someone. <br /> <br /> Apparently adding the teenager, the studio was trying to attract younger spectators. It also gave writers the opportunity to write episodes about teenage problems, alcohol, delinquency, etc. Those preaching episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction by the establishment media to the counter-culture movement. Dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order TV, although Hawaii 5-0, The F.B.I. and many other shows have also tried to jump on the bandwagon making television series that have seen irresponsible teenagers cause trouble, chaos and crimes. <br /> <br /> The addition of a teenager to the cast gave Cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems, but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general. After the death of Dan Blocker, the series limped for about another year before it was canceled. Last season was pretty bad, as he saw Little Joe track down his wife's killers, and most of the episodes were pretty depressing because Little Joe usually drank or remembered how much he loved his wife, and how unfair it was that she was killed. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've ever seen the last episode of the series, and I wonder if they ever officially wrapped it in some way. In the last year, there was only Ben (Lorne Greene) who actually lived on the Ponderosa, since Adam had moved (and never once returned as a guest) and Hoss was dead and Little Joe was gone after his wife (in the series) had been killed by vagrants. <br /> <br /> In general, the era of 1959-1965 is the best of this series. Once Adam left, he slowly declined. Most shows before 1970 are also quite good. In 1970, the series was trying to be tough and current, and had lost much of its western flavor. The addition of Candy and the teenager has also softened the overall quality of the show, and Hoss's death (Dan Blocker) was the last time. Bonanza is probably the best western series ever made, and of the 465 episodes that have been produced, at least a hundred of these are excellent Western dramas! This is a pretty good record. Even the worst of Bonanza is better than many other television programs.
