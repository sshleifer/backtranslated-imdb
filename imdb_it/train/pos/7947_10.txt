I watched this movie so many times through my hood that even today I can see all the dialogues again. And when I look at it now it makes me happy and surprisingly still laughing. I think it's amazing how they managed to train animals, especially the cat, to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film. However, observing it now I can also unfortunately notice that it is not the masterpiece I thought it was. But I prefer to remember how I felt when I was younger looking at it on VHS on my TV punch that would have tarnished the image in yellow. And bearing in mind that this is a children's film, that's why I'd definitely give it 10/10.
