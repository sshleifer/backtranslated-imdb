What could be more disgusting than the idea that private investigators are involved with women who should be spying? And most of the written dialogues are perfectly trivial. <br /> <br /> But the actors transform the dialogue into something that makes sense. You can see real people behind unreal lines. And the direction is wonderful. Each scene does just what it should and ends without dragging it too long. <br /> <br /> I showed it to many friends in the mid-80s because I was perplexed about how such a bad material could be turned into such a beautiful film. Even friends had fun.
