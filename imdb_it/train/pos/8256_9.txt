I saw this movie at the Vancouver Film Festival and thought it was deadly, elegant and fun. <br /> <br /> The cast was ROCK SOLID. Great work by Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and Up and comer, Alexia Fast. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I found myself thinking about the movie for days after seeing it. <Br /> <br /> Writers, Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie have been working on a lot of political subtext - but they didn't hit you in the head. <br /> <br /> The world they created had depth, and made sense. There is a dizzying carnivorous spirit in this film. <br /> <br /> FIDO is guaranteed to treat the unpleasantness. <br /> <br /> I loved it !!!
