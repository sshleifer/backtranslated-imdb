What would happen when a depressed cop works with a test shrink? It can be a lot of fun ... This film has been a landmark in the action / comedy genre of Argentine cinema. Carefree characters, probable history and a rhythm that between a laugh and the other has a thrill. I recommended it for a pleasant moment of entertainment. Peretti and Luque join their efforts to fight a cold and bold enemy at a time when it is difficult to trust anyone. This film will surprise you, on the other side of the "Analyze me" medal, but not in the same way, with nothing to envy. And if you like getting to know Bs.AS there where few scenes of the center and the city center.
