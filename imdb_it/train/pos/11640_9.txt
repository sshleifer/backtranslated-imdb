What I liked most about this film is that, like the Hitchcock movies, it's a thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock understood that people go to the movies to have fun. Something that Hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years. This is a thriller, but it has a lot of laughs and always has an eye winking at the camera. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdams is as wonderful as ever. Cillian Murphy is scarier than he was in Batman Begins. In the past there were boys who always played the villain. These days we don't see much of it because I suspect Hollywood agents consider it a bad career move, but Cillian Murphy is really good at being bad. <br /> <br /> The direction is surprisingly trendy. The story is good but the dialogue could have used some refinement. <br /> <br /> "Red Eye" is a really fun movie and people applauded when the credits started running. If you're in the mood for a fun escapist thriller, "Red Eye" could be your ticket.
