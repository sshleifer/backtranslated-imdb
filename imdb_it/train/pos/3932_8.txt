In the same song as his American drums along the Mohawk, John Ford captures American history in an imaginary but very credible way. Henry Fonda has made three consecutive films in this era with Ford and all three have a certain time and place with emphasis on the setting and the cultural environment. In Mohawk, pioneer America is in full bloom with Americans defending themselves against Indians and other forces. Here, Ford shows us 19th-century America; a time when invention and creativity were beginning to blossom and this nation was really growing. Among them was a tall, lanky young Illinois lawyer named Abe Lincoln and this film fictionalized his life as a lawyer, foreshadowing the greatness he would later achieve. <br /> <br /> Fonda is superb in this film, capturing the essence of what is considered the character of Lincoln, although no one knows exactly how it was then. Also the sets and the supporting cast work well together and give a unique balance in Ford's picturesque American dream and its many forms. This is not a film to be taken literally, but rather symbolically, demonstrating that Lincoln was actually warming up for the events of his life that were to create his legacy. We also have scenes between him and a young Mary Todd; and it's hard to see how they ended up together, but that's not the point. I believe this is simply a tribute to the greatness of Lincoln, widely regarded as the greatest American president. His calm and direct demeanor was rare then and would be today. In fact, our government definitely needs more men like him.
