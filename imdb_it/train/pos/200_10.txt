Updated from a previous comment. The great and underestimated Marion Davies shows her comic stories in this late (1928) silent comedy that also shows the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a part from Georgia that crashes in Hollywood with the help of Haines, a bit of a rough comedy player. They appear together in economic comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. <br /> <br /> A great lampoon on Hollywood and its claims. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team, and photos of guests of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle and Marion Davies (you must see it) are a blast. A must for any serious cinema enthusiast or anyone interested in Marion Davies still defamed! Dell Henderson plays the father. Polly Moran is a waitress. Paul Ralli is the slimy protagonist. <br /> <br /> SHOW PEOPLE was told that he used Gloria Swanson's career as a model (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But the story of this film is parallel to Swanson's rise from the comedies Mack Sennett to a reel with Charlie Chaplin to STAR in Cecil B. DeMille films of the late adolescence and the 1920s. Davies and Haines were huge MGM stars and friends. Strange that MGM never joined them in a talkie. They fit together! A sweet love story and a delicious parody of the first Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are quoted but do not appear.
