After seeing the spy thriller of World War I, Madam Lili (1969) starring Julie Andrews on TV this afternoon, I suddenly thought I saw a spy thriller far superior to the First World War. All I could remember is that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis. It only took a brief search on IMDB to find Fraulein Doktor. Once the title was recognized, the memories returned flooded. It is, for its time, a reasonably well-built story that revolves around real events like Kitchener's death and the German offensive of 1918. He also has a much more credible female spy than Julie Andrews! As with other reviewers, the first and strongest memory was of well-produced battle scenes and of men and horses in gas masks. If you have an interest in war films and in particular for the First World War, it is a film that is worth seeing if you have the opportunity.
