I will be quick to address the film's issues here: it was a very compelling story about the destructive qualities of the passions that consume everything; a young Italian woman who cannot connect emotionally with her radical political boyfriend (due in part to her apolitical attitudes and free-wheeling approach to life) finds comfort and passion in a new young lover with whom she undertakes an explicit sexual relationship . The anxieties, the anger, the tenderness and the passions that swirl in the atmosphere of history equal the dispassionate calm that seems to swallow the two clues. The film gives the film a disturbing state of mind that permeates all the political conflict that would otherwise be lost in the viewer (unless you have a profound knowledge of Italian politics in the 1980s). I found the film compelling ... the one that somehow ruined it is a free oral sex scene that the actress plays as a male protagonist ... she is not simulated and leaves little to the imagination. There are other sex scenes in the film, which I think are necessary because they outline the madness and loneliness in which the characters live. But the oral sex scene, in my opinion, derails the true story. Up until that point it was smooth up to that point and once the infamous sex scene appears (which caused a lot of fuss in his day), it's like hitting a roadblock. It is strident and useless and I am in the field who believes that the film would not have been damaged if the scene had been removed from it. And what is unfortunate is that this particular scene may deter people from watching this intriguing movie, which I think is worth seeing because there is so much to see beneath the surface, emotions and other tumors layered in the subtext. <br /> <br /> Overall: a wonderful movie hampered by a very unnecessary sex scene.
