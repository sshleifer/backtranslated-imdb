The narrative affirms the classic image of good versus evil in the form of a brother's struggle against a brother. The main character, Lin Macadam, played by James Stewart, represents justice and righteousness. His brother, who works under the character of the Dutchman Henry Brown, played by Stephen McNally, represents the classic stage trainer who steals the western outlaw, chased by his brother for killing his father. The world in which the plot takes place is the classic dystopian west where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing themselves is to take away their firearms as soon as they enter the city, and the man responsible for maintaining this Law and Order is the classic western lawyer Wyat Earp. <br /> <br /> There are also characters so typical of the western world, such as the killer Indian warrior, the besieged cavalryman and the damsel dressed in a cap in danger. <br /> <br /> Another important archetype in this film, the one that gives the film its name, is a custom-made Winchester rifle. The weapon can be seen as an allegory for the rewards given to those who do things honorably. Once stolen from the rightful owner, it brings tragedy to all those who come into contact with it. In this sense it resembles other icons like the Holy Grail in Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the blood-stained letter in Saving Private Ryan. This gives the film an element of surrealism that is usually absent from westerns, a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols. <br /> <br /> Being essentially a revenge movie, it shares this with many other examples of the genre, such as Jack Arnold's and Unforgiven's No Name on the Bullet by Clint Eastwood. <br /> <br /> There is also a tacit theme of rape in Winchester '73. Waco Johnny Dean, one of the villains of the film played very effectively by Dan Duryea, kidnaps a woman after killing her husband. The volatile cowboy toys with her tender husband pretend to be a caricature of a cat playing with an insect before biting its head. Waco Johnny Dean eventually gets what comes to mind after coming into contact with the menacing Winchester rifle. <br /> <br /> The main story of Winchester '73 recalls the mythological tale of Jason and his search for the golden fleece, as told in Apollonio's Argonautica. Both stories concern the acquisition of a sacred object that possesses a kind of intangible quality. Like Jason, Stewart's character jumps from adventure to adventure in search of a unique award. Another theme in Winchester '73 that is similar to a mythical tale is the struggle between brothers. Several stories on antiquity deal with this theme, such as the fable of the Hebrew Bible of Cain and Abel and the vulgar fable of Romulus and Remus. <br /> <br /> Regarding the theme of abduction and rape in the film by Anthony Mann, it is present in many mythological works, such as the rape of Europa told by Ovid in his Metamorphoses. <br /> <br /> Winchester '73 is a fine example of the Western genre, and serves as an objective correlative for many classic American western and ancient mythological themes.
