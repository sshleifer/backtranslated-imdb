THE SECRET OF KELLS could be the most exquisite film I've ever seen from THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE. Although stylistically very different, KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and (the stunning 2D opening sequence of) KUNG FU PANDA, incredible art direction, production design, background / layout and a wealth of colors that is a feast for one's senses. KELLS is so gorgeous - almost gothic in its layout (a bit reminiscent of Klimt), wonderfully flat in the general general perspective, adorned in its Celtic and illuminated design, but the characters are so simplistic and appealing - And everything works perfectly together. You fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them. You are so attracted to every detail of the story and to every pencil and brush stroke. What Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul and everyone at Cartoon Saloon (and their extended crew) have achieved with this small budget / VERY little manned film is absolutely amazing. The wave of support among our animation community is phenomenal. This film is breathtaking and the buzz among our colleagues in recommending this film is spreading like wildfire. Congratulations to KELLS for his numerous awards, his appointment to Annie and his current Oscar qualifying competition. They are all long-standing merits, indeed ...
