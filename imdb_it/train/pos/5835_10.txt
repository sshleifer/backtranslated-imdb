Stan and Ollie become SAPS AT SEA when their rebellious boat is requisitioned by an evil assassin. <br /> <br /> The boys are wonderful in this feature, which starts with one of their most exhilarating pieces, the horn factory. Always with a few steps out of sync with the rest of the Creation, Laurel & Hardy live in a world where icy radios and bed goats are the rule, not the exception. With its short duration, the film is more in line with its classic short subjects, which explains its episodic nature. <br /> <br /> Only the boys get the credit on the screen, but the film experts will recognize other familiar faces: James Finlayson appears like a crazy doctor, Richard Cramer does full justice to his role as a bad boy, sweet Mary Gordon plays the perplexed neighbor of the boys. Charlie Hall is the receptionist and the silent comic Ben Turpin portrays a very special plumber. <br /> <br /> One of the film's writers was the silent comedian Harry Langdon. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie is the main focus, however. Watching Hardy go crazy at the sound of a horn, or Laurel's antics with bananas, for example, reminds the viewer why these friends remain absolute movie giants.
