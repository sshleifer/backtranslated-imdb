First of all I would like to say how beautiful this is. It is surprising and sometimes shocking. And to say the least, I'm 11 and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely put up with a boring movie, but that's anything but boring. It's like a journey through humanity. His clear realism is manifested through this monumental masterpiece. It is a harrowing tale of two downs and outers (VOIGHT AND Hoffman) who build a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT), a naive Texan student arrives in New York to make him rich by entertaining women. Soon he meets Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), who is a poor man who can barely pay the rent. Ratso becomes Joe's "manager", but soon both men can't find Joe a job that results in food theft. As they try to survive in the streets of New York, we realize how difficult it is. They can't convince Joe of a girl until they meet a woman at a party. Joe makes some money and soon Joe takes Ratso to a dream location in Ratso, Florida. The last five minutes are really exciting, but some of the best moments in the film. From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get an austere and sometimes disturbing urban vision of life.
