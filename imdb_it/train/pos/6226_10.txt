Astaire and Rogers at the height of their popularity. In 1936 the Americans thought of the Navy as a place for singing and dancing. World War II was still a few years away. Fred and Ginger dance the city. <br /> <br /> The plot is decent, but who cares ... By the way, note the cameo roles of Betty Grable and a charming Lucile Ball. <br /> <br /> A load of Irving Berlin songs, including the famous "Let's do music and dance". In that scene, Ginger's heavy bat suit hits Fred in the face during one of his laps and almost makes him unconscious. Fred insisted on keeping his grip because the dance was still superb. <br /> <br /> Ginger once commented that she was a better dancer than Fred, since she had to do all the same moves, in step and backwards ... <br /> <br /> Come to think of it, even Fred's voice was beautiful. Man has been effortlessly moving. <br /> <br /> Here is a movie to caress on the couch with a loved one, kick off shoes and enjoy entertainment.
