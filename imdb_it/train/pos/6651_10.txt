Gandhi, the great: <br /> <br /> Greatness in the world is associated with people like Alexanader, the great, Ashoka the Great, because their greatness lied to be glorified more than humans. Gandhi is called great because he is not a Great but he is more human, because I always believe that taking humanity out of us is the greatness of being human lies. Gandhi was a human with humanity and one who sought humanity ready to sacrifice himself in the battle for humanity but not his enemies. Let me now go to the movie review. <br /> <br /> About Gandhi My Father: <br /> <br /> Gandhi My father is a film not about Gandhi but about his son Harilal Gandhi. On the story of a son whose father was one of the greatest humans to travel this land, the director manages to portray the story. The film manages to tell the story of a misguided son of a father who leads a nation to greatness. The film is defined as a criticism of Gandhi's failure as the father of his son, I would rather say that it is a sacrifice that Gandhi had made as the father of a child to do justice as the father of a nation. <br /> <br /> I wish the essence of this film prevails not only in India, the Gandhian land, but through the hearts of all the people of this world. <br /> <br /> Gandhi the true Human. Jaihind.
