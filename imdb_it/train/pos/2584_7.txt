The film starts very slowly, with the lifestyle of Wallace Napalm, assistant of a photo shoot station. His wife was confined to her home with an ankle bracelet as a result of an arson conviction. Wallace is a member of the voluntary fire department and takes firefighters seriously. <br /> <br /> While we observe the rather boring life of Wallace's life, suddenly something new and strident arrives: a traveling carnival arrives in the city. One of his stars is Wilder Napalm, Wallace's brother. He is a clown, but he has a special talent. <br /> <br /> So does Wallace. They are both pyrotechnic or "pyrotechnic", people capable of starting fires through mental energy. Wallace keeps his powers secret; Wilder lets his acquaintances know what he can do. <br /> <br /> Spoilers: some of their differences date back to a child accident in which they inadvertently caused the death of a tramp. Wallace holds back from using his powers; Wilder wants to become public on national TV. <br /> <br /> To complicate matters, Wilder wants Wallace's wife, whom they both attended years before. It becomes a bone of contention, and becomes one of the reasons why the brothers finally have a literal firefight. <br /> <br /> The film is fun, but not funny to laugh. I think enough to get a copy in my library. It's a good unusual movie.
