Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman is Batman's latest animated film directed at the video / DVD movie to be released. (Minor Spoilers Ahead) The plot revolves around a new criminal, the Batwoman, who seems to be personally involved, for whatever reason, in stopping a shipment of important weapons. <br /> <br /> Although the film is quite interesting, it is not as good as "Mask of the Phantasm", "Sub-Zero" or "Return of the Joker". The main reason is that it does not emanate the emotional appeal of the other films. At the end of this film, we don't really feel sorry for anyone like we did in others, in particular, "Sub-Zero". There is no real tragedy that made the other animated films special to us. Even the Batwoman is not a really "tragic" character (as were Mr. Freeze or Phantasm). Not only that, but Batwoman's alter ego seems so incredibly 'rigid' and boring that the viewer doesn't really care about what happened to her and that forced her to wear the mask or what happens to her in the end and here she the main reason we do not have this special emotional appeal. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I found the movie funny. He has his moments, for example, when the public discovers who Batwoman really is and sees an old thug coming back last time in the original "Batman: The Animated Series". The action is also very pleasant with some very suspensive moments. <br /> <br /> If Batwoman's background was more interesting, this film would have been better than "Return of the Joker" in my book, but as it is now, it's in 4th (out of 4). <br /> <br /> As for the animation, it is the same as in the The New Batman Adventures comic book from the mid-1990s. The score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated films of Batman, but it is still good. <br /> <br /> I recommend buying this DVD because, despite its flaws, it's fun. But remember, it's not as good as other Batman animated films. <br /> <br /> 7/10
