When I sat down to watch "Largo Winch" I was expecting nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars. When I got up, I saw both; and more. <br /> <br /> Karl Roden was not finally the antagonist of a film, to begin with. Kristin Scott Thomas played his role well, but in my opinion the real two stars were Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojlovic, both superbly starring. In Radivoje Bukvic plays good Goran. <br /> <br /> Mixed linguistics brought a nice color to the film, but I understand why people would get bored with it. <br /> <br /> The scenery of Hong Kong and especially the beautiful Croatian coast amazed me and I didn't want to take my eyes off the screen when Largo entered the incredibly beautiful island. <br /> <br /> Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500 and BMW 7; if someone loves expensive limousine-type cars; this is their movie. It is also a film for people who love action sequences, good acting, landscapes of extreme beauty and, above all, a fast and well-written action film, with dazzling fights and a deeply woven inner drama. <br /> <br /> My vote, given that it has illuminated a gloomy day is: 10/10
