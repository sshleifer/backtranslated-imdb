There's something about Pet Sematary that I've never heard anywhere else. Perhaps the fact that I was a child when I first saw it made this experience so memorable. But as I keep looking at it over and over again, it never gets old, and I never get bored. From the headlines with that disturbing opening song to the very chaotic finale, there is something crazy, sad and scary at the same time, and it continues to resonate in your head: sometimes dead is better! <br /> <br /> I don't think it would be useful to relate the whole story again. All you need to know is that it starts from point A (the most perfect situation for a happy American family) and step by step drowns at point B (which is, believe me, the end of all joy). The music is perfect, the story makes sense, the special effects are fantastic and the Pet Sematary is the last place on earth I want to be. As I said, sometimes dead is better!
