Well, the film is not exactly "funny". <br /> <br /> Ok, I admit, there are some HUMOROUS lines, but definitely nothing fun to laugh about. For example: right before a hot sex scene between Eleniak and one of his male costars, sh is handcuffed to the headboard of the bed and can't get his shirt off. Before leaving the room to retrieve the key, he says "Ok, don't go anywhere". <br /> <br /> Look, fun, but not fun. <br /> <br /> The plot and acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show. It's sexy and sexy and with her there's a really cool scene that you can't help but rewind and watch again. <br /> <br /> There are also other very sexy scenes with her and she has very provocative lines provocations. <br /> <br /> In general, 5 stars. I'd only give three if it wasn't for Erika Eleniak.
