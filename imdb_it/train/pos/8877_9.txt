This story was probably one of the most powerful I've ever taken. John Singleton certainly went far beyond when he put together this educational masterpiece. Brilliant performances of the entire cast, but Epps and Rapaport have become the best and most convincing of the young star's career. <br /> <br /> However, as a university student, many of the themes touched by Singleton were taken to the extreme. In a sense, even if they are problems faced on many university campuses, they are not presented as large or open-air in order to make people believe. In some cases, it seemed almost ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually happen. However, apart from the fact that it was a bit too dramatic, the film was brilliant and left me speechless, unable to speak, just to think. One of the things about this image that I will always remember, was a quote from the character of Lawrence Fishburn: "Knowledge is power, without knowledge, you cannot see your power". Brilliant, simply brilliant.
