The line, of course, comes from the Lord's prayer: "Your will will be done on earth as it is in heaven". Sweden, especially its far north, is not my idea of ​​paradise: winter temperatures at 30 degrees C are a bit low for me, but the good guys who live there no doubt think they are in God's country. <Br /> <br /> The plot here is familiar. The famous international musician Daniel suffers the collapse of health in the middle of his career, dating back to the small village in northern Sweden, where he was born. Persuaded by the local pastor to help with the church choir, he turns an unlikely talent into a class act, and they participate in a competition held in Innsbruck, Austria. There are echoes (sorry) of the "Brassed Off" musicians of the "Calendar Girls" models and the dancers of "The Full Monty". But of course it causes many emotional upheavals as some of the most oppressed villagers realize their value and their revolt against their oppressors. Face hostile husbands and an ever more doubtful pastor, but nothing but death will stop him. <br /> <br /> Despite the somewhat trivial history, we know and appreciate many of the characters that come across people rather than caricatures, although many of them are recognizable "types". I wonder if his wife's pulse goes unpunished for so long. Sweden is a country in the world where such violence is strongly discouraged (he was also a little young to be one of Daniel's youth bullies) and the Puritan pastor with a secret passion for girly magazines was a bit of a stereotype, but beautifully crafted by Niklas Falk. <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist is just as wonderful as Daniel, the frail but driven musician, and there is also good music. I was kidnapped for all the two hours. The ending is what you do with it, I think , but it is not ruined to say that Daniel realizes what he has decided to do.
