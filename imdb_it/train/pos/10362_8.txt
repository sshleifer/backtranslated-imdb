Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance like the infamous Lindy Chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly murdering her little Azaria Chamberlain and using her ravenous dingo alibi as her defense. Based on the book "Evil Angels" and titled so in its Australian version, A CRY IN THE DARK is a bad movie to watch. It presents a too realistic scenario for us in America: the witch hunt against a person considered an easy target. <br /> <br /> Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who told her opinion, someone who didn't play the sympathy card and someone who was hard enough to get on with her life despite her horrible ordeal, was labeled as suspicious and hated beyond comprehension too when it was clear that she did not kill her son. The media started a tight noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon made the entire nation stick to their sets while they scrabbled this family piece by piece. And through all this, Lindy remained more stoic than ever, even when her husband Michael was falling apart. <br /> <br /> This position, of course, is the power of force, however indifferent it may seem, and people happen to react strongly to this. They want to see an anxious mother crying and crying and occasionally fainting at every turn, not sitting there and looking blank. People do not understand that not everyone feels the same way and when someone decides to stay strong, speculation begins. Meryl Streep embodies this contaminated woman to the end and in doing so creates a cold but not insensitive woman, who remained faithful to her convictions even though it cost her freedom. Thanks to her, Sam Neill is allowed to slowly dissolve his character into despair - someone must, otherwise the Chamberlain would be too detached and nobody wants to see him. Except the monster that at the time of this writing has become the news media. They will always eat train wrecks and feed the uninformed public to hibernate.
