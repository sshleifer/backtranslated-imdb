**** SPOILERS **** The film "Sniper" is undoubtedly based on the exploits of the legendary American sniper Marine "Gunny" Hathcock. Mister Rogers' sober diver, who scored 300 confirmed and unconfirmed, Vietcong and the North Vietnamese army killed during his two tours in "Nam". This shows how truly a trained and military sniper is lethal and effective. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger is as cool and deadly as Sgt.Thomas Beckett who is at the end of his career as a top sniper in the United States Marine but later realizes that a life as a civilian will be useless . Since there is nothing out for him to do with his skills he has learned in US marines unless he decides to become a mafia hit man. Backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a professional life murderer for his country. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie "Sniper" focuses on Sgt. Beckett with the assistance of the former silver medalist with rifle shots and US government agent Richard Miller, Billy Zane , is sent deeply into the Panamanian jungle. The two snipers will have to defeat the rebel general Miguel Alveraze, Frederick Miraglittoa, and the Colombian drug king Raul Ochoa, Carlos Alveraze, who supports him in a plan to take over the country's military force. <br /> <br /> Let's see first in the movie Sgt. Purpose of Beckett and take a rebel leader that I think is the best scene in "Sniper". Because it shows step by step how Sgt. Beckett with the help of his Cpt spotter. Papich, Aden Young, does his job. There is also a sub-plot that was later interrupted in the film about a rebel DeSilva sniper, Eward Wiley, who was persecuting Beckett and who later killed Papich while they were both waiting to be lifted from the jungle by a military helicopter. You would have thought that a deadly cat and a mouse would be played between the two that would have culminated when the film ended, but the sergeant. Beckett had no problem dispersing DeSilva at the beginning of the film using an unsuspecting Miller as bait. <br /> <br /> What hurt the film the most was ironically the last fifteen minutes when the story went from one shot to a sniper movie killing a similar ending to Rambo with the sergeant. Beckett and Agent Miller are fighting an entire battalion of rebels with bullets flying like London fog. <br /> <br /> "Sniper" is still worth observing for the fact that it tells the story of a person who until now has not been really glamorous in war movies: a lone killer who kills with precision and the skill of an experienced master diamond cutter or neurosurgeon who does it in total secrecy.
