Seeing "Impulse" is a very satisfying experience. Unpredictable films are a rarity, when one arrives as "Impulse", it is something to embrace. The script is logical and extremely creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn and Bill Paxton give credible performances. This may have played like a zombie movie, but "Impulse" is far superior to any boring "zombiefest", and originality shines through almost every scene. You have the feeling that something like this can actually happen, even if the script is pure fiction. From the opening of the "grabber" to the launch of the credits, you will be fascinated. Very fun and definitely recommended. - MERK
