This film is a brilliant lesson on Japanese history set at the end of the Tokugawa shogunate just before the Shogunate lost a great battle against the loyalist, who wanted the emperor to return to the throne to rule Japan. Really, I had to read a lot of history to get the whole background. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu (also known as the original Zatoichi) offers a superb performance like Izo Okada, one of the four Hitokiri (= Human Huntress) of the Bakumatsu. He is a simple samurai who loses all his wealth. To have a good life become a servant of Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryonosuke from Sword of Doom). Hanpei is an ultranationalist politician who lets his Hitokiri gang assassinate a lot of high pro-Western politicians in order to achieve his political goals. Izo Okada follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing. As long as he has the money to go drink and spend on his whore. Okada's murders become increasingly brutal throughout the film and he is proud to have a reputation based on fear wherever he goes. <br /> <br /> It is a splendid portrait of the life of a simple samurai who is involved in political affairs and it is really naive to realize what is happening. First of all, after being betrayed and tortured and always having conversations with Sakamoto (who is a samurai who rejects violence) he changes his ideas and opinions about life. But too late .... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie to see the end of Izo Okada ... <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu and the rest of the staff perform brilliantly. Each actor reaches his role. The sword fights in a very unique and fast way ... probably faster than many movies nowadays ... <br /> <br /> Find out if you have the chance !!!
