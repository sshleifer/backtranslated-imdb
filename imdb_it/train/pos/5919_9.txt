Street Fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire. This is not a movie that you watch just for fun. It is not a comfortable experience, even if it has some funny moments. This is a movie that you watch when you need food for thought. <br /> <br /> To reject this film as simply racist means to completely lose the point. This is not only a satire of Song of the South, it is also a sharp commentary on the prejudices that Americans still have as a society. Each ethnic group depicted in the film is shown as grotesque caricatures of their stereotypes, which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people. Through this wild exaggeration, the director shows how absurd these held beliefs are. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person who is willing to acknowledge the ugliness of prevailing prejudices, American culture is still valid, and if you're not afraid to look at your own prejudices in your eyes, this movie could be for you.
