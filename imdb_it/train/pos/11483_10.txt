The thing that makes this movie so scary is the way it portrays Andre and Calvin as (relatively) normal kids. These are definitely not the people who want to become professional filmmakers since they wander around in front of the camera, forget the lines written, etc. They are making the video only as a diary to show the survivors how normal their lives were. Their parents think the boys are filming for a video of a family home. Doing research on other children they attack their schools, Andre and Calvin learn what not to do and inform (usually in a foolish way 'This Old House') any potential 'Andres and Calvins' that could watch this video how to make bombs, weapons and do not get caught before the Zero Day (the day of the attack).
