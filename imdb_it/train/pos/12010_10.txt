Attention: mild spoilers. <br /> <br /> The story of Joseph Smith stands out as a surprising - even moving - episode in American history and world religious history. This film portrays events in the life of Joseph Smith, which the Mormons revered as a prophet of the restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ on earth. I've seen the film so far twice in its first month of public screening. <br /> <br /> Joseph Smith is the first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers (Alvin, Hyrum and Joseph) who, at a very young age, needed an operation. The operation, done without our modern conveniences, was bloody and difficult. The scene helped to show the cohesion of the Smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between Joseph and his parents. <br /> <br /> Joseph's religious confusion and subsequent prayer leading up to what the Mormons call the First Vision have been interpreted in an interesting way. The face of Jesus is never shown, but you can see the unmistakable nail marks in his hands. The rejection by religious leaders and many in his small community in New York is at least partially softened by Joseph's marriage to Emma. <br /> <br /> This film does not clearly map the events in the history of the Mormon Church, but simply jumps from scene to scene. This is not a criticism - simply a note on style. <br /> <br /> The practice of tarring and plumage is shown, and it is particularly dramatic and moving when Joseph utters a sermon on the Savior's love with a scarred face of having recently been attacked. <br /> <br /> The film simultaneously portrays the joy and growth of Mormonism as a childish church simultaneously, while at the same time the deepening opposition has spread to the heights of local governments. <br /> <br /> The film shows many scenes from Joseph's life, including some beautiful moments that portray his relationship with Emma. An attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of Joseph's life, including his fierce love for his wife, his infinite love for children, his spirit, his courage in the face of dark and dangerous opposition, the his religious feelings and his compassion. <br /> <br /> While Joseph and Hyrum ride to Carthage, so as not to return home alive, most of the characters throughout the film, whose lives have been touched by Joseph, are shown along the way, contributing to reinforce what was already seen, but set the final scene to be more powerful. <br /> <br /> In the end, the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum is depicted, and the spectators are left to reflect on the events they have just witnessed. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the film, I thought it was done by the Church to present Joseph Smith to non-members. I no longer think so, although I hope the film can do just that. As an insider, I discover that the film is a celebration of Joseph and excellently strengthens the good things we already know about him. I'm curious to see how strangers will see the movie - if they see it simply as propaganda, an epic story about an American religious or something else. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully shot, suitable for families, moving and, hopefully, something good for everyone. That the events actually portrayed in these United States of America is interesting to reflect on the many aspects of our culture - including freedom of religious expression and respect (in general) of the law - we moderns take for granted.
