Did you hear the story of the reluctant heroes who were hired by a king to kill a dragon? Oh, do you have? Was it set in a world made up entirely of small islands that floated above the clouds, and the heroes had to make dangerous island hopping on their journey? Was the water flowing upwards and the remains of large cities rising on the horizon? I didn't think so. <br /> <br /> I came across this movie by accident and I'm really glad I did! It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Just like the Pixar movies, it's a piece of animated computer art that could only be possible in today's world. The animators have invested the thought in almost everything that appears on the screen, and this attention to detail is astounding (the scene where the mushrooms in the foreground spew green smoke while the characters walk carelessly in the background is one of my favorites). Monsters are also completely realized and wonderful to watch in action. <br /> <br /> Although the plot may not be entirely unique, the film has enough charm to make sure you keep watching. Our protagonists are nice and interesting, assuring the public behind their almost impossible quest to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon that could otherwise devour everything in its path. Obviously, Hector is the character he will most love with. A small blue creature with a crazy grin and a tendency to talk nonsense and English, Hector provides relief to the comedy in a way that Jar Jar Binks could only dream of. In summary, I recommend looking at The Dragon Hunters if you have the opportunity. Watch it for incredible animation, breathtaking battle scenes and take a look into a world that is unlike anything else you saw on a movie or television screen. At the very least, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - it doesn't matter if you have nine or twenty-nine (which, in fact, they are)!
