A big surprise, probably because I expected it to suck. The reviews were rather contemptuous, although they all seemed to agree that the concept was golden: a man discovers that his new girlfriend is a superhero and finds, when he wants to break with her, that he is a kind of psychopath. I kept expecting it to break up, but it never happened. Of course, he doesn't make the most of his fantastic premises that he could, and he chooses to be brief when it could have been better to expand the universe of the film. But I can't blame him for that. Uma Thurman is as big as the bipolar superhero, G-Girl. And I discovered, after several years of dislike for him, that Luke Wilson can be absolutely perfect when he launches himself as a schlub. He gave two of the best comedy shows of 2006 (the other in the almost unpublished Idiocrazia). I am absolutely angry with the expressions on his face when he and Thurman had sex for the first time. It's one of the most fun sex scenes ever. My only real complaint is that they make G-Girl a little too psychic, almost unbelievably. Perhaps with a little background I could have accepted it better. I can forgive his faults, though, because I had a great time watching him. Undervalued, for sure.
