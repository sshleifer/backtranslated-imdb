This is a dramatic film in the true sense of the word. It tells a queue that here in Greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is. Of course, it has extremes ... but sometimes the sadness of real life goes beyond art. It is profoundly critical of the goals we pursue and the entire social structure built around them. The film has a deeper understanding of Greek ways of life, stereotypes and social structure. Unlike most Greek films that have a certain mainstream fast-food audience, this one does not target anyone in particular but as you watch it you feel that someone has put the best words and images to describe your feelings. I'm not a big fan of traditional music, but I wouldn't like to hear anything else when it was played during the movie. <br /> <br /> If someone told me to say something against this movie, I'd call it the following, sometimes the transition between the scenes seemed sudden or a little cut off. I imagine that the editing had to reduce it to fit the 2 hours and a bit for the theaters .. <br /> <br /> However I could write more and more to express my thoughts on this, but I think you should see it and discuss it with a friend. A must see
