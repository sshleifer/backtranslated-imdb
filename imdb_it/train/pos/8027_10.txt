When I saw it for the first time I was really impressed. The director has created such a mysterious atmosphere, especially in the end. Throughout the story, viewers can expect Richard to really kill Thomas or do it sooner. But the main point was not the conflict, but ... FAMILY! Old and mature, he prayed to save the youngest who has all his life for life. It's incredible. I enjoy it every time I look at it! Of course it's pretty violent like any action movie, but I think it's acceptable. Thank you very much Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Incredible movie! I recommend everyone to see it. I'm sure people will not regret it and will really enjoy themselves.
