The words of Vonnegut are the best on paper. The stories he weaves are gossemars, threads of words and silky expressions that are not easily translated into a world of explosions by Marilyn Manson or Jerry Bruckheimer. His words were treated well once, in the remarkable Slaughterhouse-5. <br /> <br /> Mother night is probably one of the three novels written by Vonnegut that I could take on a desert island, along with Slaughterhouse-5 and Bluebeard. <br /> <br /> The film version deserves a 10, but the books are so permanently part of my inner landscape that I just can't do it ... some of the scenes left out of the film are part of my memory ...
