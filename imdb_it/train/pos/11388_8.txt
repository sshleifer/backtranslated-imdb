If I remember, Ira Gershwin, lyricist and brother of George, offered the Gershwin catalog for this film and was picked up by the producers. In many respects, it was a typical 1950s musical of the MGM Freed Unit and directed by Vincente Minelli with a great help from Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> The Gershwins were, of course, among the greatest all the Broadway musical teams but, in my opinion, George himself was among the greatest of all American composers, period !!! Gene Kelly was, of course, one of the two greatest dancers of the music genre in the film (One hypothesis about the other?) And I don't imagine his cast was ever doubted. But I think the rest of the cast needs some explanation: Oscar Levant was a famous personality in his time and, as a friend of George Gershwin, he had to be in this movie. He was a talented pianist and also a moderately talented composer as well as a well-known neurotic and hypochondriac and here, as always, he plays himself. <br /> <br /> Leslie Caron was unknown at this time and she was of the French "gamin" type. A talented dancer, it has never been a real beauty. George Guétary who plays the role of Maurice Chavalier, oops, I mean Henri Baurel, was Greek and not French, but it is certainly more than OK as a French boulevardier, even if a little too young for the part. <br /> <br /> Hoofer's voice of Gene is useful here, but Guétary has the best vocal equipment. Although Gene was a better cast elsewhere, of course, in "Singin 'in the Rain" where his character is much more calculating, even here he sometimes shows himself as a heel (He was, for nothing, interpreted as the original Joey in Pal Joey, the Broadway musical.) I wasn't so enchanted with his "I Got Rhythm" scene with children that it didn't seem as spontaneous as I thought it was. <br /> <br /> I also found the character of Nina Foch Milo rather annoying. <br /> <br /> But the highlight of the film is obviously the long ballet at the end of the film based on the musical title with sets and costumes in the film styles of the great French impressionist painters. <br /> <br /> I found it difficult to believe Gene and Oscar, as artists in difficulty, and I don't think that the musical numbers are as well set as they could be, but, on balance, Gershwin's music is very well served in this film. <br /> <br /> The DVD is well done with clear and clear graphics (when they are supposed and being) and the mono sound is good but a bit superficial.
