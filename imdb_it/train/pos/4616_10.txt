The title of this film is taken from a board game called "Seven Minutes in Heaven". The game was popular with my husband's friends when he was in middle school in Brooklyn, New York, and describes it as something like "Spin-the-Bottle", "Lifesaver Relay" and other kissing preadolescence games. According to the rules, a boy's name and a girl's name would have been drawn, and the elect ordered to enter a dark cupboard together and stay there for seven minutes. Meanwhile, there would have been speculation among the guests of the party about whether the two had the courage to hold hands, hug and / or kiss in the privacy of the closet. At the end of the seven minutes, the game leader would have said "Time expired" or would have knocked on the closet door, and the pair would have come out of the closet. After being questioned by the other guests, the couple should have admitted what they had done during their "Seven Minutes in Heaven". Then other couples would be chosen to enter the closet until all the guests had participated. The couple who admitted to having done more would have been the winner of the game. <br /> <br /> Such games have served as social "icebreakers" for children and adolescents, but they can be embarrassing and intimidating for shy people. The film received this title because it deals with the first experiences of boys with crushing and romantic love.
