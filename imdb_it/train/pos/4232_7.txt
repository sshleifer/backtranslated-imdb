In all my 60 years I have learned that when we watch a movie there is an identification (whether we want it or not) implicit with a specific character. <br /> <br /> Sometimes because the character performs a certain gesture, sometimes because the character speaks a certain word or phrase ?? which we use or would we use ?? in certain situations. <br /> <br /> The film in question should be viewed from this point of view. Who now finds a parking space ?? in a shopping mall, downtown or on the street - taken from a car whose driver can't remember thinking of not being the only pilot in the world? <br /> <br /> Who doesn't have the desire to "rip" the rude spit? <br /> <br /> Haven said I ask you: - Did you identify with DELLA (played by Kim Bassinger)? If your answer is: YES!, Then try not to find absurd details ?? in comparison with the reality of life ?? in the film, because surely you will find the film ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Abstract creations, you will see that the film has moments of surprise, such as: 1- In the sequence in which Della takes the box of tools in the trunk (that box contains a gun, and she has the guts to use it ?); 2- In the sequence in which Terry dies while falling; 3- In the sequence in which Della is attracted to Chuckie's "siren". <br /> <br /> If you have already seen the film, or if you are planning to see, keep in mind that there are "realistic" films, "fiction" films, "political" films and films in which you can "wash the your soul "?? To exemplify the last, we can mention: "Tropa de Elite". <br /> <br /> According to newspapers, there was unanimous applause when BOPE officials assumed certain attitudes. (As I saw the film on DVD, I could not ascertain the reaction of the audience) ?? <br /> <br /> Regarding the direction part (Susan Monford), interpretations (Kim Bassinger, Lukas Haas, Craig Scheffer, etc. Edition (William M. Anderson ?? "Dead Poets Society", "Green Card "?? exceptional edition," Robocop 2 ", etc. It is well placed in context. On a scale of 1 (Awful) to 10 (Master Piece), I rate" When She Was Out "at 7 (Regular).
