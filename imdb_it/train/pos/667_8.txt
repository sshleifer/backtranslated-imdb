Although I have been a Peter Weir fan for a long time, I haven't seen any of his Australian films until I saw The Last Wave. And it was a pleasant, unpredictable surprise. <br /> <br /> Richard Chamberlain plays David, a lawyer invited to defend five aboriginals accused of killing another aboriginal. For David's colleagues it is a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence. But David believes that there is a mystery under the murder, linked to tribal rituals. As his investigation proceeds, he learns not only about his clients but also about himself. <br /> <br /> To reveal more it would be like ruining one of the strangest films I've ever seen. I can only say that this film goes in directions that no one would expect. <br /> <br /> There are many elements that make this film fascinating: Chamberlain's acting, for example; but also the interpretations of David Gulpilil, who plays a young aboriginal who introduces David into tribal mysteries; and Nandjiwarra Amagula, who plays an old aboriginal who is a spiritual guide. The relationships between these three characters are the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> But there is also the way in which Weir suggests the supernatural in the film. David has dreams that warn him of the future. Australia is going through a terrible time, with storms, hailstones falling and even a mysterious black rain that could be nothing but pollution. But it is also linked to the case that David is defending. How it is connected is one of the great revelations of the film. Of the small events Weir manages to create an atmosphere of terror and oppression, suggesting future horrors without showing anything. <br /> <br /> The Charles Wain soundtrack is fantastic, especially the use of the didgeridoo. Photography is also quite good. Russell Boyd, Weir's long-time PS who won an Oscar in 2004 for Master and Commander, paints a dark and creepy world full of mystery. I also find it extraordinary that for a film focused on Aboriginal people, not to turn into an accusation against white culture or into a mawkish celebration of their traditions, like Dances With Wolves or The Last Samurai. This film is too smart to be so simplistic. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it can be frustrating and can upset viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything that makes sense; but for those who don't care about weirdness or ambiguity, The Last Wave is a great movie to watch.
