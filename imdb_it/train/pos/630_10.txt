I didn't expect much from this movie. I was given a ticket for an advanced screening. I had just left work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there didn't seem to be any fresh air flowing through the halls of the theater complex. <br /> <br /> Once you are sitting in the theater, tired and frustrated, the film has started. At first I didn't recognize any of the actors, but the flow of the film was perfect. From the beginning I became consumed by the film, becoming more and more excited with every passing minute. I think this film is meant to be a fantasy / fairy tale classic. The actors were fabulous, the pace was perfect and the ending was magical.
