This movie was a lot of fun, I couldn't stop smiling while watching this and I've seen it twice in a 2 day period! The film is singularly unique in its humor and its graphics, both are fantastic and on the same level as the other (more serious) films of Natali, Cube and Cypher. I have become a big fan of Vincenzo Natali since I saw Cypher and all he has done is very interesting. <br /> <br /> The characters of the music and the "losers" Dave and Andrew, played by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-author of the story), are very nice of this film, both actors I really like. The X-Box Dead Or Alive fights are also fantastic (see even Dave playing Halo in one place) and Andrew's incredible guitar solo, among other things. <br /> <br /> All in all a great well-being film about friendship. You have to see this!
