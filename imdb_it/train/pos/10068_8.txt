This film was excellent. A sad truth about how culture tends to clash with the sexes. This is just a great kind of hot and fuzzy movie. You have the teacher who is steeped in tradition and good heart in his own way, Cagnolino despite being a girl to win his affections and you overcome him with a cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions. This is equal to a great happy movie in the end. This film does a good job of showing how steeped in tradition can be, so immersed that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets. You see the sides of a culture never seen before, which helps to improve the drama that takes place near the end of the image. Cinema photography is excellent, in particular the sequence of parades in the opening with all the cues. Tied to be in conflict Oscar for the best foreign film.
