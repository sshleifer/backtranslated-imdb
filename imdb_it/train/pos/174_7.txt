Sunny, a cocktail waitress in the D.C. area, is a bit dark, to be inserted slightly. He drives an old clunker and rents a small room with a gay male couple. However, it saves the life of an important Arab, taking a bullet in the back that was intended for the official. It fascinates the national press with its bizarre remarks and its sweet appearance. Sniffing an opportunity, the presidential assistants have it installed in the protocol department for the US government. Even then, sometimes he messes things up, but she tries and learns a lot. He also takes the romantic attention of a State Department official. But is there another sinister plot in place, involving an Arab man who wants to take another wife? A blonde? LOL LOL LOL. This film presents Goldie as beautiful as a photo and stupid "like a fox", as they say. Sunny learns very, very well, her way into the jungle of the US government. He also has important things to say about honesty and lack of it in his protocol environment. Perhaps, the Arab community would not be enthusiastic about this job, but for those who like to laugh, rent this today.
