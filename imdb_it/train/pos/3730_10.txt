If you want to watch a movie and feel good watching it, Tigerland is the movie for you. I love this movie from top to bottom. The perfect scenes of this film seem so real; it's almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life but with drama. Guys, I tell you that ... the real drama is actually true "fought" in one of the scenes (the DVD is not obvious to hear the comment). I see this film as a group of desperate young people trying to escape an unfortunate fate, after seeing Saving Private Ryan I have an appreciation of what is an "unfortunate fate" and I know exactly how men feel in the film. I see this film as a cross between "Stand By Me" and "Save Private Ryan". What do men do when they are in a situation that is "difficult" in real life? Some men go crazy, some men cry, some men punch, others do drugs, others accidentally sleep with prostitutes trying ruthlessly to eradicate the meaning of love from their lives, some try to drink pain, some jump off buildings or bridges, some feel guilty and others feel so much pain that it hurts them so much that they collapse - physically. This film has all those desperate emotions rolled into a single ball. But don't get me wrong, it's not a depressing film, it's realistic, it's a very humorous film, the cocoon and funny Bozz (Collin's Character) illuminates everything, and moreover there are about 5 female actresses in the film; I'll show you what's in it! With dialogues, war sequences / action, images of perfect scenes and appropriate music; this film has everything, as I said: from top to bottom. I don't understand why Tigerland is heavily undervalued. The best thing about owning the film is that the cover reads bold "The best film of the year", and it does not fall on anything at all. Keep the rare gems coming to Hollywood, 10/10.
