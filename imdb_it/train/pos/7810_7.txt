How is "Cry Freedom"? It is simply a great and unique experience on the creation of South Africa and how blacks in that country have been repressed by whites. The main character of the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), chief editor of the Daily Dispatch newspaper in South Africa. Woods writes several articles, in which he critically talks about the opinions of Steve Biko (Denzel Washington). Soon Woods meets Biko and changes his opinions about him and also begins to understand what the authorities are doing to blacks in South Africa (even from above, even by the police chief). When Biko dies in police custody, Woods decides he has to write a book about him and that no matter what he should publish it. But Woods has to flee his country to publish that book and he must also put his family in second place, so the world can discover the truth. <br /> <br /> Attenborough was able to make a good film about people, with the main message that black and white are the same, because we are all people. History takes us to South Africa and this (film) is a great way for the whole world to learn what happened in that land and I am disappointed that only 3200 people voted this film. This is a film from which we can all learn something. Although it is a bit long, this story could not be presented in a shorter way because the director wanted to show us how difficult it was for Woods to publish that book after Biko's death. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Woods and Biko has also been shown in a big way, just like the families of these two people and all the problems they are going through. But sometimes you have to make sacrifices (Biko's death) so that the truth can be revealed (Woods book).
