In the classic sense of the four moods (which are not specific to the concept of entertaining or even fun entertainment), Altman's "H.E.A.L.T.H." treats all moods, and actually in very fun and entertaining ways. There is the Phlegm, personified by the very slow, wary and protective character of Lauren Bacall, Esther Brill, whose mission in life seems to depend on appearance, protecting the secrets of her age and her beauty more than her well-being. There is Paul Choleric by Paul Dooley, Dr. Gil Gainey, who, like a fish out of water (perhaps more like a seal) moves frantically, barking and urging the crowds to subscribe to his aquatic madness. The melancholy of Glenda Jackson, Isabella Garnell, smells of anguished and hypocritical Shakespeare's Hamlet - even offering a soliloquy or two. And let's not forget the character of Bile Hammer by Henry Gibson ("The breast that feeds the child rules the world"). Then there are the characters Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett, respectively), relatively sane characters who try to find some kind of balance between all the comrades and extreme moods that came together for H.E.A.L.T.H. - a kind of organization of world trade specialized in H.E.A.L.T.H., which is anything but health. This is Altman at its best classic.
