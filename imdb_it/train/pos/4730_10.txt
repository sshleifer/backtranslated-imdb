The story is about Jet Li who has to fight against his old friends. But there is a problem, friends are super fighters. The film is full of blood, super action and the best stunts forever. And Lau Ching-Wan is a great co-actor. Obviously the film has the typical HK-Fun. But I love it! In Germany "Black Mask" is not cut.
