I didn't expect the powerful "Girlfight" movie experience. It is an Indie; low budget, no famous actors, freshman manager. I had heard that it was good, but not so good. <br /> <br /> Located in a contemporary, ethnic working class Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama has done an extraordinary job of capturing the struggles of urban day-to-day Latinos. Diana, the protagonist, boils with rage and lashes out against her high school peers, getting into trouble with the school and her friends. She is raised by her only father, who seems to love her and her brother, but applies a rigorous double standard, based on sex, on her children. The father's double standard is illustrated by the fact that Tiny, his brother, is taking boxing lessons at the local gym, but Diana is denied similar activities. On a mission to the gym to meet Tiny, Diana is fascinated by boxing. Tiny doesn't like boxing, so he and Diana exchange seats; he gets the money from dad and then gives it to Diana to take the lessons instead. <br /> <br /> This is actually a wellness film, while Diana grows and learns by herself through boxing, meets a guy, and tackles some very serious questions head on. There is no ridicule, 'anything that can fit is fine' resolution to the "Bend It Like Beckham". The reality and the relative personal problems are too big for the pat resolutions, but in my opinion, "Girlfight" is a better and more satisfying film.
