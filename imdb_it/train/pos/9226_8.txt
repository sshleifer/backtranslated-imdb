I had read about FLAVIA THE HERETIC for many years, but I only saw it at the beginning of last year, when I started a crazy film: buying binge food and, for some reason, it has been in my thoughts lately, even if it is Sono several months have passed since I saw it. <br /> <br /> It is a surprising film, set in Italy somewhere in the fifteenth century. It was definitely medieval (although I don't think any specific year is ever given). Being the time of the Christian ascent, the era is a moment of total madness, and the film captures it very well. <br /> <br /> Flavia, our protagonist, is a young woman who meets a Muslim who fell on a battlefield. She looks hot and intriguing, and she is immediately taken with him. His father, a soldier of a family of someone standing, arrives almost immediately and kills the wounded man right in front of his eyes. But she will continue to see it in her dreams. <br /> <br /> His father sends her to a convent that looks more like a madhouse in the open air - the residents, so severely repressed by the intransigent medieval Christianity, slowly go crazy. Flavia is influenced by one of the craziest nuns. But in a crazy world, only healthy people are really crazy and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the madness that surrounds her. His interpretation of the times in which he lives strikes a chord with Flavia, who, being young and apparently protected, begins to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trapped. <br /> <br /> The film is inflexible in its portrayal of that world, showing off a lot of unpleasantness. We see a castrated horse, a gentleman rapes one of the women of his lands in a pigsty, the pious torture of a young nun. Through all this, Flavia observes and questions, refusing, in the end, the Christian dogma that creates a similar parade of horrors in terms that would get some criticism in the film over the years to seem anachronistic. I do not agree with that criticism. Flavia's visions, although sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely reflect, for example, contemporary feminist comments (the film was made in 1974), revolve around very obvious questions. It is, perhaps, difficult to believe that she could be so much a fish out of the water in her time, but this is the kind of minor point that she does not make for joking. Flavia is written in such a way as to allow those of our era, or of any age, to empathize with her condition. Getting bogged down on such an issue would lack the forest for the trees. <br /> <br /> Flavia is heartened when the Muslims arrive, invading the countryside, and finds, in their leader, a new version of the beautiful Islamist who still visits his dreams. Struck by her almost immediately, she allows her to virtually lead her army, become a figure of Joan of Arc in full armor, and direct the invaders to bring down Christian society, and take revenge on all those she has seen committing evil. /> <br /> Are you the announcer of a new and better world? You may think so, but the Muslims of that era were not great even in feminism, as they soon learned in their own way. As they say, meeting the new boss ... <br /> <br /> This is really just a miniature of some of the things that happen in FLAVIA THE HERETIC. The film is rather gloomy and with a rather depressing and rather depressing ending. Not a film for mass audiences, of course. It is quite good, though, and does not belong to the "nunsploitation" stack on which it is often thrown carelessly. I think there is a lot of value in the final film and I'm glad I saw it.
