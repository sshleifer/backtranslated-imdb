I've seen this movie a dozen times and it's fantastic. But the only thing with which he was is that at the beginning, there was too much talk about who came out with whom. I think it would be interesting to do a remake of it. But on the official website, they said they won't do a remake because so many people were saved during the visualization. What happened to Patty Dunning now? She is a pretty good actress. He made many other films in the 70s and 80s, but we haven't heard from him since. I know Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry, works for Accounting at RD Films. But overall, I have to say that the series itself is like Left Behind, old school.
