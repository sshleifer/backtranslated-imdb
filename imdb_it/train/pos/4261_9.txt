I loved this movie. Not just because I'm a big fan of Moritz Bleibtreu, even though it's practically all German films that count. But also because it is NOT the main actor. The main role is occupied by Barnaby Metschurat, who was the only reason to see Julietta in 2001, and who really brings this film on his shoulders. <br /> <br /> A family moves from Italy to Germany in search of the "German dream" (this is my invention and irony ...) of cheap labor in the steel and coal industry . However, they end up opening a restaurant and the journey the film takes up to this point alone is so poetic and at the same time fun and fascinating. From this point on, the story told is mainly that of the two brothers of this family, Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi's dream of becoming a director is threatened by his rivalry with his brother and his mother's determination to return to Italy. What follows is a great - and totally neutral - look at what life can form from the choices you make. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film does not say which life (that of Gigi or Giancarlo) was more successful or fuller or more interesting. It simply offers us a gratifying look at how the search for identity should be when two countries and mentalities are involved. and this gaze is not driven by the bitterness or contempt of either country, which makes it such an exceptional film for all countries that deal with the tensions arising from immigration. The fact that director Fatih Akin was transferred to Germany from Turkey in the 1970s gives this film a great measure of its credibility and emotional accuracy. The icing on the cake is fantastic representations of the whole cast, in particular Metschurat and - I really need to emphasize this - the boy who plays the young Gigi. That child's performance would be a hard act to be followed by virtually anyone! Great movie, go see it.
