I pulled some old musicals out of my garage and that's another favorite of mine. It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli. He won two Academy Awards for Best Film of 1951 and Best Screenplay. The story of an American painter in Paris who tries to make it big. Nina Foch is a sophisticated media lady and is very interested in helping him, but she soon finds that she loves the boy. Meanwhile, Gene Kelly falls in love with the beautiful damsel, Leslie Caron. His main dance partner, and I must say that they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise. Even the famous French singer Georges Guietary sings. So if you like beautiful smooth dances and fun-filled scenes filled with the nimble fingers of Oscar Levant's piano, George Gershwyn's songs will live forever in this colorful gem. 8/10
