79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have never done anything but great movies together. Although this is not one of their best, it is an excellent musical. There are some exceptional musical numbers, good support from Randolph Scott. Two noteworthy appearances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball make the first screen performances memorable. The ball is particularly good and even a blonde. "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the best numbers of the musical duo of all time. Harriet Hilliard, better known as Harriet Nelson of "Ozzie and Harriet" plays the sister of Ginger Roger. The basic plot is quite familiar, but with an exceptional cast, it works. Excellent artistic direction and score.
