I suggested renting this movie to my friend and he forced it since he had already seen the movie and said it was fine. I thought the title was a bit campy because the version of our shop was called "The Fear: Halloween Night". I expected this film to be somehow a Halloween rip-off with a killer wooden guy. But it opened with a good scene and the murderer killed two victims immediately and flashed ahead twenty years later, where his son who had seen him kill the two people (including his mother) and also witnessed his father's suicide is going in a cabin isolated in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend where he tries to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with the spirit of his father. Good enough for a sequel and I've never even seen the first one.
