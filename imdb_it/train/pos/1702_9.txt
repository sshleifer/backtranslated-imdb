If you have trouble dreaming you could give this movie a low rating. But you just have to realize that this film is not made to please everyone, <br /> <br /> only people with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> For those people the film is fantastic! He plays on old science fiction movies and radio programs long gone, most of the witches where they are classified as B. Along the lines of Spaceballs and Airplane 2, you may need to stretch your imagination a little to get the lines, but is worth.
