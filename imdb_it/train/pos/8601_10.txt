My observations: the vampire clothing in the end is charming and wonderful, exotic and fantastic. Jeanette wore it well, and even went with the naive Nelson. The boat crashing into his balcony had done him good. The costume dresses of her female mafia have been designed surprisingly well, especially by today's standards. 1942 costume designer did a great job. The main theme of the song is enchanting. <br /> <br /> Beware of negative posters: 1942 was the period of World War II; Pearl Harbor happened a year earlier. United States just emerged from the Great Depression; need to go out and spend that hard-earned money on the diversion of singing, dancing and yes, fantastic fantasy. The despotic dictators tried to exclude freedom in RL, eliminating the freedoms. Thankfully, the public had these fantastic plot films available. Going to the movies was a privileged treatment, in those depressing times. When you, the negative posters, become actors or even movie stars, then you have room to talk and criticize. Jeanette and Nelson's films have stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Wonderful angel wings, on the real angel. The wings of RL at the costume party are not so hot, but magnificent on Jeanette considering the SL. <br /> <br /> Beautiful songs by Jeanette and Nelson, as always. Jeanette's dance was a real pleasure. <br /> <br /> 15/10
