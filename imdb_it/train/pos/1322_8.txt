What a fascinating film. Although it was not based on real life, Forbidden Lies was a fascinating portrait of a scammer in his element. And it is the kind of cinema psychology that students can study to learn compulsive liars. <br /> <br /> The author of Forbidden Love, Norma, was revealed as a fraud in the media, but this move really gives her ample opportunity to delete her name. <br /> <br /> But the twists and turns that make the documentarist are incredible. What a patient woman! I loved this movie. I did not read the book but I simply listened to good reviews and went to see it on the boring rainy afternoon. The journey in which this film takes you is intelligent, interesting and totally compelling.
