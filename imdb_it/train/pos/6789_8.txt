Legend of Dragoon is one of those little-known games that people love or hate. Some people claim that it is too similar to other games, namely the Final Fantasy series - which is understandable, since it was originally supposed to be the Sony equivalent of Final Fantasy. I honestly cannot comment on the similarities beyond this, since I am not very familiar with FF games. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite aspect of the game is the battle system. Not only do you have the ability to turn yourself into a more powerful dragon shape, but every time you attack, you have to be careful to complete the attack by pressing the buttons at the right time. Not only that, sometimes enemies will attack you in the middle of a sequence, which means you have to press several buttons to avoid taking damage. Even the use of certain attachment elements requires a little crushing of the buttons. If you don't want to attack, you can always protect yourself, which not only reduces the damage you take in half, but increases your life points without the use of healing potions. <br /> <br /> The FMVs are pretty good - done, about the same quality as Final Fantasy 8's. However, the graphics during the game are not quite up to standard. They are friendly, but could have been - and honestly, should have been - better. Even the translation leaves something to be desired. Not only does it raise interesting questions about character relationships, but there are also some grammatical errors that simply should not have been allowed to pass. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found interesting is that you lose characters from the main party - one dies and the other practically becomes useless at the party and leaves. While the death of a character is often declared meaningless, it immediately makes you understand that the characters, while the heroes, are still as mortal as the next person. People who replace lost characters simply earn all their stats, so the game of transition is pretty fluid. Perhaps my only complaint about the characters is the protagonist's love interest, Shana. It is the epitome of the defenseless woman who needs to be saved, pathetic to the point of pushing a player to scream in frustration. While you can use it in your party, it's insanely weak - I don't even know what its dragon powers are, because I don't hate it so much that I never used it. The character Rose, by contrast, is probably my favorite female character in any game of all time. It's not disgusting, and part of its dragon magic is extremely useful. Meru is also quite strong, while at times he is an annoying loquacious brat. <br /> <br /> The character designers were, like many, inclined to make the female characters look beautiful or similar, and they didn't think much about the real usefulness of the clothes. Seriously, no armor and most exposed skin is not useful when fighting monsters. But I will give them props, since they have women who serve as knights in various countries. <br /> <br /> I can't comment much on the plot, because honestly I didn't pay much attention to it over where I had to go to the next one. I'm not sure this says anything about the plot itself, or my style of play. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very fun game. It has its flaws, but for me it struck the right balance of having to think and simply push buttons and kill monsters.
