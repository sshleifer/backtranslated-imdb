I was very happy to go and see a "Milanese" film shot in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who has understood Milanese philosophy and fortunately printed it in a film. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a standard-career couple from Milan, starting from "birth" to Death. The marriage of birth is so typical of every scheme that it becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a flash story of how the couple met and felt in love. Life is hard in the "urbe" of Milan and after the sweet old times it has become harder and harder, then finally the product: a child, who instead of further strengthening the couple relationship weakens because "the egoistic effect" typical of a day "metropolis" personality. The advertising environment with all the "creatives" under the stressful atmosphere helps to be well involved in the plot. We are losing the values ​​of life and this is reflected well and deeply in this beautiful and clear film by the director of Senza Pelle. <br /> <br /> The actors are well chosen, Stefania Rocca is pretty and well characterized, and a positive surprise, an unexpected good Fabio Volo, well known from the TV series "trash": Le Iene. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
