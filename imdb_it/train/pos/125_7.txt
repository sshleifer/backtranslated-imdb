Lars Von Trier is never behind in trying new techniques. Some of them are very original while others are better forgotten. <br /> <br /> Describes post-war Germany as a nightmare train journey. With so many ruined cities, Leo Kessler, a young American of German descent, feels obligated to help with their restoration. It is not a simple task as it soon finds out. <br /> <br /> His uncle finds work as a night conductor on the Zentropa railway line. His job is to meet the needs of passengers. When the shoes are polished, a chalk mark is made on the soles. A terrible argument occurs when a passenger's shoes are not chalked, despite having been polished. There are many allusions to the German fanaticism of adhering to such stupid details. <br /> <br /> Traveling by train is like an allegory that represents the procession of man through life with all his trials and tribulations. In a sequence, Leo rushes through the rear carriages to find them full of half-starved bodies that appear to have just escaped from Auschwitz. These images, as horrible as they are, are as fleeting as in a dream, each with its terrible impact but without connection. <br /> <br /> In a station called Urmitz Leo jumps from the train with a parcel bomb. In view of many pedigrees, he connects the bomb to the lower part of a carriage. Go back to your cabin and connect with a clock. Later he jumps off the train (at high speed) and lies in the fresh grass on a river bank. Looking at the stars above, he decides that his job is to build and not destroy. Later, as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge, he runs at breakneck speed to get on the train and stop the clock. If you are interested in analyzing the situation, it is a completely impossible task. Quite ridiculous indeed. It could only happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> It is strange how they remember small details like a row of cups hanging from hooks and flapping away with the swaying of the train. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed, I prefer later films by Lars Von Trier (Breaking the Waves and The Idiots). The bomb scene described above really discouraged me. Maybe I'm a realist.
