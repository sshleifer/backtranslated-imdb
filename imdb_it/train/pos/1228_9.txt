This 1991 NBC-TV movie aired six months before John Goodman's big-screen version of Babe Ruth's life came out. For my money, there is no comparison between the two. Television production is not perfect but presents the story of Babe with greater depth and complexity than Goodman's one-dimensional narrative. I particularly appreciated the description of the film of the complex love-hate relationship that Ruth had with the Yankee manager Miller Huggins, who always understood the genius of his actor and kept trying to indicate why the flaws in Ruth's character they would never let him become a manager or leader of the players. The TV movie rightly notes how Ruth never realized her dream of handling the Yankees because of her flaws, while Goodman's horrible version tries to push the falsity that Ruth was denied what should have been her for the taking. <br /> <br /> This film is a great complement to "Eight Men Out" as the story begins with Ruth's arrival in New York in 1920, a year after the Black Sox scandal and when his exploit at home he literally saved baseball from ruin. In fact, the continuity between the two films is even accentuated with John Anderson taking up his role as "Eight Men Out" as commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.
