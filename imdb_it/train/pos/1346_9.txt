As a "rebuttle" of sorts to the 100 best AFI films, the British Film Institute has produced a documentary with Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> Now. I'm a big movie fan and I'm proud to have seen many, many movies. But, now I'm embarrassed with my idol. In this fantastic (albeit long) documentary, Scorsese accompanies the viewer through different stages of American film history. This is divided into several sections including the Western movie, the movie Gangster and the Noir. Full of enthusiasm, Martin Scorsese is a great tour guide and a fantastic professor.
