This film was nominated for best film but lost in Casablanca but Paul Lukas beat Humphrey Bogart as best actor. I don't see why Lucile Watson was named as the best supporting actor, I don't think he did a great job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three children leave Mexico and arrive in the United States in the first scene of the film. They are going by train to the home of Davis's relatives. Davis and Lukas were underground to stop the Nazis, so they are very tired and need rest. But when they get home, theirs is a Nazi who lives there and they can't do much about it. It turns out that the Nazi only cares about money and is willing to conclude an agreement with Lukas. Theirs is more to the plot, but you can find out for yourself.
