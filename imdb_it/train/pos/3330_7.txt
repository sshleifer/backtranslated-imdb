I wasn't just an extra in this movie, I saw it in Boston for a sold out cinema. Over a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelly fans stuck in a movie theater near Boston Common to watch a comedy .... about them ... Red Sox fanatics! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon's star is a nice comedy about love and lust. Love is between the two young lovers. Lust is for the Red Sox who win the world series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for the role. It's fun enough and gets the most out of laughter. Barrymore on the other hand is the same old Barrymore. At times, I felt in support of the actress Ione Skye would have been a better actor for the role. All in all, all Boston Red Sox fans will love this movie. For the rest of the world, this is just a fun movie.
