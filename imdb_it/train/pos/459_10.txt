This is the best series of its kind I've seen all year. I can't help but think it's just my luck: a series that I love has 6 episodes (and more next year) and the constant stream of cookie cutter cop shows has endless episodes. <br /> <br /> I think the reasons why New Tricks are successful are many. The scripts are good, and the mix of superb characters, Acting is the best, and the mixture of comedy and drama is a blessing. The stories are not that memorable, but that's not why I watch shows like this. <br /> <br /> The acronym is a favorite, and we were disappointed to find that it is not available in any published edition. Great things, BBC - a triumph of meaning over the appeal of sex (apart from the young policeman, nobody is there as an illusionist, and even if he were, he can still act!).
