This is one of the most superficial episodes where the plot really seemed like an excuse to have fun. BUT, I appreciated this carefree approach and this is really one of the best episodes to see on a purely entertaining level. Think about it: the crew members have meetings with the white rabbit and Alice from Wonderland, a Bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, a horseman knight who kills McCoy and a series of other seemingly bizarre events that simply don't make sense until at the end. Despite all the danger, you can't take everything very seriously - it's just too much fun and the whole episode seems very surreal. So, on a purely non-aesthetic level, it's a great thing.
