I don't know which movie some of these people are watching, but they must have seen a different "Joseph Smith: Prophet of the Restoration" than what I saw. <br /> <br /> I think the film was well done and inspiring. I think it's worth looking at. It is clear from the outset that much attention has been paid to the making of this film. The background scenery is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I think the film does a good job in portraying Joseph Smith both as a man and as a prophet. Joseph's spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and reverence. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend watching this movie.
