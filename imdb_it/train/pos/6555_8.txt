I have read more than 100 Nancy Drew books and, if you are not yet bright enough to know, Nancy Drew was a film by a YOUNG Nancy Drew, not the eighteen year old who doesn't go to school that all the books are about. This was when she was sixteen. So, of course, it wouldn't have been as smart as that of the book, considering it's only the tenth year. Besides that, I thought the movie was very nice. It was clean and appropriate for everyone. Sometimes it was fun. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. She was articulate, of character and pretty. I liked the embarrassment that Nancy and Ned surrounded each other because obviously they weren't old enough to have a serious relationship like in books. It was a nice movie, PG, which I appreciated very much because I, unlike most of my age, enjoy films without sex, drugs or bad words.
