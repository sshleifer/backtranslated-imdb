Gerard Phillipe is absolutely perfect in this film, funny, tender, brave and loving. It gives a higher dimension to a film that is also a masterpiece, both from the other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou !!) as from history or rhythm. Never bored, always creating new emotions: for me, the best French film of all time.
