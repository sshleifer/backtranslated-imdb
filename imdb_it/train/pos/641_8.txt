This show has some clich√©s and some exaggerated moments, like those of Dawson's Creek (a sixteen year old who talks about a comeback when life made sense?), But overall it looks like a decent show. Most of the characters seem very real, and the story seemed to move well in the pilot - ending with a good lesson at the end. I just hope that every episode is not life altering like the first, it would simply be too dramatic for this vehicle. Jeremy Sumpter does a great job as a teenager with a passion for baseball, I think many of us might be concerned with his awe and sometimes the tunnel vision for the team he always wanted to be a part of.
