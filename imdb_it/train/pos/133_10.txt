Some years ago, a friend received a video with a film by Michael Mann about the film "Heat". After we finished that movie, and we were about to get up, we saw that there was another movie right after, hard on the cassette envelope that the owner didn't write. Yet we were all glued to our seats for his distinct opening, which lacked credits. <br /> <br /> A few hours later, I sat there wondering: how could I have never heard of this masterpiece? . <br /> <br /> This film was Europe. Lars von Trier has awakened film noir from dead reality, deconstructed with intentionally obvious sets, but often there was a disturbing resemblance to the post-war German photographs I saw. And then the delicate cuts! <br /> <br /> History itself is a moral odyssey that is difficult to take that has no happy ending. A young American pacifist of German origin arrives in post-war Germany, intent on doing something good to pay for the bombs that his compatriots have dropped. But above all it meets distrust and self-destructive challenge. Rent with Zentropa, a sleeper-catering company (modeled on Mitropa), whose owner is one of the Nazi collaborators of the occupant painters. Our hero falls in love with his daughter, who later turns out to be a member of the werewolf, the post-war Nazi terrorists. When he no longer understands the world (or only Europeans), in his anger he blows up a railway bridge under a train he has just saved. <br /> <br /> As a final note, for historical correctness: in the real world, the werewolf was not as important as the film suggests, they were mostly a final Nazi coup. After an SS unit murdered the eldest of the occupied allies of Aachen, two months before the capitulation, the Nazis announced the creation of legions of saboteurs and terrorists ready to fight behind the scenes, the werewolf. But only a few hundred Hitler youths have received some training, and while two or three times some have been deployed to assassinate suspected communists or foreign forced laborers in Bavarian villages to impress a lasting fear on the inhabitants, with Hitler's death and end of the war everything collapsed. <br /> <br /> However, Werewolf propaganda has had a profound effect on the occupants. They feared the werewolf everywhere, they suspected behind any serious accident - but without exception another cause was found later (ignored by some recent pseudo-historians). For example, when a gas pipeline exploded in the bombed Bremen police headquarters, or when the Soviet military commander died in a motorcycle accident in Berlin. The effect was stronger on the Soviets, who arrested tens of thousands (mostly children!) "Preventively" on charges of being werewolves and closed them in prison camps where many of them died.
