I really enjoyed this movie, but it's not new. <br /> <br /> Everyone here is grouping it with other war movies, this movie has been classified incorrectly! It's not a war movie more than "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is a kindergarten movie or "Cool Hand Luke" is a captivity movie. This is a film about individuality, non-compliance, self-confidence and the costs of that kind of personality. <br /> <br /> The plot is the same as "Someone flew over Cuckoos' nest" and "Cool Hand Luke", his in good company, and holds his. These films should be set against and compared, not with "Apocalypse Now" or "Platoon". <br /> <br /> Eric
