This was a very daring film for his day. It could also be described as soft-core porn for the age of silence. It was a talkie, but the dialogue was extremely limited and in German. One didn't need it anyway. <br /> <br /> The young (19) Hedy Lamarr is trapped in a loveless marriage with an obsessive (stereotype?) German and after a short time in a marriage that apparently has never been consummated, returns home to her father. <br /> <br /> In a famous and amusing scene, he decides to go and get a small skinny one morning when his horse is distracted by another. She is then forced to run through a field chasing him, leaving her clothes on the horse. An engineer retrieves his horse and returns his clothes - after observing it. <br /> <br /> They sit for a while and, in a zen moment, present her with a flower with a bee sitting on top. It is here that he thinks about his honeymoon and the actions of her husband and an insect. You know this man is different. <br /> <br /> Go home and eventually look for our young man and find the ecstasy that was denied. You can use your image here, but his head disappears from view and we see it writhing with pleasure. Since it has never been undressed, you can imagine ... Of course, a tribute to the women of director Gustav Machat√Ω, and a shock to the public of 1933. <br /> <br /> The only thing that marks this beautiful film is the excessive sense of guilt and a strange ending.
