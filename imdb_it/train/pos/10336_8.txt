This is hard to look at - as a previous reviewer says. This is surprising considering the terrible films that came out immediately after the Second World War, in particular the "liberation" of Dachau. It is clear that, starting in the middle of the war, we knew exactly what was happening to the Jews. The sequence showing a "transport" is vivid, almost as if it were based on a real newsreel (the Nazis loved to record their atrocities). Knox as a Nazi is brilliant. Plan the course of a Nazi career. This figure is particularly significant when it is in contrast with the reactions of other Germans, first laughing at Hitler, then in disbelief and finally defenseless. This contrast, however, allows us to believe in the "conversion" of a young Nazi officer to an anti-Nazi position. This happened, as evidenced by the numerous attempts against Hitler, in particular Staffenberg's plot that took place while this film was being released. A strong film, which effectively uses flashbacks, with an accurate prediction of the traces of Nuremberg and others that would have occurred at the end of the war.
