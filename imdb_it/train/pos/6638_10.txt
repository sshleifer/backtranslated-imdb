The attraction of ancient films like this is that you can see a real moving image of life over 100 years ago. Here are a lot of people who leave a factory, all of them dead and none of them even remotely aware of the greatness of the invention they are walking before. I was shocked to read that a critic calls this film boring as home video today, and at least one other mistakenly identified it as the first film ever made (it was the first movie made at 16 frames per second, rather than the later -normal 46 frames per second). <br /> <br /> Of course, all you see are a lot of people coming out of a building and passing in front of the cinema as they return home from work, but this is a piece of curiosity for dozens of reasons, not least which was the first film made by the Lumi√®re brothers, which probably had a stronger impact on the development of cinema than any other individual or group of people in history.
