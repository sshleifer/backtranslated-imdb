The film's novel, which is also its main theme, is good and well presented. However, the context of the love story is too lyrical, graphic and unrealistic. Even worse, the psychology of the main character is strange and incomprehensible, just like the end of the film. Don't hesitate to watch this movie if it has caught your interest, but don't expect too much.
