I've never commented on a movie before. I saw this movie with my girlfriend last night. I've read comments that say this movie stays with you. It does. Almost 24 hours have passed and I am still completely impressed. This film left me in question alone. How can I compare myself with a character like Ben who is totally selfless. I loved this movie. I love movies that make me guess and wonder until the end. I mainly feel two emotions, happiness and sadness. An incredible film, beautiful and also very sad. I wanted Ben and Emily to be together, but in the end they were, forever. If you haven't seen this movie, take it and watch it. Make sure you don't get distracted. You will want to see every nuance in this image. One for my library.
