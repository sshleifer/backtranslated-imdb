Nice story. Good script Good casting Good acting Good direction Good art direction. Good photography Nice sound. Good change Well everything. Put it all together and finish with good entertainment. <br /> <br /> The shame is that there are not enough films of this caliber these days. We might consider ourselves fortunate that writers / directors like John Hughes are occasionally able to make their creative voices heard. <br /> <br /> Whenever I notice that I'm watching a movie for the third or fourth time and still find it completely satisfying I have to conclude that something about that movie is right.
