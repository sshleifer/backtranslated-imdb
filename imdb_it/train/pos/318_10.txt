This is without doubt the greatest film ever made. It is almost incomprehensible even with many repeated views in an attempt to understand what exactly is happening. The film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers, commercials, contests that were sent by post and a series of other innovations. Also, what other films have cameos by Martin Luther King, Jr? To decipher the film, hunt down the directorial book entitled I Was Curious. It will become clear. It is a great and daring experiment in improvised recursive direction. A triumph. Now, if only somebody published a version with subtitles in a * different * color than white ... white subtitles tend to fade and become invisible.
