I love this movie very much I watch it again and again. I don't see why anyone would think this movie is not good. Maybe you've seen better or whatever it is, I personally love it. It's one of my favorite movies and I'm not at all Hindi but I love it. It might be a bit like "Pretty Woman" but I haven't seen it and I don't think it's better than that. I don't know why they're all hunting but maybe you have a good reason but I think I said it enough but I love this movie, and for those who say it's not good at all then I wonder why you watched and which movies you consider good. As for all the others I've watched with them, they liked it that way too, so it surprises me that many people don't like it. As for Rani Mukherjee (I think that's how her surname is written) she is very beautiful and my favorite actress ever!
