Despite being told from a British perspective, this is the best documentary of the Second World War ever produced. Presented in a digestible way (however digestible the war may be), episodes such as the grave voice of Laurence Olivier connects the multitudes of eyewitnesses who were forced to experience the events of that horrible time. Looking forward to his appearance on DVD in the United States, Europeans had their chance with a DVD version earlier this year.
