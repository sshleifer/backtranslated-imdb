Contrary to popular belief, this title, at least for me, is not so bad. Indeed. I consider it a favorite movie of all time. The welding of stories has not been structured too well if we consider the differences between the series, however, despite all this, it is possible to see it quite happily. For a feature film of his time, the scenes are well proportioned and the characters remain constantly credible. <br /> <br /> The audio / audio track is my favorite. Almost everything has a proper sound effect and many of the voices fit the characters much better than their US counterparts, now poorly interpreted. Synchronization is perfect in every shot. I had some problems with casting for "alien" voices (please forgive the raw name, I haven't seen it for a while). Otherwise, however, the cast seemed perfectly balanced. I feel and believe in the characters of this film. Duplications are often a topic I have rarely agreed on for a long time. I love OSDs back then, but castings often let the series go. <br /> <br /> At this point I would like to add that this was one of the first souls I saw in my life. It has historical value for me, but even after seeing the original Megazone 23 it remained stronger and more seen in my collection. As far as I know, the title did it only in the United States in Texas. Personally I think it's a great pity. If the correct audience had been subjected to it, I think Robotech the film would have been accepted and not tarnished over the years. I'm involved in souls every day of my life and everyone I showed this movie thought was a well-combined title. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie after its separate components will allow the viewer to notice the obvious hole pattern between the shows. However, without seeing the originals, a viewer would not really notice. Since the animation is identical in style, there was no reason to question it in his day. The UK has had very limited access to souls. Laser disks were the most productive media. Personally, I like the way Carl had the balls to push at least the genre. I mean, Harmony is not going to put money on the series to advertise. <br /> <br /> Despite the few picky flaws that people have had with this film, the feeling of the 80s makes me fall in love. If you look at Megazone 23 now, at its original Japanese audio, or at the new dub, I think you'll be deeply disappointed with the OSD. Recall your mind to the original soundtrack of Bubblegum Crisis Dub and imagine the new sound of the 80s on E.V.E. <br /> <br /> Saying all this. The popularity of this film today is probably due to its rarity on the open market. Personally, he created a collection for me. I'm sifting through the world for the merchandise from the three components who invented it and if I ever met Carl Macek, I'd shake his hand with the effort, and buy him a pint or crate for bringing me in souls.
