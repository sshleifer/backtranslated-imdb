Greetings from this Portuguese guy :) <br /> <br /> I think the Sopranos are one of the best productions ever, it has a reality and a fiction mixed in such a way that it's hard to see the difference. It has the same quality as GodFather! James Gandolfini adapts to the paper like a glove! I wish the Sopranos would never end. It's perfect! It should be a topic at school :) I saw the sopranos when I was a kid, but I was too young to wake up until the end of the episode, so now I've bought all the episodes in DVD format and I'm watching all the episodes at home before and after dinner and I'm getting addicted, like I did with Prison Break. In my opinion, Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best series ever made for television. The subject of both is splendid and the actors are perfect. Congratulations on this job. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for my English. Thanks for reading.
