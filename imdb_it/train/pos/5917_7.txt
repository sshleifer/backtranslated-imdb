Streetfight (aka Coonskin) is a truly unique film directed by animation pioneer Ralph Bakshi. It's a strange thing about cinema and it's really worth seeing. It's a live action mix with an animation, apparently influenced by Disney's legendary Song of the South, almost like it's a response to that movie. Philip Michael Thomas, who will later become Don Johnson's companion in Miami Vice, and Scatman Crothers, most famous for his role in Kubrick's The Shining, are prison fugitives. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, that Barry White) are friends of Thomas and intend to help him escape from prison. They are stuck at a police checkpoint, and Crothers tells Thomas a story about a black rabbit, a bear and a fox moving from south to Harlem to find a more peaceful existence. The plot is lively and offers many wonderful things to see. Like all Bakshi films, most will be annoyed and will not like animation. True animation lovers will forgive his clunkiness and fall in love with his inventiveness. The film is very violent, very sexual, and mainly concerns battles between races. For a long time I thought I was watching something extremely important, but after a while, especially after I finished watching it, it started to look more like a classic blackploitation movie, along the lines of Superfly. He is very sloppy and actually says nothing. Also, isn't Bakshi white? Whatever the answer to this question, Coonskin / Streetfight still deserves much attention to animation enthusiasts and cult film fans. 7/10.
