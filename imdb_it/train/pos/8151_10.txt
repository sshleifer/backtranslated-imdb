I saw it in an elegant cinema where the public is usually white, polite and urban. The projection I attended had a sprinkling of African-Americans, and made the difference in the reaction of the public between the two groups, a wonderful social commentary on the state of race relations in this country. Basically, whites were AFRAID to laugh or nervously laugh at funny bits - and there are many! - because they would be "laughing at blacks", while blacks remained quite silent because many could not laugh in front of whites. <br /> <br /> I, on the other hand, being an Asian (and therefore not a member of either group), I really enjoyed seeing this satire of rap culture and its ego / trappings / values ​​/ pseudo -filosofie. The cast is talented and does a great job becoming the characters portrayed. The songs are too funny to be believed. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best pseudo-documentaries to come, including "A Mighty Wind"
