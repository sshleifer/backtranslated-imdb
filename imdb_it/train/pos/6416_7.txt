Men of Honor plays Cuba Gooding Jr., like the true sailor Navy Diver Carl Brashear who challenged a man's Navy to become the first African American in the Navy. Sometimes at his side and sometimes his opponent was a man that Carl Brashear really admired. His name was Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro). Sunday in many ways pushed, aggravated and helped Carl become the man he wanted to be. <br /> <br /> I loved Cuba in this movie. His portrait here is liberating and powerful as Denzel Washington was in The Hurricane. Through each scene we can see his passion, motivation and stubbornness to realize his dream. We can see the struggle within him as he embarks to make his father proud. I also loved the way the director created and brought a lot of tension into some of the main underwater scenes. Brashear's encounter with a submarine on a rescue mission is intense and brilliant. <br /> <br /> The only fault I could see should be in the supporting cast. The characters of Cuba and DeNiro are very intricate and exciting to watch. Which makes you a little sad when they have to fight with such two-dimensional support characters. The evil Lt. Cmdr. Hanks, his Sunday wife (Charlize Theron), the eccentric colonel of the diving school (Hal Holbrook) and the love interest of Cuba are the characters I found not very thorough. What could have made these characters more substantial and more effective was a little more time to develop them. Why was that colonel always in his tower? Why was Sunday's wife so bitter and always drunk? <br /> <br /> Another curious question must be this. What happened to Carl Brashear's wedding? I mean, if this film tells the story of this man's life, wouldn't his marriage be an important event? Maybe it's just me. Men of Honor, however, is a perfect example of the triumph and faith that the human spirit envelops. This film will inspire and make you feel for this man's fight. I think it was the reason this powerful story was told. My hat comes to you, Carl Brashear. I really admire your strength. <br /> <br />
