Bruce Almighty is Jim Carrey's best work from The Truman Show and it was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent "Hey Hollywood - see how much I can do well!" disappointments at the box office. It's nice to see that Jim recognizes and embraces his strengths. He will not get an Oscar but the film itself will last longer than many of the Academy's "award-winning films". It is at the top of its shape in this latest film - it's like the return of an old friend. <br /> <br /> Carrey, Freeman and Aniston all do a great job together - comfortable in their comic roles, a superb comic moment, and of course having fun together but without the comedy "hey mom - look how fun I am". A real surprise was Steven Carrell in the role of Carrey's nemesis (The Daily Show Carrell), who walked away with some of the best and funniest scenes in the film. I laughed louder at Carell than anyone else in the last three years. <br /> <br /> I can foresee that religious nuns in the United States will be the most considerate in the treatment of God, but the bottom line of the film is true for all the most important theological beliefs - we are masses of protoplasmas that seek to overcome our short lives by exercising our free will. Without getting married with the children to complain about, this will probably become a target for people with misplaced priorities (who know the types - men adorned with gold watches on Sunday mornings and television almost late, who sell prayers to God). And, once again, about 0.5% of the country will worry and 80% of the media will report it. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: this is a purely entertaining film, each member of the audience wondering laughing what they would do, and a feeling of well-being at the conclusion of the film. A walk along one of the main roads in America must confirm that God has a tremendous sense of humor. What better comic genius to remind us of Jim Carry's. <br /> <br /> Thanks again, Jim, it's GREAT to have you back !!
