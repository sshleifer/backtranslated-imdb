I've seen Mystery Men blow off a bit in the press and with the general public (for example, take the imdb vote), but my general feeling is that Mystery Men is more fun than most movies, much more witty than comedy movies and very almost 'intelligent'. <br /> <br /> The cast is superb; Greg Kinnear is excellent, as are Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. Kinnear's limousine scene with Ricky Jay is the perfect "flawed movie star" and imbues his character with the right balance between quality and realism of comics to make it work. <br /> <br /> I admit that the rhythm is a bit off in some places, and the images are certainly very flash, perhaps at the expense of a further characterization, but in the end, this is a film of high level: these are the little "What's Up Tiger Lily" moments? - and there are so many greats in this film to deserve repeated viewing.
