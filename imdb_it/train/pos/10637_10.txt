Harem Suare is the best film I saw in 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Harem Suare is a bold and sensational film, sensitively interpreted and staggeredly interpreted, which addresses interracial romanticism, which is such a taboo in Hollywood. Women of all shapes, sizes and colors populate the film. Cut off from the outside world, women entertain each other by telling stories of intrigue, rivalry and jealousy among their ranks.
