This independent film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swimming course in Connecticut. The plot is rather thin. What drives the film are the characters, interpreted in an excellent way by mostly unknown actors. The cast actors are Brewster as a high school teacher who has marital problems and Weixler as a casino trader who works as a stripper. The two actresses offer natural performance and work well together. This is an impressive film debut for screenwriter Schechter and director Setton. The latter keeps the narration moving at a quick clip. The title and the poster of the film suggest something vulgar, but this is a wonderful dramatic comedy.
