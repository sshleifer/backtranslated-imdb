This film is a wonderfully simplistic work. Pleasant from beginning to end it is at the same time sad but at the same time uplifting. The performances of Miranda Otto (oh, as it deserves more recognition!) And George of the Hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to watch, while the two tortured souls understand each other. The supporting cast of the Dead Letter Office workers are wonderful parts in themselves, as is Alice's long-term boyfriend, who I couldn't help but feel a little sorry for. There is one scene in particular that I could watch over and over again (and I have!), It is a pity that films like these are not recognized, and therefore bring them closer to public opinion for more people to have fun. I cried, I laughed and sighed. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
