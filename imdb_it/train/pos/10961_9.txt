One of the best love stories I've ever seen. It's a bit like watching a train slowed down, but still beautiful ...

"The initial explanation of Little Edie's costume promises only that the film will live forever, as well as Big Edie" The World Famous Singer "and Little Edie" The World Famous Dancer. "
