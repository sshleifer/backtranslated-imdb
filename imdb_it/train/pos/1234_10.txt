I grew up watching this movie, and I still love it today when I was a child. Don't listen to critical reviews. They are not accurate in this film. Eddie Murphy really shines in his role. You can sit with all your family and everyone will appreciate it. I recommend this film to everyone. It's a comedy with a touch of fantasy. With demons, dragons and a bald kid with divine powers. This film takes you from LA to Tibet, in the extraordinary sight of the wonderful Tibetan mountain temples. a beautiful view! So do yourself a favor and take this! You will not regret!
