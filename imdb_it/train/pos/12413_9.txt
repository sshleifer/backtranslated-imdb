Story of a prisoner who was unjustly executed persecuting the prison where he was electrocuted and killing prisoners at random while waiting to take revenge on the man who set him up. <br /> <br /> Viggo Mortensen is great and the acting is pretty good. Lane Smith is deliciously wicked as the guilty guardian. Moreover, this film has some great strength, including the death by mummification of barbed wire.
