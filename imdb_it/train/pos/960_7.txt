This is a film that contains many things that only the Japanese can understand. Even well translated, there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism. My guess is that he tried to send a message of some sort, but that was wasted on me. <br /> <br /> What I've heard is that it's basically a mediocre movie with nice special effects. Some children become "That" and in the end it has almost no relevance for a yokai war that in any case makes absolutely no sense. It would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between the Azumi bean that washes the yokai and what looks like a big umbrella with a tongue (Rihanna eats your heart!) I couldn't really discern the plot. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: beautiful graphics, the child screams a lot, the princess of the river is terribly pretty and the rest is crap.
