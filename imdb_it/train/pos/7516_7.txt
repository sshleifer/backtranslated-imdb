The first two thirds of this biopic of the Betty Page fetish model are very interesting. Betty, played with enormous sincerity by Gretchen Mol, looks like a nice girl next door, who saw nothing wrong with what she did (and there was certainly nothing wrong with that). Director Mary Harron, who also made "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho", recreates Betty's America by mixing old black and white movies with new black and white movies. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, color is introduced. Betty's notoriety was mainly the result of his work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a great performance, and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes in which Harron recreates Betty's photo bondage sessions are fascinating and cleverly executed. The first suppliers of fetish material are not too condescending portraits and we have the feeling that these people were part of a restricted "community". Betty has never had too many problems with her reputation, even though we have the impression that her reputation has prevented her from obtaining legitimacy in the world of acting. Since the third act of the film is practically non-existent, we have the impression that we witnessed a documentary on Betty Page rather than a structured drama. Defects aside, it is a film that is worth capturing and represents another highlight of the producer Christine Vachon.
