I settled in to watch "Read My Lips", a plate of Freedom Fries before me. The food was immediately forgotten while I was absorbed by the original and superb thriller of the director and co-writer Jacques Audiard. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is a secretary of a company that develops large construction projects. He actually has some significant responsibilities that often do not fall within the secretaries and is capable and ambitious. It is hampered by a male hierarchy that will exploit but will not reward it. <br /> <br /> Work accumulates faster than I can bear it, Carla is told to hire a secretary. Join the ex-convict and the general layabout Paul (Vincent Cassel). He lies about his abilities and in fact has nothing that any legitimate business can ask for. After an initial serious misunderstanding by Paul about Carla's interest in him, the two become allies. An extravagant friendship begins. In a feat that would have made Carla a real competitor in "The Apprentice", she overcomes her egotistic male adversary at work with Paul's connivance. Exit from your rival. <br /> <br /> Carla is practically deaf without her hearing aid. With it you hear almost normally. Turn off the hearing aid to isolate yourself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people. She is very lonely too. A heroic effort has been made to make it seem simple but it is really beautiful. You don't have a boyfriend. She babysits so that a friend can have a connection (it's a French movie) Worse and humiliating, she accepts a girlfriend's request that she goes around somewhere while that married friend is having fun with her lover in Carla's bed. Not beautiful. <br /> <br /> While Carla and Paul know each other better, the slightly repressed side of the not-so-old criminal emerges. There is a side story, among other things, of Paul's relationship with his probation officer that fits the main plot and has his big surprise ending. <br /> <br /> "Read my lips?" Paul ingeniously recognizes that Carla's ability to read lips, even from a considerable distance, is more than the fun parlor trick that seems to be before then. <br /> <br /> From there develops a caper. Just say. <br /> <br /> Paul and Carla are a real pair of extravagant criminals. He wants love but will also accept money. He wants it, a little, but business must come before a possible erotic satiety. Together, Cassel and Devos are strong actors who bring an unusual criminal story to the very end in a very convincing way. <br /> <br /> Rent or buy it, but if you like crime stories choose "Read My Lips". And you might want to look at it several times: I do it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
