I've never seen four hours as fast as when I saw this movie. This film restores the power and art of Hamlet that always had to be had. Even those famous talks are made in new and inventive ways. And the cast is incredible, Brannagh is the brightest star. It is his charisma, power and command of the role that defines the film. Making it a complete and complete version it fills so many holes and allows a new appreciation of the tragedy despite its length. Where one would expect the dark, gloomy castle clich√©, we are treated to a sumptuous feast for the eyes. The only sadness comes from Hamlet himself, as he should. It's worth it, all four hours.
