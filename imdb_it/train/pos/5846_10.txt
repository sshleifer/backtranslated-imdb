It was at 7:30, too close to school to see very often. Animation and computer graphics were spectacular for the time. The idea of ​​cowboys and ordinary people who casually threw space vehicles and robots was incredible. Maybe it inspired Treasure Planet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's really boring in the DVD format. The shows are practically identical. When viewing non-sequential episodes on a DVD, you are stoned from disk # 1. By today's standards, animation is questionable. We no longer notice computer graphics and focus on how much the characters are. <br /> <br /> The bright spots are the characters of the heroine. They were much more credible, they took modern heroines more seriously and were not trivial. In reality they have saved men.
