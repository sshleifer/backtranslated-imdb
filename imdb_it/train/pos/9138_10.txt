I own this movie and have watched it over and over again over the years since it was released. Prince doesn't stun us with his phenomenal acting style or anything, he's a musician and I feel that's what he's shown here, it's the best to tell this story through influence. Most of this film is simple and adolescent, but this is the fault of the directors / writers, however it is a fantastic film with even better music. The principles and moral convictions of Purple Rain are quite strong and if more films would be based on the basics we are taught by young children we would have a better environment all over the world as art reflects life reflecting art.
