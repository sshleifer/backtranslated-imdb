This is truly the greatest Swedish film of all time. Not only is he revolutionary in his narrative, but he is also among the first films to present the next generation of Swedish humor and Swedish comedians. Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindström are two of the most intelligent and witty filmmakers in Sweden today, and this film really puts it on display. <br /> <br /> "Vuxna människor" (Adult People) is a warm and hilarious story about adulthood, and the question if we wouldn't do better without it.
