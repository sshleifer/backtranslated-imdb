I went to see Hamlet because I was in between jobs. I thought 4 hours would be great, I was a Branagh fan; Dead Again, Henry V. I was completely overwhelmed by the direction, the acting, the cinematography that this film captured. Like other reviews, the 4 hours go by quickly. Branagh does not play Hamlet, he is Hamlet, he was born for this. When I watch this movie, I constantly try to find faults, I watched jokes and didn't notice them. The way he managed to move the camera in and out of the Hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me. This film was shot at 70 mil. It is a pity that Columbia has not released a Widescreen version of this on VHS. I own a DVD player, and I would take it on Titanic every day. So Columbia if you're listening put this movie the way it should be watched! And I don't know what happened to the Oscars. This should have been the best film, the best actor, the best director, the best cinematography. What movies were they watching? I felt sorry for Branagh at the Oscars when he made a tribute to Shakespeare on the screen. They had to pay tribute to Branagh for bringing us one of the greatest films of all time.
