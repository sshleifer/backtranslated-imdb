When I rented this movie I thought I was going to watch a horror movie. However, there is a little horror in this typical seventies drama directed by the strange James T. Flocker. Matt Boston looks good, with his beautiful interpretation and the typical strange atmosphere of Flocker's films is ubiquitous.
