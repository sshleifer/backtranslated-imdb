OK, so the music was poorly written and generally poorly sung (though Walken and Marner, particularly Walken, sounded pretty good). And so they destroyed the fourth wall in the end by having the king and his nobles sing of the "battle" with the ogre and praise the efforts of the Puss in Boots when they, by right, should not even know it. /> <br /> Who cares? It's Christopher Freakin 'Walken, who makes a movie based on a fairy tale, and sings and dances. His acting style adapts very well to the role of the diabolical and mischievous Cat with which it seems that his teacher turns into deeper and deeper trouble, but in reality he has a plan that he thought of seven or eight moves ahead. And if you've ever seen Walken in any of his evil roles, you know * the ogre bit the HARD powder at the end when Walken made him fall into his trap. <br /> <br /> A fun movie, and a must for those who love the unique style of Christopher Walken.
