History and music (George Gershwin!) They are wonderful, as are Levant, Guetary, Foch and, of course, Kelly. One thing is missing, and that thing is a good lady. I'm sorry, Leslie Caron bothers me. However, despite her, the plot moves nicely with the famous (and deservedly) Ballet. Oh the colors, the dazzling reds, the blues, the greens and the yellows. Don't forget the Beiges too. ; ) I love the contrast between the Beaux Arts Ball (costumes completely in black and white) and the always brilliant Ballet. <br /> <br /> So I suppose what I'm trying to say is this: please, at all costs see it and enjoy it, because even if it's not the best, it's WONDERFUL. But make sure you don't forget that other Gene Kelly musical with the 20-year-old girl who was catapulted to the celebrity soon after.
