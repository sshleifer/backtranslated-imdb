I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful and hot. Andie MacDowell's performance has been nuanced and vulnerable. For once, the director of a film MacDowell did not make his beauty another character in the film. The love story between Kate and her young man is adorable to watch and works very well. His relationship with his friends is both a thorn and a balm in his life. Imelda Stalinson, who was an MVP in many British films, does a great job at this. There is some tragedy in this, but I think the film is saved at last by the brilliant acting, by the cleanliness of the direction and the witty writing. The quality of the film is excellent and the music is also good, although not available on the soundtrack.
