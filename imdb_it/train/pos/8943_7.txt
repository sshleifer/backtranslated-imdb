The 1960s TV series Bewitched owes its idea to this film. This is the film that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made after being chosen together with Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This isn't as obsessive as that, but Novak is just as captivating. <br /> <br /> This was Jack Lemmons' 10th movie and he is good at support here like Ernie Kovacs. The film has many positive things about it. Hermine Gingold is very good in this film, almost as a support here as in The Music Man. The cast is very solid. <br /> <br /> This film has a New York touch from the 50s and a cat that is hexagonal like any feline in any movie. It is worth watching because it is a love story with all the emotions of everyone, and also a little magic. Boot is not Vertigo, but I think that because it followed that film, the viewers then didn't judge it as good as it deserved - I'm sure William Asher saw it, so the 1960s series was created. I'm not so happy with what Will Ferrell did on the big screen, this movie is so much better than that.
