This Raggedy Ann and Andy Movie is so adorable. We love watching Ann and Andy sing and dance, along with the camel with wrinkled knees. This film is what made Camel so popular with Wrinkled Knees, singing its song, "I'm nobodies I Love You". If you love Raggedy Ann and Andy, watch the movie and see why it's a movie that kids love and adults!
