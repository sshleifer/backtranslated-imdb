The magnetism radiated by Elvira, attracting her legions of devoted admirers, has a primordial quality. With her long and well-toned figure, her deliberately cheeky, innocuously mischievous attitude and the juggling vocabulary of my generation's valley slang, Elvira's character has a universal and timeless appeal. Being an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of the narrative, it is clear that the character of Elvira has some archetypal elements that help make the character more than the sum of his cornea and his big chest. As initiated by the way the city's children react to her, it represents the profound adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman who can connect with them on their level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic desire, childish sexual desire, and a non-threatening carefree fun . She symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of femininity perfected for boys and a source of strength for the girls of the city. The other adults have problems with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, his film fails to pass its most campy ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how weak a showcase is for her talents. Almost everything is adapted to an adolescent mentality and although it is a simple comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to appreciate the absurdity. Fortunately, I have such a capacity and I found the film a delightful charmer. <br /> <br /> Best quote: Bob Redding: how are you? Elvira: I didn't have any complaints
