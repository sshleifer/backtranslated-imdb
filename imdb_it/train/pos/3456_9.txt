There is no such thing as perfect murder. Lieutenant Columbo knows this. Ken Franklin, who is the other half of the team of police writers, does not know that he kills his partner Jim Ferris who was going to go solo. Now Columbo enters the picture and asks all the questions of Mr. Franklin. And returns for another question. Columbo: Murder by the Book (1971) is directed by the young Steven Spielberg before his glory days. Steven Bochco wrote it . Columbo is a fantastic character with a scruffy appearance. It is hard to believe that this man can solve any crime. But he could. Each of them! Peter Falk is the only person in the world who can play this character. No remake, please. This part is a great example of how Columbo worked. Jack Cassidy plays the killer and Martin Milner plays the victim. Rosemary Forsyth plays the wife of the victim Joanna Ferris. There is something captivating in the scenes between Columbo and her. How does the omelette and everything. Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sanka. In reality she met a tragic fate when she died after a murder like she does here. I have been a fan of Columbo since childhood and I still enjoy watching them. There was a pause for many years that they weren't showing Columbo stories, but now it's back. Come back for another question.
