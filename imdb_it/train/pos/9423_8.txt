I can't say if the post-war British comedies produced at Ealing Studios are an acquired taste or not, but I'm completely addicted and The Man in the White Suit is one of the best. There is no need to enter the well-known plot of the threat posed both to the textile industry and to the textile unions from an indestructible and dirt-resistant fiber. Suffice it to say that the slings and arrows suffered by the naive idealist Sidney Stratton in pursuing his polymeric vision make the joy comic. Many of the well-known faces in the world of British protagonists - the nervous Cecil Parker, the devout devout Michael Gough, and the brutal and ruthless Ernest Thesinger - have staged wonderful shows. Guinness - as always and forever - is superb, and Joan Greenwood is as delicious as Daphne (just the way she says the word "Dad" makes the whole movie worth seeing). <br /> <br /> "Knudsen !!! !!!!"
