I watched this movie in a very strange way - I put it on my Netflix list and couldn't remember why (apart from what I knew that Philip Seymour Hoffman was in it). Since the film has no opening titles, I didn't even remember who directed it. <br /> <br /> While my wife and I watched it, I turned to her for about 45 minutes and said, "You know, I still want to decide that I hate this movie, but something won't let me stop to watch it. "Then there's a scene of about half a dozen scenes in the middle of the film that are really thrilling in the actors' performances. <br /> <br /> Only when the credits were shot I realized that it was a Sidney Lumet movie. And I thought: wow. I am surprised that Lumet took what was a dirty and mean story about really mean and broken people. But it is a testament to his talent that I was so taken when I didn't realize it was him. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman is really, really good at this movie. How scary well. Put this against Capote and I would say that the Oscar should have been for this film. <br /> <br /> I also recommend the special narrative feature with Lumet, Hawke and Hoffman talking about making the film - it's fun and educational, with Hawke playing the student eager to learn at the teacher's feet. Lumet surely teaches you the first rule of working with actors: he constantly kisses their ass !! <br /> <br /> There are a lot of violent and melodramatic movies out there that are empty figures when all is said and done. And there's an element in this film - that the actors fill the air with sulphurous explosions of emotion, and when the smoke clears there's nothing left. Nothing resonates at a deeper level. <br /> <br /> But Lumet gave us Network and Twelve Angry Men - films that, each in their own way, have been elevated to the highest levels of cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie is not at that level. But there is something that lingers. And maybe that's enough. <br /> <br /> My final comment concerns the comments - if you look at the number of comments on this little movie here on IMDb - and the depth and intelligence of the comments, pro and con - it's a good indication that something special is happening with this movie.
