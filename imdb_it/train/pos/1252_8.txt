The infinite limits of our inhumanity to our own species never fail to stun me. This truly amazing story of a horribly abused and largely unheard-of population is compelling, well-documented and angry. As an American, I am constantly humbled by the behavior of my country and this is just another in our long international catalog of devaluation. We suck. This is probably the first John Pilger documentary I've seen, but it immediately made me want to see what else he did. My only complaint, and the reason I gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that Pilger shows us this parody and the terrifying collaboration of US and UK governments, asks us spectators / citizens to be accomplices of the inaction ... but does not give suggestions on how to help. I don't know Britain, but America has made it almost impossible for citizens to take part in their government's actions. A gesture in the right direction could help the cause of these islanders.
