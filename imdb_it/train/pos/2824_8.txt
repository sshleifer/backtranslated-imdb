Greta Garbo's American film debut is an analogy of how our lives can be swept away by destiny and our actions, like in a torrent, causing us to lose a part of ourselves along the way. <br /> <br /> Greta plays Leonora, a poor peasant in love with the character of Ricardo Cortez, don Rafael, landowner. Ricardo is also in love with her, but he is too easily influenced by his overbearing mother. Leonora ends up homeless and goes to Paris, where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops a reputation for being a free woman. In reality, part of his attitude is bitterness for Rafael's abandonment. <br /> <br /> Go back to his home to visit his family and finally confront Rafael. Surprisingly, no one knows that it is the famous La Brunna, and Garbo does his role as the diva he truly was and appreciated so arrogantly in his later portraits. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Cortez remembers a lot about Valentino looks in this part, and was treated to be a Valentino clone from MGM, although he never thought it could be in reality and he was right. It is credible in a non-sympathetic part like a weak mother's boy, and can be realistically but comically aged at the end of the film. Leonora cannot win when she returns home, and later when she follows her, her courage is undermined. <br /> <br /> This film is beautifully filmed, with brilliant storm sequences and the series describing Spain at that time are authentic analyzing, searching, watching. There are also some fine secondary performances of the old Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall and Mack Swain timers. <br /> <br /> Although this is a story of lost love and missed opportunities, I don't think Leonora and Rafael would have been happy together, because she needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman , and I don't think she would have been happy in a small village. The ending is true to life and does not take punches. <br /> <br /> See this as Garbo's American film debut and a forerunner of things to come
