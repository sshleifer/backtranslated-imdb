Though critically criticized, Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It is a film that should be watched closely; some of the funny pieces are made in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention drawn to them. For example, keep an eye on the use Michael Keaton makes of the price gun in the pet shop ... and also in the documentary-style years that appear at the beginning of the scenes. It's one of those rare movies where humor hits you unexpectedly, even if you know it's a comedy. Amy Heckerling, the director, is really strong here - If you enjoyed her best-known films (Fast Times in Ridgemont High, Clueless, European Vacation, etc.), you should take a look at it. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton is extremely likeable in the title role and the supporting cast (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boyle) is excellent. Highly recommended.
