This is a really great movie! I remember seeing him for the first time when I was very young and I always looked at him like once a week ... Shadow was my favorite character in the film. Homeward Bound is really fun and it's really cool how they train animals to do all those things. Some parts of the film are sad (like when Sassy, ​​the cat, falls off the waterfall, and when Shadow falls into the hole at the end.) I saw the second Bound at home, but I have to say that it's not as good as the first. Shadow is the smart one, Sassy is, well, Sassy, ​​and Chance is the funny idiot. I recommend this film to anyone who loves comedy or talking animals. This is one of my top ten favorite movies!
