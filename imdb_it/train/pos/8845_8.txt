The beginning of this film is a bit clumsy and confusing, but you sit tight, because you're ready for the passage of your life. The concept is compelling, with interesting devices used to tell the overall story. There are good performances around, with Phillip Seymour Hoffman being the best of the cast, no surprise there. Ethan Hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance. Mr. Lumet's direction is exceptional. The film has a Seventies aspect in respect that the risks are taken in telling this story, but unlike most of the trite movies that populate the landscape today, this is a thriller that is sincerely based on relationships rather than special effects or thorns of product. You will be greatly rewarded for the time invested in this film.
