8 Simple Rules is a fun show, but it also has some life lessons, especially a mature lesson on how to move on after a loss, which was the episode where Paul died, which was the first episode he ever had seen of the show that arrives on ABC. The Hennessy clan - mother Cate (Katey Sagal), daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson), and son Rory (Martin Spanjers) - look at each other for guidance and support after Paul's death (John Ritter), the patriarch of the family. Cate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) help out. I'm glad that in the second season of this show they decided to put David Spade in this show since he finished with the NBC series, Just Shoot Me! But everything and this whole show is pretty good. This show reminds me of many of the usual family sitcoms of the 80s and 90s that were in ABC.
