Just as Al Gore shook us with his painfully honest and cleverly presented documentary film "An inconvenient truth", directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield also remind us that it's time to improve our way of life to save our beautiful planet. "Planet Earth" is also an alarm bell that the global warming of our planet has disastrous consequences for all living creatures in the world. Al Gore showed us the sad future of planet Earth by presenting concrete facts supported by documented examples through long but always interesting monologues. The creators of this documentary choose a different but equally powerful way to accomplish this. They do not present us with a future representation of what could happen to our planet if we do not radically change things around, but rather show us the genuine beauty of planet Earth in all its extraordinary glory. We see places that we knew existed but we never thought they could be so beautiful. In this film, we see a wide range of extraordinary places like deserted deserts, giant forests full of fauna and flora and frozen landscapes as far as the eye can see. And in all those immensely different environments, we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive. <br /> <br /> This is exactly the kind of film that had to be made, in combination with that of Al Gore, in order for us to understand that our planet is too precious to intrude. Patrick Stewart's voiceover is always relaxing and therefore very well done even if at first it seemed like you were watching an X-men movie! Cinematography is probably the most remarkable thing about this documentary. Sometimes: what you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that a man with a camera actually had to film all that delicious movie. <br /> <br /> In short: this is definitely a must for everyone as it affects every single person on this beautiful planet Earth! The truth is: I never thought that our planet was so extraordinarily beautiful!
