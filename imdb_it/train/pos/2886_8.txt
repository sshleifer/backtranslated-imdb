Cinderella is a beautiful film, with beautiful songs of course. Indeed, it is one of the best films of the 50s. I think all the characters are portrayed in a surprising way. You can see the cruelty of Cinderella's stepsisters and her stepmother, Cinderella's sweetness. Mice are also fun and sweet. I think they changed the story a bit, but I think it's the best. It is such a beautiful film, and I don't think anyone can resist it deep inside. <br /> <br /> I give him an 8/10. I don't think it's the best Disney movie. But surely it is a true classic.
