I really wonder how this show takes place in the UK and the rest of Europe. IT IS SO AUTHENTIC TO BE AN American AMERICAN (in particular American white). This could be a big reason for the poison and vitriol expressed here in this forum. I love the show but it is with some reservations and I feel that it was easily taken by Spoiler Spoiler: <br /> <br /> Crashing and burning everything at the end of the second season. Julie closed the door with the hope of reviving the show unless her character stopped on a haystack in the middle of a farm. Who knows? It was a fun, vulgar and sometimes scary sight.
