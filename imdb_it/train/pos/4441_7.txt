Well, before reviewing, I have to ask: why is this not listed individually? It may have been just a TV article in Italy, but for Lamberto Bava international fans this is his film. In America this film is distributed on VHS and DVD as "The Ogre" or "Demons 3". Yes, I know it has nothing to do with "Demons" apart from a cast member and crew. But yes, personally I was upset that it was so difficult to find on this site that it would otherwise be so useful. <br /> <br /> Finally, let's review "L'orco". I've seen the trailer many times on YouTube and I've discovered that it's pretty scary. The film itself (it's a feature film, so making it a movie) has many strong parts and manages to scare. I was sorry for the last act, but overall I don't regret having bought the DVD before seeing it (available from Shriek Show). I imagine the film's TV origins explain the last act. I will not give any spoilers. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite familiar: an American horror writer on holiday in an ancient spooky castle with her husband and son just to find it remembers exactly the setting of her childhood nightmares. There are faint echoes of "The Shining", but this is a different brand of supernatural horror. The woman (Virginia Bryant) finds more and more evidence that this is the real life of her nightmares, but her husband will not believe her. Great atmosphere and terror follow. <br /> <br /> The multiple nightmare sequences have been quite strange. The Ogre cocoon effect was good, it reminded me a little of Uncle Frank's resurrection from the first "Hellraiser". There are also some good shocks and a well done underwater scene. I give them the scene material that the film never lowered to imitate American films with similar concepts, namely "A Nightmare on Elm Street". "The orc" is an original. And the monster itself was scary when it was presented correctly. <br /> <br /> On the Shriek Show DVD there is an interview with Lamberto Bava in which he is careful to say that this is not part of his classic "Demons" series. It also gives a lot of credit to the real castle where the film was shot. Indeed, this setting contributes a lot to the film. Simon Boswell's music also helps. <br /> <br /> There are many good things here. "The orc" is not perfect, but it is really worth seeing. Take it is a minor result of Lamberto Bava.
