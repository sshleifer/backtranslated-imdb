The main reason why I had to watch this film is that he plays Susan Swift, an exceptional actress who is too little appreciated. Time travel films do not usually interest me, nor do witchcraft films, but this film was fascinating and disturbing. It was not based on outrageous special effects and did not focus so much on time travel that the viewer gets lost and confuses. This was a really creative film, simple and focused with great acting by everyone.
