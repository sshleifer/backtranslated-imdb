PERHAP in an attempt to find another "Hot Property" for adaptation, the Fleischer brothers thought back to their highly successful foray into the world of the Newspaper Comic Strip with their production of POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer Studios / Paramount) of 1933. Although was part of the BETTY BOOP series, Miss B. only made a brief appearance in the short; leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the possible appearance of a full-fledged series. <br /> <br /> AS is now in the public domain, the surly and cross-eyed sailor has become perhaps the most successful cartoon series ever; survive and literally survive the Fleischers and their study, which lasts until today. <br /> <br /> RETURNING to King Features for another makeshift attempt was undoubtedly the reason to try the very popular HENRY Comic Strip character in a BETTY BOOP Exit; objective is the search for another series. The reasoning therefore certainly seemed healthy. HENRY was one of the most popular features in the Hearst Papers line-up; appearing both as a supplement for Daily color comics and for Sunday, PUCK, THE COMICS WEEKLY. You know, "What a fool these mortals are!" Do you remember that, Schultz? Seeing the comic Strip 'Hero', the chubby bald kid, and his antics on the screen, both alone and in tandem with Miss Betty; we were pleasantly surprised to see how well the character was managed. Both the script and the director Dave Fleischer offered a multitude of comic and visual gag situations that seemed more appropriate for the character of little Henry. These mostly silent cartoons were very important for the animated film in staying true to the printed page; as the HENRY feature was mostly performed in a sort of 4-color "mime". <br /> <br /> IN the cartoon, entitled BETTY BOOP WITH HENRY: THE FUNNIEST LIVING American (Fleischer Studios / Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1935), let's see what it is; fundamentally being a situational exercise; to be punctuated by Dave Fleischer's usual rapid fire series, machine-gun-like gags. In short, Henry sees a puppy in Betty Boop's pet shop window. It's kind of love at first sight when Henry tries to buy the little puppy with the only money he has, with coins in his pocket. It was formed by Miss Boop that would have been $ 2.00 in cash from the era of depression to make the purchase. Tears appear as the little one goes down. <br /> <br /> BUT a suspension is soon on the horizon when Betty asks the boy to look after the shop while she leaves urgent business. In exchange for her services, Miss Betty promises him the little dog in return. Sure, they have an agreement and Betty leaves. <br /> <br /> REACH the work of cleaning the cages and feeding the animals gives the opportunity to the Fleischer Crew to shoot a new series of gags; this time with bird seeds, Henry's bald hair and push brooms. (But not all at once, of course, Schultz!). Henry's enthusiasm for the mass supply of the store's avian population before literally sowing his head soon leads to mass defection of birds; out of the shop on the open road to a mass prison. <br /> <br /> BETTY returns to this view and expresses his disappointment and anger with Henry's temporary custody. All bets were off, no little dog for Henry. Start starting; disconsolately; but soon convinces the owner to give him another chance to fix things. His head covered with bird seeds, is able to corrode all the small feathered creatures; returning them to their pet store. Fortunately, the little fella leaves; but this time he has his affectionate, little puppy that licks his face. <br /> <br /> UNDOUBETLY this was a winning combination. We have the carefree, full of energy, the free rotation of the boy, the kindness of Betty and the emotions of the situation and the doubtful result of the situation of the "boy and his dog". Max and Dave Fleischer had given us a sort of almost secondary mini-masterpiece of a surreal short film. <br /> <br /> We were rather surprised that no HENRY series was followed. Judging by the fairly faithful handling of the character, he certainly could have been supported for some time. In any case, this collaboration was in many ways the best of Betty Boop's photos. Although the first, POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer / Paramount, 1933), was the most successful (and almost no Betty Boop, except for a cameo as a hula dancer); the HENRY Short was much better than the two following "rehearsals" by King Features, BETTY BOOP AND THE LITTLE KING and BETTY BOOP AND LITTLE JIMMY, both from 1936. <br /> <br /> POOL SCHNITZ !!
