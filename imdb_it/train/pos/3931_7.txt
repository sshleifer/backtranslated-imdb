A somewhat fictionalized biographical portrait of Abraham Lincoln's early years by director John Ford, which focuses primarily on a trial in which the young lawyer defends two brothers accused of murder. <br /> <br /> The film offers an interesting portrait of this important American figure and film are well made, but they seem somewhat incomplete without any of the great moments of his presidency or even his debates with Stephen Douglas. The obvious intent was to play Lincoln as a young man who developed the attributes that would make him the great man he would become. But the result for me was that, while I admired the portrait, it was not as satisfying as I think it could have been wider. <br /> <br /> In the role of Abraham Lincoln we have Henry Fonda who effectively shows a silent force. Fonda's performance includes some "gangly" mannerisms and other affectations that are quite effective in presenting a portrait of Lincoln, particularly when combined with effective makeup and the costume that is occasionally a bit excessive. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is solid and surprisingly does not include many of Ford's supporting casts (sometimes referred to as his stock company), but we have Ward Bond one of Hollywood's most prolific actors. Bond has appeared in more than any other actor's AFI Top 100 Films, both on the original list and in that magazine. He has also appeared in 11 Best Picture Nominees. <br /> <br /> The film features a scene that seems to have inspired a fairly similar scene in "To Kill a Mockingbird", where it would have been made even better than it is here, although that scene is one of the most effective in this movie.
