This is a true "80s movie": in those days they produced perhaps 100 times more films than today, and this makes them quite interesting ... It was a cultural phenomenon, which no longer exists. Nowadays perhaps the same kind of people who would have made cheap "straight-to-video" movies in the eighties are doing cheap porn. Porn seems to sell. However, this is above the average level of the trash film: it has a good and fascinating history, and it's pretty well done, I think. In a scene you can even see the microphone swing at the top edge of the image. Of course there are also small cameos by Ozzy and Gene Simmons, but they don't contribute much to the "success" of the film, even if they are good in their small roles. The monster, the heavy singer "Sammi Curr", looks really terrible, especially when he sings. One of the scariest monsters I've seen in horror movies. I could have nightmares of him next night. Not recommended for lovers of intellectual films.
