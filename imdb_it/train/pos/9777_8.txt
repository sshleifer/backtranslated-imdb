one of the best low budget films in Germany! Is this the dark side of new age? if you believe in the esoteric, please don't watch this movie! wipe out all your positive fantasies. this film shows that beyond the peaceful facade of the soul's spiritual quest there is a world of extreme transgressions and terror. I hope that soon there will be a 35 mm copy! Andreas Marschall's first film is just the beginning of a new area, making films with just a few euros! I'm waiting for the second success!
