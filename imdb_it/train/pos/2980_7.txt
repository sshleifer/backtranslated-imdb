This film is simply fun. without mind, but fun. to fully enjoy this movie you can't have the perception of how a movie like this is going and enjoy all the jokes and word games that are involved in the movie. I still find it funny at the beginning, when he says "I want a beer ........ fuck". funny things. but what makes the film decent is the fact that it doesn't try to create a serious effect on the film, too many plays try to have serious aspects that you simply don't believe. But this is different and focuses only on being funny. I have to say though, Yasmin bleeth is terrible in the movie and adds nothing but the 3 main guys, coop, remer and squeak are great fun to watch and make the movie look fantastic
