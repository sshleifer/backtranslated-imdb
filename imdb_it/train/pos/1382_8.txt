Not everything has been said in this excellent first feature by Céline Sciamma. Friendship, "wanting to enter", the first sexual feelings ... All this and much more is sublimated through the synchronized underwater swimming scenes. <br /> <br /> All three girls in the film try to find and express their personality in a very different way. It is a much less violent approach to understanding adolescents than, say, "Thirteen", but still a very useful journey. <br /> <br /> A must see, and please leave all American film preconceptions with him. By the way, the soundtrack is A +. <br /> <br /> Bon cinéma!
