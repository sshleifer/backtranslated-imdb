I seriously loved this movie ... I started reading the book and I loved it ... the way everything was created and everything had a purpose ... I think this film was so beautiful because Louis Sachar wrote the screenplay. .and of course Andrew Davis directed it ... Shia Lebouf offers a great interpretation for his first film ... the plot is very interesting and interesting ... there is humor, heart and intensity ... it is very similar to the book ... I find this film not boring at all ... I loved it ... and I encourage anyone to read the book ... everything in this film is very well done and taken care of ... two thumbs up up for me in every single way
