This film is Damian SzifrÃ³n's second immersion in the movies after his excellent study of the characters in "El Fondo del Mar". With "Tiempo De Valientes" he creates extremely well-made characters, far from the prototypes and with an unprecedented chemistry between them. I saw Szifron's talent for presenting every character in a carefree way but enough to get emotionally involved with them. His control over them is magnificent, so he gives the film a great direction and a brilliant overall script, the characters laugh and cry with real feeling and invite the viewer to join them in their emotions and their evolution on the screen. > <br /> Spanish takes control of English, the cityscape of Buenos Aires at night replaces the scenes of Hollywood and the premise is just as interesting as any other, so we have a film that has the courage to compete at Hollywood's Machinery . <br /> <br /> But I want you to see the film mainly because I've never dealt with such endearing characters, all of them. It seems that the script fits perfectly with the actors and vice versa. I truly believe that with a film like this, Argentina is truly up to the competition.
