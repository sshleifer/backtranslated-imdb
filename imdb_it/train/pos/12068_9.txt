If you have any kind of appreciation for the character and dialogue, and any sense of American cultural history, in this film you will find a lot of very engaging material. It was probably originally a game, which is why it is a heavy dialogue, but I can't stress enough how these icons that we have only a superficial understanding of are transformed into really complex and wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> This film is better than any university course to tell you how to create a story driven by the characters. <br /> <br />
