I really liked the detail of the script. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Rhys Myers (incorrect) and Jewel were outstanding in their supporting roles. As was Jeffery Wright. Toby McGuire did a great acting job like never before, when he had to amputate his best friend's arm, knowing he would die without the procedure. <br /> <br /> Attention to detail, with good dialectal coaching to capture the incredibly good Southern accent. <br /> <br /> Because this film was swept under the carpet by Hollywood promoters that I can only imagine. I have strong suspicions. Which makes me even more attractive. I distributed a dozen copies of DVDs for gifts. <br /> <br /> Film completely overlooked. Rent or buy and pay all your attention for a couple of hours, then judge.
