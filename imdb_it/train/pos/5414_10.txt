This happily unfortunate 1939 military swordsman, based rather loosely on Rudyard Kipling's memorable poem and his novel "Soldiers Three", qualifies as first-rate entertainment for the British imperial army in India in the 1880s. Gary Grant is punching more with his fists than all his films put together. Set in distant India, this six-fisted yarn focuses on the exploits of three sturdy British sergeants and their native water owner Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) vying for a bloody cult of murderous Indians called the Thuggee. Sergeant Archibald Cutter (Cary Grant of "The Last Outpost"), Sergeant MacChesney (Oscar winner Victor McLaglen of "The Informer") and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. of "The Dawn Patrol"), are a competitive trio of alpha males who drink, collide and enjoy fun, whose years of madness are about to become history, because Ballantine plans to marry Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and enter the world of tea. Of course, Cutter and MacChesney prepare various schemes to derail Ballentine's plans. When their superiors put them back into action with the sergeant. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote of "The Sheik Steps Out"), Cutter and MacChesney drug Higginbotham so that he cannot accompany them and Ballantine must replace him. Half the fun here is watching the headmasters trying to outdo each other without hating each other. Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in style and reach as our heroes intertwine with an army of Thuggees. Lenser Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for his extraordinary black and white cinematography.
