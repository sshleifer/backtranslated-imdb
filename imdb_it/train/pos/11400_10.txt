I thought it necessary to respond to the comments posted on the first page of this film's page because some were slightly wrong. <br /> <br /> I originally posted the quotes from the original poster, but I wasn't sure if it's true, since this is the "comments" index and not a bulletin board (although we used them earlier, IMDb has added the movie boards), then I will edit it to make it superfluous. <br /> Well, first of all you might not be aware of this, but Gene Kelly became famous for playing "Pal Joey" on Broadway in the original production. When Vincente Minnelli decided to make a "panorama" film by Gershwin, he wanted Kelly's character to be more sophisticated than the "two cute" roles he had played in most of his films (except "For Me and My Gal" ) Alan Jay Lerner was commissioned to build a new story set in Paris based on the story of "Pal Joey". This gave Kelly the chance to play his famous Broadway role even though Warners had overtaken MGM for "Pal Joey" rights. In my opinion, the WB film "Pal Joey" is a disaster, although Sinatra was suitable for the role, but other problems sink the film (screenplay changes and bad direction. ============= = ===================================== <br /> <br /> You complain about the photos of Kelly are not well made, even citing your artistic education to prove the point, but you miss the fact that Kelly's bad art was clearly designed to be bad, and it is necessary for the story / characters that Kelly is not ready for an exhibition, even if he knows it, even if Milo has somehow reduced it to the point where he almost believes it, but it is important that the public is not sitting there to say "but he is a great artist, if only he had had the chance! ". You want the public to be fully aware of its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> So you complain that it sabotages your interest in the show, once again you are not understanding the structure of the story, yes he refuses because he doesn't want to feel like a gigolo, and because he knows he's not really ready for the show. His enthusiasm for the show is certainly not as exceptional as "Joey's enthusiasm for" starting a nightclub ". But the same function is needed in the plot. Remember, it is essential in "Pal Joey" (the comedy) that Joey leave his nightclub after realizing he doesn't deserve it. The same with the art exhibition. If Kelly's paintings were actually good, that would weaken this point. ================================================== = <br /> <br /> So you complain that Caron and Kelly have no "chemistry". I imagine it's in the eye of the beholder. I agree, the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be, but for me it was fine. Compare it to even worse "forced" novels like the one between Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in "The Pride and the Passion". ================================================== == <br /> <br /> When you say that the finale of the great dance has nothing to do with anything else in this film, it simply shows that you didn't dig under the surface of the film in its symbolism. Many elements of the dance sequence refer to the story and the characters, and through the dance the plot is resolved through images and symbolism. It's about finding love, enjoying love, then losing love (he looks around and his love is gone). The movements of the symphony are constructed in such a way that part of each dance scene reflects a separate phase of the Parisian art and also a separate phase of their relationships. If you haven't seen it, it's not the movie's fault. It is certainly not a "load of shit". ==================================================
