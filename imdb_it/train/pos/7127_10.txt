Wonderful film that still deals with the trials and tribulations of World War II England. What makes this film so beautiful is the touch of the human element. This film is certainly in the tradition of British line classics like "Mrs. Miniver" and "Hope and Glory". As in the case of this film, we see the desperation of people in times of war. <br /> <br /> The performances are outstanding here above all by the unrepentant John Thaw, who is assigned a child who was evacuated from the London bombing. <br /> <br /> Let's see why this baby bathes his bed soon. He comes from a crazy mother who has abused him terribly. <br /> <br /> The old man takes the child and brings happiness to his sad life. When the child is returned to his mother, the old man goes to London and seeks him only to find the tragedy. He literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince more that the child is better with him than being in a boy's house. <br /> <br /> The image is so good because it treats and develops engaging relationships.
