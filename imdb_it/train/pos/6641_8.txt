On December 28, 1895, in the Grand Café in Paris, the history of cinema was being written while Louis Lumière was showing his short films, all singles, to a paying public. "La Sortie des Usines Lumière" was the first film to be interpreted and I would like to be there, not only to watch the film, but also for the reactions of the audience. <br /> <br /> We begin behind the closed doors of the Lumière factory. Apparently, since the image looks like a photograph, people thought they were going to see a slide show, not something they hoped for. But then the doors open and people pour into the house. First a lot of women, then some men and a man on a bicycle with a big dog. When they are all out the doors close again. <br /> <br /> Whether this is the first film or not (some say that "L'Arrivée d'un train à la Ciotat" was the first film recorded by Lumière), it is an impressive piece of ancient cinema. Being bored by this is almost impossible for multiple reasons. A simple reason: it lasts only fifty seconds. But even for people who normally only love films with special effects, there must be something interesting here; you don't see historical things like this every day.
