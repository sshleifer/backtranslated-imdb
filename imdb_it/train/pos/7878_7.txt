While the story of my family goes, my father, Milton Raskin, played the piano for the Dorsey band. After Sinatra joined the band, my father practiced with him for hours and hours. Then, at some point in time, my father told Sinatra that he would actually be good at being tied up with such a small group (group), and that he should have ventured alone. At that time Sinatra had enough credits 'under the belt' to do just that! Dorsey has never forgiven my father, and the rest, as they say, is history. <br /> <br /> I have some photos and documents to that effect, and also Berkley University in California. <br /> <br /> I have seen almost all of Sinatra's films more than I would like to say, and his films never get old. . . Thanks, Frank
