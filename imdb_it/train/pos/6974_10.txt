I recently looked at Caprica again and thought that I could also come and write a review! I saw it for the first time after seeing the finale of the Battlestar Galactica series (Being a big drooling fan of the show left me clinging to anything I could of the show universe) so I didn't know what to expect ... came out with a smile even though I have to admit ... <br /> <br /> The story begins dramatically on the planet of Caprica and we are introduced with a variety of interesting characters ... I will not give too much away, but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of history but I suggest you look at it. <br /> <br /> I must say ... Esai Morales is an infernal actor who pulled out of a young Joseph Adama. .. (Admiral's father in Battlestar Galactica) I found his acting place and I could believe he was the father of William Adama of BSG ... <br /> <br /> Even Eric Stoltz fits his role perfectly . ..! Special note it was nice to see Polly Walker outside Rome! Don't sit back and watch Caprica with the expectation that it's like Battlestar Galactica because the plot is simple enough and anyone can look at it ... without having to see BSG! <br /> <br /> is a well-written drama for those who love drama there with a bit of sci-fi football!
