The planning episodes were a bit boring, but when they reached the desert it was pretty fun to watch. The reason I call it the most realistic reality show is because, to my surprise, Charley fell out of the race relatively early. When his hands were sore, I expected the usual stress and then a miraculous solution, but instead he actually abandoned the race. The most anxious moment of the show must have been when Max stayed out in the desert with almost no water or food! The finish was great and I was very happy to see that at least one of the team made it. Overall, not as exceptional as the Long Way Round, but certainly an interesting watch, as it gives a sneak peek at the most challenging race in the world.
