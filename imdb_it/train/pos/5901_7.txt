It is a remake of many recent films, only this one has fewer stars, fewer complications and a more fuzzy feeling. Abhay and Ritika (played respectively by Fardeen Khan and Esha Deol) meet at a friend's wedding where their marriage (unbeknownst to them) begins their process of organization. In a very short time the two strangers are married and sent to a honeymoon camp where they meet other couples who face movements similar to theirs. As time passes together, the secrets are revealed, the broken and / or repaired hearts and the flowers of love. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Honeymoon Private Limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishq, then you've seen this movie. The twists and turns are the same, there is not a single element of surprise in the two and a half hours of the film. Everything is predictable. I only liked it because I saw "Darling" (also played by the main characters Deol & Khan) at the beginning of the day and I enjoyed their chemistry, so I said "why not" when my sister suggested renting "Just married" . <br /> <br /> Look at it: because Kirron Kher is co-protagonist and is his usual beloved in it. <br /> <br /> Jump: Because you have had enough of all this nonsense as a couple fest! <br /> <br /> C +
