Indian summer! He was very nostalgic for me. I found it funny, moving and absolutely adorable! Anyone who went to the camp as a child and sometimes wanted to be able to return to the "beautiful Ole days" for a short time, really needed to see this! It begins like 20 years later, a group of old campers returns for a "meeting". I will no longer comment on the plot because you have to see it alone. The actors were fantastic and contains a cast of famous actors. Everyone in it has played an exceptional role. You actually felt like you were part of the movie watching it. Alan Arkin was particularly good at his role as Uncle Lou. He plays the kind of guy that everyone wants to have in their life. This is also a good family movie for the most part. I would recommend this to anyone in the blink of an eye! Highly recommended!
