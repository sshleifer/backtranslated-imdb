Not since the Simpsons made their debut was there a sitcom that I didn't want to turn into a 2-minute issue. It has been said that the Simpsons killed the sitcom. Not this though. <br /> <br /> The first season was such that the teenage characters were not as outrageous as they later became. Sometimes they even went to school. The following seasons the character in which he came out. Eric, the sarcastic idiot, Donna, his partner, Kelso, the dim light bulb, Hyde, the conspiracy theorist and the anti-establishment punk, Fez, the perverted student and finally Jackie, the rich and spoiled. As for the adult characters, there was Eric's mother, the "suburban" mother, Eric's father, the straight arrow who obviously wasn't such a tough ass, Donna's silly dad and her silly blonde mum. Everyone is loyal to their characters but special congratulations to Kurtwood Smith who finds the perfect balance between strength and makes his Red Forman quite nice without making us vomit with unexpectedly cute. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace is obviously the main reason why this show is so good. He is a difficult character to play because he does not allow the athlete to indulge in wild exaggerations like Kelso's character, played competently by Ashton Kutcher. I enjoyed seeing the two characters interact because they are the most diverse. <br /> <br /> The character of Hyde is a little more difficult to enjoy because it is more realistic and we really need to see the story of the orphans for the umpteenth time, even if I say that the writers have invented a brilliant story for him in recent seasons. <br /> <br /> Jackie, played by vocal artist Family Guy Mila Kunis, is exhilarating and has nails on a type of slate that actually fits her character. The only sad part is that we didn't see more scenes with her and Eric because they were fun ... together. Too much history has been wasted on his relationship problems, since we have already teased him with Eric and Donna. <br /> <br /> Finally, I will say that the cast of guest actors has always been great. Some favorites: Fez's humorous girlfriend in the middle of the seasons, Pastor Dan, the totally fantastic Leo played by the cheerful Thomas Chong, another certifiable girlfriend of Fez and a special appearance of the teenage witch Sabrina as a slutty Catholic girl. <br /> <br /> Next next on Fox, whatever.
