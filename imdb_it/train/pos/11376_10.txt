This must be one of the best serial killer movies I've ever seen, and this comes from someone who absolutely loved Silence of the Lambs. HBO has reached the jackpot here. This film is compelling from first to last. <br /> <br /> This film has so many basic themes that it's hard to say exactly what it is. It retraces the ten-year research of Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Stephen Rea gives a brilliantly reserved performance as an inexperienced forensic expert who is in charge of the investigation, and Donald Sutherland gives an even more engaging performance like his superior cynic, and the only person in the Russian government willing to help him. Both of their shows are subtle masterpieces - Rea starts naive and doesn't want to compromise, while Sutherland starts off detached and almost amused by the situation. Towards the end, Rea becomes more tired of the world and beaten by the system, while Sutherland finds himself more passionate and idealistic. <br /> <br /> In any other film, I would have said that Sutherland's performance stands out above the rest, but even here he is rivaled by Jeffrey DuMann, like the same serial killer. DuMann creates here a character that inspires empathy rather than the hatred we think we find: he is a monster, but he does not want to be, and we have the idea that he is disgusted by what he does as we are. He is tortured, shameful, but also evil. <br /> <br /> If you can shoot incredibly dark subjects, (and it's * very * disturbing), you should see this movie.
