I saw this my last day at the festival, and I was glad I stopped in that extra couple of days. Poetic, moving and, surprisingly, funny, in his strange way. It is so rare to see directors working in this style who are able to find the real weirdness and humor in a hyper-realistic world, without seeming precious, or upsetting the balance. Manages to seem both improvised but completely controlled. I hesitated to make comparisons, because these directors really digested their influences (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... the usual suspects) and found their unique style, but if you like modern directors in this tradition (Lynne Ramsay, David Gordon Greene), you're ready for a real party. This is a wonderful film, and I hope more people can see it. If this movie plays at a festival in your city, go! leave! leave!
