"The Invisible Ray" is partly science fiction and partly horror. It was also the third of the seven functions of Karloff / Lugosi. In this voice, the dominant role belongs to Boris Karloff. <br /> <br /> Through specially designed astronomical equipment, Dr. Janos Rukh (Karloff) demonstrates to his colleagues dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi), Sir Frances Stevens (Walter Kingsford), his wife Lady Stevens (Beulah Bondi) and their nephew Ronald Drake (Frank Lawton), that a meteorite containing a powerful element, landed on the African continent many millions of Years ago. Rukh impresses his guests who invite him to accompany them on an expedition to Africa to find the mysterious element. <br /> <br /> Rukh leaves alone and discovers the place where the meteorite fell and the element he calls "Radium X". Due to Rukh's long absences, his young wife Diana (Frances Drake) is attracted to Drake and they fall in love. Meanwhile Rukh is contaminated by Radium X to the point that anyone who touches will die instantly. Contamination causes his skin to glow brightly in the dark. <br /> <br /> Rukh goes to Benet to ask for help. Benet elaborates an antidote that, if taken daily, will provide temporary immunity to the element. Unfortunately, the deadly element also affects Rukh's brain, slowly turning it into a vengeful killer. While Rukh is continuing his work, Sir Frances reports the news of the discovery in France. Diana and Ronald accompany him. When Benet informs him of this action, Rukh accuses the party of betraying him and his discovery and secretly plans his revenge. When he returns to France he discovers the healing power of Radium X while treating the blindness of his mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) and Benet's work in treating his patients' diseases. <br /> <br /> But Rukh's madness intensifies. First he kills an innocent identified as Rukh. After learning of Rukh's apparent demise, Diana and Ronald get married. This angers Rukh and he begins to demand his revenge on the other five members of the expedition. One night is drawn into a trap by Benet and .... <br /> <br /> Karloff is excellent in the title role, moving from an ambitious scientist happily married to a delusional maniac. Lugosi has a straight role for once and does what he can with the limited part. <br /> <br /> At 79 minutes this film was the second longest among the six Karloff / Lugosi collaborations. Karloff's film to the hilt.
