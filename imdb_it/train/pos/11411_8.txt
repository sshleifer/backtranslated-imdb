S. Van Dine had to be a clever businessman in dealing with Hollywood. Most film series from the time of study were usually limited to one or two studies. But apparently Van Dine must have sold his rights to every book on Philo Vance one at a time. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers and others have released Philo Vance films. Only Tarzan seemed to be going around Hollywood more. <br /> <br /> MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and played Edmund Lowe as a fashion detective. Of course MGM had contracted the original Philo screen, but Bill Powell was busy making The Thin Man at that time and I imagine that Louis B. Mayer decided to focus it there. <br /> <br /> Edmund Lowe is a fairly acceptable Philo Vance. Lowe had started doing great things at the end of the silent period with What Price Glory and then with a series of films with Victor McLaglen with their characters Flagg and Quirt. But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe seemed to vanish into the B image market. <br /> <br /> The Garden Murder Case involves three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart and Frieda Inescourt. The sinister atmosphere surrounding the culprit gives away, the mystery really is how all the killings are connected and how they are carried out. <br /> <br /> I'll say it anyway. Vance has a great chance of exhibiting the villain and the last 15 minutes are worthy of Hitchcock.
