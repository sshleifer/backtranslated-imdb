The third Muppet film is perhaps the most relaxed and enjoyable, with the band bringing their modest college musical to Broadway's (still volatile) lights filled with typically naive optimism. Of course, their first attempt fails and Kermit (group leader and author of the show) blows up; so, others must all be separated so that they do not have to feel responsible for them. The same Kermit befriends a young fashion designer who does the weekend serving food at his father's restaurant (the old man, therefore, has a particularly tortuous line in non-sequitur!). We get the usual cameo appearances from a variety of stars: Art Carney (as a producer), James Coco (as an overzealous dog owner), Dabney Coleman (as a trusted cheater), Elliott Gould (who was also in THE MUPPET MOVIE [1979]), Gregory Hines, Liza Minnelli (as herself with her portrait in a classy restaurant replaced by Kermit, fake sports mustache, as a seemingly famous entrepreneur in a ploy to attract publicity to the Muppets show), Brooke Shields , and even the director John Landis (perhaps in the most amusing scene of the film as a Broadway producer, in front of which Kermit appears streetwise and rowdy acting and wears hilarious nuances and an afro wig!). The other Muppets more or less pass through their typical rhythms, with (unfortunately) less space given to Gonzo this time; while Miss Piggy is something of a taste acquired with me, the scenes in which the latter discovers what it takes to be Kermit's love affair with the maid ?? and above all his violent reaction to this? they are undeniably fun. What disappoints, however, is the culinary spectacle itself (after a fairly redundant media section in which Kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up advertising on Madison Avenue) which, rather than the usual planned routines, provides nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of Kermit and his eternal flame Miss Piggy!
