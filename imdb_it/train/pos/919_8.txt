Having been a fan of "Columbo", I was very disappointed with "Corky Romano". Although certainly an entertaining film, the character of Falk's boss is a far cry from the adorable lieutenant he played for so many years, especially with the offensive language he used. After "Corky Romano", I was honestly surprised and irritated by Mr. Peter Falk. However, having just seen "Finding John Christmas" and its predecessor, "A city without Christmas", for the first time in a week of each other, I must say that "Max", the delightful character of Peter's Falk in both films, it is certainly memorable and lovable as 'Columbo'. While some parts of the film are quite predictable, such scenes in no way take away the pleasure of seeing the story played. I also wish I had recorded both of these moving Christmas movies, and I highly recommend them if you are a Falk fan, a crazy Christmas, or just someone who enjoys the occasional movie in a good mood of the week. This movie could end up getting lost in the crowds of TV-made movies, so make sure you find "Find John Christmas" before it's too late.
