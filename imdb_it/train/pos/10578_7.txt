"Footlight Parade" is just one of the many wonderfully jaunty musicals that Warner Bros. produced in the early 1930s to ward off the Depression. "42nd Street" and the Golddiggers series were also produced during this era, and they literally did, millions of Americans forget their problems for a while and have fun. <br /> <br /> While most of the films produced had the great talents of Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, only Foolight Parade had the incomparable James Cagney. Almost ten years before his most famous musical, "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Here she dances in those more original dance styles, with her arms usually lowered at her side, and her legs making all kinds of undulations and kicks. It's easy to see that you're having fun and that makes us even more fun. <br /> <br /> While almost all musical sequences appear at the end of the film, it's worth the wait. I think this film was made just before the production code was installed, so some of the costumes and scenes are a little bold. But it's all fun. <br /> <br /> No matter what the plot of the movie is, just know that there are lots of laughs and a superb cast. In addition to those already mentioned, Guy Kibbee is at the best of his agitation here. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
