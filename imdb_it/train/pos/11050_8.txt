Well, magic works in mysterious ways. This film of about 4 prisoners, trying to escape with the help of spells, written by another prisoner centuries ago, was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and a lot of suspense. Although he had something theatrical (almost everything happens in the cell) it never became boring and he behaved very well. In the tradition of "Cube" you felt trapped with the Characters and even if they were criminals, you developed some sympathy with some of them, only to change your mind with the turns of history. Some events caught you off guard and there was always some madness in the air. Overall, intense and fun and as I expected nothing (a friend rented it), it was a positive surprise!
