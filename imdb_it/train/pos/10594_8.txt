Passport to Pimlico is a real treat for all fans of British cinema. Not only is it a funny and very funny comedy, but it is a cinematic flashback of a bygone era, with attitudes and scenarios unfortunately only a memory in British life. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway plays the resident of Pimlico Arthur Pemberton, who after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb, discovers a wealth of medieval treasure belonging to the 14th-century Duke of Burgundy that was buried deep under the their small suburban street for the last 600 years. <br /> <br /> Accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by King Edward IV of England (which was never officially rescinded) to state that that particular London street had been declared Burgundian land, which means that in the eyes of international law, Pemberton and other local residents are no longer British subjects, but natives of Burgundy and their tiny via an independent country in its own right and a law unto itself. <br /> <br /> This sets the battered and impoverished returns of war bruises are good in that they believe they are outside the jurisdiction and jurisdiction of the English, so in an act of drunken defiance they burn their ration books, they destroy and ignore their clothing coupons, clearly ignore the British licensing laws, etc., declaring themselves completely independent of Britain. <br /> <br /> However, what happens afterwards is always spad, the black Moroccan and the dishonest swindler follow the example and cross the "border" in Burgundy as a refuge from the law and the post-war restrictions to sell the their deceptive assets and half of London's consumers follow them to dodge the ration, making their quiet little paradise, a den of thieves and a fairly crowded one. <br /> <br /> Appealing to Whitehall for assistance, I am said that due to developments this is "now a foreign policy issue, that His Majesty's government is reluctant to get involved" leaving the high and dry residents. However, they declare the area a legal frontier and as such establish a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road, mainly to monitor smuggling rather than ensuring security for Pimlico residents. <br /> <br /> Eventually the border is completely closed, starting a great siege, with the inhabitants of Bugundian slowly losing water and food, but never fighting in true British style. As a bugundian resident says, "we are English and we have always been in English, and it is only because we are English, we are fighting so hard to be bugundians" <br /> <br /> A feeling that soon echoes throughout the capital as when the rest of London learns of the poor situation of the Bugundi they all feel obliged to throw themselves and help them, throwing food and supplies on the blocks of barbed wire. Will Whitehall, who thus fought the invaders over the centuries can finally be brought to his knees by this new group of foreigners, especially since these are English !!!! <br /> <br /> Great story and fun in everything. Not to be missed.
