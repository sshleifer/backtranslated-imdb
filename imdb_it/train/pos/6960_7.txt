A boy desperate for action to hit a gorgeous girl in a bus. She refuses him, but when she runs after someone trying to steal her purse they still gather. And there begins - a relationship that is slightly contaminated by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It cannot be a secret that things between them will be problematic. <br /> <br /> In short, a story that could promise to become an interesting film. And IMO, it manages to be a good film. It's not a masterpiece, but it made me cry with laughter on more than one occasion - the two protagonists go around each other in a crazy festival of love that is, even with the superhero thing, believable. <br /> <br /> So. Subtle story, but it worked in a really fun and therefore worthy of the time of the cinema. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 broken hearts
