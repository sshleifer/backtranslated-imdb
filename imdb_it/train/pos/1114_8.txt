At the moment I remember being quite surprised and amused by this movie. I referred to it as the most important film I had seen in ten years, and I found myself bumping into people who said similar things. <br /> <br /> Bernhard has an unusually perceptual behavioral notebook. And it shaped the adolescent's bitter personality that we all had, in a corrosive and adult worldview. The two together provide a surprising mix that could be too edgy for some viewers. (Hi Skip. I wish you weren't my brother, so I could ****!) <br /> <br /> Bernhards searches for himself after returning to LA from New York, results in the engaging test of various people (all unsuitable) for our enjoyment, but enough of them involve acting to appeal to a system of "black imperative" values ​​that the true barometer of his compensation is if black culture accepts it. (It's been a while, Nina Simone comes to mind and in the film she has an impressive and solid black lover) A rather black girl takes part in the shows and seems to authorize Sandra's darkness, but in the end she refuses. <br /> <br /> Just as Catholics consider themselves fortunate to suffer for Christ, here Sandra finds herself suffering at the hands of a black culture in which she craves a place; as if he loved his dignity and his refusal. It is the only value system involved in the world of cinema, outside the artistic confusion of Bernhard. <br /> <br /> For a nation whose main problems are racism and money, it is refreshing to see one of the 2 topics dealt with in an atypical way.
