The original animated Dark Knight returns in this ace adventure film that rivals Mask of Phantasm in its coldness. There is a lot of style and intelligence in Mystery of the Batwoman, much more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. There is a new criminal on the streets of Gotham. It dresses like a bat but is not an adult Batgirl. And Batman is denying any affiliation with her. Meanwhile Bruce Wayne has to do with the usual novels and detective work. But the Penguin, Bain and local Mob make things a little more complicated. <br /> <br /> I had no great hopes for this "one since I was very disappointed but the weak Batman: Sub Zero (Robin isn 'I put a lot of emphasis here!), but I was delighted by the imaginative and exciting sets , with a clever plot and a cheeky sense of humor, this is definitely a movie that no Batman fan should be without. Keep your ears open for a really catchy song called "Betcha Neva" which is featured all over the world. br /> <br /> It's a pity that the DVD is not so great, don't get me wrong there are some great features (the short 'Chase Me' is awesome) and a fantastic Dolby 5.1 soundtrack but ... the movie is presented in Pan and Scan Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman was designed and shot in 1.85: 1 but this DVD is presented in 1.33: 1 in comparison to the widescreen clips shown on the features in which the image is cut on both sides. I find the fact c. Extremely annoying he Mask of Phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen format. Warner had to re-release literally dozens of films on DVD because people complained about the lack of original proportions available on some titles. Because they have chosen to make the same mistake here again it is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I would give this DVD 5/5 but the lack of OAR brings the overall score to 4/5. It's a shame because the widescreen would have completed a great DVD package.
