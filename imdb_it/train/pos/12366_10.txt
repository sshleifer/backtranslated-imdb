Wonderful movie, one of the best horror movies of the 70s. She is realistic settings and atmospheres. As usual, the usual negative comments were inevitable. I have noticed that most horror movies of a certain period often fail to reach even enough. Obviously because most horror films are old and must be denigrated, it's like a mental mechanism that moves the minds of the potential of music critics here. Before reading the review I already knew what the final judgment was. In the film a good gift because 10 is really well done. Raines reads quite well and the film as a way in which it was produced reminds me of many Kubrick films. It really has an impression. An excellent film indeed. I consider a cinematographic anthology of the 70s.
