Unfortunately, this film has never been on DVD. I saw it when it first came out in theaters in 1983, and then again when the VHS was released in 1992. When I recently saw a VHS copy at a flea market, I bought it immediately. I was not disappointed. First, the obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and a joy to see. But then, the film takes you into an unreal world where you have to reflect on your values ​​and decide what is really important to you. The film is about many things. It is about how the World Bank and large corporations exploit and enslave developing countries with their capitalist schemes to force them into a debt they can never repay. It concerns the way in which our economic system exploits us by forcing us to borrow with credit cards, mortgages and car payments. It is about trying to save innocence that perhaps we never had and perhaps we can't really save. It concerns good and evil and how difficult it is sometimes to distinguish one from the other. It raises many questions but does not give answers. I think sometimes this is good. For this reason, this is a film that is really worth saving and seeing.
