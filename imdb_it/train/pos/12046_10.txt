There is nothing scary about the modern "horror" which is an insult to the word "horror". Freddie Vs Jason, the films Scream, Cabin Trash, and in particular Stephen King's childish attempts - recycled every story from The Monkey's Paw to anything, often in the same story - with horror both in writing and in the movie (except the version by Kubrick of The Shining that was actually scary, unlike King's books that are as scary as my big toe - the left one, which still has a fingernail. <br /> <br /> But The Woman In Black is that rare modern movie that will make the hair behind the neck stand upright, so it should be done, the director creates tension, and the scariest ghost ever seen simply simply making it suddenly stand somewhere with that incredible look on her face , then brings everything to a horrible, disturbing neighbor, he learned his lessons from the masters who knew how to do horror: Val Lewton (original Cat People) and Robert Wise (a disciple and director of Val Lewton of The Haunting in nd The Body Snatcher), Jacques Tou rnier (another disciple of Val Lewton who directed a horrible zombie film, not the rough garbage Raimi did (coarse is not scary, folks, it's just lousy), and Lewis Allen ( The Uninvited), and of course Jack Clayton to Henry James The Innocents, and the way the master of suspense, Hitchcock, can still take you to the edge of your seat even with a period piece in slow construction like Under Capricorn. <br /> <br /> TEN STARS ...
