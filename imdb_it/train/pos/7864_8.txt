This is yet another Madhur Bhandarkar film. I'm not sure why he has this obsession of showing talented children and concepts to the Indian public, but I find some of those scenes really disgusting! What's new? It's a beautiful piece put together by Bhandarkar, where it shows the story of an entertainment reporter played by the star of the famous film, Mr & Mrs Iyer. What makes this film different is that it also covers the stories of people this reporter interacts with or is a friend of, like his roommates, colleagues, movie stars, models, rich characters and others featured on page # 3 entertainment in his newspaper. <br /> <br /> Remarkable: it is another good performance by Mrs. Iyer. It is likely that she is noted for this role. He does selective roles but shines in them. It is remarkably de-glamorous and less beautiful in this film. But then the entertainment journalists shouldn't overshadow the people they cover, right? Verdict: Madhur has come up with another good movie, which brings social issues into the limelight very well. However, this film loses focus and you are not sure what the director is trying to convey. <br /> <br /> Are you trying to show us the pomp and charm of the rich? or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and that contrasts with the life of the real crime reporter? Are you trying to tell us how the government and the rich govern the press? or is trying to illustrate problems with child abuse and ordinary people. Other concepts include the unwritten rule that young women must sleep with directors or co-stars if they wish to enter Bollywood. <br /> <br /> Also, talk about how flight attendants get sick and get tired of their jobs after a while and take extreme measures by marrying many elderly people, etc. It also speaks of unhappy women and spoiled children in rich families. <br /> <br /> This was all ok for me ... but it could be too complex for an average filmmaker, who just wants to relieve stress from everyday work
