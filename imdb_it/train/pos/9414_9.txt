Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work besides Star Wars, Alec Guinness has produced incredible work - particularly in the 1940s and 1950s - ranging from dramas to extravagant comedies. I particularly like his comedies, because they are so well made and they look so natural and real on the screen - very different from the usual Hollywood stuff. <br /> <br /> That said, this was the film that aroused my interest in these films. The plot was so strange and pretty that it is very unlikely that the film would be made anywhere, except for Ealing Studios, which had a particular fondness for "small" films like this. <br /> <br /> Guinness is a nerdy little scientist who works for a textile company. He wants to experiment to create an indestructible synthetic fabric, although he doesn't work for the company as a researcher but for the cleaning job! Thus, it tends to sneak into laboratories (during the day if no one is suspicious or at night) and tries to invent. Repeatedly, he is captured (like after blowing up the lab) and given the boot until one day it actually happened! Then, despite the importance of the discovery, it unleashes a completely unexpected chain of events - and then the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The film is a wonderful satire that makes fun of the industry, the unions, the government and people in general.
