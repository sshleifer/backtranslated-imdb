Netflix should mention this brief information function for Silk Stockings. Superior in every way to that excessively produced fluff. This has had much better Cole Porter songs and much more energy. Silk Stockings proved to be a great disappointment. Fred was getting too old for this kind of thing, even though the dances and Cyd are adorable. I will be on my guard for the Garbo version - Melvyn Douglas of Ninotchka. Peter Lorre was ill during the making of Silk Stockings - does he seem to be very passive in the most active numbers and with less lines? Very happy to have met Paree - Paree by pure chance. It made the whole experience much more enjoyable. Bob Hope, as a simple "singer and dancer" is pure joy.
