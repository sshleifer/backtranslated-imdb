In Iran, women are not allowed to play football. Officially it is because they must be spared from the vulgar language and the behavior of the male public. But of course it's about sexism. Women are inferior forms of human beings. <br /> <br /> Some brave girls oppose this and try to enter the stadium using different tricks. They are captured by soldiers and held in a kind of cage, until the police come to pick them up. <br /> <br /> Despite the crazy situation, this is a very humorous film. It is also encouraging to see how people always find different ways to combat oppression. You will feel touched at the same time that you will have a lot of laughter. Great work by director Jafar Panahi. This is in many ways a heroic comedy.
