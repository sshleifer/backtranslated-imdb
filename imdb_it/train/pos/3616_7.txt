Unknown cast Michelle Rodriguez in the role of Diana was a stroke of genius. She is perfect. His inexperience in acting really works in his favor. We've never seen it before, so it really looks like it's history. It also carries real strength. But this works against her, because we never doubt it. You never have to cheer for her to win because she never goes against any fighter we don't think she can beat. Like a boxing movie, it fails. <br /> <br /> So again, this is not really a boxing movie. How do you make a film about a girl who wants to be a boxer who isn't a boxing movie? You do not do it. But Karyn Kusama has it anyway. Like many indie films, "Girlfight" challenges the classification or genre and stands alone as a folklore that could embody something similar in real life. <br /> <br /> Diana is hurting at school. He beats the people he doesn't like (all the other girls in his school, for example). She doesn't adapt to her. His father is forcing his little brother Tiny to learn to box so he can defend himself when things get tough. He gives Tiny money for his boxing sessions and gives Diana nothing, as if he didn't need to defend himself, or something useful to do with his life. Tiny wants to go to art school (clich√©, crap), so he abandons his boxing allowance to Diana, who actually wants to box. Things get complicated when Diana falls in love with another boxer, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who is trying to become a professional. From there the story unfolds towards the inevitable ... the two meet in the struggle for the amateur title. <br /> <br /> What left me cold is that I've never found anything so interesting. It's all just a little too believable. Children with difficult lives growing up in rough urban areas fall back on sports. Many professional boxers have grown from these circumstances. The mental and physical strength that this education requires lends itself to a game like boxing, where anger is your friend. So this time it's a girl. A big problem. <br /> <br /> Or there is another position to take: finally, a boxing movie about a girl. Women's boxing has been around for a long time. The brutality we usually see in boxing movies is replaced here by discussions about people's lives and their feelings. The whole combat thing is used as a platform from which to paint a larger picture. Respect. Overcoming adversity. Self-discovery. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Girlfight" because it has a good spirit and is an example of a great work by a director at the same time. Dialogue never exceeds the quality of soap operas, but history itself has actually changed my point of view on some things. Yes, the world now seems like a better place. A film did this. <br /> <br /> Vote: B-
