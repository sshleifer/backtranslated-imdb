Here is the kind of love story I like to watch. And above all, it is for two reasons. One, focuses on young, VERY young people. People who are still teenagers and are experiencing love for the first time, or at least think they are. All of us have been there in our lives and "The man in the moon" is a magnificent reflection on our memories, perhaps adding some other details and improving it more than anyone of us has ever experienced. The second reason is that it is a love triangle. And I think, as a teenager, it's the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you think the characters can really be in love, or that they are so new to love that they firmly believe they are and after a tragedy or something similar happens, they will believe it for the rest of their lives. <br /> <br /> The cast of "The Man in the Moon" is full of great names of talent. He is played by Sam Waterston, who is truly a versatile actor, capable of interpreting both difficult district lawyers and strict fathers, but wise and careful as in this film. Also there are Tess Harper, Jason London and a young and young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the talented young actress at the age of fourteen and think that about ten years later, she will win the Oscar. All cast members show off excellent performances and with the engaging dialogue of the script, they are exalted to look like real people in real situations. As if it really happened. This type of film that I would like to see will come out more often. Love story or not. I would like to see films that make everything seem real and not at all fake or incredible.
