I don't have much to add to my summary, this film is placed right there with Top Gun as one of the funniest movies ever made while I didn't try to be. I for one don't think it should be taken seriously when it is seen as very funny. <br /> <br /> I don't think it reduces the reputation of Christopher Walken either as his reputation was declining then later. Pulp Fiction served to wake him from the torpor in which he had been. As for Michael Ironside, he was in some of the funniest while not trying to be a serious movie. Total Recall, Top Gun. What I think is surprising is the budget of this film. Scenes, actors, explosions, etc. They are quite surprising, so obviously someone really liked it and is willing to risk a lot of money. Whoever he or she was, I like them because I love this movie! <br /> <br /> If someone reads this in search of information on McBain (and I seriously doubt that there are too many), know that it's a hilarious movie and should be seen with a smile on your face!
