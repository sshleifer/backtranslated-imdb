I really like the 101 Dalmations when it came out in 1996, now 5 years later I went to see 102 dalmations in 2001, I thought it was great but I think the 101 is better because I think it's more fun, more humorous, and even that movie was based on the same story of the cartoon version (one hundred and one dalmazioni (1961) I wonder if there are plans for 103 Dalmations. I hope there is, maybe yes, maybe not, all of us Dalmatia fans will have to find out if there are 103 dalmazioni in the future.
