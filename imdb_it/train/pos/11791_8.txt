This is a very intriguing short film by David Lynch, and to say that the name David Lynch is probably enough for many people. This is your typical Lynch short. A blonde and a brunette are in a dark room. The blonde has cried, the brunette is talking in a threatening way to the blonde, and that's all. <br /> <br /> With many moments of silence, but with the disturbing music of Angelo Badalamenti, there is a strange form of suspense. This short looks a bit like "Mulholland Dr.", a movie I loved, so I liked that too. It's probably particularly for Lynch fans, but there's a chance you like it.
