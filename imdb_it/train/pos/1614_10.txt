There is nothing you don't like about Moonstruck. I come from an Italian family in New York and actually get a little nostalgic when I look at it. The actors and actresses, the plot, the subplots, the humor .. they were all fantastic. Start a little slow, but a lot happens in those two days! I fell in love with LaBoheme because of this movie. In my list of favorite movies, Moonstruck is the number 3. It is a "feel good" movie where you leave the theater hum "that is love" or repeat some of your favorite jokes: "old, if you give those dogs another piece of my food, I'll kick you until you're dead "; "Chrissy, bring me the big knife", "who's dead", "do you love Loretta ..... well because when you do they make you crazy because they know they can do it". I always wear Moonstruck when there is nothing nice to look at because it makes me happy.
