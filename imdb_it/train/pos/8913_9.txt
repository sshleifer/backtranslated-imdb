This is my favorite classic. It was shot a little west of Philadelphia, PA when I was 13, in 1957, and released the following year. Then, in 1970, I found myself working in the same county as a rookie PA state soldier. I've always enjoyed checking out the different places where the scenes were shot. I knew the owner of the Downingtown Diner well, and he had a sign that told all passing motorists that this was the "blob house". The theater scene was in Phoenixville, near Valley Forge Park and today it still shows movies!
