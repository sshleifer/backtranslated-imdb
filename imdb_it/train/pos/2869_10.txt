First of all, I want to say, "Thank you, Disney, for having finally released the movie" Cinderella "on DVD! Now you have all the Disney animated films on DVD (including Limited Editions 1999)! What are you going to do next ? You're going to Disney World !!!!! "Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) <br /> <br /> However, Disney remains magical in its 1950s animated film "Cinderella", the film that put fairy tale films on the map. We all know the story of Cinderella, her stepsisters, her date, the glass slipper, the pumpkin that turns into a carriage just to say "Bippity-boppity-boo!" And, of course, trying to get home by midnight! <br /> <br /> What I like about this film: It's a great old tale that kids like, now in a cinematic form (as in DVD) !!!!! <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" - thanks, Disney !!!!! 10 stars.
