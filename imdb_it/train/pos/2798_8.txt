Jess is 18, is very intelligent and wants nothing more than to play soccer, when she joins a local team, has to lie to her parents again and again, because they would never approve of her pursuit of her dream, they want her to settle with a nice Indian guy and learns to cook. <br /> <br /> Bend it Like Beckham is a very funny film, which doesn't need to be deep and complex, it's ok as it is. The cast are all very good and play their roles very well, the plot is simple and predictable, but it works perfectly and the script is very realistic and very funny. <br /> <br /> A great film for 8/10 families
