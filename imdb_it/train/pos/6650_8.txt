I don't want to comment on how good the movie was or what the flaws were because I'm not a professional film critic and I don't have enough knowledge of filmmaking. What I know is that making this type of film in your first shot is a great achievement and I would like to congratulate the director for this. However, in some reviews I read, critics complained that Hiralal's relationship with his brothers was not highlighted, and his brothers were completely erased from the story. Now I really want to raise a point that, as the name of the film suggests, is not a film about Hiralal's brothers, it's a film about the relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his son Hiralal Gandhi, nothing more, nothing less. If we start to complain about the fact that some characters are kept out of play in the film, it would be a bit unfair because these characters don't fit the figure, no matter how relevant they were in real life. So I think it would be better if we stick to the main idea and stop satisfying a critic in ourselves. <br /> <br /> Have fun !!!!
