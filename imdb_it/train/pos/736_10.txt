A must for any punk rocker, this is the film that made The Ramones a household name in the early 1980s (when it first appeared on premium cable stations). This was one of the first and best films of American punk rock, with a classic cult status up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Originally the producers wanted Cheap Trick as the stars, but the release of the "Live At Budakon" album had simply made them superstars and an object too hot to be in a low budget movie. Very good luck for the Ramones who were trying to get out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market (which unfortunately never happened until after the band disappeared). The band, Dee Dee in particular, has always enjoyed the film in the 80s but the fans have always loved and could play most of the film while waiting to enter the Ramones shows. This film, like most of the classics, is a stupid fun with some classic Ramones movies from the golden age. Don't expect more, you won't find it. It's a lot of fun, so have fun. Another similar classic Allan Arkush movie is Get Crazy, with Lee Ving from the legendary hardcore punk band Fear.
