Man On Fire tells the story of a former special forces man with an alcoholism problem who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard for a child in Mexico during the wave of ransom kidnappings. At first he is not kind, but then they huddle together, decide to stop drinking etc., etc ... then one day he is kidnapped ... and killed ... <br /> <br / > HE, he will stop at nothing to get revenge. <br /> <br /> This is basically the story of Man On Fire, but expect some great twists at least a few times including the ending that is beautiful and will probably make you cry. <br /> <br /> This is also due to the great music composed by Harry-Gregson Williams and Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator). <br /> <br /> But the strongest part of the film ... wait .. the thing is that everything here is perfect. <br /> <br /> First - acting. Denzel Washington is at its best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken are as good as ever, the great Radtha Mitchell and the young INCREDIBLE Dakota Fanning. And that's not the end of the list ... <br /> <br /> Then comes the cinematography which is amazing and along with the superb montage, it should have won an Oscar for sure. <br /> <br /> The story is ... not just a revenge movie. The story is smart, the plot makes you think ... and it's pure beauty. Really. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you have to see in your life, at least once!
