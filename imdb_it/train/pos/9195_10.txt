I don't give a movie or a show ten very often, but this show has caught my nerve in a way no other show has. I found the whole series on mysoju.com and thought the premise was interesting, so I took a look. I was not disappointed by what I saw; I was moved. This story remains on the soft side as the main characters move us through the scenes. Sumire Iwaya, meticulously interpreted by Koyuki, shows us human nature because he wants problems to not be shown. No one really wants to lay down their soul in front of a prospective partner. Thus, instead, he replaces a human being, played by an adorable Matsumoto Jun, as a pet. This pet is like any other creature we would consider a pet. The difference; he can take revenge in the same way, after all Momo is a man, not a dog. Because it is treated as a pet, it reacts to situations in which a dog might react. Spends time with the new boyfriend, Momo becomes jealous. It is when he realizes that his pet is not just a pet and that the sexual tension between the two begins to become dense - Momo is a dance prodigy. His way of thinking changes slowly as we begin to take a look at his thoughts. Matsumoto takes us from seeing a character that is very one-dimensional at the beginning, to two dimensions when we see that he is a dancer, to a three-dimensional character when we see him start to fall for his master like a man, not like a dog. In my opinion, it's worth looking at this story just to see how this character develops. Also Matsumoto plays Momo with such tenderness that you will almost begin to wish I had one too. Neither of them wants to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but as Momo says (the name she gives him the name of their new puppy) he says ?? we both knew he wouldn't be able to last. Watch this show with an open mind, it's worth it.
