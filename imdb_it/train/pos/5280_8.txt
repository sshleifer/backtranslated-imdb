Reda is a young Frenchman of Moroccan origin. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is very French in his attitudes and values. Suddenly, his father announces that Reda will take him to the Hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca - something that Reda has no interest in doing but only accepts as an obligation. As a result, Reda is angry, but being a traditional Muslim man, his father has difficulty talking or discussing his fears. Both the father and the son seem very rigid and inflexible - and it is very ironic when the father tells his son that he should not be so stubborn. <br /> <br /> When I read the summary, he talks about how the characters grew and began to know each other. However, I don't think they did and this is the fascinating and sad aspect of the film. Of course, there were times of understanding, but so often there was a background of hostility and repression. I actually liked it and appreciated the fact that there wasn't a complete resolution of this - as it would have seemed fake. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is well acted and fascinating - giving Westerners an unusual vision of Islam and the Hajj. It also provides a fascinating juxtaposition between traditional Islam and the secular generation of young people. While the slow pace and lack of clarity about the relationship during the film can annoy some, I think it gave the film an intense realism and made it look like a movie about people - not a formula. A beautiful and unusual film.
