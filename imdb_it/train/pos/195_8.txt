"Show People" is an absolutely delightful silent film directed by King Vidor and starring Marion Davies and Billy Haines. What gems of both are in this charming comedy about a girl, Peggy Pepper, whose acting is Savannah's speech trying to do it on the big screen. Although it is a success in comedy, what he wants to do is "make art", so he moves to the Alta Arts Studio. He soon becomes Patricia Pepoire and is too good for his friend Billy. <br /> <br /> Many stars of the silent era have cameos in "Show People", including Davies herself without curly hair and makeup. I am sure that when people saw the film in 1928, they recognized all those who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene; unfortunately, nowadays, it is not the case, even for cinema lovers. In one part of the film, however, he meets Charlie Chaplin; in another, the author Elinor Glyn is shown to her, and Vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film. Other stars that appear in "Show People" are John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Leatrice Joy, Bess Flowers, Renee Adoree, Rod LaRoque, Aileen Pringle and many others. <br /> <br /> Davies was adorable and a lively comedy. It's a shame that William Haines left the movies - he was cute and energetic, deservedly a huge star throughout the day. <br /> <br /> "Show People" is a simple story told in a witty way. It's also a look back at an exciting era in Hollywood history and contains performances by two wonderful stars.
