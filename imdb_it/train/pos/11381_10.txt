The best part of An American In Paris is the long sequence of ballets at the end, in which Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the living personification of several great painters. Kelly was previously established as a pavement artist in Paris, so the sequence is the logical conclusion to a musical full of life and energy, Gershwin songs and cast members like Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant. Kelly was at his best here - he's a little different from Singin 'in the Rain, and the effect of the whole movie like the one overtaken by the ballet gives him a definite wow factor. No wonder the sequence ended "That's Entertainment" after all the other MGM musical highlights had passed!
