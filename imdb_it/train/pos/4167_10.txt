The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell is really a good movie. He has good acting in the cast, including Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong. The music is spooky and gives that diabolical cold! I liked the effects on the dog and I think the creature itself was really beautiful with its horns, a volute like a part on the neck, and it acted really viscous! If you like horror movies and I haven't seen The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell before and I can find and buy this rare movie, then do it because it's a good movie and I don't think you'll be disappointed!
