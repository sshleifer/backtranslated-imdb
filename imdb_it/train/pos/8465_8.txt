The Booth gives a completely new twist to your typical J-horror movie. This film puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story. The director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks. <br /> <br /> The story speaks of the perception of the people who work, of the life and loves of our protagonist, and how he perceives the people around him in a DJ booth of the antiquated radio station. The story detaches the main character's layers like an onion in flashbacks while the film takes its course, and from it we learned that things are not always what they seem. The film took place mostly in a study of the outdated radio station, with a very bad story, in which the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show due to the radio station being re-located. It is from this narrow space that this film thrives and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid. Sometimes our protagonist cannot determine that the strange events in the old studio were caused by ghosts or some conspiracy by his collaborators or if it was all in his mind. What I like about this film is that the directors make you see through the eyes of the protagonist and make you as paranoid as the protagonist was. This film is a rather short smart 76-minute film.
