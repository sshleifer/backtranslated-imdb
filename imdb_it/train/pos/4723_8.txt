I really enjoyed this little movie. It is a moving film about the struggle, sacrifice and above all the bonds of friendship between different peoples (the child actor who plays Miki is particularly good). There are so many large-scale impersonal films set in the Second World War that this convincingly told little story is a real break from the norm, and an original one in this. I will also add that this film is far from boring, far away !! Obviously the horses are wonderful and the scenery breathtaking. For all those who truly treat their animal as part of the family (I do), this film is particularly gratifying. Recommended for movie fans who are looking for something different.
