The ship may have sunk but the movie is not! The director, James Cameron, of "The Terminator" did it again with this fantastic photo. One of my favorite scenes is the scene 'The Dinner table', in which Rose's family and friends meet Jack after saving her. Rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when she meets 'THE ONE' ... I hope I have that look when I'm in the room with my future husband. <br /> <br /> Jack and Rose have a connection that is "MOVIE STUFF" but it's good movie stuff. We have the greedy mother and all her elites linked to members who live by the wealth of their husbands. Rose almost commits suicide but Gilbert Grape's star saves her. I really liked the hanging on the boat scene. It was a nice risk. <br /> <br /> The film is long but it's fantastic !!! Nice story, good flow, good actors !!! Go see it twice if you want, it's worth it !!!
