I saw it in the early 1970s (when I was 16), and despite the long slow set-up, meetings, riots, etc., Once the desert section started, everything fell into context and the I loved it. (Still, he has aged very well.) I was then in what appeared to be a small minority. All the criticisms seemed to focus on the lack of action and narrative. Fortunately I am no longer in such a minority. <br /> <br /> Skilfully shows (in a somewhat prophetic way) the political splinters, riots, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialization and deception that await us. <br /> <br /> The appreciation for this masterful film has grown, and I'm happy about it.
