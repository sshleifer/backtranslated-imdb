The good western filmed in the wilds of rocky Arizona. A lot of tough guys in everything; Cobern's character seemed to swing back and forth between a furious psychopath and a relaxed type. In the photo several holes have appeared, but not enough to compensate for the fact that it is exciting and worthy of being seen. A really stupid scene shows that Heston empties 45 cases of dust and collects it in a sack in order to light a fire. A. To collect all that gunpowder, he would need a pack mule to carry the ammunition. B. The grass was obviously dry: why not drop a match and let it tear?
