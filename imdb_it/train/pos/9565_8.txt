Dog Bite Dog will not be for everyone, but I loved it. Full of slaps, stabs and gunfire (but don't worry, lead is a terrible blow), it can best be described as a violent clash between Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pang, a Cambodian murderer in the city to kill a lawyer. Despite being dirty from his trip, he is almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant. If this sounds incredibly implausible to you, you should probably avoid this movie. It was my inspiration to suspend disbelief, and I enjoyed it much more. <br /> <br /> Chasing Pang down is Wai (Sam Lee), a young and angular cop who likes to beat people up almost as much as he likes to smoke. Wai walks on a thin line that has internal affairs investigating him, and his father, a legendary Good Cop, is in a coma following a drug deal that went south (the implication is that Wai is letting his father take rap for his own corrupt relationships). <br /> <br /> There are car accidents, lots of murders and a strange and strange love story offered here, all interpreted in a comic book style. I suspect that humor was intentional (no one uses cement bastard gargantuanas without an eye for extravagant absurdity), although the exaggerated nature has lost a number of members of my audience. There are at least three points where the film could be finished, and at 109 minutes it could have benefited from a more ruthless editing, or the cancellation of one of the narrative threads (the light-hearted things worked well, so I would have left out the interactions with the three fathers ). <br /> <br /> Am I inclined to give him a (high) pass, however, if only for the finale ?? I have rarely heard so many people laugh so hard at what should have been a touching moment. This is one to see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous
