I found "Time At The Top" a fun and challenging experience. The acting, although not generally brilliant, was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good. Being a film obviously aimed at young demographics, it is certainly one of the best works of its kind (Children's Sci-Fi). Normally, I would say that Canada, the UK and Australia produce the best movies and TV shows for children, and "Time At The Top" does nothing to discard this theory! I don't think that continuity and great acting are important for young people. A good storyline and an imaginative script are much more important to them. Both are in abundance in this film. The special effects are good, without detracting from the plot, or closing the spectators from their own imagination. It would have been very easy to inject an SFX overload into this film, but it would have completely destroyed his entire 'Raison d'etre'. <br /> <br /> The settings and camera work are of the highest standard in this film, and complement the refined wardrobe and historical accuracy. Overall, this film is very satisfying and I recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through the eyes of children or those who try to do it, like me! Now, I really need to read the original book as soon as possible.
