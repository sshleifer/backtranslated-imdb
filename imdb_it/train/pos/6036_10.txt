I'm definitely not in the target of this film. I am a nearly 50 man who has only recently stumbled into the world of independent cinema. This happened quite by accident, with the discovery of a movie called Clerks late one night on television. The first two things I noticed about that movie were that it was 1) technically amateur and 2) brilliantly written. When I read an interview with the director in the local newspaper and said that one of his influences was Clerks, I started to get interested. When he said his main influence was The Station Agent, a movie I had seen on DVD a week ago, I decided I had to go and have a look. The result could be described along the same lines as Clerks, although the two films are not as happy. Both films suffer from technical blunders that are overcome through incredible writing. While Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life and is afraid of asking difficult questions about himself and his situation, Less Like Me talks about a man who seems forced to be constantly busy, he is always running one way or another, filling his life with little things so that he will never have to face the big ones. The themes and ideas of this film are strong and moving. I can understand from watching it that not much has changed since I was growing up, young people still have the same problems they always have. The writer dresses these problems and themes in the modern vernacular, creates wonderfully honest characters and makes them do things that are completely credible. As for independent cinema, this may not be perfect from a technical point of view, but from an artistic point of view, it is very close.
