This was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no grandchildren or grandchildren, as noted elsewhere in IMDb), but he did a great matchmaker. He brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors. The supporting cast (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) were all clicked on the screen and made this experience fantastic. The fact that he drove a car to go around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to go around. And he wore stockings in a scene ... it is said, the professor never wore stockings! (Two new entries for IMDb's IMDb section.) Apart from the inaccuracies and historical inconsistencies, this was a great movie to watch with an exceptional cast. I give him an 8!
