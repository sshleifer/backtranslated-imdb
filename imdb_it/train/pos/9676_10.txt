The film was very sweet and moving! I cry almost every time I watch the movie. I would recommend this movie for everyone. The film was so inspiring for me. The actors did a great job of acting, and the film was well played and done. The film was about a little girl who owned a parrot she called Paulie. Paulie had detached herself from her parents because they thought it would be better for her. <br /> <br /> After Paulie had lived so many people he ended up in a cage alone in a basement. Finally this Russian who had found work in a place like a janitor. He had found Paulie in the basement and Paulie had begun to talk to him telling him the story of his life. Eventually the man helped Paulie reunite with Marie (the little girl who raised Paulie). Love has overcome all obstacles.
