Ida Lupino was one of the few women to overcome the glass ceiling of the Hollywood direction under the studio system. Not surprisingly, he also addressed proto-feminist issues that, when touched by everyone, were approached so cautiously in a way that was rarely clear enough what was being talked about. In Outrage, he deals with rape and its consequences, and even if for all the short it is called "criminal assault", he leaves, for once, without a doubt, what happened. <br /> <br /> Mala Powers (her official debut) plays an accountant secretary in a large industrial plant; she lives with her parents but is engaged to a smart boy (Robert Clarke), who has just gotten a raise and now earns $ 90 a week. Leaving the plant after working late one night, it finds itself being followed. In the following scene ?? the best of the movie ?? he tries to escape his pursuer in a prohibitive labyrinth of buildings and alleys, but fails. <br /> <br /> When he returns home, disheveled and in shock, the police can't get rid of her; he claims he never saw his attacker (who ran a snack truck outside the factory). Trying to pretend that nothing happened, she goes back to work but falls apart, thinking that everyone is staring at her, judging. Enters a state of escape, fleeing to Los Angeles on a bus but stumbling over a stop. <br /> <br /> Waking up on a strange farm, he learns that she was rescued by Tod Andrews, a young minister in a California farming town. He lies about his identity and takes a job packing the oranges. The two fall vaguely in love, but it is clear to Andrews that Powers is hiding terrible secrets. When, during a picnic in the company, she takes a wrench and breaks the skull of Jerry Paris, who was trying to steal a kiss, the truth about her past comes out .... <br /> <br / > It was a brave movie released in 1950, and this could explain and excuse some of its shortcomings. Lupino never resumes the verve of the scene of the first assaults, and the film goes out in the bucolic and sentimental, ending up being spoken and didactic. Yes, Lupino had important information to communicate, but he did not trust the narrative to speak for himself. His cast, pleasant but bland and generic, was not of great help, returning to melodramatic positions or home reassurance. But Outrage was a step forward, paving the way for a subsequent speech on what is really the crime of rape and its victims.
