God, I love this movie. If you grew up in the 80s and love Heavy Metal, this is the movie for you. They really don't improve that much. The Fastway soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks ever. I put on disk when it came out and spent the next month learning every song on the guitar note. The plot is your standard Heavy Metal horror movie. Kid's favorite singer dies. The child plays backwards. The hero returns in demonic form and tears the city to pieces. What more could you ask for? <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it yet, drop it and buy it. You will not be disappointed. Metal rules ...
