While flipping through the TV Guide and came across "Twisted Desire" in the movie section, I read his description. Three words caught my eye "Melissa Joan Hart" ... I find her role in "Sabrina: The Teenage Witch" absolutely vile, I hate that kind of programs, so I was thinking it would be an old boring, love story that interprets it ... I knew nothing about it. <br /> <br /> Finally it started on television, I had my bucket ready in case I had to throw up because of guilt or sloppy, you know what I mean. At first, you think she's just a pretty, normal girl who's in love, but she has bad parents. Then, when you find out that he has manipulated his boyfriend to kill his parents, so he could be with his true love, you are like "Whoa". You don't expect this kind of role for that kind of actress. He played his role very well in my opinion, I never expected her to behave like a bitch, and voila, she did it perfectly! Congratulations to you, the film was very good, I would look at it again and recommend it to others.
