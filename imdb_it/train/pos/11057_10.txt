I was 10 when this show was on TV. By far it was my favorite. The actors were very credible. Alexandra Bastedo was simply beautiful ... I order the DVD (15 episodes). They had no superpowers. They had only superior human abilities (strength, hearing, sight). The 3 actors were very good in their roles, very credible. There was a good story in each episode. At the time there were no special effects or explosions everywhere, so the script had to be good and the characters' performances were great. There were no fancy things, like in other shows. They didn't try to make a joke every 2 minutes to do a light show. I highly recommend this TV show to anyone who loves good things.
