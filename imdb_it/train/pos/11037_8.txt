Now, I know it's unlikely that the French inmates read Lovecraft (and this shows my view that his writings should be taught in school, perhaps as a separate topic), but how they thought something like "ftagn yog sototh" could lead to something good? <br /> <br /> The film takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cellmates stumble upon a magic book that can, if read right, get them out. While the prisons go, the cell was totally unrealistic, so I made it difficult for me to get into the atmosphere of things. It also moves rather slowly, which can bore people. But apart from that, this is a first-rate horror feeling, which mixes "hell is other people" by Sartre with a type of Lovecraft / Barker story, and that does quite well. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: take the time to look at this. This means not doing it when you're going to work or sleeping or doing something else. This is a film that works best if you are immersed in it. Lessons to learn: yoga is bad, almost like French women.
