Spirit is a unique and original look at western life from the perspective of a wild and native American horse. The film focuses on the friendships and dangers that a wild horse, the Spirit, encounters during his life. <br /> <br /> Very well done in the presentation, using the technology available today to offer extraordinary images that are breathtaking in their depth and realism. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic, with the songs of Bryan Adams and the music of Hans Zimmer, who was also responsible for the extremely popular music of the famous Disney movie of 1994, The Lion King. <br /> <br /> The story is not very deep, but the fact that it is not as thorough as some films, in my opinion, does not detract from the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> An excellent film that I enjoyed immensely and that is suitable for the whole family. Not one not to be missed. (10/10)
