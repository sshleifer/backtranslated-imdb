Accountant Shohei Sugiyama (Kôji Yakusho) feels bored with his routine life, limited to hard work and stays at home with his wife Masako Sugiyama (Hideko Hara) and his son's daughter. One night, while traveling home by train, he sees the beautiful face of Mai Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari) on the balcony of a dance school, and a couple of days later, he decides to visit the school and secretly take ballroom dancing every Wednesday night. However, he is ashamed to tell his family his secret. Meanwhile, Masako senses changes in her happier husband's behavior, and takes a private eye to investigate whether Shohei has a relationship. I just finished watching "Shall We Dansu?" and I really loved it. What a lovely and delightful movie! The story is incredibly good, with drama, comedy and romance. The cast is excellent, and I was particularly struck by the cold beauty and kindness of director Masayuki Suo's wife and professional dancer Tamiyo Kusakari. On September 6th I saw the American remake of "Shall We Dansu?" for the first time, and I found it delicious entertainment. But now I can say it's another unnecessary remake, and instead I recommend this original movie. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dança Comigo?" ("Dance with Me?")
