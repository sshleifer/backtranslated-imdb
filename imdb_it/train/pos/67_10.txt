The industry has dropped the ball on this. The trailer does not do the film justice and when it was opened it was full of screens. If people had the opportunity to see it, the work of the mouth would have been very successful. The two leading actresses offer great emotional performances that really involve you in history and in particular in the characters. I verified this based on the rave recommendation by Richard Roeper or (Ebert and Roeper) in his book. An example of a great film that has never been completely published except on some screens. Which gave him no chance of being seen. Some movies quickly switch to video because they are not so good. This is a worthy Oscar and it is a tragedy on many levels that most will never even hear about. Perhaps through word of mouth he will get a sequel on DVD or cable. If you haven't seen this movie you should. Great performances by the two leading actresses make this film. It may have been just another formidable film for teenagers after school, but instead holds up well to other noteworthy films. A girl interrupted comes to mind. If you like it, you will like this. <br /> <br /> Both girls find themselves in one extraordinary emotional scene after another without coming out as melodramatic. Although Alicia is angry and Deanna is crying for most of the film, it is done in such a real way that they are not interpreted as stereotyped or melodramatic characters. The film will move you to many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor, use these real performances like your school. Erica is even better in this respect than Traffic. I hope both of these actors get more roles using their talents and making them shine. Watch this movie and, if you want, recommend it to friends so they don't get lost in all the crap of success that comes out every year. This film was buried while Spiderman 2 broke records. What kind of word do we live in? AGHhh. So to make the world right again, see this and recommend it.
