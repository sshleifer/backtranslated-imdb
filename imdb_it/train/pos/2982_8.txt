I really enjoyed this movie. I firmly believe that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are comedic geniuses of our time. They have the extraordinary ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it ridiculous but in a realistic way ... if that makes sense. This is mainly what makes South Park really fun. Once the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet comic ever, in every episode we see the message that is transmitted. This is evident in BASEketball. Although it is directed by David Zucker and is completely ridiculous, he has a sincere message about the America of big business and the shame that is the main sport of the league. I'm also a sports fan so I find this movie hilarious sometimes because it's so true in that bizarre way that people hate to love. The opening prologue is brilliant ... laughing tears are formed every time I see soccer players start Riverdance! Some might not like this movie because it's not just everyone's cup of tea ... but, just like South Park, once the absurdity is overcome ... it has a truly genuine message transmitted through the genius of literal comics. I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars.
