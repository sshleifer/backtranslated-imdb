I was watching this movie on Friday 7th April. I didn't see the last scene (because I was talking to my mother and my sister at the same time). Can anyone tell me what happened to her? I observed that her husband was hearing someone talking to his wife in the bedroom and then opening the door, she is already dead. <br /> <br /> What happened to you? Did she kill herself? How could he organize everything like phone calls, meanwhile he's at home when her husband talks to this strange admirer? Anyone can explain, please. I'm so curious !! (In the end, I read that he suffered from Multiply Disorder Personality). <br /> <br /> Thnks first.
