Charleton Heston wore one, James Franciscus wore one, but Mark Wahlberg was not wearing the traditional flap. I hope nobody decides it as Tarzan. Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 films of Planet but Estrella Warren barely shows the décolleté: her hair is always in the way. Tim Burton could have had sex with this saga of monkeys and given the adults of the public something to watch. Even the caste Helena Bonham Carter never leaves her costume that looks like a big tent. She's pretty but all the love things are limited to look anxious and a little kiss at the end. As in Artificial Intelligence which discusses sex between robot and human species of animals, but which never delivers - the planet of the apes suggests an inter-species novel between humans and apes but only suggestions. Lisa Marie is the only monkey who dares to be sexy. This film has three great actors Tim Roth, Mrs Carter and Paul Giamatti who chew the scenery like a trio of monkeys and are fun to watch. Superlative trick (a certain Oscar) costumes, set designs, music make this summer movie the success of 2001.
