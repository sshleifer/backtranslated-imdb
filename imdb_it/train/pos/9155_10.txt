Whoever invented history is a sick person. I rented it for the slumber party party and all six of them were crazy because we're all in an acting class together, and we know a couple of actors from the class. Besides all those who were screaming all night, I had frightening nightmares. I kept thinking oh my God, if I get up to go to the bathroom to pee, I'll be stabbed in the middle of drying or something. I couldn't even go to the bathroom because we watched this creepy horror movie. I also thought why all the girls are topless in this movie, but we don't have any of the boys' units? You should make a horror movie in which the killer is a girl and cut the units. I would watch it again and again. Call it hard or soft or something stupid like that. I'm giving a 9-bit movie just because you got me FREAKED FREAKS.
