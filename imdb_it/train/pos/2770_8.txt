Watching David and Bathsheba is a much better way to get the Bible lesson going to Sunday school. Despite a script that is sometimes unintentionally funny, the film is a lot of fun. The studio system had its flaws but spared no expense when sumptuous production was requested. Peck plays King David as a lustful but tormented poet who commits what amounts to killing a sexy Bathsheba, Susan Hayward, in bed. Raymond Massey as prophet Nathan delivers his usual saturnine and fierce performance. Look for the silent screen star Francis X. Bushman as King Saul and a young Gwen Verdon as a dancer. Hurray for the Old Testament and Hollywood.
