If there's a genre I've never been a fan of, it's the biographical film. Always misleading, full of false information, overly dramatized scenes and tricks all around, biographical films are almost never done well. Even in the hands of talented filmmakers like Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often do a disservice to the people they are trying to capture on the screen. Skeptiscism takes the place of the clamor with most biopics heading to the big screen and the Notorious Bettie Page is no different. Some critics and spectators objected to Gretchen Mol for the role of Bettie Page, saying she was no longer a celebrity and didn't have the ribs for the part. I never doubted that Mol could take care of the part since then, but I never expected to be more excited by his performance as I was watching the movie hours ago. Mol exhibits a performance worthy of an Oscar as the iconic pin-up of the Fifties, who, after a first life of abuse (painted with refinement and taste, something that few directors would probably do) inadvertently becomes one of the most talked-about models of all times . The image covers a lot of ground in its 90 minutes of execution and despite no less than three subplots, there is still the feeling that there may be a small part missing in the story. The director / co-writer Marry Harron and the fantastic screenplay by Guinevere Turner are only stained by too blunt and not as clear as it should be. However, we must give credit to the two women for having created an almost impeccable biopic that is able to pay homage to both the subject and the decade he emulates with mastery. Come to Oscar time, Mol, Turner and Harron should be nominated. I doubt it will happen, although certainly there are not three women more deserving than them. 9/10
