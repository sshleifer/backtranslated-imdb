No film caught my attention like this. See, I wanted to see this movie for over twenty-five years. The only time I saw him was as a teenager who may have been the year he was released in 1977. <br /> <br /> What I remember from the movie is that he touched those emotions so profoundly deep that there is still an overwhelming desire to see it again. The intrigue that this film provides from the human element of the father / son to research and research is sure to touch every human soul that looks at it. Because this film was not taken out of the archive and shown every time you find many other films of lesser depth, I don't know. <br /> <br /> Postscript: copy of the received film and after looking at it again it was a pleasure to see that my memory was true. The evaluation reflects the content of the film. I would like to see this film on DVD as seeing this 1977 production on a used VHS tape took away the overall quality.
