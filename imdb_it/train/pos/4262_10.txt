I saw it as many times as I could before he left the scene. A delightful and fun movie with some of my favorite stars. I just wish I could find him again! I would certainly buy / display if I could. Please, someone, bring it back. Fred MacMurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during World War II, and his protagonists, Joan Leslie and especially June Haver were beautiful and fascinating. It was a musical, but also romantic, fun and intelligent. This was my favorite movie with June Haver, although I always liked it. His dazzling smile lit up the screen, and his beauty and talent were a plus for each film. The supporting cast gave credit to their individual roles. A balanced and carefree film; I just wish there was more like it!
