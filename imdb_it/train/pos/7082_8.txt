First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take most of his films you will see that the characters have these moments where they are the same. His character in this film is far beyond every single one so far ... and the count. The story begins in the future (not so far) in which a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept away most of humanity from the face of the earth. The story seems to go towards SF, but I think it's closer to a drama because of the slow pace of the story. About that. Films tend to be faster and slower in some places and develop more towards the end than at the beginning, but as you see this movie you will be aware of this constant rhythm of history and revealing facts that do not accelerate or slow down. It is the one and the same speed that flows gently and quite well. But that doesn't mean that the ending won't make you lose your nerves, because it's pretty good. As for the direction, it's perfect. Films as such are easily destroyed by bad direction but this has become much better. So, if you're preparing to watch a science fiction movie or some action, you'll miss it. B There should be more films like this.
