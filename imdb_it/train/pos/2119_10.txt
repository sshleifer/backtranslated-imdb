"The Shop Around the Corner" is one of the great films of the director Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, he is full of an exceptional cast of prominent actors like Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart. They are the type of leading actors that Hollywood unfortunately no longer employs. In fact, the film itself is the kind of film that Hollywood no longer produces. (The producers of "You've Got Mail" claim that their movie is a remake, but this is nothing but a lot of self-inflicted praise.) However, if you have a fondness for romantic comedies of the 1940s, you'll find "The Shop Around the Corner" to be nothing short of wonderful. Equally good with repeated views. To enjoy!
