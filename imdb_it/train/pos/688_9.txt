I had the pleasure of seeing this movie at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and I was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is clearly a great writer and I would like to see more of her films. If you could do what you did with the budget of this movie, I'm very anxious to see what you can do with an important photo. Congratulations to the cast for their formidable performances (that little girl was golden), and for anyone who composed the music. The deformed "Row Your Boat" shocked me. Very creative film all around ... I really hope to see it come out on video or on DVD because I would buy it in a second. If you get the chance, you should definitely watch this movie.
