The barbarians are perhaps not the best film that any of us have ever seen, but really ???? ........ It's so funny ...... I can't say how much I had to laugh when I saw it for the first time ... The director really wanted to make a serious adventure movie, but it's also a bad bad ... so bad that it is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen ...... so my advice is that you should see it ..... and if you've already done it, do it again! !!!!!!
