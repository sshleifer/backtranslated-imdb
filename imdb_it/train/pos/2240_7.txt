My constant love for the Italian actress Lucianna Paluzzi, who helped to restart my puberty with her performance in the 1965 movie "Thunderball", took me to some rather unusual places. Case in point, this British curiosity of 1959, "Carlton-Browne of the F.O.", which presents Lucianna in one of her previous roles. She plays a princess in this, although the image is actually a showcase for the talents of Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers, both of whom the stars were certainly on the rise at this point. In this nice film, often very funny, we learn about the island of Gaillardia, an island similar to Madeira, which had been a British colony until 1916 and then universally forgotten. Forty-three years later, however, it becomes the center of world attention and international espionage when precious cobalt deposits are discovered, and His Majesty sends the impertinent Foreign Office's Carlton-Browne home. Terry-Thomas underestimates this part well, as do Sellers in his role as Prime Minister Amphibulos of the small country. (This was Sellers' second 1959 film about a small town that combined ingenuity with the world, the other was "The screaming mouse", of course.) Ian Bannen almost steals the show here as the gentle king of Gaillardia , and my girlfriend Lucianna is as attractive as she can be in her minor role. The film shows a lot about the way of very dry humor, even if there are some belly laughs (the reception at the Gaillard airport, for example, and especially that May Day-style parade of the Gaillard force). And the penniless Prime Minister of Sellers, with his cracked English and seemingly perpetual sweat stains, is yet another memorable character in the pantheon of this great actor. Despite the occasional case or two of indecipherable, rigid English chatter, I found this photo as a modest and winning entertainment, and well presented on this sparkling-looking DVD of Anchor Bay.
