I thought it was a very funny movie. I love movies for dogs and comedy films so combined that they were twice as good. K-9, k-911 and k-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is hysterical and Jerry Lee is hilarious and adorable and they make a great team. The only drawback is that I didn't really understand how Dooley's wife died. She died before this film, but how? If they said I must have lost it. Apart from that, I give him two inches / cross! Those dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) must have had a lot of training. They were so funny and all the sounds that Jerry Lee made when Dooley talked to him was so much fun. my favorite was when Jerry Lee sang and when he would bite private people to get very funny information
