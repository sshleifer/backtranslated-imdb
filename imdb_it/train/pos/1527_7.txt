Shocked when it came out, this movie now looks beautiful and sounds great. An intelligent and intelligent acting party, by Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially by Anton Walbrook, and a moving central performance of the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger doesn't jump around and shows his long breaks that encourage you to listen and reflect, and Graham Greene's script condenses Shaw without sacrificing complexity. The piece looks like a TV movie, and it's definitely studio related but none the worse for that. Too many contemporary films on "historical" themes cannot resist dizziness. What would Mel Gibson do with the maid? Many shots of her that probably dribble on the grill, then curl up on the barbecue while the flames take hold. Preminger does none of this. The burning is shown mainly through a reaction affected by guilt. There are some weak performances, but not enough to cause serious damage. I took this movie on TV and didn't expect to watch it, but I was grabbed. In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has an unexpected resonance.
