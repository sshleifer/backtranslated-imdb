Two things haunt you throughout The intrus (The Intruder): who is the intruder and is it a movie or a dream you are watching? The ending is so overwhelming that you can't find an answer to any of those questions for a while. The intruder appears as different characters, different men in different circumstances that do not belong to the scene, so they are expelled, kindly or brutally, but often without emotional involvement. The main character, Louis, is a despicable man. He has ugly ways, petty and heartless work. He needs it and follows it. He has a transplanted heart and then decides to start a new life. Can this man succeed in his quest for redemption? A guy like that could cut your throat in the blink of an eye. You know, but Claire Denis doesn't encourage you to judge him. Occasionally, there is a young Russian woman - a beautiful girl who seems to live somewhere between heaven and earth - who judges him. He could even punish him. But not Denis. There's the character played by Beatrice Dalle who doesn't want business with him: don't touch me, she says. But Denis lets this man be himself, filming him in his self-absorbed search. I don't know if what you film is the heart or the mind, but they are not the basis of the traditional plot. Whatever you're filming, you can make it in the end. You know who the "intruder" is, you know why, more or less, and some scenes come back into your mind with their full meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
