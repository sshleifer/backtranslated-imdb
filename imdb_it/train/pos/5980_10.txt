First of all, this is really my favorite movie of all time. I don't need to give anyone a description because every hole does it. I am literally obsessed with these effects that are virtually devoid of blood, cheese and lame ', shows the boom-stick', a masterpiece of metal horror from the eighties badly written. The director (I heard) had hoped for a box office success so he could make sequels and have a kind of FREDDY / JASON deal for himself. Damn, I wish he'd gone down like this! The soundtrack is flapping '. The acting is good .... CHECK THIS MOFO. and all the diehard fans out there, feel free to e-mail and chat sometime. Midgetorgy .... I can be found at YAHOO.
