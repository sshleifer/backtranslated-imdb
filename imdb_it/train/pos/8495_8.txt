A long time ago, in the 1980s, long before NAFTA was drafted and multinationals began to get rid of their national identities, the United States and Japan found each other in the world production contest. Remember words like "Union Yes!", "The Japanese are bringing this country" and "Are Americans lazy?" <br /> <br /> As the Reagan era ended and the companies approached a global market, director Ron Howard made one of several trips to the comedy genre with his 1986 hit "Gung Ho", which grossed over $ 36 million in US box office receipts. While in many ways dated, Howard's ironic story of colliding cultures in the workplace still offers a harsh truth for today's industrial life. <br /> <br /> 'Gung Ho' focuses on Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), the union representative for car manufacturers in Hadleyville, a small depressed town at the foot of Pennsylvania. Stevenson was asked to visit the Assan Motor Company in Tokyo (similar to the real life of Toyota), which is considering a US operation at the empty city plant. With hundreds of jobless residents and the city on the verge of collapse, Assan decides to move and Stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and assembly line workers. <br /> <br /> The 112 minutes of "Gung" Ho 'is a humorous look at these two sides, with their strengths and weaknesses considered equally: on the one hand, an American workforce that values ​​its traditions but it is often caught in the frenzy of pride and syndicalism; on the other hand, Japanese workers who are extremely devoted to their work but lack personal satisfaction and feelings of self-worth. At Stevenson, we find a figure of the American working class of average intelligence with the ability to chat with people through misunderstandings. With the survival of his workers and most of Hadleyville on the line, Stevenson demonstrates a nice guy who wants nothing more than a good chance, even if his intelligence will waste him in a great deal of trouble. In addition to responding to the leaders of Assan, we are seeing a delicate balance between Stevenson and his fellow union members, many of whom he grew up with. This includes Buster (George Wendt), Willie (John Turturro) and Paul (Clint Howard, brother of Ron). <br /> <br /> The Japanese cast is directed by Gedde Watanabe, also known for "Sixteen Candles" and "Volunteers". Watanabe plays Kazihiro, the factory manager who has no luck and begins to feel sympathy for life American is constantly in the shadow of Saito (Sab Shimono), the nephew of the CEO of Assan, who desperately wants to take his place in the hierarchical order, while having a light touch, these characters are very good at conveying ideas about the culture of Japanese work. <br /> <br /> With Hunt Stevenson dominating the script, Michael Keaton has to give a solid performance to make this film work. "Gung Ho" is really an overwhelming success for Keaton, who also collaborated with Ron Howard "The Paper" in 1994. He made this film during a series of lighter roles that included "Mr. Mom, '' Beetle Juice 'and' The Dream Team 'before venturing into' Batman ',' One Good Cop 'and' My Life '. It is also difficult not to appreciate the performance of Gedde Watanabe as an out-of-the-ordinary man who first wears Japanese shame ribbons before collaborating with Stevenson to make the car plant a cohesive unit. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is at the top notch, including Wendt, Turturro, Shimono and Soh Yamamura as CEO of Assan Sakamoto. Mimi Rogers provides a romantic interest like Audrey, Hunt's girlfriend. Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel joined forces for Gung Ho's solid writing. The incidental music, which received a BMI Film Music Award, was composed by Thomas Newman. The songs from the Gung Ho soundtrack are 80s wall-to-walls, including "Do not Get Me Wrong", "Tuff Enuff" and "Working Class Man". <br /> <br /> The success of "Gung Ho" actually led to a short-lived TV series on ABC. Although more impressive than a social comment twenty years ago, Ron Howard's film still has its comic value. It is available on DVD as part of the Paramount Widescreen Collection and has changed a little. Audio options are provided in English 5.1 surround, English Dolby surround and French "dubbing", but the subtitles are in English only. There are no extras, not even the theatrical trailer. By the way, Paramount's digital transfer is quite good, with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound. While some extras would have been useful, especially "Gung Ho" was a box office success - there is little to complain about the presentation of the film itself. <br /> <br /> *** out of 4
