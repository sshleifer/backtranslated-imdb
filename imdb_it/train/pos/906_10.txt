VIVAH is in my book THE BEST MOVIE OF 2006! PERIOD !!. In my book it is one of the 100 best films ever made in Bollywood. It's sad that this movie doesn't have many reviews and doesn't have much popularity. <br /> <br /> VIVAH is once again a real achievement by a director who does it again. After HAHK and Maine Pyar Kiya Sooraj once again obtained a brilliant VIVAH. <br /> <br /> This is the simplest and cutest film I've seen this year. After seeing Don 2 who was CRAP and then Dhoom 2 who also beat Don in that subject, I finally see a film that is so close to my heart and my culture. <br /> <br /> I don't know why Bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture we have and we are making shitty movies like Hollywood remakes like Dhoom 2 and don. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and refers a lot to the Indian system of organized marriage of which I too would like to be a part. Our system that teaches us to obey the elderly, follow them and, of course, obey their thoughts is so brilliantly shown in this film! Obviously there is no strength in choosing your life partner and it should be a brief encounter between the couple and their task of deciding how it is brilliantly shown in this film. <br /> <br /> Returning to the film ..... VIVAH is a story of Journey between the beautiful engagement and marriage period. The stage where the boy meets the girl! ... Both understand each other. Both try to evaluate if they can love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and the various that occur during marriages. <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao is brilliant in the film ....... Shahid is OK ..... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are fantastic !! The songs are BRILLANTI. ! I especially like the HAMARI SHAADI MAIN HAFTE REH GYE CHAAR and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ...... <br /> <br /> Overall, MUST SEE for all those who still believe in Indian culture and tradition and certainly the I do! <br /> <br /> Go see this movie ...... I just have to say a word ....... <br /> <br /> BLISS!
