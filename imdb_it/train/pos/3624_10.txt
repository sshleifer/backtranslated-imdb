The Rookie made me smile from beginning to end. Dennis Quaid played the role perfectly. The kid who plays his son was fantastic. He made this a parent-child film to remember. The messages are good. Follow your dreams. Failing to pursue is fine as long as you try. Excitement is palpable. I believe this film will be a classic.
