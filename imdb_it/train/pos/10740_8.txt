Made by the French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet and narrated by Robert De Niro and Firefighter James Hanlon, this is a compelling and heartbreaking story of how the most beautiful of New York shone on its darkest day. I saw it for the first time when I was a naive young man of 12, and at that age it still touched me. Knowing how seriously September 11 is seeing, this has extended the full effect of September 11th. We were discovering who the heroes were, how everyday lives were composed, and how they put their lives at stake in a situation where most people just ran and saved themselves. These brave men put their lives at stake and watching this increases my admiration for them. See if you can, this is the best documentary I've ever seen.
