I showed this to my 6th class class about 17 years ago and the students loved it. I loved it too. The history of termites and their interaction with their environment is surprising. The cast of the creatures is deep and everyone plays their parts well. The battle between the two cold-blooded titans is really a classic movie. Alan Root did an incredible job with the camera and this should have won the Oscar for best documentary. The copy I have does not have Orson Welles who tells it (Derek Jacobi) and is not called "Mysterious Castles of Clay", only "Castles of Clay". This makes me think that it must have been done with Welles added for the star power and an Oscar push. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate enough to find this VHS recently and it is now my children's favorite movie. They took him to the last family meeting instead of a Disney movie. If you can find this movie, you're really lucky.
