The problem with the 1985 version of this film is simple; Indiana Jones was so closely modeled after Alan Quartermain (or at least he is a type of Alan Quartermain character), that the '85 director made the mistake of plundering IJ films for dialogue and history too deeply. What you got as a finished product was a confused mess of Alan Quartermain's name, in an intricate mix of a cheap imitated IJ saga (with a touch of Austin Powers cheese here and there). <br /> <br /> It has been labeled by many critics as a "big parody" or "involuntary comedy". The word is unintentional. This film was never meant to be fun; witty, yes, but not humorous. Unfortunately, it is more carefree than witty. <br /> <br /> With this new M4TV mini-series, you get much more history, your character's character development, solid portraits and a fine, even fun mix. This story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors, but deservedly because this version brings a real plot and not just action and Eye Candy. Although it has both action and Eye Candy, it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version, forgetting IJ all together and returning to the original materials for AQ, creating an excellent and well thought out plot, and some interesting sub-frame complements. <br /> <br /> Now this attempt is not the extravagance of action out of everything that is Indiana Jones. Nor is it a poor attempt to be one. This vehicle is guided by the plot and the characters and is a beautiful interpretation of the AQ / KSM saga. Filmed in South Africa, the audience receives beautiful views (if desolate), SA aboriginal cultures and some wildlife films that blend harmoniously with the performances and the plot here. <br /> <br /> Steve Boyum totally surprised me with this, as I've never been one to endorse his vision. In fact, I didn't like most of his work as a director until this attempt. I hope this is more a new vein of talent and less luck that seems to be. <br /> <br /> This version evaluates a 9.8 / 10 on the "TV" scale from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
