An action thriller that is a little fun and full of suspense, starring Jamie Foxx, an unfortunate and fast thug who is chosen by an American Treasury agent (David Morse) demanding to be released in the streets of New York to find a thief of finicky computer / hacker (Doug Hutchinson), who stole forty-two million dollars from the treasure and left two guards killed. <br /> <br /> "Bait" marks the second film for Antoine Fuqua ("The Replacement Killers") and he handles the task quite well even if he does not pass his first film. What the two films have in common are the action sequences, which are perfect. <br /> <br /> Foxx is pretty good here, even if his character is annoying at first, but throughout the movie, I started taking it over. Hutchinson is wonderful as the mind that can be ruthless as John Malkovich and patient as the late Laurence Olivier was in "Marathon Man". Morse is fine as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get anyone who did it at all costs.
