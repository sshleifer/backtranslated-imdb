The original film, The Odd Couple, has some wonderful comic liner. It seems that the whole world knows the story of the neurotic Felix Ungar and the funny, obnoxious, slob Oscar Madison. This mockery of mismatched roommates has created one of the most successful TV series of all time and countless, but no less good, imitations. <br /> <br /> The film Odd Couple has some wonderful jokes about Oscar's apartment and his sloppy habits. He says "Who wants food?" One of his poker buddies asks, "What do you have?" Oscar says, "I got brown rolls and green rolls." "What is brown?" It is a very new cheese or very old meat! "I also like the phrase on Oscar's refrigerator:" It was out of use for two weeks, I saw the milk in there that wasn't even in a bottle! "There is no doubt that Walter Matthau's Oscar Oscar is a joy to watch on the screen. It is almost as good as the version of Jack Klugman in the TV series. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is Jack Lemmon's Felix Ungar His problem is that he makes Felix so depressing and trampled that he becomes more boring than comical. Tony Randall's performance in the series, brought the kind of humor, warmth and sensitivity to Felix's character The Portrait of Lemmon is lacking, Tony's Felix Unger, of course, could be a bit annoying, but in the television series he was referring to specific situations where the plot nuisance was necessary Jack Felix Ungar, (note the different spelling) in the film , seems to never be happy, funny or intriguing interior.The movie Felix Ungar is a roommate that pushes you to the wall, all the time. <br /> <br /> The film still has great moments that stand up to the test of the time, the famous "meatloaf" is one of the biggest s always dinners! One of the other great examples of Felix's "little notes" on Oscar's pillow will be remembered forever. However, there are some dark sides where Oscar goes beyond the lines, his "crying" towards the end after shouting Felix, and a scene involving Felix's Linguine dinner, (though lightened by a funny line) seems more depressing and comic. br /> <br /> Perhaps there was not enough time to see the lighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable in the film. The first 20 minutes are very boring. The same problem occurs with Felix's conversation with the Pidgeon Sisters. The ending of the film is predictable and too friendly. There is very little care or compassion for each of them on the other. The result is that the dark side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger, rather than comedy, unless you look at the big scenes described above. It seems that the monotonous character of Felix's Jack Lemmon lowers the film, rather than extolling or embracing the comedy among the characters. <br /> <br /> It really took the TV series 70s to make The Odd Couple the best it could be. The original film is still very good. However, the TV series is much better.
