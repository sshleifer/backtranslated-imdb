I saw SHORE LEAVE the other day. I've seen it so many times, and I never get tired. Strangely, every time I look at it recently, it brings me back to the first time I saw it. Including this time. It must be that sense of mystery and "What's going on here?" By the way. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the only part of the story that ALWAYS seemed embarrassing and uncomfortable to me, this time, actually had a HUGE effect on me-- Ruth. I think it was Gerald Fried's score. A true masterpiece, that! The romantic section has been reused - much more widely - in THIS SIDE OF PARADISE. But of course, he debuted here. I have the impression that, of all the girls Kirk knew over the years, it may have been the "sweetest". When he said "You have to go?", In combination with the music, I could really feel the pain he must have felt in not being able to have it with her. <br /> <br /> Someone commented online that Ruth looked older than him, yet she wouldn't have to grow old for 15 years. Which makes me think ... MAYBE she was one of the academy teachers. Kirk had a relationship with an old woman! (Maybe he thought about this in "MIRI" when he told Janice, "I've never been involved with older women." Maybe he meant "... more". <br /> <br /> Reading ST reviews l "Another day, I see where someone has compared WHAT ARE THE CHILDREN MADE WITH" I, MUDD. But it seems that SHORE LEAVE must also be in there. What are all those "people" if not androids? be related to "The Old Ones" of the previous episode? Whoever it is, seems to be one of the RARE cases in ST where you have a race that is actually "superior" to just thinking about being. <br /> <br /> Yeoman Barrows seems to be filling up for Yeoman Rand: Considering how much attention Dr. McCoy showered with her, it's just another frustrating example of a potentially good character who appears once and then never shows up again! what I missed among the last ones I saw came back, Spock smiling, I saw him, I prefer to I want to know that there are 2 sides to it I'm always going on, rather than this "submerged" business. When he said, "Have fun, sir." at the beginning, one could see that it was not only his speech to his superior officer, but talking to his friend. And in the end, when he says in vain "Totally illogical!", I can't help but think he does it purely to provoke a reaction. He may not smile or laugh, but I think he likes to see his fellow crew members happy.
