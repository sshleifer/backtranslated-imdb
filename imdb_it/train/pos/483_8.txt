in the last two years very few chess films have been made, but this is more than just a chess film, it is a story about the need to be loved and the need to win, John Toturro plays a psychologically challenged man, it doesn't matter to him accepts 64 squares and 32 pieces, the game validates him as a person, when he loses a game he loses the only thing that makes sense to him and John Torturro expresses it in a beautiful way, even a woman's love was not enough to save him from his sad existence. It makes you wonder if Luzon is out there obsessed with the game, I'm sure it is, if you're a chess fan it won't hurt you to watch it. It is a clever piece of work correctly presented and executed well, it achieves its objectives, unfortunately I doubt that there will be a sequel.
