If you like Deep Purple, you'll enjoy this excellent movie with Stephen Rea in the lead role. The story is about the most famous rock band of the 70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But of course, there will be a lot of problems during their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are fantastic, and the song "The Flame Still Burns" is perfect. You have to watch it.
