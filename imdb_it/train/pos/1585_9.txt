Born in Berlin in 1942, Margarethe von Trotta was an actress and is now a very important director and writer. It has been described, perhaps even unfairly charged, as a director whose commitment to bringing a woman's sensitivity to the screen far surpasses her artistic strengths. "Rosenstrasse", which has collected mixed and even strange reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews I've ever read about that newspaper) is not a perfect movie. It is a beautiful film and a testimony of a rare coalition of successful opposition to the genocidal Nazi regime by, of all peoples, generically impotent Germans who manifest in a street in Berlin. <br /> <br /> The co-author von Trotta uses the Rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman's search for information on his mother never revealed the life of a child in the German capital during World War II. <br /> <br /> Ruth Weinstein's husband (Jutta Lampe) died and in a surprising return to an apparently orthodox Jewish lifestyle until now, Ruth not only "sits shivah" (the mourning ritual a week as Jews) but insists on following the strict proscriptions of his faith. His apartment in New York reflects the turnout assured by the fatigues of his deceased spouse. The daughter, born in America, Hannah (Maria Schrader) and her brother are a little discouraged by the mother's taking on restrictive Orthodox Jewish practices, but they enter the scene. The mother coldly refuses the presence of Hannah's boyfriend, a non-Jew named Luis (Fedja van Huet). An internal crisis could explode when Ruth warns that she will deny Hannah if she doesn't give up, with her handsome Luis. Stay tuned. <br /> <br /> A cousin comes to pay his respects and lets clues fall on a Hannah interested in a wartime mystery about her mother's childhood in Berlin. Hannah is curious - she asks her mother who categorically refuses to discuss that part of her life. This is very, very realistic. I grew up with parents who fled from Nazi Germany just in time and met many children whose families, generally but partly in part, escaped the holocaust. Those days were simply not discussed. <br /> <br /> So Hannah, having learned that a kind German woman saved Ruth's life, moved to Berlin hoping to find the savior who still breathes. If it wasn't, it would have been a very short short film. But Ruth, pretending to be a historian, finds ninety-year-old Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), now a widow. Like the happy interviewees, but upset by the repressed memories, Lena tells her story, the scenes change without interruption between the current Berlin and the capital of wartime. <br /> <br /> The young Lena of 1943 (Katja Riemann) was a good pianist married to a Jewish violinist, Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel). With the advent of the Nazi regime he was asked to use "Israel" as a middle name just as Jewish women had to add "Sarah" to their names (incidentally, I wish IMDb hadn't given Fabian's name on his list of characters with the false "Israel" included - it simply perpetuates a name applied by the Nazis as a sign of classification and degradation. <br /> <br /> While Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps, those married to "Aryans" they were exempted. For a time. Until 1943, when the regime decided to take them too (most were men, a minority were Jewish women married to non-Jews.) The raid is shown here in all its appalling intensity. br /> <br /> The young Lena tries to locate her husband, all she and many other women know is that they are confined to a building on Rosenstrasse, the multitude of anxious women accumulates, searching help from German officers who predictably refuse aid and verbally abuse them ("whore who loves Jews", being a name). As a subplot, Lena more or less adopts the eight-year-old Ruth who hid when her mother was captured (remember, Ruth is now sitting at Shiva in Manhattan). The little girl Ruth is played by Svea Lohde. <br /> <br /> Through the increasingly angry protests women finally prevail. Men and a handful of women are released. As in the true history of the Nazis, one of the rare, almost unprecedented times in which the madmen recognized defeat in their murderous program (another was the end of the euthanasia campaign to free the Reich from mental defectives and chronic invalids, but this is another story). <br /> <br /> Von Trotta increases the tension and every woman's story is both personal and universal. Hannah continues to solicit the elderly Lena who slowly gets together, begins to suspect that she is not dealing with an ordinary historian, but rather someone with the need to know the girl who saved, the child whose mother was killed . <br /> <br /> The contrasts between the 1943 Rosenstrasse, a set, and the street today in a lively, reconstructed and unified Berlin constitute a recurring thematic element. Today's Berlin carries the legacy but not the scars of a monstrous past. Von Trotta makes this point very well. <br /> <br /> The main actors are uniformly impressive. Lena's husband, although strong, also shows himself totally defenseless in the trap of imprisonment with a probable attitude of deportation (which is shown to have been clearly understood by all the characters - including local police and military - as a one-way trip towards oblivion). The old Ruth is catalically forced to face long-suppressed demons in her happy New York life. Hannah is very credible as a young woman whose father's death triggers the need to discover her family's past. These things happen (even if the Times critic doesn't seem to know). <br /> <br /> Von Trotta's hand is safe but not perfect. A scene with Goebbels on an evening when Lena's violin is played is useless and distracted. The suggestion that she may have slept with the propaganda minister, the most fanatical high-level Hitler worshiper, to save her husband, takes away the wonderful result of the demonstrating spouses and relatives. Most of the German officers come from the central fusion and are shaped by the Teutonic school of rudeness "copy and paste" by Erich von Stroheim. But it's understandable. <br /> <br /> The history of Rosenstrasse has been the subject of books and articles and some argue that it is a paradigmatic case to claim that many other Jews could have been saved if other Germans protested. Unfortunately that argument makes no sense. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were profoundly and understandably selfish. Most Germans were on a line halfway between passive and virulent anti-Semitism. That is why the Rosenstrasse protest was almost unique. Whether Goldenhagen's argument is squeezed or denied that most Germans were willing accomplices of actual killers, it cannot be denied that the pre-Nazi endemic anti-Semitism erupted into a virulent variety from 1933 onwards. <br /> <br /> the elderly Lena observes that what was accomplished by women was "a ray of light" in an evil time. Most men and women from a near-death journey survived the war. So "a ray of light" has been and von Trotta's film is a beacon of light that shows that some have been saved from the courage of mostly ordinary women and for every life saved a festive occasion exists. And he will always do it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
