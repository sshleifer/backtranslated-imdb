Vaguely reminiscent of the great westerns of 1940, such as "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" (1948), "Red Rock West" is a story of conscience, greed and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is a young man from Texas who goes west looking for work and money. Find both, but not in the way he expected. <br /> <br /> The script of the film contains many surprises and twists. Excellent cinematography, film editing and moody western music add tension and suspense. The expansiveness of the great country of the sky offers a wonderful environment. And the acting ranges from good to excellent, with great performances by Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh. The country / western song by Dwight Yoakam, specially recorded, gives the film a strong ending. <br /> <br /> Properly labeled as neo-noir, "Red Rock West" also strikes me as something else. The plot is full of surprising coincidences and unlikely timing, so much so that others might consider the script as flawed. Normally, I would agree. In this case, however, when combined with the moody atmosphere, and the fact that the town of Red Rock seems almost empty of normal daily life, coincidences and unlikely timing suggest a story that, beyond the "noirish", it's ... surreal. It's almost as if fate intervened deliberately with unlikely events to force Michael to come to terms with himself. From this point of view, coincidences are not at all writing defects. They are plot points needed in a nightmare story of a young man who must face his own demons ... disguised as other characters. <br /> <br /> All we need is Rod Serling, in a postscript, which explains, in his always clearly stated voice, that ... a young man, in search of himself, stops in a small, almost deserted city a thousand miles from nothing. It's his last stop on a journey to ... the twilight zone.
