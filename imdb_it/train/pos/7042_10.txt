first, someone mentioned here that since this was released in "limited" quantities it means it should be bad ... that's exactly what the "big five" Hollywood studios would want everyone to think in order to "pass" or "ignore" "features that are not desirable, without losing face or imagining censoring them directly to the point, this production has been released" limited "because it is considered" unpatriotic "by some individuals. <br /> <br /> now I absolutely loved this feature, I find it much better than "Charlie Wilson's War" even if it is a "fictitious" story of something that "never" happens but it is always so OBVIOUS. this goes to anyone, interested or influenced by the current American foreign policies, "at home" or "on board": the country "turakistan" and "the city of emerald" are certainly trying to resemble Iraq and Baghdad as much as the "Tamerlano" company chooses "halib urton "(with Vice President Dan Aykroyd playing Dick Cheney, LOL). Quiet a moment in which the film is DEAD SERIOUS, not even more sarcastic (the main example would be how the character of John Cusack deals with his depression, but not only). <br /> <br /> I discovered that ALL the characters can be connected to something / someone or specific stereotypes. now word of advice; if you are not politically active, especially towards the aspects of "globalization", you will probably not appreciate this function much since most of its content and within the "jokes" are targeting certain "personalities" that are not "visible" to the general public on a daily basis ... (the main exception would be Hilary Duff who plays the famous materialist pop star, I must say name (S)?). at its CORE the function is an anti-globalization concert, period. the message is unmistakably delivered with a comic revenge. Joan has a joke at one point that says this: "and here we have a book written by you that you know, about how I conquered the world and solved the problems with my father". INDICATED)) <br /> <br /> sister and brother Cusacks are doing well together as always, as in "Grosse PointeBlank" I would say a little more "mature". Marisa Tomeihere does not show her ass and breasts to "impress us" (as she did recently "Before the devil knows you are dead"), but instead she has a very serious role and manages to make it quietly. <br /> <br /> many critics don't understand it (can't do it or I don't want to). this is NOT a "normal" film but more than a comic documentary. this function is able to provide a message and NOT to get the Oscars, or to have "visual effects" that induce the viewer to buy the latest "HDTV experience" TVs ... I have also noticed in my local newspapers that this film it hurts - the visions because they are not "artistic", while war war movies in Iraq look good to be "balanced" in appearance and "engaging". One wonders how all the mainstream media is concentrated in the hands of a group of kids. .. <br /> <br /> I bet this feature will prove to be a success overseas as well as in North America. as I said before, it's all a satire on American foreign policy and how it was hijacked by "special interest" groups ... the fact that the "normal" American soldier wearing the "Tamerlane" company logo on his dress fighting is rather offensive BUT EFFECTIVE in showing reality as it is, or it will soon be the way things will go so far. <br /> <br /> some shots WITHOUT PRICE: on "liberation", the country is invaded by commercial advertisements; a hilarious scene on how future journalists probably collect "news" ("everything must be better than this bullock x-box"))); soldiers dealing with their "frustration"; <br /> <br /> in general, I do not recommend it to "conservatives" or "hard core" patriots of some sort or other. This feature is not meant to reach people's "minds" (like traditional propaganda and commercial interests always try to do it). Instead, it contains a well-defined message for realists and towards some seemingly "always" short-run ideological goals.
