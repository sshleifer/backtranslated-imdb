I have just returned from a screening of "My Left Foot" in our public library. What an emotional experience - I feel drained and relieved. <br /> <br /> It is the story of Christy Brown, an Irish writer and painter, based on the autobiographical "My Left Foot". Christy was born with a form of cerebral palsy such that the only limb he had good control over was his left foot. The doctors advised his parents that he was hopelessly mentally retarded, but his mother did not give up and, as Annie Sullivan did with Helen Keller, helped him get a breakthrough in which he learned the alphabet and then read, write and paint. <br /> <br /> This film won Academy Awards for Daniel Day-Lewis (best actor) and best supporting actress for the actress who plays her mother; he also received the Oscar nominations for best film, best director and best script. <br /> <br /> As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist, while many films may entertain me, many often leave me to having to overlook fictions or improbabilities in realistic psychological reactions. <br /> <br /> It is not this film - it was absolutely "apt" in portraying the typical Irish relatives roles and behaviors (see, for example, seeing the typical Irish families in "Ethnicity and ethnicity" of McGoldrick Family Therapy " ) as well as the heterogeneous emotional maturation of Christy Brown - some immature reactions of the personality that have been further amplified by his way of capturing his father's traits. <br /> <br /> The film presents the greatest truth as it changes certain sequences in its development (painting and writing) and the condensation of several important people into one person, in order to tell a coherent and credible story, not burdened by small, distracting and less important realities. (See Christy Brown on Wikipedia for more accuracy.) The DVD version we were shown had some English subtitles that were very helpful in understanding Christy's speech (and some of the Irish speeches), the version initial of the film may have missed this. (If you see it on DVD, activate the option.) <br /> <br /> The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the biggest and most believable acting works I've ever seen. Really magnificent, exceptional, superlative. <br /> <br /> "My Left Foot" has more than a few resemblances to a more recent film, "The Diving Bell & the Butterfly", in which everyone portrays the life of a real person successfully overcoming imprisonment and isolation of an extremely severe physical handicap. <br /> <br /> And in so doing it resonates with "Invictus" by William Ernest Henley which begins: "Out of the night that covers me, // Black like the pit from one pole to the other, // I thank any god / / For my invincible soul. "
