This is undoubtedly my favorite novel Le Carre and turns on the big screen with all the love and care you could wish for. I read a review on this site that seems to find the characters repulsive but I believe that this is not successful. All Le Carre stories are essentially love stories and this is no exception. It is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set. Betrayal is everyone's key to anyone's good. Pym's education is so close to mine that I find it chilling to watch. Peter Egan is in his best role and the late Ray McAnally is incredibly good. Even the smallest roles played by Andy de la Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are correct. This cast is a dream for the theater manager. The story should not be ruined by a misinformed description, but it suffices to say that it refers to a slow but inexorable destruction of the young, and to the descent into espionage and betrayal. All my sympathies are related to Magnus Pym and his only (non-sexual) love for Poppy (RÃ¼diger Weigang - wonderful as always.) His only true friendship but also by definition another in the long series of betrayals. AWESOME! I love it.
