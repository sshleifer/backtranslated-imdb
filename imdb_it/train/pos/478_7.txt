I'm rather surprised that no reviewer has so far commented on the rather elementary chess in Luzhin's game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as an expert chess consultant, Luzhin has proven to win the game in an illegal move. Among the rapid cuts and the return to the board it is not difficult to notice that after the combination of Luzhin which culminates in a sacrifice of the queen, its tower in d1 is still blocked by the black tower at c1 against its king in the corner in h1. So he is unable to play the alleged Rd1-d8 move that would be illegal, but he has shown that he can do it for an ecstatic applause from the public.
