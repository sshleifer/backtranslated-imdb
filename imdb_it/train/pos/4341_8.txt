Who has no unresolved problems with their parents? And which parents do not have unsolved problems between them? <br /> <br /> I know, it looks heavy. But this is played for the laughter in the film, making both the best comedy and the drama better. I always like Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was a little worried that their star qualities might be too big for a small film, I was enchanted from the first scene. <br /> <br /> Particularly amusing were the discoveries that the son makes of his father as a person. And Peter Falk's monologue about being a hardworking and sacrificed father and husband was the perfect balance point. Without the scene being played so well, the film would have seemed much less nuanced, and the character much less interesting. <br /> <br /> Well done, Paul and Peter!
