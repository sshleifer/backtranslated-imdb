This is not the comedy Robin Williams, nor the extravagant / crazy Robin Williams of recent thriller fame. This is a hybrid of classical drama without excessive dramatization, mixed with Robin's new love for the thriller. But this is not a thriller, per se. This is more a mysterious vehicle / suspense through which Williams tries to locate a sick boy and his keeper. <br /> <br /> Also played by Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, this Suspense Drama sounds almost like a newsletter, until William the character gets closer to achieving his goal. <br /> <br /> I must say that I was very entertained, even if this film fails to teach, drive, inspect or entertain. It seemed more like I was looking at a guy (Williams), since he was actually performing the actions, from a third-person perspective. In other words, it seemed real, and I was able to subscribe to the premise of the story. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's worth looking at, even if it's definitely not the Friday / Saturday night rate. /> <br /> Evaluate a 7.7 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
