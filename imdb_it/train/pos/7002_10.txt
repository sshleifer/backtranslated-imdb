Will Smith will once again deliver in a film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to straighten his wrongs in a way that will touch even the hardest hearts !!! Screenwriter Grant Nieporte and Italian director Gabriele Muccino come together and have created a masterpiece that I highly recommend buying and storing in your movie collection because you will never get tired of watching / hearing this movie !!! I have the utmost respect for Will Smith since he is not only a brilliant actor, but it can be said that he has a true love for people and life that undoubtedly made him perfect for the character (Irish agent Ben Thomas) who has interpreted in this film. You'll find yourself feeling his pain and anger, the frustrations about his love for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, who by the way was fantastic as usual. I found myself falling in love with the fact that their characters were falling in love. Woody Harrelson is also the protagonist of this film Top Notch. I find it very difficult to write this review without revealing the key points of the plot ... All I can say is, look at it and when you make sure you have nothing to interrupt, take the phone off the hook, sit down and get ready to start looking for unravel the mysterious life and past of the IRS agent Ben Thomas ... Thank you Will Smith for another great movie !!!
