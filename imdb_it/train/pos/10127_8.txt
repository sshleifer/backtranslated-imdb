This was the beginning of everything! Of course, this is not Friends at its best, but this was the pilot of the show, let's not forget it and not bad. We are introduced to the band and Central Perk, where our story begins. Also from this first episode we get a sign of the Ross-Rachel report that will arrive in the next ten years, when Ross says, "I just want to get married again" and Rachel bursts in with a wedding dress on ... probably unintentional like at the moment which the writers were going for a Monica-Joey relationship but now fits well when you look back. Something else .. in this episode Rachel is presented to Chandler as if the two had never met before, but in subsequent episodes, the so-called "flashbacks", this is contradicted by the fact that the two met on three previous occasions . However, the point is that this is a good start for a great show. This episode may not be the usual Friends as we are used to them, with the cast still a little inexperienced but in the next few episodes we see why the show has become what it was! Keep watching, the first season is a hoot !!
