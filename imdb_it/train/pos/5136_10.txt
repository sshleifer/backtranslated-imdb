Perhaps the greatest jazz ever film. <br /> <br /> It's jazz. <br /> <br /> The opening film continues to haunt my reveries. <br /> <br /> Lester, of course, is wonderful and out of this world. <br /> <br /> Jo Jones is always a pleasure (see also The Sound of Jazz). <br /> <br /> If you can, find the music; is available on CD. <br /> <br /> All lovers of jazz and noir cinema should study this extraordinary jewel. <br /> <br /> What shadows and light - what music - what a hat!
