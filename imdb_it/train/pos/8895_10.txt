I accidentally heard this movie on TV and I was not able to leave it ... It is really an excellent film that makes known to American history the Vietnam war, the time of flower power, the fight against racism ... It illustrates the conflict of generation, of political opinion, of race that took place in the 60s ... I was born in 1980, so I didn't know all those things before ... In France, US history is not a priority and that movie really taught me a lot of facts! By the way, I think all the actors are fantastic; in particular Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I can watch this movie more than once every day !! It's really great ... what a shame it only appeared on TV not in theaters ... <br /> <br />
