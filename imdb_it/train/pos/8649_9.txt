I bought it some time ago, but somehow I neglected to look at it until last night. I like Juliette Lewis even though I'm indifferent to Brad Pitt. After this vision I must admit that he is a perfect actor - his character was completely believable, and I didn't think of "Brad Pitt" at all. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I can't say the same about David Duchovny. I'm a fan of X-Files and had to search twice to confirm the date of this film, as I thought it was created a few years later. I like Duchovny, but I found his character a bit two-dimensional here, except where he's doing voice-overs. That part was strong, it seemed of character, good intonation, etc. Otherwise I kept thinking "Agent Mulder", which is a pity. <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes was a surprise. Why didn't I notice her before? (I'll look up to see what other roles he did and see those as soon as possible). I'm a little worried about stereotypes about Lewis, this movie and "Natural Born Killers" (a favorite). Interesting, however, to see a contrast of characters - in NBK is a complacent compliant, while here it abhors violence and tries very hard not to recognize Early's dark side until it is pushed in the face. <br /> <br /> I liked movies almost without reservations. Apart from Duchovny's character who doesn't seem completely formed (and perhaps was "blown away" somehow by Pitt's), it was perfect. I was also happy with the ending - happy that the innocent heroes didn't die, yet they had to suffer first. It was realistic, tense, disturbing. <br /> <br /> If you like NBK, you might like this movie, and vice versa.
