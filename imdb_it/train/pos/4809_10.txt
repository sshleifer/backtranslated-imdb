With all the films recently, which deal with the British monarchy, is it really another's time? Answer: BET! The Young Victoria is another contribution to Britain's film family that deals with the royal family. In this case, he deals with Princess Victoria's early life, and the events leading up to the Coronation to become the queen of all England, as well as her love story and her eventual marriage to Prince Albert. The film also deals with Queen & Prince's stormy lives and careers in England, as well as many other events that take place (political unrest, etc.). Emily Blunt plays a beautiful Victoria in her youth, while Rupert Friend is his beloved and best friend, Prince Albert. The rest of the cast is completed by the likes of Miranda Richardson, such as Dutchess of Kent, and always welcomed on the screen, Jim Broadbent as King William, as well as a cast of others that shine on the screen. Jean Marc Vall√©e (C.R.A.Z.Y., Loser Love), directed a winning screenplay by Jullian Fellowes (Vanity Fair, Gosford Park, Separate Lies). I absolutely went crazy about the visual aspect of the film (by the director of photography Hagen Bogdansker), which gave each frame a pictorial aspect (with the help of the set designer, Patrice Vermette), in addition to a tight editing Jill Bilcock & Matt Garner). What I also appreciated in the Fellowes script is the use of a chess game, as a metaphor for some of the film's political motivations (the characters in the film move like chess pieces). This is intelligent, well written, directed, filmed, edited and acted (and enlightened) that makes a well-spent evening at the cinema. PG rating of the MPAA for some scenes of sensuality, some brief violence (a bit bloody, though nothing too bloody), a crude release of language, and some on the screen that smoke
