... also beats the "raw" bad. This show is almost twenty years old and I still laughed VERY hard when I was watching it last night. Shows Eddie Murphy dressed in tight red clothes (Old School) and jokes around with everything from celebrities to his family. He was only 22 years old and this is a must see! <br /> <br /> 8/10
