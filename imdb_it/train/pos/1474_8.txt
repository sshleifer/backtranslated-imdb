I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival. Not as salacious as it seems, this is a three-part documentary (each episode is 50 minutes long) with Slovenian superstar philosopher / psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek. Zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films, exploring themes of sexuality, fantasy, morality and mortality. It was directed by Sophie Fiennes, from the talented clan of Fiennes (she is the sister of actors Ralph and Joseph). I liked it a lot, although I think it will be even more fun on DVD, since there is such a stew of ideas to digest. The Freudian and Lacanian analysis can be quite heavy and seeing the whole series has become a bit confusing for the end of two and a half hours. It didn't help that a careless coffee and the possession of a bladder brought me some discomfort for the last hour. <br /> <br /> My only real problem is that Zizek chose films that were quite obviously full of Freudian themes. He spends a good deal of time on the films of Hitchcock and David Lynch, not exactly masters of subtlety. I would have liked to see him try to support his theories using a wider range of films, although this is just that I say I would like to see the fourth and fifth and sixth. <br /> <br /> Zizek is a lot of fun, and part of the humor saw him present what amounted to a conference as he inserted himself into the real scenes of some of the films he was discussing. So, for example, we see him on a speedboat bound for Bodega Bay (from Hitchcock's The Birds) or sitting in the basement of the Motel Bates (from Psycho). Which is not to say that his theories are not provocative. Even when I disagreed with him, he definitely made me think a bit more about the movies. What exactly is it trying to accomplish.
