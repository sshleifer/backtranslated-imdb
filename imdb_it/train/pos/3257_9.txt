I just watched this movie for the second time on television. He is adorable, warm, sentimental, very very romantic. I have rarely seen actors better able to reveal with their movements and gestures the love for another - Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. and above all Mary Stuart Masterson simply exceeds. Masterson probably has the most difficult role and is simply adorable. <br /> <br /> The film is in the vein of both romantic films such as While You Were Sleeping, When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and the "high gimmick" genre of films like Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue got married. I hate to say this, because this cast was superb and I would never have changed any of them - but I think it failed as well as the films mentioned above because the cast's box office appeal wasn't as great as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks , Michael J. Fox and Kathleen Turner at the time the film was made. <br /> <br /> It is not superbly written - for example, the character lines are not particularly memorable. Yet it is executed to perfection. <br /> <br /> Romantic aspirations are truly palpable, the "feeling" of falling in love with people is exquisitely communicated, the timelessness of love and the all-encompassing garbage, the feeling of loss and the desire to regain that connection, they are so moving delivered. Again and again, you will be touched. In reality, a comparable film is Made in Heaven, the same romantic desire. <br /> <br /> Show it, it's lovely.
