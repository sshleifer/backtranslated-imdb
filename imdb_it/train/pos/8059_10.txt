I just watched this movie on Turner Classic Movies last night and I was amazed by Victor McLaglen's performance: a "tour de force" in every sense. The 1922 Dublin atmosphere evoked through cinematography and production design foreshadowed the techniques used in the best noir films of the 40s and early 50s. Very nice attention to detail also: during the wake of Frankie McPhillip (Wallace Ford), the mourners are all praying Gaelic. Max Steiner's score is unforgettable. As in later films like GWTW in 1939, folk ballads were used to give local color and a sense of place and time. John Ford: already a cinema giant in 1935!
