Buster absolutely shines in this episode, which is the only vehicle I saw towards the end of his career that allowed him to do physical (and silent!) Comedy that made him famous. It's still shocking to hear his serious voice in the talkie sequences - his voice is the only thing I don't care about, as far as Buster is concerned - but his ability to make a jump is still unmatched. He even repeats some of the gags used in his first two rolls with Roscoe Arbuckle. <br /> <br /> My deepest gratitude to Rod Serling for introducing us to this episode, and for giving Buster's genius the full scope. He didn't have much time (an episode) to do it, but this is a touching tribute to the greatest Hollywood genius.
