I remember being terrified by the blood of the movies when I was younger, and gradually less, until I became quite tired, as I'm sure many other viewers have become, so that the barrage of bloody movies produced in recent years has amused me but not it scared me or made me squirm. "The Dentist" turned it around. <br /> <br /> The configuration seems simple: an mentally unstable dentist destroys the inside of the mouth and perhaps the bodies. A clever turning point, however, is that the dentist is the protagonist of the film, so instead of being a bad one-dimensional individual without a clear motivation, his development is the widest of any character and is very human and credible. The spectator then feels sympathy for him and his victims, and instead of hoping for justice to come from him, I found myself hoping that he would somehow find a way to cover his tracks and return to a normal life. <br /> <br /> What really "makes" a horror movie is violence. And "The Dentist" does it better than any other movie he can think of. First of all, the film has tons of tension, which is something modern gore films tend to miss. In a scene (), the dentist is emotionally upset and must see a small child for the first time. While reaching the baby's mouth, you hope that, for the sake of the dentist and the child, the meeting ends without damage. I don't want to ruin what happens. Second, when blood comes, it affects all the worst nerves. Once again, I will not give anything. <br /> <br /> Of course, being a film you've never heard of, it has flaws. Above all, it is exclusively for horror fans. Furthermore, as mentioned by another review, which takes place over a few days, we have no background on the characters. And the tension drops a little during the end. But in reality, the fact that we would also like to know the background of the characters is proof of how beautiful it is, and most of the film is solid enough to be forgiven for every little power outage. <br /> <br /> It is strange, after years of getting used to the cinema, to want to suddenly cover my eyes at the sight of blood. "The Dentist" has made me scared and deeply uncomfortable, and for this it gains my full approval.
