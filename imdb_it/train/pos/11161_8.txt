This is a very funny movie! I have no idea if it translates well into other languages ​​or not. However, I think that men from all over the world can identify with "Frank" and his thoughts to some extent! These thoughts are extremely fun and even women will love this movie. I'm sure! <br /> <br /> All cast members behave well and this film could have been a huge success worldwide if it was made in England or the United States. But for those of you who are lucky enough to understand Swedish, a party is waiting for you! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
