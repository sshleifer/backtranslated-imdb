Late one evening, on a desolate road, Martin Sheen spins a yarn for Robert Carradine of Hopalong Cassidy and friends follow a group of criminal cattle killers, who killed some men and kidnapped Cassidy's girl. <br /> Writer / director Christopher Coppola He may have incited the wrath of William Boyd's purists by daring to make a modern low-budget film with their beloved Hoppy, but I'm glad he did! No character should be so attached to an actor that no one else is ever allowed to play it again! <br /> <br /> I thought it was fun and an interesting update of the classic programmers of the thirties and forties. Although guilty of bad acting, this is quite serious and unpretentious, making it difficult not to love. <br /> <br /> The entire production is a bit weird, but I really enjoyed the scenes between Sheen and Carridine. The fact that we are looking at a story within a story makes strangeness and exaggeration more enjoyable.
