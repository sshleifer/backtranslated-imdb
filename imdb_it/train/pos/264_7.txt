Hickory Dickory Dock was a good Poirot mystery. I confess that I haven't read the book, despite being an avid fan of Agatha Christie. Adaptation is not without its problems, there were times when humor, and there were courageous attempts to do it right, was a bit exaggerated, and the events leading up to the final solution were rather hasty. I also thought there were slow moments, so some of the mysteries filled up. Anyway, I liked how Hickory Dickory Dock was shot, it had a visual style very similar to the brilliant ABC Murders, and it really set the atmosphere, with dark camera work and dark lighting. The darkest moments were somewhat gruesome, this was helped by one of the most disturbing scores in music in a Poirot adaptation, perhaps not as disturbing as that of One Two Buckle My Shoe, which gave me nightmares. The plot is complex, with all the essential ingredients, though not as convoluted as Buckle My Shoe, and somehow it's a good thing. The acting was very good, David Suchet is impeccable (I know I can't use this word forever but I can't think of a better word to describe his performance in the series) like Poirot, and Philip Jackson and Pauline Moran do justice to the their characters integrally brilliantly. And the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole, in particular Damian Lewis as Leonard. All in all, a solid mystery, but it is not the best. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
