David Beckham is an English soccer star and the husband of Victoria Beckham ("Posh Spice" of the Spice Girls). His trademark is a goal shot that curves on the field and in the net. The soccer equivalent of an indoluble curve ball in baseball. "Fold it like Beckham" means making that kind of spectacular blow. Apart from that, and a small shrine for him in the main character's bedroom and a fake cameo in the end, the film has nothing to do with him. <br /> <br /> The film is full of little jokes, like the gift that one of the characters' parents gave her a shirt with the number 9 on top (owned by the great Mia Hamm, for those who know) , references to "Posh 'n' Becks", the tribute video to WUSA that one of the characters performs for a non-believing friend ("They * have * that ??"), lesbian gags, sports gags and so on. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenager in England who idolizes Beckham and wants to be a soccer star. He has a real gift, but the two seemingly insurmountable obstacles he has to overcome are the absence of a professional female league in the UK (hence their fascination with our WUSA), and his parents, who are Indian immigrants immersed in very ways antiquated that do not allow daughters, among other things, to practice contact sports. The girl's family is portrayed as a figure of ironic amusement, but with great affection - think My Big Fat Greek Wedding. The girl loves them and respects them enough to go through the sitcom hell to hide her growing soccer celebrity from them.
