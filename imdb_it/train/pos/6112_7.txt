It is first and foremost a chick, it is a romantic comedy. There is a balance between the two. This film in particular has the addition of some pretty sweet fighting scenes, I don't think they were used threads or if they weren't gaudy. It's not a terribly complicated film, so it's easy on the brain, there's no need to analyze anything to get the deeper, rather simple meaning, good lead chemistry and a funny clock. I would like it if they brought out the full potential of the girls it seems that only once can be incredibly pretty, but throughout the movie they keep the bass tone pretty nice. I'd watch it again ... with a girl.
