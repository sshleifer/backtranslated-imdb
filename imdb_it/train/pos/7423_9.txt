I recently saw the 1954 version of the movie with Judy, and while I enjoyed the story and the music, I discovered that the film couldn't catch my attention. I expected the '76 remake to be the same story, except with a touch of Barbra. I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern aspect of fame, money, love and the price of everything. This version is much more real than that of '54, with much better music, better acting, a more compelling storyline and, of course, deeper love. I don't understand why the previous film is in the top 100 of the American Film Institute, while this compelling remake fails to leave a mark on the list of critics.
