I always thought it would be a long and boring Talking-Head shot full of static interiors, man, I was wrong. "Election" is a very fascinating and completely captivating drama-thriller, which offers a deep and realistic view of the origins of the Triads-Rituals. The characters are constantly on the move, and even if as a spectator you are always a stranger, you can still hear the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters. Furthermore, Johnnie To manages to create truly opulent images thanks to meticulously composed lights and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts. Although there is almost no action, the ending is still shocking in its ruthless representation of brutality. A fantastic film that deserves more attention, and I've come to appreciate the minimalist acoustic guitar score a bit.
