"The second beginning", as the title explains, shows us the beginning of the end for the human race. Set long before the matrix existed, this short anime written by the Wachowskis shows us the world that could be in front of us in a not too distant future, set at the turn of the 21st century, the second renaissance enters into common issues with human behaviour ; greed, power, control, vanity, etc. <br /> <br /> The use of robots or artificial intelligence as slaves or servants is common among science fiction / fantasy stories. The second Renaissance is not an exception to this concept, but instead of a simple man-to-machine scheme, this story explains the struggle that machines endure, the struggle for acceptance in a world ruled by humans. Where matrix films show us the human perspective, these short animations tell both sides of the story. <br /> <br /> The second part Renaissance 1 + 2, answers many questions raised by the original film of the Matrix, such as how the war broke out, how the sky was obscured, what led to the use of humans as batteries and also introduces us to the city of the machine called 01, which could have relevance for the next Matrix Revolutions film. <br /> <br /> I won't give away too much of the story, since I don't want to spoil the experience for the perspective viewers, however I will recommend it to anyone interested in the matrix world or just anyone interested in Japanese animation (anime). <br /> <br /> 9/10.
