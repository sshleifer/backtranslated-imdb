MY MY FOUND FOOT, in my opinion, is a great biographical film about one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. The performances were amazing, the soundtrack was fantastic and the casting was perfect. I thought Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented man, even though I couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time. Also, when he had a tantrum, I got a little scared. Moreover, he is so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy. In conclusion, if you are a passionate fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or biopic, I highly recommend this fantastic biographical film about one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. You're ready for a real party and a good time, so don't miss this.
