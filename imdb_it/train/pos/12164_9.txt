In a year of fake slime like "Synecdoche, New York", a film born from the same self-indulgence of Charlie Kaufman, comes a film that is just as difficult to watch, but three times more important. "Frownland" is a work of love by the crew, actors and director, shot for years by friends. Track a man who can't communicate through his authentic and authentic Brooklyn world. The people you see are a step beyond even the stylization of the "mumblecore" movement. They are real people, painfully trapped in their own autonomous neuroses, not willing to change, incapable. For them the real world is their set of disappointments and because this is a film about people who are so profoundly out of touch, it is very difficult to watch. It is a 16mm film without the right light, money or other factors that would make a film "polished", but its honesty cannot be underestimated, a fact that would cause a room full of people to fire him and Richard Linklater to give him a award like he did to SXSW. This is reminiscent of films like "Naked" or the best of "mumblecore". It is a film that is not for everyone, but one that challenges you to look and grow on you longer than you think.
