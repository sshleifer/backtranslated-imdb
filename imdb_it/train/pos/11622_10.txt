Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams play in this action / thriller written and directed by the master of suspense, Wes Craven, himself. The whole film starts with a few problems at the Lux Atlantic, a hotel in Miami. The problem was solved by Lisa Reisert, the hotel manager. Then she goes to the airport, and that's where all the problems start. Meet Jackson Rippner, who doesn't like being called Jack by the name of Jack the Ripper, if you know him and I mean. Then they board the plane, and crazy enough, Rippner and Reisert sit next to each other. For the next half hour, Lisa is terrified, tormented and terrified by Rippner. I will not give anything. Then we move on to where Jack is chasing Lisa at the airport. Then Lisa goes to her house to see if her father is well and, insanely enough, Rippner is already there. There are almost twelve minutes of violence and intense intensity throughout the scene. In total, about 25 minutes of intense action come to an end. <br /> <br /> Not only was the film intense but it had a fantastic plot. As I said, I will not give anything because it is so shocking, electrifying and quite disturbing / scary. And the acting of every single character in the film, even those without lines, were all perfect. It was incredible. Everything was great in this movie! The acting, the music, the effects, the make-up, the direction, the editing, the writing, everything was wonderful! Wes Craven is definitely The Master of Suspense. Red Eye is a must see and definitely worth your money. You could see this movie again and again and again and it would never be boring. <br /> <br /> Red Eye I must say that it is better than 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Original MPAA classification: PG-13: some intense sequences of violence and language <br /> <br /> My evaluation MPAA: PG-13: some very intense sequences of violence and language <br /> My Canadian Rating: 14A: Violence, Scary Scenes, Disturbing Content
