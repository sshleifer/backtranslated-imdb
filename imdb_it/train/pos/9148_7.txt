A very underrated film that tells the story of a young musician trapped in a spiral of domestic violence that is always in decline. <br /> <br /> Sometimes difficult to watch, while Morris Day is interpreted as the misogynist, Prince as the rider on a motorcycle, is still called to beat a woman twice as part of the script. That he can do it and that he still emerges as an imperfect but confirmed hero, is due to writing. Prince is so ego-free in this film that he not only finds himself as a megalomaniac narcissist who beats women, but his most famous song is fictionalized as written by his father and Wendy & Lisa. Furthermore, two of his compositions - Computer Blue (obviously the weakest track on the album) and Darling Nikki - are shown as songs that kill an audience. Perhaps the only concession to the royal ego is a card listing the (slightly lower than Prince) Apollonia as 5'6. <br /> <br /> The almost complete-amateur cast are mainly the band members who play themselves (and slate reviewers who on the terms that never appeared in other films are completely missing the point), and they do perfectly well under the direction. Morris Day gets the most acclaim for his cute ham, although Jerome Benton must also have the merit of having bounced it well, especially their scenic act, which is hilarious. Day and Benton even go so far as to make a Abbott and Costello routine fun, which requires some work. <br /> <br /> Finally, there's Prince. While I admit to being a bias, I actually think he is a pretty good actor in terms of his ability to portray a low-key version of himself. Acting is NOT his profession, this was a movie made for entertainment, so anyone would point out that the boy in the main role is not Robert DeNiro and he thinks they are making a point he is sadly disappointed. I don't want this review to be a derisive attack on other people's comments, but I also expected this film to have a limited budget and it's dark. So how would a film on domestic violence be filmed? With ceiling spotlights and a CGI dinosaur walking in the frame? <br /> <br /> Does the film behave almost like a perfect snapshot of the neon light and the thin tie era? until you remember that it was actually made in a world of curly perches and metal synthesizers, and this is not a retro recreation. Prince's best film with Oscar-winning music, he sees it at its peak, and it saddens me to realize that even though he would have made some fine albums, he would never have captured this level again.
