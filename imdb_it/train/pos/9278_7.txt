In The White Balloon and Crimson Gold, the other two films by Jafar Panahi that I saw, the director draws surprising amounts of depth into subjects that seem light and on the surface. In Offside, Panahi's seriocomic tribute to Iranian women who defend their rights, I don't think it is as successful. Not that what he is saying is not important, of course (and it's a shame that, like almost all other Panahi films, the Iranians can't see it). But, after a while, the film looks a bit flat, and it seems to be as long as 90 minutes. Not saying that I didn't like it, though. The actors are all fantastic and the celebration at the end of the film is contagious. But it's not an important job, in my opinion.
