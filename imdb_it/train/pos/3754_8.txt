I remember seeing this movie on Saturday afternoon in the 50s or 60s. It was well presented, but I remember that there was a message of hope transmitted by the transmitters secreted by the glaring in one of the last manic executions for the imminent release. I'm not sure the squares with the facts. <br /> <br /> The film is still well done. The German High Command ironically reports an emotion "The Russians are advancing along the Fredrich Strasse" as if everything had gone as planned. <br /> <br /> I had the impression that this film and a subsequent American were made for TV. off was based on the tale of the British historian Trevor-Roper from a similar title Last Days of Hitler. I was surprised not to see the merit of Trevor-Roper. <br /> <br /> I agree that the new German movie on the DOWNFALL topic was well done as the classic. The American knock-off was a bit flat. <br /> <br /> Few figures have attracted so much attention from the cinema as Adolph. Yet I find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have come to the surface have ever talked about Hitler's double evoking the magnificent historical piece by John Toland. <br /> <br /> Were they flakes?
