They often laugh at fun games about sex, family, and Beverly Hills milk lessons plus laughter from the zip code not seen since the days of Granny and Jed Clampett. The plot centers on two chauffers who bet on which of them can host his employer (both single and soon single, rather sexy women - Bisset and Woronov) first. If Manuel wins, his friend will pay the debt to a violent Asian street gang - if he loses, he must play the background man to his friend! <br /> <br /> A lot of vulgar dialogues, quite sick physical humor, etc. But much of the comedy is just below the surface. Bartel is memorable as a very sensual member of the family that ends up bringing his sexy and teenage granddaughter on a "missionary journey" of a year to Africa. <br /> <br /> Fun for fun.
