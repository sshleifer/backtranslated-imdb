I grew up during the time when the music of this film was popular. What a wonderful time for music and dancing! My only complaint was that I was a little too young to go to the USO and nightclubs. I think it sounds like you live in the past, (I have wonderful memories) so what's wrong with that? !!? World War II was a terrible time, except for the music. Glenn Miller's death was a terrible sadness for us. This film will be my favorite. Clio Laine was excellent; what a voice! I don't know how he ever lost this movie. My main reason for this comment is to warn the modern generation of an alternative to Rap and New Age music, which is offensive to me. Please watch this movie and give it a chance!
