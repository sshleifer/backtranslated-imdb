In 1986 I saw this movie by chance on TV one evening. I was 6 years old. It was similar to my accidental vision of the terrifying final of Do not Look Now in 1987. I went to Venice on vacation the following year in silent terror, hoping for a god that my parents would not have discovered having seen it! <br /> <br /> Would I be sorry if my parents knew I had seen Les Valseuses as a child? I probably would have avoided the subject with my father even nowadays, and my mother would probably disapprove of the afterlife. I don't know if they will want to see it anyway. From the stalking and the trapping of a woman to the apartment building in the first scene to slide down the mountain streets with saturated and saturated eyes, I'm never sure if this film is a numb piece of garbage that neglects the sexual revolution or if it's a film of sexy release to look at when it occurs to you that you could never be so offensive. <br /> <br /> It is decidedly violent. He has a violent view of sex, practically no recognition of love. Even the infant of a small child turns into an avid sexual act of exploitation. But the scenery is very erotic and (god I am so English) exciting! Do they suck your breast for your own good? This is exploitation. So why am I becoming a woody? <br /> <br /> The comrades go in search of an experienced elderly woman, do they find a former swindler, a mother figure? I do not know. He ends up in a real gruesome suicide. I described it to my friend JB Nelson, who has a cannibal holocaust liver, and he left eeuurrgghh! No maternal love for this film, on the contrary. Mutilation of where the boys started. Why are they shooting a girl in the leg? Why do you come back to them? Should women be punished so that they learn what is right from men? <br /> <br /> I'm thinking of two films, one of which I wish I'd never seen before, the other makes me wish it wasn't a world so hard Swept Away / Madonna that a lot of madness doesn't calculate is never been so offended that a woman punished for being a woman becomes the man's slave and perhaps her madonna says everyone respects the boy, I'm so infuriated that I can't use punctuation! Once Upon A Time In America / Leo God Why Noodles Does It? It destroys the path of joy that we have been following throughout his life. So close to finally finding love with Deborah. Now they are both destroyed. Why Sergio? Why? <br /> <br /> There is no rape in Les Valseuses, but a lot of sex and nudity in abundance, of both sexes. Very honest, without titillation. No fantasy gets confused, no perfect perfect Hollywood move. Jokes, yes But there is too much darkness, jealousy and deception here to call it a sexual comedy. Forget to take back a naked hairstylist in the leg because he will come back and love you with your ex lover's avenger son and learn how to cum from him. <br /> <br /> Two things I can't stand are the rapes and prison movies. Les Valseuses is not a rape movie! God no one will want to see it now! It's a brilliant movie!
