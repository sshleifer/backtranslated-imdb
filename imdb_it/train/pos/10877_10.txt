I saw this movie with a group of friends and even though two of us came out of the cinema thinking it was beautiful, the others laughed and commented on how stupid it was. Well, because he shouldn't be taken so seriously, after all, it's a movie that makes horror movies fun and does a damn good job ... It looks like there's another movie coming out like that, umm ... Scary Movie ?? Well, this is Australian and original !!! Jessica Napier makes a superb performance and Sarah Kants has a bright and defined future in acting! I hope to see more of it. Molly Ringwald was a good move and Kylie was an even better move. The Impossible Princess was the queen of the screen !! I recommend seeing this movie, as you will guess until the end the connection with Raffy, Hilary and The film that never ended 20 years ago.
