Director Raoul Walsh was like Michael Bay from the 1940s and earlier. And I mean that in a positive way, since I am absolutely not an enemy of the Bay. His films are just high quality entertainment, just like in Raoul Walsh's time. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is quality entertainment. In addition to a first-class director, he also presents a first-degree cast, with Raoul Walsh's regular protagonist Errol Flynn in the main part. <br /> <br /> What surprised me was how boxing matches were brought to the screen. They used a very dynamic car job, which also made the boxing matches encouraging and exciting to watch, with the final of the championship fight against John L. Sullivan as the ultimate. <br /> <br /> The biographies of the 1940s and earlier were obviously still very different from the biographies made today. Modern biographies often glorify its main subject and show its life fundamentally from birth to death and everything, especially the emotional aspects, in the middle. "Old" biographical films were created as films not based on real people, which also means that filmmakers often use a lot of creative freedom with the personality and events of the main character that happened in his / her life. This film is not just a biography of a boxing legend, but also a beautiful portrait of the period when illegal naked fighting entered the modern era of boxing. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn does a great job playing the real famous boxer James J. Corbett aka Gentleman Jim. Not many people knew him but Flynn did some good acting work in the 1940s, of which this film is one. Physically he also seems to be in excellent shape. He also looks very different this way without his branded mustache in this film. In the film there are also some good supporting actors and a beautiful acting. <br /> <br /> A fantastic and entertaining film that still holds up really well. <br /> <br /> 8/10
