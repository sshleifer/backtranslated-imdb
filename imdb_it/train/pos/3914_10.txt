Personally, I think the film was done very professionally, I loved the choreography and acting. The plot is also compelling and mysterious. The film itself is very emotional and what I liked most is that it makes you think later. Antonio Gades has absolutely lived his role until the end, and I must say that it is one of my favorite photos and Saura is a wonderful director.
