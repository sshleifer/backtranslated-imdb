I liked it a lot and it was so shattered that it's not doing another season !!! I wish they would do it! it was the best show ever !!!!!! there is probably no possibility that they decide not to cancel the show! ha ha I wish there was though! I would be so excited !! I would really do it! I miss! and it was particularly destroyed for not knowing what happens to Jason !! I think they should do another .... but I also think it's stupid to have to write ten lines to post a comment ... it does drag your comment and no one will read it !! I really want to know what would have happened between Jason and Nicole ... maybe they could do a spin off !!
