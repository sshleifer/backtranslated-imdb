I haven't read all the comments, but at least one poster said the 30-minute version could be shortened. I'm curious because the next parts of the film didn't make much sense to me even when I rewound them. Even in 1917 30 minutes seem really short for a film. "Poor Little Rich Girl", which was Tourneur's next film, lasts 65 minutes and "Pride of the Clan", which was his previous feature, was 84 minutes long. So I'm relieved to see that I wasn't crazy, there must be a part of this movie missing and that's why the resolution doesn't make much sense. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to review or comment on films that you can only half see ... but I would still recommend this film because of the really fascinating vision it gives us of the interiors of an East Coast film studio. 'era. It is the first film I saw personally based on the film industry itself. The main character is a movie star played by Robert Warwick, who later became a leading Hollywood actor and appeared in almost all of Preston Sturges's films. He plays a western actor perhaps vaguely modeled on William S. Hart, which Warwick looks a little like. After the truly fascinating studio-set sequences, we see them in a photo shoot in which she discovers a country girl (Doris Kenyon) and convinces her to come to New Jersey for a screen test that is very bad. After that point the film seems to lack important pieces in the form we have now. <br /> <br /> Again, I would recommend it to anyone interested in the history of cinema for the value of the documentary, but in the way it doesn't hold up much like a film and is not a particularly good example of the work of Maurice Tourneur.
