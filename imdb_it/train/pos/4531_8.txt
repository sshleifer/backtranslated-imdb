This is a movie of cleavers that tells love through the centuries. The film is composed by Keaton in search of a lady of love in the Stone Age, in ancient Rome and in the present (1920). In all three cases, he is the usual Wimpy Buster and fights against Wallace Beery for his beloved lady. Of the three periods of time, I think I liked the Roman one, although I admit that he might have been the most cheerful. Actually I liked the scenes with the lion which was obviously a guy in costume as well as the strange chariot race in the snow - but what I liked most was to see all of Keaton's incredible stunts. However, all three eras have been a good old-fashioned film and, although not at its best, it is still an exceptional and enjoyable film. Check it out!
