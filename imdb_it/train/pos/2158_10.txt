I don't like "grade inflation", but I had to give this to 10. I can't think of something I don't like. I saw it last night and woke up today to think about it. I'm sure the Hollywood remake that someone told me, with J Lo and Richard Gear, will be excellent, but this original Japanese version of 1996 was so exciting and challenging for me that I find it hard to think anyway that it could be improved , or its settings have changed in a different culture. <br /> <br /> A story I found worthy of being seen, and with fist-warrior scenes or exploding guns or something! Imagine that! <br /> <br /> All the characters seemed well developed, ... even the non-primary characters had good character development and pleasant acting, and the casting seemed very appropriate. <br /> <br /> It is always difficult to find a good musical movie in our day and maybe this is not entirely appropriate (there is a lot to learn to dance but not to sing) but I really think that Gene Kelly and others who claimed a place for dance in our lives would have thought very well about this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a successful middle-aged man with a family in Japan, looking for something ... he doesn't know exactly what. <br /> <br /> To the team of people in Japan who contributed to this film, thank you for creating and creating it.
