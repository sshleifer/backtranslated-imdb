Ok, basically it's a pop-corn sci-fi movie, but from the beginning it's obvious that it was directed with a great deal of intelligence. You can count on about 10 clich√©s to which the film is growing, but it only offers about three of them, and a couple of them have a turning point for them that lets you know once again that the director has not assumed you are a idiot. Kurt Russell's acting is truly superb and brings a depth to the character that is surprising and rewarding. Recommended if you've just seen something really stupid and want to rebuild your faith!
