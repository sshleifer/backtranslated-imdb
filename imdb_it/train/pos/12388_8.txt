I read the book and I must say that this film remains true to form. I think this is the beginning of psychological thrillers of the same kind as Psycho. Cristina Raines offers an excellent starring performance, and Burgess Meredith offers an excellent supporting actor like the neighbor. I've seen this movie at least twice and I think I'll buy both the book and the film for my collection. The suspense continues to grow to the climatic end, the turning point you will never see coming. If you like movies like Signs and The Village, the Sentinel will be a classic prelude. Furthermore, what is interesting are the actors of the film: you wouldn't recognize them if you didn't read the credits. The late Jerry Orbach is as big as the sales manager and Jeff Goldblum is excellent as a photographer. Also there is Beverly D'Angelo, who is underrated but fantastic.
