As winter approaches, our state-owned broadcaster, ABC, has for some reason decided to have a partial Jane Austen festival on Sundays. This began with a 12-year film version of "Emma" last Sunday; More recent versions of three other novels, "Persuasion", "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park". <br /> <br /> The curious thing about this production of A & E Television Networks, with the script of the always-reliable Andrew Davies, appeared almost simultaneously with two versions of much larger budget films, one with Gwyneth Paltrow, and "Clueless", a "modernized" version, with Alicia Silverstone, who transported the plot to Beverly Hills. Perhaps as a result, even with Kate Beckinsale in the lead, this production collapsed without a trace. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, a lot is lost when novels are reduced to fit the length of the feature film. The adaptations that tend to be appreciated and remembered are those that have an adequate space to develop both the story and the characters. An outstanding example is "Brideshead Revisited" which had 13 episodes lasting 50 minutes in 1982. Just compare the film version of "Pride and Prejudice" in 2005 with the TV miniseries in six parts of 1995. It is not that a novel should be filmed page by page, and some novels (often not very good) adapt wonderfully to the film ("Atonement" is a recent example), but Jane Austen's novels need time and space to practice their full charm. <br /> <br /> Given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation, this production is OK. Kate Beckinsale offers Emma the right mix of security and vulnerability and Mark Strong is a sincere Mr Knightly (he reminded me that Jane tended to recycle the characters ??????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????? Samantha Morton was a rather limping Harriet, but Prunella Scales perfectly has Miss Bates of the blabbermouths - Sybil Fawlty in speed, and even Emma's weak father Bernard Hepton was excellent. poverty, as well as elegant interiors, in case someone thought that this was a particularly idyllic age for everyone. <br /> <br /> Even though this was a condensed adaptation it was strangely slow in the places ?? some of the conversations were rather rigged, even taking into account the formalities of the times.I should look at the film again to be sure, but it could be due to the under-use of the reaction shots. <br /> <br /> If you like the shooting of In the film, this is a perfectly nice example, and compares well with the version of Paltrow. Anyway, there's more to come!
