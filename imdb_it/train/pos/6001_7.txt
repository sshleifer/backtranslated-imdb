Not at all a masterpiece, and far from the best of Errol Flynn, Istanbul still has a lot to offer. The locations and the beautiful technicolor cinematography take us back to a past time. Errol Flynn shows moments of his past glory, and he is OK as Jim Brennan, a pilot who has turned to haunt him. The image is actually a remake of the "Singapore" of 1947, and the story seems terribly artificial and clich√© according to today's standards. Many of the supporting casts also seem to simply "go through the motions" in this image. Many people have even compared him to one of the greatest of all time, CASABLANCA. While watching the film, I could see many of the similarities, but hey, Casablanca has inspired countless imitators, so take it for what it's worth. In closing, if you're a Flynn fan, or old-fashioned love stories, you might want to take a look at this movie. Otherwise, I'd recommend Casablanca, or The Maltese Falcon, as a good introduction to some of the Hollywood classics ....
