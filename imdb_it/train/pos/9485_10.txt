I saw this movie for the first time several years ago - and it was connected in an instant. It's fantastic and much better than J. F. K. because you always have to think "Can it happen to me too? Can I become a killer?" You can't shoot the TV or your VCR without thinking about the plot and the end, which you should definitely not lose under any circumstances.
