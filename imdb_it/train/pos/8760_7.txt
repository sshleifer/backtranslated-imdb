It's nice to see a movie that you think will end happily like most other American movies, and then surprise you when that doesn't happen. I like a happy ending as much as the next, but sometimes it's better to portray things in a more realistic way, and I thought Brokedown Palace did it very well. <br /> <br /> The finale, with a friend practically sacrificing himself for the other, thus redeeming his previous bad behavior that brought them into the situation in the first place, was very moving. I would almost prefer to do without the last line, which showed that in reality he didn't do the deed he confessed, because that would have made the film more about friendship between the two girls, and less about crime. Whether he did it or not wasn't that important. <br /> <br /> The story itself bordered on the clich√©, but the actresses kept my attention with their excellent performances. Very realistic, very captivating. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
