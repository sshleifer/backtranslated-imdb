I can't wait for this movie to come on TV. I have to get the DVD, I guess. The range of different types of people is great. He tells me that anyone can be a dancer if they try hard enough. My favorite character must be Mr. Aoki. He is so eccentric but so full of emotions. It is a perfect film with wonderful dances. Unfortunately we never had the chance to see them go to Blackpool. He would do the perfect follow-up if they did. But I guess you leave what might happen to your imagination. <br /> <br /> A very simple and innocent story. He remains faithful to his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the Hollywood remake. I'm not sure if I want it. I don't really like Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere more closely matches Lopez's original. I have the feeling that the remake is not so simple and innocent.
