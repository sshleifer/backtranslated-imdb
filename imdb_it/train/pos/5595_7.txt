Polanski returns to the themes of solitude and madness he explored with such a tremendous effect in Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, in The Tenant. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is a Polanski brand - dark, brooding, unnerving - but there's something embarrassing about this movie and I'm not sure it's intentional or not. <br /> <br /> Sven Nykvist, who was responsible for some of Bergman's most beautiful films, does not do justice here. Since his name was one of the things that really attracted me to this film, I was a little disappointed that there are few examples of truly impressive cinematography in the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really leaves the film down is the acting. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but seems to have bitten him more than he can chew with the difficult role of Trelkovsky. Some of the supporting casts are great, especially Melvyn Douglas as host and Shelley Winters as the goalkeeper, but others are weak and annoyed. It is also difficult to overcome the fact that all these alleged Parisians have American accents. <br /> <br /> Quite unexpectedly, there are some good dark comedy moments in the film. Anyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is certainly a good comedian. However, there are times when he slips dangerously close to being a parody of himself. The sudden (and somewhat inexplicable) transformation of Trelkovsky is more likely to raise giggles than eyebrows, which takes away from what should have been a strong moment in his psycho-dramatic journey. <br /> <br /> All in all, The Tenant is a pleasant and intriguing experience, even if a little too languid for its good. There are a handful of exceptionally chilling moments and a constantly uncomfortable and disturbing atmosphere, but this film, although very good, has not hit the mark with the success it could have. <br /> <br /> Alas, at the end of the day, an "okay" Polanski movie is even better than most other "good" movies. Definitely worth looking at, don't expect to be swept away.
