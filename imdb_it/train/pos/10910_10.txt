A highly recommendable masterpiece, not only for the underlying themes of the story, but also for the unmistakable brilliant and ingenious work of Angelopoulos, not to mention the recitation of giants, Mastroianni and Moreau, and the remarkable character played by Ilias Logothethis. The performance of Gregory Karr may seem overshadowed by his hard "partners" in the first position, but in reality he perfectly interprets his character, who reveals himself in his last scene with the girl (Khrysikou) and the man (Mastroianni), although mentioned in advance. (Hence the spoiler.) <br /> <br /> Get your expectations! It is an "art film" in the meaning that that phrase has to offer and requires attention. Not to spend free time, but to watch a work of art with the necessary concentration like reading a book or attending a concert. Due to the general photographic style, a wide screen view is recommended. <br /> <br /> Dialogues are used sparingly. But the film includes, in addition to the Greek and English language standards, fragments spoken in Albanian, Kurdish and Turkish, which will be attractive to those who are fascinated by the beauty of listening to various languages.
