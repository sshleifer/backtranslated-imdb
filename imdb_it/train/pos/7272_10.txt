Before starting, let me tell you how BIG this special stand-up sound is when you play Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut at the same time (Red Mountain level in particular). So, as I watch this special stand-up, I suggest-- no, QUESTION you do it. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia takes his stand-up to the extreme in San Francisco, California. There, he makes fun of everyone with absolutely NO excuses. <br /> <br /> I am practically thanking God for the fact that Carlos didn't do his thing using the same joke again and again, again and again and again. He does a tremendous job teasing everyone and the same time is sincere; I know a couple of times I said, after Carlos said a joke, "Damn, this guy is a good point!" And then the Game Over screen came on my TV because I forgot to play Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut. My bad :) So yes, there is nothing to complain about this special stand-up. If you have TiVo or something like that, please do yourself a favor and record this historic time.
