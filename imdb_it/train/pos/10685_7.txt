This film has a clear plot, which is quite unusual for the musical genre. "Cats", "Phantom of the Opera" and other musicals by Andrew Lloyd Webber can be considered metaphorical, since they use literary works as their structure. The plot of "Biarkan Bintang Menari" (BBM) touches the very core of human relations, in particular that of the Indonesian people. Despite the fact that the film was based on a "presumably" fairy tale, it is actually a "child" fantasy in Indonesian adults. The dance sequences are not perfect, however the songs represent the way Indonesians express themselves. I think the choreographer should explore the Indonesian way of dancing, not baffling the fact that the development of dance in Indonesia tends to be more westernized. The dance sequences seem embarrassing in some way and not synchronized with the songs and / or the music. However, I still love this film and consider it a new wave of Indonesian film genre that I hope to improve in the future.
