I love Korean films because they have the ability to really capture (almost mysteriously) real life. I tend to watch Korean films just for this reason. I've already seen other directors in other films. What comes closest to the feelings I received from this is Oasis and another fantastic film called This Charming Girl. <br /> <br /> However, my title summary should be from a Chrstian perspective, so I'll just start by doing this instead of simply making it praise. <br /> <br /> For a non-Christian perspective, director Chang-dong Lee has captured a real and almost strangely real image of a modern Protestant church (regardless of denomination) and all. I've always waited for a Christian film that really portrayed the darkest recesses of church life. Because Christian films tend to speak in a different language than those they want to share their faith with. Many films with religious subtitles, despite having good motivations, tend to have the resonance of a Disney movie or a special after-school. They have to show life as it is. Real people curse, real people have desire, real people fall. And although Christians believe that salvation is available to those who seek it, we are still challenged by the daily horrors of this life. And the character of Do-yeon Jeon is a totally honest and almost brutal portrait of a woman who found God, but because of the bitter realities of life, she loses that love for him she once had. You do not deny that God exists. It's just that she refuses to accept living with the idea that He is a loving and forgiving God. <br /> <br /> In his decorous respect to the limits of morality and madness, his character poses questions that are on everyone's mind, religious or not. <br /> <br /> "If God is Love, why does He allow such terrible things to happen?" This film does not answer, rightly. And I believe that the last 10 minutes of the film, even if open to interpretation, leave us a promising future for our main character and bring the idea of ​​the "secret sun" to the starting point. <br /> <br /> I don't do it I believe for a moment that this film tried to be religious or that it somehow tried and tried to be that. There is the reason why it worked even more. It's real, it's honest. And because of this, it is by far the best synthesis of a true Christian life that I saw in the film.
