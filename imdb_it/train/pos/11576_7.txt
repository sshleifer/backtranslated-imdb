Try to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Sh√¥ Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it's really the perfect B adventure of all time. In reality it is a rather fun and reckless adventure that, even with its flaws, captures your interest. It must be considered the greatest film ever for the people who created it. Although it was made in the 1990s, it does not look modern. It feels more like an old Errol Flynn movie. Great adventure films are again the most important thing in Hollywood, but I fear their feeling will never be the same as those old movies. This on the other hand, has only the real feeling. You can't hate it. I think it's an adventure movie ok. And I love the soundtrack. Damn, I want the theme song.
