THE YOUNG VICTORIA is an elegantly decorated and reproduced piece of history that benefits from some beautiful settings, a solid direction by Jean-Marc Vall√©e of the courageous version of Julian Fellowes of the young girl who will become the longest reigning monarch in England - Victoria. Much of the first part of the film, the one in which Victoria is a child whose ascent to the throne is disputed by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) seems to drag on and get lost in the multiple costumes and variations scenarios. But once Victoria (Emily Blunt) comes of age and is courted by Prince Albert (friend Rupert), the film blossoms. Blunt is a strong actress and finds that delicate line between girlish infatuation and royal dignity that makes her a good protest for those at court trying to control the "baby queen" - including her secretary Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) . But as he matures in his role as queen, his eye lingers on the triumphant German prince Albert, and a love story that lasted in everyone's memories is accompanied by the concept of uniting Royalty with concern for the care of his subjects - much due to Albert's sensitivity. The film brings us to the birth of their first of nine children and then ends with some statements on the influence of the effects of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on the various Royalties throughout Europe! It makes an evening of beautiful drama in costume and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. A solid epic film if not transport. <br /> <br /> Grady Harp
