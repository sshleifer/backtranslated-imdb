This is just another example of the absolute genius of Gene Wilder. He wrote and acted in this terrible mystery. No one could have done it better. The suspense was palpable everywhere. I wish Mr. Wilder honored us with another one. I liked everything I saw in Mr. Wilder, but I had no idea how talented he really was until I saw "Murder in a small town" and this followed. He really has a solid understanding of what the public wants and how to distribute it in his writing and, of course, in his brilliant acting. His subtle spirit comes to the wheel. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves the mysteries and / or the Gene Wilder movie. His star becomes brighter and brighter.
