I thought this movie was a lot of fun. I saw this movie with my wife BEFORE I had my first child. Therefore, I wasn't looking at it as a simple family entertainment and I always loved it. It seems that many of the reviews point out that this film is not shocking, there were no unexpected plot changes and that the film was predictable and boring. If these people were watching this movie expecting to have a religious experience, then they would obviously have been disappointed. This is simply an animated film; nothing more. If you want to watch this movie simply to sit down and let yourself be entertained, you won't be disappointed. In conclusion, this is definitely not the best film that Disney has made, but it's fun and I don't understand the bad reputation it has received.
