It looks like it should be a biography of Claude Monet, but in reality it is a very focused story of relationships between three teenage girls on a French synchronized swimming team. There are no parents or teachers to talk about, no school, and the boys are represented by a peripheral figure, the hunky Francois who enters history determined from time to time and always leaves confused. <br /> <br /> Pauline Aquart is the youngest of the three, who only aspires to join the team that she admires so much. It's rather strange. She hasn't emerged from her teenage growth yet and has long bony limbs, big feet and nothing to talk about. He is a prognathist and shows off these full, puckered lips. After a while his appearance grows on you and from certain angles can become fascinating. <br /> <br /> Adele Haenel is older - more, well, more physically developed. What a charming figure he cuts in his bathing suit, wandering around, teasing the boys, shaking his long blond hair. But she's not what she seems. Or her? I couldn't understand it. The French have long been paradoxical and inconsistent. No wonder Francois is always sniffing her. <br /> <br /> There is not so much ambiguity in the character of Louse Blachere. She is also in the team, but she is sloppy, simple and sensitive, and has an intense crush on Francois. Blachere is a good actress and adds to the character's unruliness through her performance. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the relationships between these three, that is intrigues, deceptions, hidden feelings and all the rest of what to associate with young girls who spend a lot of time with each other. This is obviously a difficult topic. It becomes more complicated during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between Pauline and Adele. Not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie. The only nudity we see is considerably less than a breakthrough, and what little sex there is under the covers, sometimes literally. <br /> <br /> I don't think I want to go into the plot or its analysis too much, partly because it's suggestive rather than expressed through action, partly because it's complex, and partly because I'm not sure I understood all. <br /> <br /> Let me give you an example. All right. Adele is the girl who envies others. She is also quite distant and satisfied with herself. Moreover, he seems to be able to see all the boys and men in sight, if they can be of any use to her, from the beautiful but stupid Francois to the bus driver from whom she wants a favor. He brazenly boasts of his fellatio experience. When Pauline approaches her to enter the swim team, Adele uses her as a lookout during her assignments with the boys. A superior and self-indulgent narcissist, you know? But then the soi-disant bitch takes the very thin Pauline under her wing and reveals to Pauline that she is still a virgin. Really? Yes, really. Pauline begins to approach Adele and Adele finally confesses that she would like to get rid of her hymen and would like Pauline to do it for her. Pauline, now sexually attracted by Adele, performs the task with a subdued taste. NOW NOW I WOULD LIKE to REALLY do it with a man, preferably older and more experienced. Then take Pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with a boy until she follows Pauline into the powder room. The two girls stand there staring at each other, and have not openly expressed a sexual interest in the other. But Adele is so close that Pauline slowly loosens her reins, gets up and kisses Adele on the lips. Adele takes a step back, smiling, and says, "Well, it wasn't that bad, was it?", And then back to the club. <br /> <br /> This is a very nice description of what's going on between Pauline and Adele - but what the hell is going on? Initially, Adele treats Pauline as an irrelevant child, later as a close friend, finally as a potential lover - and the moment Pauline responds, Adele goes away satisfied. Is he using Pauline as he seems to be using men? Does it satisfy Adele that she now has another person in involuntary servitude? I do not know. I offended Louise Blachere as the third member of the trio, the simple and overly mature wallflower whose expression always suggests disconcerting, but which at least is completely heterosexual and the first three to get rid of that shameful virginity, but I just ignored it for considerations of space. <br /> <br /> Should you see it? By any means. (Just compare it to the typical American film about high school children.) For men, some of whom have never penetrated female mystique, this may give you an idea of ​​what it looks like in the average shot.
