I can understand those who do not like this film due to lack of knowledge. <br /> <br /> First of all, those girls aren't Geisha, but the brothel tenants and one who doesn't know the difference won't understand half of the movie, and certainly not the end. This is a complete artistic work on the life and needs of women in this era. Everything is important, and certainly the way they dress, the whole film means more than words. To those who thought it was a boring geisha film, I suggest you read a little about this company before making a conclusion that is so out of touch. This is Kurosawa's work of is life, and I'm sure the director understood the silent meaning of Kurosawa's piece to the right intellectual range.
