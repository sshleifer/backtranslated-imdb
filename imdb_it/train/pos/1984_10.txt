One of the best made musicals, one that is timeless and worth seeing over and over again. Delicious! The acting, in particular by Ron Moody as Fagin, is superb. The costumes are exquisite ... even the scruffy ones. <br /> <br /> The two young boys who play Oliver and The Artful Dodger are wonderfully talented. Oliver Reed does a great job interpreting Bill Sykes where you can't help but hope he comes to a terrible end ... what he does. <br /> <br /> Dance is expertly choreographed and is fascinating. Oliver can stand comparison with the likes of My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma, etc. A film for the whole family.
