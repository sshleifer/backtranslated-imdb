The performances in this film were fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patric made a fantastic performance as "Kid" Collins in this wonderful adaptation of the Jim Thompson novel. Far superior to "The Grifters", which was a good film, this film has remained faithful to the pulp fiction / film noir stories from which the story was born. I recommend this film to all fans of film noir.
