"The College Girl Murders" is my first acquaintance with Edgar Wallace's writing work ?? and in general my first true acquaintance with the films of "Krimi" in general ?? and I can say that I am moderately impressed. Is this stuff really fun, even if I never expected it to be like this ?? Fool! The film has an exhilarating and well-twisted plot, with a healthy dose of humor, flashy twists and rather inventive killings. Is there any kind of evil James Bond mind? who always sits in the shade and in front of a large monitor - recruits prisoners to kill certain girls in a specific college with a new type of poison. There is also an evil monk with a whip, dressed as a communist member of the KKK, who gets rid of the remaining characters, as overly curious and similar teachers, as well as an extravagant police commissioner who persists in solving the case with a psychological approach . Seriously, if I had known before that these Krimi films were so colorful and crazy, I would have already bought an entire collection of them. The pretzel plot actually raises more questions than it solves in the end, and the overload of comedy gimmicks on the account of Scotland Yard Inspector Higgins is sometimes a little too much to swallow, but I don't care because it was sublime entertainment. Even the soundtrack of the 60s has remained etched in my head for a long time. It is like a variant of Italian yellow, but with slapstick elements.
