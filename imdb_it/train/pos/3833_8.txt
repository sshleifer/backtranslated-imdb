I can't believe others have taken such a serious view of this. God, it was so much fun to cheer for Hop-a-long Cassidy. It was a great tribute to American serials from years ago. It didn't have to be a great cinematic experience, except it was. So what would happen if there wasn't a great special effect? It was fun, with my tongue on my cheeks, look at the old westerns. Man, relax and have fun.
