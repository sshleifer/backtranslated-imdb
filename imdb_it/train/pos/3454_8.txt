First of all, I'm not a little Justin Timberlake fangirl obsessed with making it look good, in fact I'm not even a big fan of Justin, but I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I work in a video store and when I saw this movie with its huge cast that I had never even heard, I had to see what it was. I did not find Justin's acting so ugly, it was clearly the worst exit from the group, but it is a rather impressive group, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that have not even made the list of first credits. The story is basic, a journalist who discovers corrupt cops, but I found it well done. The character of L L Cool J was clearly in conflict, but honestly I didn't know what he would do in the end. Morgan Freeman is as always, the wise mentor figure who does so well, and as much as I love Kevin SPacey, he was a little there. His character didn't have a lot of substance, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can't be wrong. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly I thought Dylan McDermott had given the best interpretation of a murderous cop. Really believable and really of character, it scared me a couple of times. <br /> <br /> I really expected a lot of kindness to be honest. Horrified horrifying phrases, unjustified action sequences, things like that, but it was surprisingly well done and I didn't find any of this. Every shot had a point, it was not a clich√©, rather solid. <br /> <br /> Overall, extraordinary cast, decent story that kept me interested and enough action to make me jump. I don't know why it didn't appear in theaters, it was better than some rubbish I saw on the big screen. I would say it's worth seeing.
