The part where Meg visits the mechanic and says, "Is the piston shooting short?" (implying low sexual energy from his girlfriend) was hilarious. I love Meg Ryan and she is sweeter than ever in this wonderful movie. Very lovable and also very intelligent. His innocent indignant expressions make you want to be yours. The hero handles garage mechanics well for physical transformation. Did Einstein have a romantic side to his psyche? The turn of the puzzle in front of the press and the public was done well. It is terribly undervalued and deserves recognition and recovery attempts. A vote is lost to include the far-fetched and far-fetched theory that is bought by the US government. I don't see why he doesn't appear in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century. Great movie, has the presidential seal of approval on it!
