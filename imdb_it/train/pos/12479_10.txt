What are the chances of a "siren" helium balloon traveling from Yuba City, Ca. (8 November 1993) and landing 4 days later (12 November) at MERMAID, Prince Edward Island, Canada. (About 4000 miles). This is a great movie. It is based on a true story. This film helps not only children to cope with losses, but also the elderly. I hope everyone will have fun !!! Rhonda
