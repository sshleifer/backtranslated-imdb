Pandro S. Berman was "production manager", but this made him the so-called Line Producer. But who produced this epic, shot not in Arizona but in the California Mohave desert, where the jackals did everything with the remains of the "golden temple", the Thuggee huts, the British outpost in Muri, the village of Tantrapur, etc. small technical defects can and must be forgiven. The unforgivable thing is the lack of an Oscar for the best music, even if perhaps the Academy didn't offer it at that time. A single theme was played at various times including the waltz, the march and the sweet, the atmosphere. Brilliant! One of the curious aspects of the production was the requests of the widow Kipling. An actor who plays Kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes. In the initial version his scenes were cut, according to the requests of Mrs Kipling. They were later included and lent a "connection" to Kipling's immortal poem to the script by Ben Hecht. It is interesting to note that this typically British and pro-British story was of a great writer who hated the British himself.
