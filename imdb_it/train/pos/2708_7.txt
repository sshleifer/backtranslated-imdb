After being sent to jail for no less than 10 or more than 40 years for being caught with drugs and refusing to renounce his successes, Jackie (Erica Gavin of Russ Meyer "Vixen" and "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls ", in her last film role) must get used to life in the big house of" dolls ", or at least try it, in this first film by Jonathan Demme. Because of his gaudy nature and his incredible impermeability, I would also classify him as one of his best films, right under "Silence of the Lambs" and "Stop Making Sense", but so far above his other films. This minor classic is just campy, shabby, and fun enough to be a guilty and incredibly good pleasure and fortunately never managed to overcome the parody of the Women In Prison genre. NEARLY washed away from my mouth the rancid bad taste of the "Philidelphia", ridiculously ridiculous. However, the film is not free of falls (the performance of an Italent is a huge task to sit on and goes on for too long, Barbera Steele is sadly wasted, among other little things) But don't let those sores stop you to watch an otherwise pleasant film. <br /> <br /> My Grade: B- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: interview with Roger Corman of 5 minutes; Cast & crew Bios; Original trailer; and trailer for "Candy Stripe Nurses" (with nudity), "Big Bad Mama 2", "Big Doll House" (with nudity), and "Crazy Mama" <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Juanita Brown, Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith, Erica Gavin, Roberta Collins, Ella Reid, Lynda Gold and some others show skin
