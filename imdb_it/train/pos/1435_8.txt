I appreciate films like this: smart and well made, fun, engaging, well acted and well directed. No one - not even Pacino - is chewing the scenario *, trying to stand out; one of the film's most effective moments (Aielo approaching his beloved exit ramp) is chilling for his control. <br /> <br /> Not as good as, for example, QUIZ SHOW, CITY HALL is of a similar fabric: involving the mind and the eyes, the ears and the heart. Because such well done entertainment fails at the box office no one knows. <br /> <br /> * You know, Pacino makes him chew in a particular scene, but precisely because it is required. Great scene too.
