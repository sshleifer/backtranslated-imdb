Although I like the books of EE "Doc" Smith and David A. Kyles of Lensman, the anime, which is freely based on books, is a rather amusing and rather innovative fair. <br /> <br /> Although the story may seem familiar to fans of Sci-Fi / Fantasy, like a child on an isolated planet who inherits mystical powers and avenges the death of his family, it is still quite funny. In addition, Lensman was the first animated film to simultaneously use hand-drawn animation and CG animation. Of course, it might seem a little outdated now, but it's still an innovation. If it were not for Lensman, none of this would ever have happened (personally, I think computer graphics are better in animation than live action.) <br /> <br /> Too bad they were released only on DVD / VCD in a few countries in the world of work (mainly on formats that are rather foreign and different). I just hope they release the film and TV series of Lensman on DVD / VCD in EVERY part of the world, not just certain parts. <br /> <br /> P.S. Worsel rules! I just think it's so beautiful and orderly.
