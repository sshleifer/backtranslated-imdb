At the beginning Hollywood is better !! A classic Kipling poem turns into an epic adventure with memorable performances of a stellar cast. I think the measure of a good movie is the number of times you can watch it and still really enjoy it. I've seen it a dozen times and I still cry at the end and, admit it, you do it too !!
