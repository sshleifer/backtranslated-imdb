William Hurt may no longer be an American matine idol, but he still has good taste in B-movie projects. Here, he plays a specialist in cleaning up hazardous waste with a tragic past that traces a perennial loser on the run - played by the ex-handsome boy Weller - who has been contaminated by a deadly poison. The current Hardy Kruger Jr. little boy - possibly nicer than his father - is described as Weller's arrogant boss in a terrifying sequence in a chemical production facility that moves history. Natasha McElhone is a slightly extravagant government agent who examines the incident that provides the inevitable and loving love interest for the hero Hurt. Michael Brandon looks like a slimy "don't take prisoner" type whose surrender cannot be expected. The Coca-Cola company wins the Product Placement award for 2000, as the non-alcoholic beverage is present throughout the production, lovingly filmed on the spot in a postcard-like winter postcard in Hungary.
