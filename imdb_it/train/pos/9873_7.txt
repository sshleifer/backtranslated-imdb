Lily Mars, a young girl living in Indiana, dreams of growing up on Broadway and her aspirations are resolved when the successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to his hometown for a visit. Lily tries everything she can to get Thornway to notice, but only gets angry for her antics. When Thornway returns to New York to stage his show, Lily follows (unknown to John of course) and Thornway eventually gives her a small role in her next show, only as a favor to her family, however Thornway begins to fall in love with this young girl and romantic flowers, which makes the protagonist of the show, Isabel Rekay, jealous. When Isabel gets tired of John-Lily's novel causing friction with the show, she leaves, and John decides to turn Lily into a star. Isabel returns later, and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she has returned to her little role in the game, which could also jeopardize the romance. Very fascinating film, and a refreshing change in seeing Garland putting comic touches in his role (his reading of Lady MacBeth, while it was supposed to be fun, never threatened his singing career) I liked the Heflin character (Thornway) more when he was annoyed with Lily rather than being romantic. The film became quite predictable and the scenes were not assembled so well together, but a very funny movie. Evaluation, 7.
