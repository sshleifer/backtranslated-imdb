The Secret of Kells is an independent animated film that gives us one of the legendary stories surrounding the Book of Kells, an illuminated medieval manuscript with the four Gospels of the New Testament. I didn't know that this book really exists, but knowing it now makes my interpretation and analysis much easier. There are some stories and ideas that float about how the book was born, who wrote it and how it survived for more than 1,000 years. This is one of these. <br /> <br /> We are introduced to Brendan, an orphan who lives at Kells Abbey in Ireland with his uncle, Abbot Cellach (voiced by Brendan Gleeson). Abbot Cellach is building a huge wall around the abbey to protect the villagers and monks. Brendan does not like the wall or even the other monks. They are more focused on reading and writing, something Abbot Cellach no longer has time to continue. He fears the "Northmen", those who plunder and leave cities and villages empty and burned to the ground. <br /> <br /> One day a traveler comes from the island of Iona, near Scotland. It is brother Aidan, a very wise man who brings with him a special book that is not yet finished. Abbot Cellach grants him permission to stay and Brendan's friends with him. Aidan has special plans for Brendan. First it needs ink for the book, but it requires specific berries. The only way to get them is to venture out of the walls and into the forest, an area off limits to Brendan. Seeing that he is the only chance for Aidan to continue his work, he decides to sneak out and return with the berries before his uncle notices his absence. <br /> <br /> In the forest Brendan meets Ashley, the protector of the forest. It allows Brendan's passage to the berries and becomes similar to his company along the way. She warns him of the danger looming in the darkness and of not hindering him. There are worse things than the Vikings out there. From there Brendan meets more challenges with the book and the looming certainty of the invasion. <br /> <br /> I like the story a lot more now that I know what it is. Knowing now what the Book of Kells is and what it contains, animation makes perfect sense. I'm sure you've seen images or copies of old texts hundreds of years ago, with fringed edges, colorful paintings and patterns, extravagant creatures and writings that adorn the pages. Just like the initial frames of Disney The Sword in the Stone. The animation here contains many similar designs and models. Create a truly unique viewing experience in which history and animation almost try to outdo each other. <br /> <br /> I couldn't look away from the incredible details. This is one of the best 2D animations I've seen in years. It is vibrant, stimulating and full of life. The characters are constantly surrounded by drawings, scribbles and motifs on the trees, on the walls and in the air that float around. Improve the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is satisfying, although I think the ending could have been a little further. With a running time of just 75 minutes, I think there may have been something special in the final act. It does not provide much information or allude to the meaning of the book. We are reminded of its importance but it is never fully understood. We are told that it gives hope, but never why or how. This was really the only missing part of the movie. Otherwise I thought the story was interesting even though it was completely overtaken by animation. <br /> <br /> I think it's ok at a certain level. Animation can bring a movie so far before it falls. The story lacks some parts, but it's an interesting review of a fascinating piece of history. I would recommend that you briefly consult the Book of Kells just to get an idea of ​​what this film and I are talking about. I think it will help your viewing experience a lot more. This is a very impressive and wonderfully illustrated film that should not be missed.
