Probably this is a great "sequel", better than the first live action movie 101 Dalmatians. He has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and all the right crap! <br /> <br /> Cruella DeVil, who has had a rather important therapy, is now a dog lover and very kind to them. Many, including Chloe Simon, owner of one of the dogs that Crudelia once tried to kill, do not believe it. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (owner of 2nd Chance Dog Shelter), believe it has changed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dipstick, with his partner, gave birth to three cute Dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball ... <br /> <br /> Starring Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (the hilarious ara), Glenn Close as Cruella herself and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another villain , the name should give a clue), this is a good film for families with enthusiasm and much more !! A fall of this film is that it has a lot of painful slapstick, but not as excessive as the last film. This is even more fun than the last movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy with "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
