This is a film about Italian artists of the 17th century and a particular artist, a Artemisia woman, a profession unheard of for women at the time, and had the courage to paint the male nude with her unique musculature. <br /> <br /> The work of the cameras is mainly in interiors, where the artists worked mainly. There are some great shots. Close-ups in candlelight suggest the fine work of classical painters and it is fascinating to observe the painters and their students supported by elaborate scaffolding that brushes the details of religious frescoes. Not surprisingly, the artistic elements of the film (costumes, faces, tricks) are authentically superb because Italian churches have preserved all these details in their frescoes for centuries. The beautiful Artemisia is stimulated by her father to study under the great Florentine artist, Tassi, who has become an expert in the art of perspective and landscape painting (something very new) but the unsuspecting Artemisia is introduced more than new techniques in painting . After posing for her, Tax violently violently. His father is indignant. Legal proceedings follow. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama has a fairly simple history with an unsatisfactory ending. The main feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail. Scenes like women running on a field with the wind swelling their bulky clothes add wonderful effects. <br /> <br /> Artemisia says that she paints to please herself; his father paints to please others. As for this film, I will like it better, I think.
