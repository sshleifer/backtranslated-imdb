At first glance this film does not seem particularly beautiful. After all, Bette Davis movies with only 166 votes on IMDb and a rating of 6.5 must be pretty negative. But the film turned out to be a delightful and original surprise. <br /> <br /> At the beginning you would expect it to be a normal movie of the 1930s with a formidable love story, but the film is surprisingly well built and has an unusual and original history that helps also to make this film very enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> The story is run by his two main characters played by Bette Davis and George Brent. Theirs was helped by a cast of mostly funny characters, but the film mainly involves only the two of them. Their character is involved in an unusual and intelligent written love story that works the same way. It makes this movie a delightful little comedy to watch, which is perfectly enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The film is quite short (just over an hour), which means that the story doesn't waste time, plot, development and characters in vain. It also makes the film pretty fast, which helps make this movie perfectly watchable even to today's standards. Maybe it makes the movie a bit simple sometimes, but this never comes at the expense of its fun or entertainment. <br /> <br /> A delightful and delightful romantic comedy that deserves to be seen more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
