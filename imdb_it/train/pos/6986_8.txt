If you are researching UFO facts, this video is very important. The "flesh" of the video is the comments made by Buzz Aldrin. It is without doubt the best in America. Trained to be objective, honest and concrete in his relationships. Many American astronauts of all ages have reported some kind of contact, or UFO observance, and there are videos from some of those missions. At the very least something happened that requires further investigative objectives in progress. I think this testimony of Buzz Aldrin shows that other worlds may be interested in our progress. Like all alleged documentary videos, this can be tilted, but it contains more information and opinions from an established American hero. Those don't arrive every day. So the fact that some people are not interested in the details should not discourage you from seeing this video. If nothing else, it's interesting and I suggest you look at it with an open mind.
