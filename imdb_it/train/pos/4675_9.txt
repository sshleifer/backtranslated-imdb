I saw "Brother's Shadow" at the Tribeca Film Festival and found myself thinking about it two days later. The story of a prodigal son (Scott Cohen) who returns to his family's custom-made furniture store after a jail term, offers all the qualities necessary for a solid drama - memorable characters; careful and attentive dialogue; sensitive use of the camera by a filmmaker who thinks visually. <br /> <br /> But more than that, it presents something extremely rare at the multiplex these days: the uncompromising vision of a mature sensitivity. The talent of the director and screenwriter Todd S. Yellin seems to emerge in full, but we have the feeling that he (like his protagonist) has paid his debts. He knows how real people struggle in this world and knows how we want to see, or at least indirectly, experience success. Yet Yellin respects his audience too much to blow happy smoke on our back ends. In the end, we see that Jake's triumph does not lie in the commissions, or even in the esteem of his family, but in the "work" he could not abandon if he tried. <br /> <br /> It is an essential theme in a world (and above all a film industry) that cannot overcome "the bottom line". This film deserves a large audience.
