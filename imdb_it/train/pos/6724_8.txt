As a popular sport, many people like surfing. Immediately after seeing the documentary, I realized how dangerous it could be. In fact surfers are also afraid of big waves. Even someone was killed by it. But they continued to sail and enjoyed themselves. Only brave people can do it. <br /> <br /> According to the surfers, we can clearly know what they felt when the big wave arrived. You have to adapt better and avoid the direct strike by the big wave. When you win, this will obviously bring you great satisfaction. <br /> <br /> The extraordinary cinematography cannot be neglected. It is an absolutely visual enjoyment. <br /> <br /> An excellent sports documentary. 8/10
