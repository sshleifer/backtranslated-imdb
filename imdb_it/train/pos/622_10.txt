While I don't consider myself a big fan of fairytale films, Stardust intrigued me based on seeing Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain (especially since I was about to see her as the bully Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray). Boy, she's so convincingly evil here as a witch, especially with her ugly make-up, at the beginning and end! Robert De Niro is also as big as the pirate captain who is forced to hide "in the closet" to protect his "reputation"! Almost all the actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others work well here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, there are also the stunning faces of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (like Girl Bernard) and Kate Magowan, especially when we meet her for the first time. The newcomer Charlie Cox is as good as the protagonist Tristan and looked so much like his father Dunstan as a boy that I thought he was in the first scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared this to The Princess Bride and while I see some similarities, the main difference was that with PB, you always knew it was just an imaginary story told by an old man to his nephew. Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you are seeing and listening to might actually happen even with all the hilarity that happens in everything. So on that note, I highly recommend Stardust.
