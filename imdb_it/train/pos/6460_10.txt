If the writer and director wanted to open their hearts to the film as the musician wanted to do with his music, they succeeded. Common human situations have become original, personal and immediate, so as to be personally touched by every situation. I believe I would give credit to the power of music combined with the point of view of the person writing the film. Without spoiling, I can say that I was touched by the approach to living of the film. Didn't you really scream out-what-joy? empathy? just a deep emotion? in a very long time. I'd like to find a way to show it to others. I saw it at the Seattle International Film Festival.
