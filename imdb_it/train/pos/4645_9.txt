This film is very interesting. I saw him twice and it seems that Glover hit the nail on the head with what he claims to want to accomplish. As far as I'm concerned, I can relate the indignation that the director clearly expresses against the current carefree corporate madness that is an assault in all our media centers and the things that we as a culture should not "think" about control of corporate media. The indignation that Glover expresses through the "outrageous" elements in the films is both clear in its visceral aggressiveness and beautiful in its poetic power. I'm glad I saw this film and it's even clearer that Glover has something interesting in the second part of what will be a trilogy. All right! EVERYTHING IS ALRIGHT. See also this. People who reject this film as "carefree" or "pretentious" are really losing the boat. This is a smart movie. If you can see it with his live show, he performs first with his books, which is also very angry. The way you enter his mentality is really something. You will have an experience!
