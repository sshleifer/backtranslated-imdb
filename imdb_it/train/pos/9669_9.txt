After reading the original script I thought it would be much more difficult to adapt to the screen than it was. Donal McCann stages a great performance as Public Gar, the repressed antagonist who openly manifests himself on the screen by his extrovert (but not seen to others) alterego - Private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays an excellent "turnaround" whose inability to communicate her feelings is matched only by Gar. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth renting if you find it. (Probably not available outside Ireland and the UK)
