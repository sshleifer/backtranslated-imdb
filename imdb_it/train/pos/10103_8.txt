I spent years looking for a copy of this film (16mm, dvd, vhs), so I could show it to my children. The film is fun, and Spike and his band members show why they were the best musicians in the business. They had to be so good at playing so demented. I like it and recommend it to movie lovers of all ages. <br /> <br /> The film is about a firehouse of the last century, with a crew of misfits who are firemen and the band of the department (when they don't fight fires). There are the usual racing gags, as well as the chaos of Spike Jones and his Orchestra. Also, the relief from the comedy provided by comedian Buddy Hackett and the straight man Hugh O'Brien.
