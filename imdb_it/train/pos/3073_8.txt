This is the kind of movie that Hollywood needs to do the most. No extravagant props, no car chases, no smart jokes. Only people take care of being people. <br /> <br /> William Macy plays an unlikely hit man who works for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy is the respectful son, Sutherland is the overbearing father. The son wants to get out of the business, the father won't let him. Macy loves his son, beautifully played by David Dorfman ("The Ring"). He also begins to fall in love with Neve Campbell, a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatric studio. <br /> <br /> It is an interesting juxtaposition of characters and the film follows the reluctant killer while balancing his needs with those of his family. There are many moving scenes, especially between Macy and her baby. And as you would expect in a movie with William Macy, there is also a bit of humor. <br /> <br /> Great all-round work, actors and director. It's nice to know that they can still make a good movie in Hollywood on a limited budget.
