I really liked the debut of Ring's director, Hideo Nakata. If you've seen Ring before, you'll know the style and idea of ​​this movie. It has a subtle spookiness that works better than the constant (and predictable) stingers that infest most mainstream movies of this kind. If you like films that give you the creeps, you'll probably like this. A good, terrifying debut by Hideo Nakata. 8/10
