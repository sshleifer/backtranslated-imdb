This film earned all ten votes I gave! Thanks guys for making a movie worth seeing. You showed the world, you can still write, direct, produce and act in a black movie without the negative stereotypes. Even the poetry was fantastic, the hats to musicians and poets. <br /> <br /> I saw him last night when I fell in love with my darling again. I'll add it to my movie collection today and recommend it to my friends and family. <br /> <br /> Continue to produce quality, don't worry about the quantity .... <br /> Thank you again, and best wishes and blessings to you!
