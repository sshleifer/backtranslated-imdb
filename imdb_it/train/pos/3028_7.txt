It could have been a better movie. Drag the points, and the central story moves from Boyer completing his mission to Boyer avenging the death of Wanda Hendrix, but Graham Greene is an author who is really hard to mess up. His stories are all moral stories, because of his own considerations on Catholicism, guilt and innocence (very relative terms in his world view) and the human condition. <br /> <br /> Boyer is Luis Denard, a well-known concert pianist, who sided with the Republicans in the Spanish civil war. He was sent to England to try to get a deal to buy weapons that is desperately needed. Unfortunately for Denard he is literally alone - all his contacts turn out to be a vulgar vulgar for the Spanish Falagists. In particular, Katina Paxinou (Mrs. Melendez), a very bad landlord, and Peter Lorre (Mr Contreras), an "Esperanto" international language teacher. Wanda Hendrix is ​​the slave of a girl (Else) who works for Mrs Melendez. The local diplomat, Licata (Victor Francken) is already a volunteer collaborator of the Phalangists. <br /> <br /> The British (Holmes Herbert, Miles Mander, and the best - if not the worst - of the group, George Coulouris) don Give much hope to Boyer's cause (which may very soon be Britain) . Herbert and Mander retreat behind the official neutrality policy ordered by the governments of Ramsay MacDonald and Stanley Baldwin during the Civil War. Coulouris here is a typical Col. Blimp type - always impeccable in his native English diction, he is strong in showing his dislike for foreigners in general. <br /> <br /> The only ray of hope is Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen), here she tries to interpret her role in the best possible way, but she can't really. She is an aristocrat, the daughter of a press lord. It was Bacall's second film and (sad to say) he almost sank his long career. She does well, but the spark she showed in her first film is due to the dual effect of starring with Humphrey Bogart and being directed by Howard Hawks. Boyer is a good actor, but he's not Bogie, and Herman Shumlin isn't Hawks. Her next film brought her back to Bogie and Hawks, and her star resumed its rise. <br /> <br /> It is a dark film (as was the novel). Boyer's mission is never successful, because he has too many enemies hidden everywhere. But the bad guys are also losers - often with their lives. <br /> <br /> With Dan Seymour as a suspected foreign tenant of Katina Paxinou (and the man who destroys her). It is worth looking to capture the sack of Warner's characteristic actors doing their best given the weakness of the director.
