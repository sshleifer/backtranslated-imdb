Gender Bender the Limerick: <br /> <br /> A man or a woman? Who knows? <br /> <br /> It turns out that "it" is both. <br /> <br /> Sleeping in the clay <br /> <br /> Then they all went away <br /> <br /> In one of their UFOs. <br /> <br /> Gender Bender is another great episode of Season 1. I like this one because the story is the kind in which you're never really sure what will happen next. It is completely original. The teaser is very funny with the foreground of the eye and the reflection of the disco lights. I really need to learn my makeup for the genderbender thumb. I really like the atmosphere of the small village of the Brothers and Mulder and Scully, who are stealthily moving in the middle of the night. It's very exciting. This is one of my favorite episodes of the first season. I think the thing I like about it so much is how they turn out to be aliens in the end and they left the crop circles. Many people see this as an alien episode not related to mythology like "The Unnatural" or "Space", but I think this can easily be seen as relating to mythology. Perhaps the genderbender was just like the alien bounty hunter and could look like anyone. Eh? However, I give the episode a 9 out of 10.
