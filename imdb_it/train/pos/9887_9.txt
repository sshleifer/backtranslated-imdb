"Erendira" is a film from Mexico that is rarely discussed. The film exists only in a low quality VHS format. It is a pity that this film was not given a DVD version. "Erendira" is splendid and wonderful with her magical-realistic images. "Erendira" is based on a story from the novel "100 years of solitude". Erendira is constantly dreaming with her eyes open and accidentally burning her grandmother's house. Her bad grandmother, played by Irene Papas, forces her into prostitution to pay damages. The whole city receives a piece of Erendira, so to speak. Although the subject is hard, the film does not exploit sexuality. It is done in a mature artistic way. The film also has fantastic costumes. Some of the most surreal aspects of the film that stand out most are the origami birds that turn into real birds, and a golden orange with a diamond in the center. Erendira is a fantastic film, which even manages to throw humor. This is definitely a movie that deserves a special DVD version. As they would say in Spanish, "Es muy muy bien !!! Excellent!
