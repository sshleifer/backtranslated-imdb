For beginners, it's a very funny film with some crazy characters around who are forced to make people laugh (take a look at the two Russian bugs). <br /> <br /> A Bug's Life has a classic Disney storyline, but that's one of the good things about the movie. The family values ​​are praised and the main characters of the film undergo some evolution to endure the grasshoppers in the end. And he also has a couple of great voiceovers from Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey (of course), ... But actually, the most amazing thing about this movie is animation. It's simply wonderful. All the details, the fantastic colors, every ant looks different, beautiful backgrounds ... And the boys and girls of Pixar have made everything so realistic. All in all, a very nice job. This is the best animation from Disney since Aladdin.
