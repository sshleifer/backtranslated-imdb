Soylent Green IS ... really a good movie, actually. <br /> <br /> I never would have thought. I don't really like Heston in his science fiction efforts. He is one of those actors who, like Superman, manages to bump into all the scorns and invincible most of the time. I prefer more vulnerable heroes. And indeed, he makes a mockery of much of Soylent Green too, but since he should play a bully too confident I don't mind. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people turn their noses on this movie. Soylent Green makes absolutely no effort to create futuristic images (what you know - it looks like 1973), and lacks action. However, I admire the film's vision of a complex, corrupt and highly stratified society, and I was very pleased to see that Edward G. Robinson had such a fun and moving final role. Cute moments from a small character - like when he shares precious food with Heston - really make the movie. <br /> <br /> Soylent Green's message is quite relevant these days, when no one seems to know what the hell the government is or the corporations are up to it. Funny, isn't it, to see Heston in a prototype of Michael Moore's film ...
