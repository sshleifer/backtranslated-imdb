Despite having read the "initial comments" of someone who didn't like the movie - (WHY IS THE ONLY VERY FIRST COMMENT OF THE LIST?) It was very nice to note that practically everyone else loved it! Obviously the Church wanted to emphasize some points and portray the Prophet Joseph Smith in a positive way - this is the idea. And indeed, those points were extremely effective. We already know that Joseph Smith was human ... but nevertheless, AND all the horrible negative attempts aroused by the adversary, showed how he was able to complete a work worthy of note. I would recommend it to anyone!
