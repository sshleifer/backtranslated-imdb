I first enjoyed every episode of Pushing Daisies shamelessly this season, and I hope the writers' strike does not end brutally with the beginning of a very beautiful show. Ned is a cake maker who owns a restaurant in the city center and has a secret talent. Emmerson is a private investigator with his unique quirks like his love for knitting. Charlotte (Chuck) is a childhood friend, once dead and no longer, and a sunny place in Ned's life. Olive is the jealous but kind-hearted waitress. Oh, and add the dog. Jim Dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narrative of the show. Chuck, Ned and Emmerson together with Olive and occasionally the dog solve multiple mysteries of murder with the help of Ned's special gift of bringing the dead back to life. The show is fun, clean and romantic in a very nice and kind-hearted way, and I would recommend it to anyone.
