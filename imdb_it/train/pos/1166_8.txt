Tony Arzenta, a bitter and deadly bitter man (a divinely smooth and imposing performance by Alain Delon) wants to leave the assassination activity, but the dangerous mobsters he works for won't let him. After his wife and son were killed, Arzenta declares the season open to all those responsible for their death. The director Duccio Tessari tells the absorbing story at a steady pace, maintains a serious and no-frills tone, stages the exciting shoot-outs and the exciting car chases with remarkable sniffing verve and punctuates the narrative with explosions of explosive bloody violence . Delon's suave and charismatic presence adds extra class to the already compelling process. This film draws further benefit from the sterling recitation of a bang-up cast, with laudable contributions by Richard Conte such as the wise mafia boss Nick Gusto, Carla Gravini as Arzenta's companion Sandra, Marc Porel as Arzenta's faithful friend, Domenico Maggio , Anton Diffring as ruthless, calculating boss Grunwald and Lino Troisi as the poisonous gangster Rocco Cutitta. Silvano Ippoliti's lucid cinematography boasts numerous graceful pans. Gianni Ferrio's funky soundtrack hits the fantastic spot. Erika Blanc and Rosalba Neri appear briefly in elegant parts. Better yet, there is nothing to talk about and we also get a decent touch of tasty free female nudity. The surprising conclusion contains a petty and persistent obstacle to the intestine. A solid and satisfying winner.
