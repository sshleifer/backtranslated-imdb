This TV series was one of those I loved as a child. Even though I see it now through pink nostalgia glasses, I can still say that it was a quality show, very educational but still fun. I have not seen the original French version, only the Swedish one. I have no idea how good dubbing was, it was too long ago to remember. <br /> <br /> The premise of the show was to show you how the body works. I swear, the school hasn't taught me half of what I know from this show yet. He also tied in other things, like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and you don't train, with good examples in the body. Who wants to have another chocolate bar when you know that miniature virus tanks can invade you? : D The cardboard looked nice, very suitable for children, of course, but done with care. Cells, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are represented by figures of smiling cartoons, which look more or less like you would expect them to appear in the animated body. <br /> <br /> This and the series on history (in particular the disturbing ending to the environment) were fundamental parts of my childhood. I'm so happy I found them here.
