I didn't see BSG, I tried to watch it once in the middle of the show but I couldn't. Anyway, I saw Caprica Rebirth yesterday I felt a little lost, so I decided to watch the pilot today and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I think this is a promising show and the only side effect he has had on me is that now I want to watch BSG too. <br /> <br /> But what I really liked is that I didn't have to be a fan of BSG fans to understand what's going on in Caprica. From what I read on the net, they were trying to reach the female population since BSG reached more men, and at least in my case it worked. <br /> <br /> However, I suggest that if you are trying to see the show do it from the beginning starting with the pilot.
