The film was not exceptional. The book is better But the film was not so bad. It was interesting to say the least. The plot had enough suspense to make me look, although I wouldn't say that I was really interested in the film itself. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr are both beautiful enough to let you watch :) They have some cute scenes that should please the romantics. Overall I would give the film a 7 or 8. It was not bad, just a little lacking in plot.
