Made in the same year as "Vertigo", this is an equally haunting film, albeit in a much lighter vein. It's set in an enchanted New York during the winter: Kim Novak is a witch who casts a spell on James Stewart, but is captured instead in it. The interesting light of position is that Novak's rival is played by Janice Rule, who gave rise to Madge in "Picnic" on Broadway (the part that Novak would have made famous in the film).
