This extraordinary film can be summarized very easily. First of all, while "Princess Bride" comparisons are inevitable, it is almost useless to do so. While both films combine humor and humor for adults with a fairytale scenario, "Stardust" is very different from any other fantasy / sci-fi movie I've ever seen. It is a hybrid of those genres, but the plot and screenplay are so unique that - along with performance, special effects, cinematography and scoring - the finished product is simply not comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the screen of silver. Secondly, the soundtrack is very effective and simultaneously draws us into history and into the fantasy world in which the story unfolds and pushes forward, while creating the right amount of wonder and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm in which the characters exist. Thirdly, I did not find the film even remotely difficult to follow or confuse in any way. Indeed, the interesting interaction between the three main subplots made it even more compelling to watch. Wonderfully cast and superbly performed across the board. This fantasy adventure (with elements of science fiction) was the best I've seen from "The Return of the King" (not that I'm comparing the two to everyone). OK, so it's not so easy to summarize it, but don't let any crude and / or ruthless and cynical reviews, nor the pathetic PR of the film prevent you from participating in the best time you could have at the cinema this summer (or maybe even for a long time time)!
