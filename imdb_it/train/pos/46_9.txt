I just finished watching this movie for the 7th or 8th time, I took it one night previously seen at Blockbuster and I loved it, I showed it to 4 people so far and they also had fun . Avoiding all the Hollywood glamor, special effects and stress on the "shock factor", this independent film by Paul F. Ryan hits the nail on the head to face the side effects of traumatic situations. Taking place after a high school shooting, two characters Alicia (Busy Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen) form an unlikely bond. Alicia, the girl with a heart of stone, the Goth who has a pessimistic attitude towards life, helps Deanna overcome the questions of life and death and live in the next period. Meanwhile Deanna tries to help Alicia see again part of the softness and light of the world. Not to emphasize the shocking event of the shoot, but on the interpersonal relationships between those who survived, this film stands out. Despite its limited budget and the short recovery time, this film is anything but poor. Ryan respects a situation he has never endured and tries to deepen the human psyche. With a fascinating emerging actress, Philipps, adds the drama necessary to the dialogue and the general feeling of the film and Christensen helps to balance the feeling of "gloom and darkness" that this film could have. Overall, I recommend this film and if you like the theme of aggression and school violence and you know more, I also suggest the documentary "It's a Girls World" published by CBC in 2004, which deals with the issue of social bullying, comparing and comparing two groups of girls, one in Montreal, Quebec and the other in Victoria, British Columbia, the group of friends and acquaintances of Dawn Marie Wellesley, a 14-year-old girl who killed herself after being brutally bullied.
