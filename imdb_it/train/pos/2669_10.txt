This story set in the suburbs of Wellington, New Zealand (Tawa-home of the famous Tawa College) is the first feature by McCarten. <br /> <br /> With a contemporary New Zealand flavor, Via Satellite abounds in absolutely hilarious situations that develop in the (adult) family context. At the same time it manages to arouse intense emotions of sadness and despair. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving and humorous films of the year - not to be missed!
