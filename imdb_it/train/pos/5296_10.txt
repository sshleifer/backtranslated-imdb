Absolutely hilarious. John Waters' tribute to the people he loves most (Baltimore) is a little twisted little song with lots to look at and laugh at. It's like being scattered in a kitsch museum! I didn't laugh so much in a Serial Mom theater. I enjoyed seeing old friends from Dreamland days, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, in front of Waters' camera. The cast is simply wonderful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). Use the best elements of the atrocities of the past waters (in particular the undervalued polyester) and many new surprises. It hurt me, in a wonderful way. Thanks, John!
