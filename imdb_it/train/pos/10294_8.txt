Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman together with Jennifer Aniston unite to make one of the funniest films so far this season 2003 (late May) and a good improvement on Carrey's past crazy and personally forgettable roles in past comedies. With Carrey's antics a little reduced, but with only the zapping and crackling of his old self, Carrey strongly brings this film to the height of laughter and also some dramatic and gloomy moments. The elements of Jim's true acting skills continue to appear in this film. This delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons, including dramatic elements and awkward moments that fit perfectly into this script. While still lacking the superbly polished comedy / drama ensemble, Bruce, Almightly deserves the credit of being a great dating film along with a solid message and a soft spiritual cynicism and parody that retains its good taste. Eight stars out of ten.
