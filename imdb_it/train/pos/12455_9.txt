I used to watch this show when I was a child. Although I don't remember much, I have to say that it was a pretty good show. Also, I don't think I've seen every episode. However, if you ask me, it was still a good show. I vaguely remember the theme song. Everyone was ideally cast, the costume was fantastic. The performances were also of a high standard. I just hope one day some networks report this series so I can watch every episode. Before concluding, I would like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I don't think I've seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, when and if this show is ever aired again, I hope you catch it one day before it goes on forever.
