Bela made 9 photos for Monogram, but it was only THIS, the 4th, that things started coming together. All the rest of the series would use this as an essential model for character production, writing and development. From here on, for better or for worse, the series will also deal with an essential theme: a scientist (usually Bela) experiments in the basement or in the old house (sometimes in the basement of the old house) that makes things go. This was also the first time that artistic director Dave Milton had the chance to spread his wings. He got on board for BLACK DRAGONS, the first shot, but THIS is where he can get his boat started. Lewis has created a fantastic atmosphere for almost nothing and has been around for the rest of the Monograms. The cast is crucial in these, and it's a pretty good B movie here. Get Barclay and Harlen (also from BLACK DRAGONS), along with Russell, who will star in the Catton People films of Lewtons .. and Rosetto, of SPOOKS RUN WILD ... a nice slice of Poverty Row talent. If you have limited time and budget, start with this ... summarize everything they had learned so far and offer you something to compare the rest with. The plot? Bela steals gland juice to keep her ugly wife young. They both like to sleep in coffins. If you can read it and smile, the rest will be easy.
