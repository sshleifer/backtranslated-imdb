Clear and well-made documentary focused on Mardi Gras beads. I have always liked this approach to creating films - communicating ideas about a larger, more complex and often inscrutable phenomenon by breaking down the problem into something familiar and close to home. <br /> <br /> I am sure that many people have heard stories of exploiters and I understand the reasons behind profit and capitalism, and the effect of globalism on poorer nations (however people feel about it). Rather than expounding on these topics and getting up on a soapbox (not that there is anything wrong with that, other than those documentaries that usually preach to converts), this documentary simply shows the Mardi Gras beads, how they are made, by which people , and under what conditions and how they are used by consumers at the end of the process. Openly and explicitly analyzes the motivations of all the people involved in the process, including workers, factory management, American importers and, finally, the consumer at the end of the chain. <br /> <br /> I felt a little disgusted with this; similarly from the Mardi Gras revelers, but also from the way the workers in China accepted their situation as normal and equal for the course (although they have some objections to the details of how they are managed). The video of the street sweepers who cleaned the pearls at the end made a particular impression. But this was just my reaction; I can see how someone else might read this documentary a little differently. <br /> <br /> Unlike other documentaries on this topic, I don't think you should have any specific political opinion to be influenced by this. This is ultimately a story about human beings and our relationship with the goods we produce and consume. If you've ever bought a product made in the Far East, this should give you something to think about. <br /> <br /> Exceptional and highly recommended. You need to see more documentaries like this. Congratulations to all those involved in the making of this film.
