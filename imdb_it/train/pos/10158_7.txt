Johnny and June Carter Cash have funded this film which is a traditional representation of gospel stories. The music is great, there is a real feeling of what the world of Jesus was like (I was there too), and June enters the part of Mary Magdalene with passion. Cash's narrative is also good. <br /> <br /> But .... <br /> <br /> 1. The actor who played Jesus was unbeliever. 2. There is no limit to the story, as Cash partially puts his music based on faith. 3. Since it is not interesting, I doubt we will still see it widely distributed. <br /> <br /> I'd like to buy the CD. <br /> <br /> Tom Paine Texas, USA
