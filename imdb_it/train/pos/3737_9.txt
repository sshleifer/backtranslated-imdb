First of all, this movie was a wild ride all the time. The history of the training of the soldiers, the struggle with their superiors, and finally the grouping. <br /> <br /> From start to finish. This is a War Drama that is worth seeing if you come for the constant curses (sometimes beyond reason) and the horrors of what the training camp is. <br /> <br /> The interaction dynamics of the actors were quite surprising at times and sometimes funny. Like Bozz (Colin Farrel) he confronts Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout the plot, from camp to Tigerland, and even helps him eventually. <br /> <br /> Innovative hand-held shots added some taste or flavor to the film. Constant movement, constant action and constant confusion. Sometimes, it was a help. Others, not so much. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, it has been increasingly realistic. Some points in the film (the sex scenes in particular) seemed to be a little too realistic even though they added an effect to the film that wouldn't have been there without them. it was a really gritty film, in every way. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of Colin Farrel's best films (if not his best performance). The acting for each character was superb. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
