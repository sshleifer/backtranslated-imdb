Most people, especially young people, may not understand this film. It seems like a story of loss, when in reality it is a story of being alone. Some people may never feel loneliness at this level. <br /> <br /> The character of Cheadles Johnson reflects the exact opposite of the character of Sandlers, Fineman. Where Johnson felt trapped by his blessings, Fineman was trying to forget his life in the same perspective. Jada is a fantastic additive to the cast and Sandler tears. Cheadle had a comedic role and was a great supporter of Sandler. I see the Oscars somewhere here. A very beautiful film. If you have ever lost and felt alone, this movie will ensure that you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
