It's really funny. He has an exceptional cast that offers great performances. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. It is a well-written script by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon In Vegas). I don't like soap operas, even though I never watch them. But I love this movie because it's so crazy and out of the wall, it beats out of every stupid soap they have on daytime television. In my opinion, it's the best film of 1991.
