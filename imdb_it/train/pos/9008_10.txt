I saw this movie without knowing what it was ... I'm a fan of Branagh, even more his Shakespeare films, and, at the beginning, I only saw him for that ... and I ended up with tears in my eyes, because the great, great serenity, values, affection and courageous philosophy on the life of Elena's girl. Recommended for people bored with TV programming (at least in Spain).
