Michael Keaton is "Johnny Dangerously" in this take-off on gangster movies made in 1984. Maureen Stapleton plays her sick mother, Griffin Dunne is her brother DA, Peter Boyle is her boss and Marilu Henner is his girlfriend. Other stars include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton plays a pet shop owner in the 1930s that catches a kid stealing a puppy and then tells him, in flashback, how he got to own the pet store. He turned to thefts at a young age to get his mother's pancreas operation ($ 49.95, special this week) and started working for a mafia boss (Boyle). Johnny uses the surname "Dangerously" in the world of the mafia. <br /> <br /> There are some hilarious scenes in this film, and Stapleton is a revolt like Johnny's insensitive mother who needs to replace the organ in her body. Peter Boyle in the role of Johnny's boss makes a very entertaining performance, as does Griffin Dunne, a dart that does not "play ball" with crooked Burr (Danny De Vito). As a nemesis of Johnny, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri is a leading exponent like Moronie, who tortures the English language - but you have to hear him do it rather than read it. What makes it fun is that it does everything with an angry face. <br /> <br /> The film gets a little tired towards the end, but it's worth seeing, and Keaton is formidable as a good boy / bad boy Johnny. For some reason, this film was underestimated when it was released, and like Keaton's other gem, "Night Shift", you don't talk much about it today. With some performances and scenes that are real gems, you will find "Johnny Dangerously" immensely fun.
