I saw it for the first time in the early 90s in UK TV, I liked it a lot, but I lost the chance to record it, many years have passed but the film has always impressed me and I lost hope of seeing it again , the main thing that remained with me was the end, the part of the castle of the hole really touched me, it's easy to look at, has a good story, great music, the list goes on and on, it's okay telling me how much it is beautiful, but everyone will bring the best pieces with them once they have seen them, yes the animation is top notch and beautiful to look at, shows its age in very few parts but now it has become part of its beauty, they are so glad it's out on DVD as it's one of my 10 best movies of all time. Buy it or rent it, just see it, the best view is at night alone, with drinks and food at hand, so you don't have to stop the movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy yourself
