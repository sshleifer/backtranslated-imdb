Here is my first film directed by David Mamet. Editing, since it was his first, as well. <br /> <br /> The story here is uneven and moves along like any ghost movie, from small to big disadvantages to all-encompassing. It's like "The Grifters", but without the acting level of that movie. (In that movie, John Cusack was a bit bland but that was the nature of his character.) The acting here is very flat (sometimes I wondered if Crouse's bland acting should be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis). At least at the beginning. It never gets really good, but evolves beyond painfully rigid reading after about ten minutes. At the beginning of the film, some of Lindsay Crouse's lines - the way she reads them - seem like an inner monologue or narrative, which they are not. With the arrival of Mantegna things resume. <br /> <br /> Dialogue here is not as fun as it should be. I was expecting ring-a-ding-ding-ding-rock lines that roll out of the tongue, but these don't. It all looks very read, rather than spoken. Maybe Mamet evolved after this movie and broke up, but if not, then maybe he should let others direct his words. It is too precious with them here and as a result, they lose their rhythmic and jazz quality. The strangest thing is that, apart from that, the film does not seem nor does it seem like a game. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with "Glengarry Glen Ross" was that it looked too much like cinema, but in that movie the actors weren't just complete, but relaxed and free. Everything flowed. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't mind a lot if it sounded like a character in a movie that talked about movie lines - or even played characters that talk about game lines - but here it seems that the characters in the movie (or even the book ) talk about the game lines. It's a strange mixture of theater and film that simply doesn't work. This does not mean that the film is bad - it is not, it is often extremely funny. The best part is in the middle. <br /> <br /> It's a standard thing for the cinema: the new guy (in this case, the girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved in the damned world of crime. How she lets herself get involved is: she's a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler. He wants to help him with his gambling debt, so he enters The House of Games, a squalid game room where scammers work in a back room. I admit that the configuration is rather unlikely. (Were they just waiting for Crouse to come in? Were they waiting for him to write a check? Was it Billy? On one of these questions he was definitely answered at the end, anyway.) <br /> <br /> And here the consuls begin to take off . I found the beginners - the small students - to be the most fun. We are learning the art of cheating like Crouse. <br /> <br /> Let's see the final arrive, and then we didn't see the second final coming, and then the real ending that I didn't see coming but maybe you did. The ball continues to bounce back and forth and from the last scene of the film we realize that the second Crouse entered The House of Games has found its true calling. <br /> <br /> I'm going to forgive the annoying opening, the unlikely bits and the strange reading of the line because there are many good things here. If the first part of the film seems stolid, follow it. After the half hour, the result is really positive. If you want a funny movie, then here it is. If you want Mamet, go and watch "Glengarry Glen Ross" again - James Foley did it better. <br /> <br /> ***
