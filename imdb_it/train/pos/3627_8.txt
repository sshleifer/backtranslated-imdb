What a fun cinema experience! I was expecting a cheesy children's movie and found that I liked it better than my teenage years. Take a tissue, it's not sad, just "move" in parts. Finally, it is a "feeling good" film for the whole family. Note: they are 2+ hours, so consider leaving the squirmers' smallest home for this. AP
