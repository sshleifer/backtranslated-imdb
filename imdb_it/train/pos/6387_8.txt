I thought this movie was very well done. Even the off-screen voices were fantastic. I liked the way everyone has overcome their conflicts and achieved their goals. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was definitely worth the pain, the time and the money to see it. Atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh. Other scenes have made me sad. And others have pleased me. It is a film that any age can enjoy. From the moment in which Milo is the crazy "profesor" or until the crew gathers for the fantastic journey under the sea. After watching the movie, I read the book. It was nice, but the film puts better images in your mind. It's just like the book. But go ahead and watch this movie!
