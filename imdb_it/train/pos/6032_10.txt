Antonioni really showed some "cojones" when he made this film. He went to America working with a contract of the most luxurious studio (MGM) and made the most overwhelming portrait of the American society I've ever seen. Having seen LA first hand, this is the most accurate portrait of the crowded, overheated and impersonal city. If only Antonioni had met Bill Hicks ... <br /> <br /> The subsequent burial of the study is understandable, after such an enormous investment and a sad return. It is sad that people no longer see this film, because I believe that Antonioni was right. Here he foresees the end of the hippie / civil rights movement in American politics. Everyone is much more interested in what enters their pockets and the incessant expansion of living space in the inhospitable (yet beautiful) desert and beyond. How I'd like to see the interest in this resounding film and a sumptuous DVD version. <br /> <br /> I suppose people look at Zabriskie Point with an open mind and an open heart. We have a truly unique film that comments on a turning point in the history of the most powerful nation on the planet, and we have forgotten it. <br /> <br /> An unexpected jewel.
