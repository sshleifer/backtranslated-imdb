One of my favorite movies, with a very nostalgic ending. The film is about the Sullivan family, obviously Michael Sullivan (the father) is one of the main members of the mafia, the murderer to say it this way, and an expert. One of the children wants to know his father's work (a terrible mistake), so he hides on his father's car and well, he sees Tom Hanks in action to say it this way. <br /> <br /> Mafia doesn The rules, in Mafia no one wins, when they want you out, they take you out. Of course you can see anyone working with the mafia in a giant house, the best car in the world, whatever you want, but doing the wrong job or doing something your "boss" doesn't want, and you're fired, and killed. <br /> <br /> You can see what I mean in the film, Sullivan Jr. sees something he didn't have to see, and well, almost all of his family is killed for that "wrong thing" his son did. The movie is really fun, you can see how the Sullivans live after being chased by the mafia, or something like that. <br /> <br /> This film is rather sad, it shows us revenge, those dirty works that people do, almost everything you like. I hope the boy is reading this comment does not work for the mafia, and if you work do the mafia a favor and go out of the country before being killed by your boss and his workers. <br /> <br /> This film receives: 10/10
