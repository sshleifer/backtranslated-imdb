Although DiG! was hailed as the closest to what the music industry is as if it were highly manufactured. The director led the public to believe that the Brian Jonestown massacre disappeared from the face of the earth after 1998. And the rivalry between Dandy Warhol and Jonestown has been milked. The truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film. <br /> <br /> That said, the film is infinitely quotable and is an interesting watch because we take a look at two groups of highly talented musicians who create their art. One of the best things about this film is a unique perspective between the independent music scene and the larger corporate scene. <br /> <br /> Recommended especially for music and the two fantastic bands.
