I've seen this movie more than once now, and there's always someone complaining about the "obvious construction" of the plot later. But then - this is part of the Petzold game: play with the rules of the genre. <br /> <br /> It is very beautiful, as the highly unlikely story of how the two girls (Timoteo / Hummer) meet, is again reflects another story, even more unlikely, that the girls make up for a casting . This film is a journey between reality and fiction, it is more about potentials, things that may have happened in the past or could happen in the future, rather than actual expenses. It's a kind of reverie, so fitting that there are many reasons, which Freud might have found interesting for the analysis of his dreams, like all the "doppelganger" constellations. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I think "Gespenster" could be interesting to see compared to the current Asian cinema of the uncanny: even the daily urban architecture of Petzold feels infested in an unobtrusive and strangely familiar way. This film is not about the obvious. To describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers, or as the story of an orphan mother, who looks for her lost daughter in Europe, clearly does not say much about the nature of "Gespenster".
