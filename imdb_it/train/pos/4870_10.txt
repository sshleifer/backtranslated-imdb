The film celebrates life. <br /> <br /> The world is preparing for the innocent and pure souls and everything has "Happy End", just like in the final scene of the film. <br /> <br /> The film has a wonderful soundtrack, a mixture of Serbian neofolk, Gypsy music and jazz. <br /> <br /> This film is a very refreshing visual poem. <br /> <br /> The vision experience is like you have been sucked into another colorful, romantic and sometimes rough world. <br /> <br /> Like Mr. Kusturica's film should be.
