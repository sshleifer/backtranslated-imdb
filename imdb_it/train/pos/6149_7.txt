I have just purchased the restored version of a film that I remember with great affection since childhood and it is certainly made for a curious afternoon entertainment. The bedknobs certainly have more sense in its complete form, the deleted scenes (especially those with McDowall) connect the events together in a fairly orderly manner. What is a little disconcerting is the way the scenes have been remastered. Clearly, the soundtrack of this movie had been lost or damaged, so some brilliant spark at Disney decided to duplicate the scenes with a new dialogue. It would have been great if not that half of the cast was not there to do it (some for better reasons than others) and the whole thing has a rather poor quality. Some of the lip syncs are pretty bad, and David Tomlinson's voice was dubbed by a guy who looks nothing like David Tomlinson (actually I think there's a bit of German, I think). However, it's nice to hear the full versions of all the songs (even if "Step in the Right Direction" is still absent) and the moments of magic in this film continue to shine. And I dare you not to giggle when the young Paul looks so innocently at Angela Lansbury and his coos "but what does it have to do with my knob?"
