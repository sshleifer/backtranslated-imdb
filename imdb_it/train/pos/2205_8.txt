Your psychotic garden variety lunatic (deliciously elaborated with ramshackle joy by Stephen Sachs) silences the dull young "adults" (to use the term very freely) in Dayton Hall University, which is closed for demolition. With a terrible acting by the whole cast (Daphne Zuniga makes her ignoble and ominous film debut here as Debbie, a child whose head is crushed by a car!), A heavy number of corpses of 10, makeup ok f / x by Matthew Mungle, some bloody murders (baseball bat, chicken screech, your standard drill through the tip of the head, that kind of macabre thing), a surprise surprise surprise that was later copied into "Intruder ", a gruesome soundtrack by Christopher (" Hellraiser ") Young, a slight grimace of free female nudity and irresistibly incompetent direction by Jeffrey Obrow and Steve Carpenter (who also blessed us with" The Power "and" The Kindred "), this hilarious and excruciating slice of atrocity stands out as a good dose of deliciously low-quality dopdy and drecky fun.
