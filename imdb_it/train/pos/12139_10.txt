This film, although more than 70 years old, is still a very moving and strong film. Bette Davis, as the slutty and ferocious waitress Cockney Mildred is absolutely credible. Watching his performance is still fascinating. It makes the viewer absolutely despised and sympathetic at the same time. Leslie Howard's performance as the weak and obsessed Philip Carey is not so strong, but I don't see how an actor can stand up to the performance of Mrs. Davis. She chews the scenery in every scene she finds herself in, totally stealing the show. This is the film that sealed his celebrity and deserved to win the Oscar, but lost. What was shocking for his day was that of unmarried pregnancy, multiple sexual partners and Mildred's vicious language, so it's a little dated, but still an excellent film. Just to see the scene where Mildred tells Phillip what he REALLY thinks of him ("You cad, you dirty dirty maine ...") is still one of the greatest recitations I've ever seen in a movie.
