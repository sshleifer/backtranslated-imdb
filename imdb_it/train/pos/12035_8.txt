I recently came across this TNT movie for five minutes while I was on vacation in Florida ... (hey there must be some free time at the hotel, right?) I was initially surprised to see Melissa Joan Hart in any feature film on TNT. I mean "Drive Me Crazy" ain't old yet, is it? <br /> <br /> But I was glued to this, and was completely surprised and amused. Melissa plays the role of the psychotic Jennifer in an excellent way. The supporting cast (Nick, ex-boyfriend, Karen, her best friend and her life-controlling parents) added a great degree of credibility. The turning point in the end was a nice closure for this story of the girl who always seemed to be one step ahead of everyone. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance, take a look! <br /> <br />
