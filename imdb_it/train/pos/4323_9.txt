This is a great adaptation and a great mini-series of its own. The plot cuts could disappoint book fans (but how many modern readers have read Bleak House without seeing a film version first? I only know a few). <br /> <br /> I think it's pretty terrifying to see critical reviews of the series that were clearly written by people who have no idea of ​​the story - you actually saw the series or you just made a BBC production bag because Gillian Anderson was it in the latest version? <br /> <br /> The series captures the mood, the rhythm, the characters and the drivers of the plot (eliminating the Dickensian florins that are not necessary and diminish a cinematic treatment like the story of Turveydrop, the dynamics of the family Smallweed and extra lawyers - Tangle, Vholes etc. are very truncated). The only omission that I would have liked was the Jellyby incident, but since the first episode is already a bit slow (after the first episode the rhythm is perfect), I can see that it had to go. <br /> <br /> The only other criticism I have is that Jo's death could have been done more faithfully. I can see that he would have practically canonized Woodcourt and he was a bit more human for not having that scene, but actually I think Jo's death is one of the most touching points in the book and I missed it even though it always makes me cry. <br /> <br /> Actually, theowinthrop saw the series? HOW did you think Ester had grown up with her aunt and UNCLE ?? Who is this uncle? I suppose someone who could confuse the name of DENHOLM Eliott for Desmond is not a true admirer of English art (film or literature). I also think he made mistakes in handling the law. YES, the law is drawn VERY badly in Bleak House. The descendants of Jarndyce, whose precious legacy is devoured by the costs of litigation, fails, the deceased Tom Jarndyce and Rick Carstone and all those who trust the seed fail. Miss Flyte fails. In a sense, Captain Hawdon, who is driven to his death by the monotony of the copyist work of the law, also fails. Yes, it feeds the scavengers of Vholes and Tangle. But it also makes men like Guppy and Kenge able to go beyond their position in life. Although they are not kind to social status, the Dickens climbers would clearly have preferred that they were not forced to get stuck in the station where they were born (contrary to Jo and the masons' families climbing from the poverty of Charley Neckett). <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the law, poorly used by Tulkinghorn and the Chancery vultures, is actually the source of security for the Ada and Richard court departments, and for Esther who is simply the Jarndyce ward. Their security has been guaranteed by the law that delivers them to Jarndyce. <br /> <br /> I can't understand how anyone could have trouble following the story - remember that you shouldn't understand that Esther is the daughter of Lady Dedlock the beginning. Nor should you "get" all connections immediately. Instant gratification does not happen to Dickens himself. <br /> <br /> As for the "see clearly" through the fog - Gillian Anderson had such an eccentric editing that I found it impossible to follow and I already knew the plot! <br /> <br /> I found Diana Rigg absolutely brilliant (the script and the drama are not a good Lady Dedlock but if you think they tried the Gillian Anderson version). <br /> <br /> It's ADA and Rick not "Kate"! and get everything you need from the Rouncewell subplot.
