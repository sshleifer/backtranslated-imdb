"Zabriskie Point" (1970): Was this particularly interesting for me on a personal level, since it takes place under identical circumstances, with identical peers, in my own life? the Counter Culture movement of the late 60s / early 70s, on and off campus. We follow two unrelated young men in separate stories, which intertwine slowly. One is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of all the endless, pseudo-revolutionary jabbers in the classrooms and canteens on his campus, and, the other, a young woman who drives to Phoenix to see his father and his employer , and takes on an "establishment" job. The film is FULL of the visual notations of our Italian director's America (Michelangelo Antonioni) and, the confused, psychedelic crazies of the hypocritical age, "we know everything, we will change everything for the best" of the young. Only who is the "revolutionary"? What does REALLY mean? Do you dress like one and march around the song? "Fly under the radar" but warn in advance of your arrival? Do you keep your plans for yourself, and go about the business of change, without group approval? "Zabriskie Point" is certainly a "vintage piece" - full of slang, uniforms, a little surreal cinematic moments (after all, this is a film by the man who gave us the incredible "Blow Up" of 1966) and the artifacts of the time, but more. Presents options for the cultural revolution, and going to Antonioni (who seems to support it), young people are too involved to see what is needed for radical success. For this reason, it becomes a powerful and scary movie that applies to anyone, anytime, anywhere.
