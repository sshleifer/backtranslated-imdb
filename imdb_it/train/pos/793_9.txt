I really liked this movie. (This is why it surprised me that it got such a low score from so many users on this site!) I'm not saying it's a cinematic masterpiece, but it was a great way to spend a cold, snowy Saturday night. It's fun, moving, and a great story of the ups and downs of female friendships that last through difficult times and bad things that friends tend to do to each other! (let's assume we're ALL!) Bill Paterson shines like Reverend Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell shows that she can be a good actress when the role is right and focuses on it. (And really, there is the best "honeymoon" I've ever seen or dreamed of in this movie ... more courage than anyone else has ever known!) You will laugh and cry --- ignore any marketing campaign and how is commercializing this film .... it is a hidden gem that TONNES was supposed to do at the box office. (now I have to look around to buy a copy!)
