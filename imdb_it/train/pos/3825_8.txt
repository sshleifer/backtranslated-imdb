A young woman arrives in her husband's hometown after his death in an accident. He barely settles in this small town, but soon after, he loses his little son in a kidnapping and all his hopes ... This could lead to all kinds by following the storylines in a normal movie: finding a new partner and being happy long last; or depressed enough to fight and eventually kill each other ... Try to kill yourself, but not after a series of hard fights with God. Trust God, only to discover that God seems to forgive everyone, even the murderer. Well, I should pay attention to God here, the film means nothing to God. The way the film deals with this is quite interesting: not from the point of view of the woman or from God's point of view (in this way, I suppose that there is a lot of grass growing, clouds that beat the views). Rather, it is from the eye of a third party, the film allows us to perceive and does not explain a thing. <br /> <br /> The film would not be so interesting if there was only the woman. There is this man who is everywhere around the woman and obviously in love with her, but in his own way. He's a funny guy, as a clown would say, who clings shamelessly to our heroine. The combination of these two, the woman full of tension, always cries and vomits, and the man, smiling and talking stupidly, ends up in a good balance of emotions: nothing absurdly wrong or too boring. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend.
