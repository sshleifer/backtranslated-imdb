The intellect of the weft is light as a feather. But the advantage here is the classic refusal of boy and girl that we got used to in "The Gay Divorcee" and "Top Hat" is now absent. Instead of the typical accidental knowledge, the dancer duo are the former lovers Bake Baker and Sherry Martin, who are still in love with their dancing days. <br /> <br /> Of course, being a 1930s musical, there are the problems of misunderstood romanticism, class courtship and the slight irritation of an audition sabotaged with baking soda has cost Ginger something rather special. And then, in the great tradition of diminishing finances, there is nothing better for the best Hollywood entertainers than to stage a show. <br /> <br /> Irving Berlin's delightful numbers are scattered throughout the show. Top hats and evening dresses are saved to the end, which remains a refreshing change. Fred and Ginger are out again to charm the world ... and enchant the navy. Everyone and everything is once again so pleasant. <br /> <br /> Pure classic nonsense at its best. But with Astaire and Rogers, we only know that it has to work. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.25 / 10
