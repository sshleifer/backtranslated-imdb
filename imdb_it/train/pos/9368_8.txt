I just returned from a screening a couple of hours ago, and I was very happy with the film when I left it. It's very intense, and the closest one I came to cry in a movie in quite some time. This is a credit to Adam Sandler, who offers a magnificent performance on many levels and probably deserves an Oscar for this if he hadn't been released so early in the year. Don Cheadle gives his usual superb interpretation by interpreting the straight man to Adam's disorientation. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of humor, but most of it is really fun just compared to tearful moments, while Adam takes care of his loss and Don struggles to help him. Adam plays two levels very well ... when he is mentally stable he is fun and funny, but when he is, well, less stable he is powerful and dark. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to all those who love mental dramas about friendships and difficult losses.
