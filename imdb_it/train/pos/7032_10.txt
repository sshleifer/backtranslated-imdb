My school's theater club will release this show in the spring of 2002, and I can only hope to be as good as this! I saw this movie recently as a sort of "research" for my role (Rosie Alvarez), and I'd just like to say that Vanessa Williams is the most beautiful! <br /> <br /> Wow! The casting for this film was right (with one exception). Jason Alexander, oh my God, is there something you can't do? He was the most wonderful Albert Peterson ever - especially I liked all his funny facial expressions and dances during "Put on a Happy Face!" He is so beautiful! Vanessa Williams, as I said before, is the most beautiful. She was a beautiful Rosie and her transition from a secretary to a seductress was absolutely credible. Tyne Daly was as exhilarating as the hateful mother of Albert and George Wendt was as superb as the annoying Mr. McAfee (however I really liked Paul Lynde's 1963 version!) Brigitta Dau smashed me like Ursula Merkle; she really hammered him! And Marc Kudisch was a fantastic Conrad Birdie ... "Suffer!" <br /> <br /> There was only one casting I didn't understand, and, as you'll see from previous comments, many other people didn't understand Chynna Phillips as Kim McAfee - what was it? I mean, she's really pretty and very talented, but ... she looks a little too old for the role. Eh, maybe I'm disappointed. <br /> <br /> Okay anyway, I highly recommend this movie. It will leave you smiling! <br /> <br />
