I saw this wonderful production and I wonder if anyone could tell me something about the actress who played the blacksmith's wife: I'm not sure of her character's name. I went to BYU with her and lost contact with her - her maiden name was Kim Luke - and I wonder if anyone has any information about her. You are not listed in the credits. This production was exceptional, a tear-jerker on all points of view, a superb acting by everyone. I guess I don't even want to put it in the general category of 'acting', more like 'portraying with hearing the incredible events that led to the opening of Heaven for this final dispensation' ..... something like that. If someone has worked with Kim or has a website or something please let me know !!! She was fantastic in her role, by the way ... Thanks, Melissa Thorne
