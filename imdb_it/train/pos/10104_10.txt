The exhibition by Om Puri, Smita Patil and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and the whole chemistry resolve well, together with the minimalist approach to the story and the direction of Govind Nihlani. The dialogues of Vijay Tendulkar are also fantastic. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen another movie like this. It is a whole, each piece is so well inserted into the plot. You can't be struck by this movie. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri looks like the overbearing husband and "baap" of Om Puri. Om Puri is the young man trapped between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system. Sadhashiv in the role of Rama Shetty gives the right touch to the film with his smiling and tender villain. Anand Velankar's first meeting with Rama Shetty instead of Sadhashiv is absolutely amazing. Smita Patil does not have a main role, but also its part does not distract from the main plot. <br /> <br /> And to add to all this, Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a policeman who has come to terms with the system and its operation. Say the right things in the right places and know how to keep yourself out of trouble. He is also the "guru" of Om Puri and helps him every time he gets into trouble. <br /> <br /> The film not only focuses on the difficulties encountered by a police officer who tries to do his duty but also the other part of the brutality in police custody. Om Puri captures desperation and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in Ardh Satya. <br /> <br /> A treat for all lovers of Indian cinema.
