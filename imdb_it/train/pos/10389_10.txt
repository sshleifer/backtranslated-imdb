I saw this movie when I was a child. It upset me. This was before television, so a film of this magnitude could send a kid into orbit. I was so impressed that I went to watch this movie for twelve consecutive days. The special effects used at that time were far ahead of his time. Sabu was a real treat, as was Rex Ingram as a genius. I found myself singing "I want to be a sailor" for months after the film left the city. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, who was an evil character like you never wanted to meet. Furthermore, June Duprez has never been more beautiful than she in this photo. The color was exceptional. Give this movie a AAA!
