Luckily I saw this movie, just because I was going through a phase where I had a new admiration for Bill Pullman and I wanted to see all his recent films and thank God I did it! This film has remained with me ever since and remains one of my favorites! The story revolves around two girls embarking on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they will learn the true meaning of freedom. <br /> <br /> Alice and Darlene were just trying to spend a vacation together before going to university but their journey ended with a much more complicated story. The struggle they go through while being arrested in Thailand and becomes a prisoner is very moving and intense. The acting is extraordinary, the images extraordinary, the soundtrack is fantastic and so right for the film and the message transmitted is decidedly powerful. Actually I can't even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time I watch it. I know some people didn't appreciate it as much as I did for the evaluation of the film, but I swear, this, you have to see !!! I promise you will stay with you!
