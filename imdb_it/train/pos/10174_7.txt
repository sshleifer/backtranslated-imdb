This was another message of World War II to the soldiers and allies to pay attention to spreading the rumors. These were called "instructive" cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a fun-looking main character called "Pvt. Snafu". <br /> <br /> We all have imagination, along with fears and ... you-you, and that's what happens here as Pvt. Snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something that feels and comes with " five". You can panic and get all kinds of disasters if you spread enough voices and enough people believe them. This includes the loss of trust in your country and your cause, as pointed out here in this comic. A good way to lose a war is to demoralize the enemy. This is still done today. <br /> <br /> "We lost the war", declares a great baloney towards the end of this cartoon. Unbelievable how some Americans haven't yet learned. This cartoon could be 65 years old but it certainly has relevance today. As I write this, there have been two terrorist attacks in Europe today and some still think that the "War on Terror" is just a slogan for sticker newsletters. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The writer, the famous "Dr. Suess", uses analogies of "balloon juice" to present the message above. With Theodore Geisel (his real name) you know the rhymes will be smart. <br /> <br /> Nothing hilarious here, but it wasn't meant to be. You have to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that was out there during the Second World War. People forget that the war could easily end up with the other party winning. It was a moment of tension
