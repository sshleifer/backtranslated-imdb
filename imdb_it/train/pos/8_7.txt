The drama is very beautiful even though it seems to have some empty areas that leave the spectators to fill the action for themselves. I can imagine that life is like this for someone who can neither read nor write. This film simply has a taste of the real world: the wife who is suddenly the only supporter, the living relatives and their quarrels, the tormented child who is silenced and, typically, abandons school, an idiotic husband who takes the nest and buy beer with it. 2 inches up.
