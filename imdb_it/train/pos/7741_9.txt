The first of two adaptations by Jim Thompson published in 1990 (the other is the best-known GRIFTERS), AFTER DARK has all the distinctive features of Thompson: dangerous women, the game of trust and characters that are not as weak as others suspect them Jason Patric is superb as a former boxer disqualified from sports for a lifetime due to an accident in the ring (director James Foley uses sequences of RAGING BULL-esquire to enrich back stories) and Rachel Ward, also little known, offers a great performance. But Bruce Dern is the film's secret weapon: his sweet uncle Bud communicator subtly commands each of his scenes. <br /> <br /> there is almost no comic relief in this film, so watch it prepared to be sucked into the void.
