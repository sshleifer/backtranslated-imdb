Otto Preminger's classic noir works almost like a downside of LAURA ... while that movie was gorgeous and characterizes the high-luting Clifton Webb, this film is much more seamier. Dana Andrews is a far from good cop who accidentally kills a man for potentially blocking him from the father of the girl he loves. Preminger keeps things moving with a lively clip so that errors in logic are easily overlooked. Andrews is pretty nice (much less in wood than he was in the past) and the beautiful Gene Tierney is incredibly beautiful! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unfortunate victim. WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDISCE is a must see and a formidable complement to the same noisy WHIRLPOOL of Preminger (also with Tierney).
