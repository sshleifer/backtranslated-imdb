This is the first release of the Guinea Pig series, and is one of the most infamous films in the collection. <br /> <br /> It took me a long time to finally get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of movies. I bought the set of Guinea Pig boxes and decided to look at the collection in order by release date. So I let this sucker in and sat down. <br /> <br /> From what I had read on the internet, and realizing the contents involved in this film, I expected to put my nerves to the test. This was not the case. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and start torturing her with the hope of discovering the human breaking point, and how long a human being can tolerate pain. <br /> <br /> Sounds like a sick shot right? Mistaken. The film fails to shock. This may be due to the fact that over the years I have become desensitized to my obsession with horror, but I think it is safe to say that any real black marion could easily sit down. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the individual who does not have a good knowledge of this type of film will probably be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen. Although it didn't shock me, the film contains rather mean and witty scenes of violence. Including the tearing of the nails, the intestines thrown to an unconscious woman and a needle through the eye. <br /> <br /> In general I think that for most of the gorehounds on this board you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for its novelty, but I suggest that for every newcomer to this type of film you should work up to this.
