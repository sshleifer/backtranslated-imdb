Now I really enjoyed this movie, it was a lot of fun. Both Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are brilliant actors, I think that after watching this movie they should do a lot more movies together in the future. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar gets himself into a bit of trouble when he meets 3 women at the same time, but the way he handles it when he walks out the door and then the other one was so fun to watch, he played very well in his film and I hope he makes a comedy more beautiful like this in the future, John Abraham plays his best friend, plays his role very well and is so undervalued that I'm glad some of his incredible works have been noticed but he's really a good actor. I love John, Neha Dhupia has a small role in this film and it sounds good. <br /> <br /> The muse is really good, I really recommend this movie to everyone.
