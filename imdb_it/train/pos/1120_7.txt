Not to be confused with the British black comedy with the same name that came out in 1994. But this Shallow Grave is an addition worthy of the slogans of the 80s. <br /> <br /> The plot goes = 4 sorority girls from one the convent is planning the spring break of a life in Florida, but the plans are suspended when one of them sees a man kill a local woman, and when he realizes that he has been seen, well let's say it becomes deadly cat and mouse game and things get even worse when he turns out to be the local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Shallow Grave, in my opinion, is one of the nicest slashers released in the 1980s, especially the late 1980s, or when loggers went downhill, this was one of the few that it didn't work and this film should be better known, it's a pity it isn't. this is a film that actually confuses stereotypes (just guess who will be the last girl - I was completely wrong). The main cast is nice and it is one of those films that you hope everyone can escape, which is obviously not the case. This, combined with the softness of the first half-hour jars of the film (in a good way) with some flashes of real wickedness (the second murder provides a real shock) and some unexpected sweetness (even if this is not a high I didn't expect the topless scene in which a woman is strangled with her bra (accompanied by a hysterical religious radio broadcast), in a late 80's movie. <br /> <br /> There are one or two bad things about this movie, well not bad just of secondary importance, like the secondary plot with the two teenage boys who are not going anywhere and the ending that was stupid and more the inability of the Deputy to follow the logic.There are no sharp instruments in GRAVE INCREDIBLE but, at least for me, it's an unbroken slasher. The scenes in which the girls are hunted through the woods by the evil sheriff are tense and exciting. <br /> <br /> All in all a very fun and useful slasher, with great performances of all four main girls and of that psychopath sheriff.
