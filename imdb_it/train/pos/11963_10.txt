"Scoop" is easily the most enjoyable Woody Allen movie of the 2000s so far. Allen, even though he is his age, is at the top of his game as the wizard of eyebrows Sidney Waterman. His one-liners and his behavior are hilarious. Don't let critics influence your opinion. "Scoop" is a first-class "Woody-Lite" image. <br /> <br /> The classic soundtrack is an excellent compliment to on-screen action. Scarlett Johanson looks beautiful in that swimsuit. Jackman is running. Cinematography shines. "Scoop" is a wonderful experience of escape from beginning to end. The last shot of the film is worth the admission price.
