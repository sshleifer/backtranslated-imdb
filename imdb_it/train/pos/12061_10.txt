Every now and then in the wonderful world of horror, diamonds are made and one is completely stunned by its sheer brilliance. This is no less than a diamond !! This is a film full of strangeness, chilling anticipation and dark atmosphere, and I think it's safe to say, one of my favorite horror movies of all time! And of course it contains probably the scariest, all-flat sequence in the whole horror story! Every time I see the movie, and get to the point where you know it will inevitably happen, I try to remember exactly when I'm scared of my wits, but it will never fail; I never understood correctly, and I find myself terrified like the first time I saw it !! Now, it must be said, to frighten a passionate fan of horror like that, which is nothing short of pure perfection. Unlike the Americans, the British know their subtleties, they are proud of the art of acting, they do not need any special effect to convey atmosphere, they rely on the power of powerful history and the creepiness (in this case) of suggestion and anticipation . Every single element is impeccable, from the sets, the acting, the story, the threatening atmosphere. Pauline Moran surely could make the devil cry, that's for sure !! As a final note, if for a demented reason you don't like this piece of madness, then you honestly don't know what the horror is, and honestly you don't even deserve to know. Thank you!
