I'm afraid it was a movie that you MUST REALLY LOOK to get something out. It's not a mindless movie like ..... "LEATHAL WEAPON PART 58" do you know what Riggs is really crazy about? it is not a film that is practically the same at the end since it is a beginning. you can run anywhere, talk on the phone, always do and enjoy yourself in every way. I have noticed in the past that most people who do not like this type of film are the type that will do almost everything except watch a movie and then slam it because they don't understand or understand or what happened. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LET YOUR DOGGY TAKE A SHOWER !!!
