I'll start by telling you about my first encounter with Prince's music. He was in a bar on my 39th birthday and a girl was dancing bare-chested for "1999" playing on the speakers. I asked people, who is this singer? I was told it was Prince. It was so beautiful that it distracted me from a beautiful topless dancer. Later I started listening to other Prince songs and really "digging" them. When Purple Rain came out, I still knew little about this Minnesotan. The film shocked me. I immediately became Prince n. 1 fan of the "War Baby" generation. Later I found out that one of my cousins ​​was his secretary, and she got me and my nephew in a V.I.P. Prince's concert where we sat next to his mother ... how nice! Returning to the topic in question, I agree with Siskel & Ebert who called Purple Rain an instant classic. I've seen it over 17 times and absolutely love it. I thought Prince's acting was good, Apollonia struggled a bit, but all in all the acting was fine. John Gielgud was not available to play "The Kid", so Prince took the role. The film is visually stunning, at a brisk pace (it never slows down) and terrifyingly directed. I rank it among the best musical films of all time. The last time I saw it was after about 7 years of gap and still delivered. I'm so proud of fellow Minnesotan Prince Rogers Nelson and I'd like to tell him personally. He walked right in front of me during the aforementioned concert and said, "Hi," to my nephew but not me. He was chatting with his mother. I was a little crushed but he is still number 1 with me.
