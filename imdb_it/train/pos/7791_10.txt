Another one of those movies that you hear about friends (... or read on IMDb). There are not many false notes in this. I could see pretty much everything that actually happened to a girl who fled from a dead city in Tennessee to Florida, with all her earthly possessions in an old battered car. <br /> <br /> The heroine, Ruby, makes false starts, but learns from them. I found myself wondering why, because she didn't lean over Mike's shoulder a little, but ... she has her reasons, apparently. <br /> <br /> Just a good movie. The only thing I don't really like, I think, is the title.
