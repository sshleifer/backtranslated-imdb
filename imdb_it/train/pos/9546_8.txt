Directed by the duo Yudai Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Jun'ichi Yamamoto "Meatball Machine" is apparently a remake of the 1999 Yamamoto film of the same name. I doubt I'll ever have the chance to see the original, so I'll just comment on this. First of all is "Meatball Machine"? A simple, real-time, pretentious low-budget industrial coup, full of makeup and gore effects. It's not something you'll end up writing books, but it's still fun if you dig this kind of cinema. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" follows the well-known plot. The boy loves the girl but is too afraid to ask for a date. The boy finally meets the girl. The girl is infected by an alien parasitic creature that turns her into a murderous cyborg. The boy, in turn, also turns into what he said, and continues a search to save his love. Will he? Who cares, as long as there is carnage and death I am satisfied. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, relatively clich√© but it does its job quite well, setting the film straight in a bloody clash between the two main characters. There is a subplot that focuses on how the parasite that infected the girl entered their lives. And yes, too fortunately it shows more violence. I'm happy. Acting is what you would expect from a film without a budget. It's not exactly painful to the ears, but it's not exactly good. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of the film besides the violence and the blood (as I have not already said enough) are the drawings of the cyborgs. Made by Keita Amemiya, whose work is creating extravagant creatures and costumes for both movies and video games is well known. The necroborgs as they are called in "Meatball Machine" seem incredibly detailed. Without the use of CGI, Amemiya's drawings are a breathtaking blend of flesh and metal, painfully impressive in their appearance. Able to transform various parts of the body into fresh weapons such as saws, rocket launchers, blood pump shotguns and so on and so forth. Although you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film, the necroborgs are of the A-movie class. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" is "Tetsuo The Iron Man" mixed with "Alien" all done with low budget and extra ketchup mode. It is an immensely funny film that does not take into account modern special effects and shows that the splatter genre is still alive and well.
