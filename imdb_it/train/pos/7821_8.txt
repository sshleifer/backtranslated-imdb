Very rarely Denzil Washington makes a bad film and comes to think of it for Kevin Kline and in this case, this must be considered one of their best films. It is more about films about how strong friendship can be more of Steve Biko's story, even if we understand how the man was and to what extent the reporter and friend Donald Woods went to preserve the man's name and he let the world know that South Africa was a corrupt and rotten society. The Direction is exceptional by David Attenborough as it was for Gandhi, although if there is any criticism to be made it could be at the end of the film. Two and a half hours is a long time to go through a historical film. What is incredible is how he manages to control all the extras. Thousands of people in both films. This movie really opens your eyes to what happened before Aparthiet's breakup and you can't miss it. 8 out of 10.
