Excellent documentation. Personally, I remember this growing up in New York in the early 1980s. This film is for everyone who wasn't around during that time. This shows the only thing the African-American Gay Underclass felt was just theirs and the love and camara you see are real. People are real and unfortunately few are still alive as this has been written. The balls are still held, but not to the extent that they were in the nineteen eighties. That time is gone forever. This is a good pre homo thug movie. When the queens were really proud of being extroverted. Goodbye to Storyville this is another past but it has documented the hail film a lot!
