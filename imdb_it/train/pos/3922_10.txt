Carmen is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's hard to say which is the best performance: Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are superb. Their souls dance. It is a beautiful story of the inseparability of life and myth; the myth penetrates into everyday life. Dance becomes life and all life is danced. Real people at the same time live their lives and become somebody else, play the parts of lovers of the past. The magic is continuing.
