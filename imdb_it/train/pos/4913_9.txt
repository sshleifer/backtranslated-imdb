The title somehow enhances the content of this film, which could lead to unrealized expectations. Frankly, there is very little "panic in the streets" to see here. In fact, very few people in the film know that there is a killer in the wild who could spread the scourge to everyone and anyone he meets. That being said, what we have here is a very well done story with a level of suspense that starts reasonably high (because, unlike people "in the streets", the viewer knows what's going on) and that director Elia Kazan builds very deliberately . While looking for the plague-infected murderer, one of the most interesting barriers I found was the developing relationship between Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and Captain Warren (Paul Douglas). At first, they don't really love each other, even if they have to work together. In the end, they forged a true bond of mutual respect. Kazan did a good job with that. <br /> <br /> Practically all the performances here were excellent. Widmark and Douglas were fantastic, and I was caught by a very initial look at Jack Palance who played what would become his typical "heavy" role. I found very little to criticize here. Perhaps Barbara Bel Geddes saw herself as flat as Reed's wife, Nancy, but her role was not really central to the story. All in all, an excellent job. 9/10
