Rank this the best of Zorro's chapters. The exciting soundtrack adds a punch to an exciting script. There is an excellent support and mystery cast that will make you guess until the last chapter. Reed Hadley does a great job as Don Diego and his alter ego Zorro.Last, but certainly not least, is the great director of Whitney and English.
