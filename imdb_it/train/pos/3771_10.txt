1991 saw the release of the two best sequels of all time: TERMINATOR 2: NEWSPAPER and BILL & TED BOGUS JOURNEY. Between the two, I always liked BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY a little better. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is the best, but there's nothing like Bill and Ted. Besides Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY, it's hard to think of a bigger comic duo than Bill and Ted. They are unique in their kind. <br /> <br /> Apparently influenced by the National Lampoon's O.C. and Stiggs, Bill and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo while performing in a local theater at L.A. in the 80s. The two immediately started writing a script on two and before the BILL & TED EXCELLENT ADVENTURE was born. The film, shot in 1987 and published in 1989, has become a great box office hit and an instant cult classic. It was not long before work on the sequel began. Stephen Herek, the director of "EXCELLENT ADVENTURE" was not enthusiastic about working on the sequel since he considered it too petty and different from the first, so Peter Hewitt, who made his film debut, was taken to direct the film. following. There couldn't be a better director for the job. THE BOGUS JOURNEY DI BILL & TED is admirably direct. It is full of its unique style and energy that cannot be matched. <br /> <br /> What makes "BOGUS JOURNEY" one of the best sequels ever is that while it's darker than the original, it's just fun. It doesn't change characters like most sequels do. Bill and Ted are the same adorable characters that were in the first movie. This is because it was written by the original writers. Most of the sequels are not written by the authors of the first one, but since "BOGUS JOURNEY" had the same writers, it ended up being just as good as "EXCELLENT ADVENTURE" if not even better. Just like the first one, 'BOGUS JOURNEY' is absolutely fun, well written, fun and, above all, original. It is full of spectacular special effects and fantastic comedy shows by Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves and William Sadler. It is an unforgettable "journey". 10/10
