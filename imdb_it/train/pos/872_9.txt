Carla works for a developer of real estate where she excels at being unattractive, un-appreciated and desperate. She is also deaf. <br /> <br /> His boss offers to hire someone to ease his heavy workload, so he uses the opportunity to secure a male company. The help comes in the form of Paul, a tattooed hooligan who has just been released from prison and clearly unfit for an office routine. <br /> <br /> An implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and Carla is determined to keep it turned on despite her reluctance to embrace the work week. When Carla came out of an important contract she was negotiating with a slippery colleague, she uses Paul's crime to get the contract back. The colleague immediately realizes that she is behind the robbery, but when he confronts her, Paul's willingness to hit people in the face is useful - but this hooligan has a price. <br /> <br /> Paul is given a "pass" by some family acquaintances to remember an unpaid debt. He formulates a plan that uses the extraordinary reading abilities of Carla's lips to snatch a band of violent bank robbers. It is now Carla's turn to enter a new, frightening world. <br /> <br /> The fourth feature film by director Jacques Audiard, "READ MY LIPS" begins as a romantic, addictive drama between two marginalized losers just to move the gears halfway to an angular thriller in which their symbiotic deficiencies turn them into winners. The cables are excellent; convincing us effortlessly that this strange couple could really connect. Carla's first encounter with Paul is a pleasant farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate her reticence and her gallant ways to discover that she was, until recently, a jailbird. Emmanuelle Devos, who plays Carla, has that almost exclusive ability to go from sloppy to gorgeous and vice versa within a frame. Vincent Cassel plays Paul as a dog with his back to the wall who looks really comfortable when he is receiving a beating or is inventing the rip-off that threatens to have him killed. <br /> <br /> Like many French films, "READ MY LIPS" seems, in the beginning, to be nothing in particular until it is scratched under the surface and it turns out that it is probably on everything. "the only note to cheat is a subplot concerning the missing wife of the officer for freedom of Paul; a device that seems contrived only to help guide the main thrust of the story into a very nice dead end. <br /> <br / > It was the French "New Wave" of the 60s that introduced the concept of "genre" for the first time for the making of films and I always thought that any support is in some way compromised when it is necessary to use a system of labels to help define it, so it's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend the genre, or better yet, challenge it.
