Brutal, emotionless Michael Myers stabbed his sister to death at the age of six on Halloween night in 1963; on October 30, 1978, he escaped from a mental institution and established a new reign of terror in his hometown, Haddonfield, Illinois. He is pursued all the time by a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence) who knows how bad this young man is. <br /> <br /> It opens with a bang, and creates a genuinely suspenseful cooler that is actually superior to the many slasher images it has helped inspire. It is thin compared to the ugly bloodbaths of many of those subsequent films; thin and scary. It keeps the ability to make me jump even after repeated views. How many films are there, really, that can continue to be scary even after having seen them before? Not much. <br /> <br /> The pleasure is great in what was probably the definitive role of his career; Jamie Lee Curtis, in her feature film debut, has become a veritable scream queen after starring in "Halloween" and some later slasher photos, and is a deliberate victim worth cheering for. <br /> <br /> With the director and screenwriter John Carpenter knows what works in this film, making excellent use of shadows and dark skies; note how much of the film is set after dark. With this image, he and his former collaborator Debra Hill created a franchise that generated seven sequels, many imitators and an imminent "re-imagination". <br /> <br /> It's very interesting - who could ever forget Dr. Loomis's speech (Pleasence) in which he describes Michael Myers to the sheriff (Charles Cyphers, a reliable repertoire player in many of Carpenter's previous works) ? <br /> <br /> It's fantastic and worth finding. This is my favorite John Carpenter film of all time. <br /> <br /> It is not entirely infallible - there are holes in the scripts, after all - but overall it has a strong impact. <br /> <br /> 9/10
