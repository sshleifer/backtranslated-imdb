I was going to give him an 8, but since people got 6.5 better grades, I had to make my contribution. The Styx river was pure genius. Of course, Woody was his perennial stuff, but at least his role was appropriate. The first half hour was really fun, and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch. The dialogue was smart enough, and Woody's tricks at parties, along with the reaction of the upper crust, were fun to watch. This was much better than the newspaper's critics made it seem. And a plus, a little Sorcerer's Apprentice to get along. And, of course, did you notice that Johansen is getting a bit grumpy? Charles Dance is always fun, as was Hugh Jackman.
