Weak, fast and multicolored, this is Valvoline's film, in fact you can always see this brand of oil in many scenes. The real protagonist is the cars, the weak performances of Cage and Duvall. An interesting Angelina Jolie is an unlikely mechanic. For dream car lovers (LAMBORGHINI and FERRARI above all).
