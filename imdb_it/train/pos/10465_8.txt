Even at the beginning of his career, Capra was quite adept with his filming and timing. This is a subtle story - and quite predictable at times - but gets good performances from his cast and has some rather complicated moves that intimately involve the viewer. The first part looks like a Cinderella story, although anyone with a brain can see that the fund will fall from that - the rich "prince" will lose his fortune. <br /> <br /> However, due to its good cast and fast pace, it's easy to get caught up in the clich√©s. Then the film becomes more original, as the couple has to find a way to make a living. The finish is very predictable but satisfying. I also want to compliment the title: very witty and fun.
