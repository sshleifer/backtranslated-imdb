It may not be the best film of 2006 but it was just a movie to excite and think. The Sentinel is a good political thriller movie that looks similar or even borrows some elements from other political thriller films like In the Line of Fire and the Manchurian candidate. The basic plot of this film is similar to other films like this: A plot to kill the President of the United States. Michael Douglas plays the secret service agent Pete Garrison who leads the operation only to find out later that he was framed. Kiefer Sutherland co-stars as a sort of rival by the name of David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria as Jill Marin who is a debutante agent under the guidance of Agent Breckinridge and Oscar-winning winner Kim Basinger as First Lady Sarah Ballentine. An improvement for this film may have been more action, as some sources are considered an action film as much as a Thriller movie, but a positive thing about this film is instead of a murder plot to kill the president of the United States , but also concerns a mole (traitor) in the secret service that is leading the president in the wrong direction.
