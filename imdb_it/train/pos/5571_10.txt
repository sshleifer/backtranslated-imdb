After seeing "Whipped" at the screening of a distributor at the AFM the other night, I must say that I was deeply impressed. The audience was laughing all the way. Unfortunately, every territory had already been sold, so I didn't have the opportunity to buy the film, but I truly believe that it will be a great success both nationally and internationally. I agree with the comment that "Whipped" should not be interpreted as a "Sex and the City" male, mainly because unlike "Sex and the City", "Whipped" is a satire of events that never takes too much on serious. "Whipped" mocks relationships in a way that most sexual comedies wouldn't dare. Furthermore, the film I showed at the AFM had more plot and story than "Swingers", "Clerks" and "Sex and the City" put together. "Whipped" never slowed down for a shot and gave the audience a nonstop comedy. The performances of Amanda Peet and the rest of the cast were very solid, which made the film even more impressive considering the budget.
