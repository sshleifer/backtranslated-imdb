Thelma Ritter stole the image. I just finished watching it again. I could not avoid becoming emotional in his final scene. He did not receive the Oscar. That's why you shouldn't trust the Oscars too much. Richard Widmark never had a better part and it was a perfect casting like a 3-D human, defective. Jean Peters was fantastic as the robust and streetwise girl in her best role ever. And Richard Kiley must have been very good; because otherwise I would have hated him like that. Yes, it was heavy handed over to patriotism; but without it you don't have much of a movie. Look at their faces! The first three stars didn't really need much script. I'd like to have seen them make this film without dialogue. If you've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in "The Thief", maybe you know what I mean. When I was a kid in 1956 during my first trip to New York, I did my Uncle Bronx taking us to the foot of South Street looking for the no. 66. At that moment I realized that Hollywood could not be trusted. But I found the river. <br /> <br /> I am not giving away much of the story because I hate it when I know what happens before seeing it alone. If you have seen it, no clarification is necessary. Only perhaps, someone who is reading these comments has not seen "Pickup On South Street". You will like it; don't go looking for 66 South Street in New York City.
