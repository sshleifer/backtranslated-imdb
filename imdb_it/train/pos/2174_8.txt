I think I really love this movie. "Prix de Beaute" was originally a silent film, but later renamed in French in the 1930s. Despite the voice of someone else nicknamed on his, this remains an extraordinary tour de force for Louis Brooks. The fact that his singing voice is nicknamed by the legendary Edith Piaf helps to revive us purists on the dubbing deception. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Lulu and we see it for the first time in a resort with its macho boyfriend, Andre (Georges Charlia) and their friend Antonin (Augusto Bandini). Lulu enters the frame like a pair of legs: we see her inside the car that turns into her bathing suit. Lulu is very free with showing her body and this doesn't fit well with the iridescent Andre. When Lulu claims to be applying for the "Miss Europe" title, we know that a happy ending will not be held at the end of Easy Street. <br /> <br /> The film seems to focus a lot on the men who look at beautiful women. We see a lot of beauties in the bathroom and the reactions of the men who stare at them. But at the center of it all is the magnificent Louise Brooks. <br /> <br /> If you don't mind watching movies from past eras, consider trying it. Louise Brooks is not a name that most fans of average cinema can easily know, but as soon as you see it you will be hypnotized and would like to learn more. Also check it in "Pandora's Box" if you can find it. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the DVD version of Kino in the United States. I don't know if their projection speed is correct. Many scenes seem to be shown at too fast a speed. This may have been the way they were shot. I do not know. But since it's the only way to see this movie, it's worth swallowing that bitter pill.
