During the course of 1933 this film suffered many cuts because it was very exaggerated for the content of the story and the fact that Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) would have done everything to get great wealth and power. Lily's father had forced his daughter to prostitute herself at the age of 14 and she had grown up in a steel mill in a city with very poor people and her father ran a speakeasy who brought all kinds of male characters into the house who had the eyes on Lily. As the story progresses, Lily meets one man after another and eventually finds a boy who has everything and is a president of the games bank. It's nice to see a very young John Wayne, (Jimmy McCoy Jr.) who was only 25 when this photo was produced and Jimmy didn't even get to first base with Lily, not even for lunch. A very young George Brent, (Coutland Trenholm) starred with Barbara Stanwyck and both gave exceptional performances. This is a great 1933 film produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and has been held guilty for many years and recently screened on the big screen. This film is rather mild compared to what we see today on Hollywood screens, but in 1933 it was very bad to watch this type of film. To enjoy
