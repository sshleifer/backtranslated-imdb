SPOILERS THROUGH: <br /> <br /> I'm really in the minority on this, but I liked this movie. It is not a classic but it is definitely addictive and rather an adrenaline rush. I definitely thought it was worth at least a 7. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the reason I liked it is because I didn't see the original. Something tells me that with a film like this is the strongest fan will be people who have not seen the original version and, therefore, have little to compare to. This was not a masterpiece, but I worked hard on it and actually made me want to see the original. <br /> <br /> There were some things I liked. One was the casting of Kowalkski. Viggo Mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma into the role. Since most of the film fell on his shoulders, he really needed to be excellent and he was. This was an important role for him. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point is the fact that it is made for television. I had no idea this was the case when I looked at him. It certainly looked like an important film and I never imagined it wasn't a big screen. <br /> <br /> I also found the story very engaging. I'm not one for action movies, but I got sucked into it. Also it was much more than an action movie as there was drama, mysticism, a love story, eccentric people in every way you filmed. (I didn't even recognize Priestly.) And touched. This was not a great movie but it is watchable. <br /> <br /> And then there's the ending. It has a strong impact and if one has been involved in the story up to that point, it is very difficult not to be paralyzed at the end. I'm not sure what I feel for the finale. The implication was that Kowalkski had survived and although I am very skeptical about HOW that would be possible, it is a film and realism is not an ingredient that is always in the mix when making a film. <br /> <br /> So I must say that I found the end incredibly unreal but very touching in a manipulative way, which I usually don't like, but for some reason, it's almost forgivable in this movie. Of course, a lot of things were just plot props (could the bad ones have been more stereotyped?) But the producers had a lot of right even though they did a lot of wrong things. However, having said that, I have to admit that I can understand why someone who is a big fan of the original hates this version because, even though I didn't see the original, I saw many original films that I loved being redone with terrible results. (My great antipathy is actually sequel.) But I can understand the low grades if the original is of such a high quality. <br /> <br /> People have compared him to Smoky and the Bandit. How about a version of "Legends Of The Fall" that also meets "Thelma and Louese"? I'm sure I've touched both films (both of which I'm a fan). However, I don't think it was a great movie. It was better than average for me, but far from exceptional. But it was an engaging, adrenaline and touching film, with an excellent casting of the main character. My vote is 7 out of 10.
