Hi guys, I've been looking for every where to find these two films and I can't find them anywhere in my area. (I am Australian). You could help me and tell me where I can buy it. In General Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best films I've ever seen and are suitable for people of all ages. It was my favorite movie when I was 5 and it still is now when I'm a teenager. It's a great film for the whole family. My whole family loves this movie except for my younger sister, because I've seen it many times that she's tired of it. I love this movie and I can't wait to buy it again on DVD. <br /> <br /> Sally
