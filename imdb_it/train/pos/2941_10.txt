This is the last one-man show in which Eddie Murphy is at his best. Just forget the crazy professor and the illustrious gentlemen, this is the real Eddie Murphy. His imitations of Mr. T. (pretending to be gay), Michael Jackson and other artists are murderers. I think it's also pretty bold to make fun of artists who were very popular at the time. My favorite act is one in which he is at his annual family barbeque and plays the drunken father and Aunt Bunny who falls down the stairs. <br /> <br /> This show is the best medicine when you feel down! If you watch the sequel 'Raw' don't be disappointed. It is good enough but does not correspond to "Delirante".
