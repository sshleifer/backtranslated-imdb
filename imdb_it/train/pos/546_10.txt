I thought it was one of the best sequels I've seen in a while. Sometimes I felt like I just wanted someone to die, Stanley's killing of boring characters was brilliant. It was such a beautiful film that you were happy when it died like this. My only problem was that in some scenes it seemed that someone with a home video camera was filming and it was strange. Judd Nelson is nice, at least in my opinion, and he was excellent in the role of Stanley Caldwell. Brilliant film.
