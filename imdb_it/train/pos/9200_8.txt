I have read countless posts about this game that is so similar to Max Payne, when I played it the first time I thought it was a somewhat strange arcade game with the desire to rip Max Payne's style (not just a bullet - time). So when I played it for a couple of hours I realized how much fun it is! and how different from "Max Payne", yes, bullet time is a bit similar but I think it adapts differently to the style of play. This game is a non-stop game - a mix between a shoot'em up and a fight'em up, very funny, like a big Max Payne fan I have to say that the DTR plot is not close to the greatness of Max Payne, the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same, but if you want a little more of that "bullet time" you should absolutely own this game.
