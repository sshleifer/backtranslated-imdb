A surprisingly effective thriller, this. <br /> <br /> David Duchovny and Michelle "Ensign Ro" Forbes are a successful couple, a writer, a photographer. Forbes desperately wants to move to California and, in a compromise, Mulder accepts the move on the condition that, along the way, they visit sites of historical interest regarding famous serial killers. His idea: he writes the words, takes the photos, with the end result a bestseller table book that will set them for life. To help finance the trip, they decide to share the car and publicize the fact. Unfortunately, he would like Brad Pitt to see the commercial, and shortly after he killed his landlord, he and his girlfriend, Juliette Lewis, met the writer couple and began their cross country trip. Inevitably, trouble arises. <br /> <br /> Pitt is outstanding as the genuinely cold inspirer of Early Grayce and is ably supported by Lewis who plays his usual white basket character that appears to be his default set. Also Duchovny and Forbes do a convincing double act and, while the events are out of control, you while the spectator is sucked into their situation and you can feel the tension with laughter. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, sinister and well turned, this deserves recognition beyond its current state. A top movie.
