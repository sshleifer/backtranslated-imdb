I was watching this movie in one of my usual times, which is real until late at night. Usually if a film doesn't interest me, I start falling asleep and have to raid the fridge to stay awake. At first I thought it was what I had to do since the rhythm of the film started slowly, along with the fact that his shots tended to linger with the character for a long time. But after a while, I begin to get more into the film, as it reveals itself more about the main character through his story. In the end, you feel you've known him for life. The film kept my interest so much that I didn't even know the sun was about to rise. <br /> <br /> Not much of Lynch's bizarre style, but there are enough eccentric characters to make the movie fun.
