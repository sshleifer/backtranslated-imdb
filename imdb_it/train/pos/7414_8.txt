This was a very funny movie. A humorous but moving look at the family and the obligations that derive from it. The story of a man who returns home from his life in the city to his father's thermal baths in a small Chinese village. There he learns to appreciate, to love even the things he left at home to escape. The film is as visually beautiful as it is emotionally beautiful.
