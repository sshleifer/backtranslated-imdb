MAJOR DAMAGERS !! THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN THE FILM !! <br /> <br /> Commentators touched on the main theme of "honor" in the film, and too many comparisons with "Braveheart". I will point out some things about this film that I have not seen touch other comments: <br /> <br /> This film has a decidedly different take on abortion. The first character to get pregnant is the girl of the villain (Roth), and when she coldly suggests an abortion, she says it's too late for that. The shame of her situation ("I must have the bastard bastard") leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene. The second character to find herself pregnant is Mary, Rob's wife, after being raped by the character of Roth (and at least one sex scene with her husband, Rob). Towards the end of the film, while Rob is leaving for a final confrontation with Roth, Mary asks what she should do about the pregnancy of questionable origins, with a tone that suggests abortion. Rob responds in a noble tone, "it's not the child's fault", and then he states what he thinks the name should be, girl or boy. I find that this "pro-life" position by the hero is very non-Hollywood. Rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright exterior to make this comment - not a random symbolism. <br /> <br /> Another related theme is that the character of Roth is a bastard, someone who obviously does not know who his father was and has few kind words for his mother, even if he wears a picture of him in a hanging case to the neck. It is a coincidence that Roth (without family stability) is the walking definition of psychopath, while Rob is the strong husband / father figure, and of course the hero. In the last gunfight between Rob and the villain (Roth), the first one cuts the latter on the chest - the left side of the chest, above the heart. His employer and the pseudo-father figure (John Hurt's character) holds the photo of his mother in his hand and looks at it, before tearing it from the Roth's neck. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, what I find interesting was the direction of the rape scene, which was not graphic enough but was not off-camera and implicit. I found it surprising in its representation in some way, with Mary convincingly showing the characteristics of someone going through the ordeal and the subsequent post traumatic stress (as we call it now). My point is that rape has been neither sensationalized nor simply implicit, and I find an interesting intermediate road for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In the final scene of the fight, I have to correct a previous commentator: The Roth weapon chosen was a small sword (or maybe a short sword), the weapon chosen by Rob was a Claymore. Someone was really doing the homework on this scene. Roth would have the advantage in such a situation, but of course Claymore is a decidedly Scottish weapon. What is even more surprising to me (as a fencer and someone who has read a little on the subject) is that this final battle with the sword is one of the most convincing of all the films ever made: the actors seem to actually try to kill each other. - not the usual blade cuts of the opponents we see in most movie fights (including the fight for opening films). Even more faithful to the story, Roth is seen several times that he uses the rapier as a pushing weapon, which is a design purpose! (The pliers were sharp, but mostly a weapon that pushed with the edges used primarily to ward off an opposing push.) Rob uses the Claymore in wide bars, as is the design intent. The fight goes down as I would expect that - Roth effectively wins. Although Rob wins the day by grabbing Roth's weapon (more symbolism) and hitting him to death with a powerful cut-off. <br /> <br /> Folks, it is RARE to see this level of historical precision in a sword fight of the film. br /> <br /> I will also note that, for some reason, I remember 1995 (the year of publication) distinctly as a period of distrust of the US government. Obviously Hollywood was tuned to this, with the release of "Rob Roy" and "Braveheart", and I think that anti-government inclinations are the reason why both films get so much comparisons. <br /> <br /> I think the different perspective that this film offers is refreshing for movie fans, tired of the same old messages, not so hidden, from Hollywood.
