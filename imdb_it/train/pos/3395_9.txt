This is a brilliant science fiction film that is very strange in the way men and women look at the same film. I talked to many people about the movie and almost every guy loved it and said it was great - while most women thought it was simply disgusting and stupid! This is the only film I know that has such a polarized view based on gender. Perhaps many women have only a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plots - but whatever the cause, I have always found this difference fascinating. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation led by Charlton Heston. This is set in the near future and the head of the huge international company Soylent Corporation has been murdered. As the film develops, you soon realize that this is a terrible and highly unjust future American society. The rich live in beautiful apartments with security and all the pleasures that money can buy (including "furniture" - a euphemism for paid ladies who come together with the apartment). At the same time, the masses are poor in dirt, unemployed and in many cases live in abandoned cars or apartment corridors. Overpopulation and smog have taken a serious toll and the future looks really terrible! <br /> <br /> Because the rich man died and the horrible truth he couldn't live with I shouldn't have argued - it could ruin the film for you. However, the film has great plot and acting and is super exciting to watch. In addition, he presents Edward G. Robinson in his last performance on the big screen as Heston's crisp assistant. Although not for the simple depressed or finicky, this is a great science fiction film that is allegorical and profound.
