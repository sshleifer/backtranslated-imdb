I could never remember the name of this show. I looked at him when I was 8 years old. I remember getting up late when I didn't have to just watch this show. It was the best show for me. From what I remember, it's still fantastic. This saw the protagonist Lucas Black who made him the first boy he ever had a crush on. I come from the country, so I don't like boys with an accent, but I would definitely make an exception for him. That after seeing Crazy in Alabama, Friday Night Lights and Tokyo Drift you should understand why. He is a great actor and has been since he was a child. I miss this show and I want it to come back. If anyone ever sees where they are selling the season, write to me. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
