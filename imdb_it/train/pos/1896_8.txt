Arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons. A good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help out with the horses during the stables scene has just died. If you look quickly you can see Frank Graham during the restaurant scene in the background while Dudley Moore and Jill Eikenberry are in conversation. Frank was an equestrian champion and will be missed by everyone who knows him. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I actually knew a true Arthur Bach life. He wasn't as rich as Arthur, but he spent 47 years of his life basically as a child. His parents strictly controlled his purse strings, but his rent and utilities were paid in a basement apartment in Greenwich Village. He spent much of his time getting drunk on various spirits and getting himself a public show, just like Dudley Moore does. <br /> <br /> Astonishment with Arthur is why someone is uncomfortable with the richness of no. But this is the other half of the equation. My friend was a very charming person when you knew him. In fact it was almost an obligation to be fascinating. He couldn't buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the seller. He spent his life being a perfect party guest. The term wastrel which was commonly used in the nineteenth century would apply to him. <br /> <br /> And this is what Dudley Moore is, a wastrel. Unlike my friend Moore, John Gielgud cleaned it up. This is a full-time job, as we see at Arthur. My friend also never found a Liza Minnelli, a male Liza Minnelli because he was gay. Still Moore's portrait of Arthur Bach is deadly accurate and so real to me. Arthur, in his twenties of the twentieth century, is forced to marry another trust fund to Jill Eikenberry. Since he won't work to live, the threat of being cut is real enough for him. He has only his butler Hobson played by John Gielgud and the driver Bitterman played by Ted Post to send his problems. We should have all these problems. <br /> <br /> John Gielgud in his almost century of life has certainly done a better job than Arthur in film and in fact Gielgud is best known for his theatrical performances. Yet 1981 was a year of feeling at the time of the Oscars. The Academy gave Henry Golden and Katharine Hepburn Oscars for On Golden Pond and Gielgud the best supporting actor for a lifetime's work. That man was incredible, still at his job almost to the end. <br /> <br /> So to Frank Graham who worked on the film and to Jackie Weiss, a real real life Arthur, I dedicate this review.
