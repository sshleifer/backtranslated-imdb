I had the privilege of seeing this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> 'Xizhao' or 'Shower' is a $ 200,000 low budget film about a father and his two children. The father has a traditional bathhouse somewhere in a traditional Chinese village where local men, mostly elderly, come to relax and swim. The father has children: a "retarded" son who lives with him and a son who lives in a large modern city and comes to visit him. For this son, the traditional village, the bathing establishment and his "retarded" brother seem strange and annoying, but this changes along the film. <br /> <br /> Although the story may seem trivial or clich√©, it is not. With really great performances, especially of the father and the "retarded" son (sorry, I don't know their names) and a good story that the film was moving and fun at the same time. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to watch this movie do it. It's a great alternative to Hollywood cinema. <br /> <br />
