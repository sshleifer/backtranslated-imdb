I always knew that Anne DeSalvo was a great actor, now I know that she is also a great writer / director. I've been a fan since I saw her in the movies "Perfect", "My Favorite Year", "DC Cab" and "Stardust Memories". <br /> <br /> It is so rare to see Lee Grant these days in anything. He has disappeared from the screen for too long. It's also wonderful to see Cloris Leachman in something other than a sitcom. This is his best work from "The Last Picture Show". If you grew up in an Italian American family, you'll love this movie. I didn't expect much when I started watching this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this movie. If you have the chance, look at it.
