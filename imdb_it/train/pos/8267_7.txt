Brown of Harvard is a difficult film to define. We expect a lot more from our films these days, so it is useful to remember that the public in the 1920s was a little more innocent. William Haines is as charming as the thief who must stumble in pain and humiliation to find success and even glory. All the reports in the film seem very sad, EXCEPT the homoerotic bond between Billy and Jack Pickford, the city nerd. The film has everything, romance, tears, love, death and even sport ... It's a great education about how society changed in the 20th century.
