While a pretty pleasant musical, what struck me about this film was the unexpected comedy between Basil Rathbone, as the composer, and Oscar Levant as his assistant. The character of Rathbone seems unable to find his way out of bed without help, interpreting a very detached and distracted artistic type (far from his more familiar roles such as the threatening villains or the coldly logical Sherlock Holmes). And that help is Starbuck, played with his usual Oscar Levant humor. Taking the character of Crosby in the role of his ghost songwriter, Rathbone introduces him to Starbuck saying, "He does all my thinking for me." Obviously this goes further (or above) to Rathbone, who is too busy worrying about where his next song will come from. As another reviewer said, who knew Rathbone could be so funny! Too bad he no longer had the opportunity to show his comic talent.
