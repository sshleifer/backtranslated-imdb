I saw this film for the first time over 25 years ago on British TV and I just caught it last week on a copy of DVD bought on ebay. I had remembered the musical sequences, the color and the beautiful poses and clothes of fashion, but the plot is weaker than in the previous Anna Neagle / Michael Wilding Spring movie in Park Lane and Maytime does not hold up so well over the years. But Michael Wilding is a joy in the film, charming, funny, casual, he seems to be having fun and on top of his form. It is worth seeing it alone. Anna Neagle looks a bit matronly next to him, and a little too old for the role she plays, but by the late 1940s their cinematographic collaboration was well established and the cinema became public. Spring in Park Lane was a hit in 1947 and a big money maker. In his autobiography, Wilding has long written about his great regard for Herbert Wilcox, the director and instigator of this series of London films.
