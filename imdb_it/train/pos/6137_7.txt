What a great jewel this is. It's an unusual story that's fun to watch. Yes, he sang, but it is very well done in history and is very melodic to listen to. It was so pleasant to look at; I loved it from start to finish! <br /> <br /> The film takes place in England during the Second World War. It is an apprentice witch who is looking for a missing portion of a spell she needs. Use his rough "magic" to transport you and 3 children under his care to various destinations to find it. They are joined by his correspondence teacher, who is surprised to learn that his school's lessons really work! <br /> <br /> Although the special effects may seem a little dated at the beginning, once you get used to them they become part of the charm of this movie. In fact, the film won an Oscar for these effects! <br /> <br /> The film is innocent and fun - and it's hard not to love melodic songs. The characters are wonderfully interesting to watch. I think anyone at any age can find something like this movie.
