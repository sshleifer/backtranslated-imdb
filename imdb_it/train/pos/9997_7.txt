Life Stinks (1991) was a step below other Mel Brooks productions. The protagonist of a rich man who undertakes a crazy bet with his "friends". Brooks claims he can live like a homeless person for a month. His friends shocked and amused accept this unusual bet. During his "stay" in Bowery, he meets a group of homeless, one of whom captures his fantasy (Lesley-Ann Warren). They face a friendship as she teaches him the many tricks he learned while living on the street. Can Mr. Brooks survive on his own without the luxury of being rich crappy? Will this unorthodox bet win? Who are his real friends? Find out when you look at LIFE STINKS to find out! <br /> <br /> This movie has been unfairly dumped. Of course it's not a classic like his previous films, but it's still fun. I liked the way Mel Brooks pays tribute to Charles Chaplin in this film. If you've seen Chaplin's previous silent films, then you'll also get humor. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Mel Brooks fans.
