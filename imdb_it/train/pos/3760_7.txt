It may not have been for the Academy awards and, let's face it, it's pretty bad, but it's so much fun! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. Amiable, optimistic and exhilarating, Bill and Ted are a great way to relax. <br /> <br /> Although I adore Excellent Adventure, Bogus Journey is more fun for me. Death is hilarious and Bill and Ted are even more appealing. People hurt me for loving this movie, but only really pretentious viewers will say that it's not even a little fun. If you like it, you will probably also be a fan of Wayne's World, Dude Where's My Car and Dumb and Dumber. Admit it, even if it's silly, they make you smile and make you tickle the tickle box. So just watch them for kicks and laughs !!
