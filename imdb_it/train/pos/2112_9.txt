In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (as Klara Novak) gets a job as a shop assistant in a gift shop; there, she bickers with colleague James Stewart (like Alfred Kralik). The two don't get along at work because everyone has fallen in love with an unseen pen friend. Watching Ernst Lubitsch directing these stars through the inevitable is predictably satisfying. <br /> <br /> Even better is a secondary plot involving shop owner Frank Morgan (like Hugo Matuschek), who suspects his wife is having an affair. Hiring a private investigator, Mr. Morgan confirms that his 22-year-old wife has sex with one of his younger employees. Morgan, painfully realizing, "He didn't want to grow old with me", and the supporting characters are what keep the film from aging. <br /> <br /> ********* The Shop Around the Corner (1/12/40) Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut
