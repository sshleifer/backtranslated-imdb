I saw the trailer on the DVD after watching the movie, and I think anyone who saw it before watching the movie would be very surprised and probably disappointed. It made a lot of the fact that the film was "from the director of Cube" and made it look like a horror movie, when in reality it is an absurd comedy (the spell checker on IMDB doesn't seem to think that Absurdist is a word but it is), recalls Rosencrantz and Guildernstern have died. <br /> <br /> I like the way the story develops slowly at first, then gradually intensifies. I also like the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film. This and the fact that the story takes place mainly in one set are the only aspects in which this film is similar to Cube. I advise.
