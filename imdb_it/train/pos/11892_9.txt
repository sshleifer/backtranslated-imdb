Pialat films people in extreme situations, usually with violent scenes. In La Gueule ouverte, it has to do with the devastating effects on a woman's husband and son while he dies of cancer. In A nos amours, the girl's sexual experimentation leads to violent confrontations with her family. Here we have a rather spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to take a sexy ex-convict. His motivation is a bit murky, since Loulou is unable to read or discuss anything more challenging than TV shows; on the other hand, he has a fabulous body (I wonder why Depardieu never made a sports film to show that physique - he would have been fantastic as a rugby player). <br /> <br /> The casting is impressive. Isabelle Huppert is not authorized to give an insignificant and inexpressive performance (she has given many); Depardieu plays Loulou with all the dynamism and charm one could wish for: seeing the scene in the bar, where he is stabbed in the intestine, runs away and seeks treatment, then soon resumes with Nelly. Guy Marchand, with those coal-black eyes and anguished eyes, interprets Nelly's husband in a splendid manner; it's a nice repetition of the combination in Coup de foudre.
