George Lopez has never attracted my interest in his comedy standing and still does not. But this show is a work of art. It is never shown where jokes make you laugh every time you remember it (and jokes that it is really memorable). This show looks optimistic and the characters range from an old, short drunk to a dyslexic teenager. I don't know who writes this show but that person does a great job. If they had just continued the show I'm sure they would get a positive response from the critics of this great country. If you are looking for a good traditional comedy, George Lopez is the show for you! The only negative thing is the title. George Lopez? Really? Imagine that the new Prince of Bel-Air is "Will Smith". Come on friend! But for the rest, this show is brilliant! 10/10
