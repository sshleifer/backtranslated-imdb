Bunny Comes Home 'This Man's Navy' deserves more credit than it gets, a skilled script by Borden Chase, directed by 'Wild Bill' Wellman, the film has the right feeling for the euphoria and goodwill of the WW11 WW1 and none of the blind terror that came into play a few years later. Produced in 1944, the defeated Japanese, the somewhat déjà vu battle scenes, Tom Drake's melancholy attraction for the radiant young Jan Clayton has a solid chemistry, authentically recites and validates Drake's career at Metro. The following year Jan opened on Broadway in "Carousel". Wally Beery, a little bummed, does he brag about an unbelieving Jimmy Gleason ?? his memories improve reality and give Beery a shadow similar to Ulysses to play with. Shots of the Navy LTA (Lighter Than Air) are authentic, photographed in Tustin and Lakehurst, and the P-38 squadron is out of AFB in March. Lot 3 has doubled for India and the U-turn of Bunny ?? Bunny arrives home ?? returns to Beery a real slice of his past, something he wanted to believe was true ?? so, is the future in which we turn again great? now on a larger scale, a newly developed Navy LTA with launch capability for a reconnaissance aircraft ?? How much is it, blissfully optimistic ?? still: "You have to believe it, that's how you make things come true?"
