Gurinda Chada's semi-autobiographical film (2002) is a gentle and moving comedy set in the ethnically diverse community near Heahthrow airport in west London. <br /> <br /> Like the airliners that arrive and depart constantly from above, we follow the ups and downs of the two main characters, Jess Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley), who insinuate a unlikely friendship centered on mutual passion for football and their technical infatuation with David Beckham. <br /> <br /> Much of the play comes from the misunderstandings of the families of these two talented girls who break all the expectations and conventions of their very different family backgrounds. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in between, as a mediator, peacemaker and degraded athlete, Joe (Jonathan Reece-Myers) - team coach for the Harrier Hounslow - intervenes in times of crisis, while remaining the object main affection of both main characters. <br /> <br /> In the end, and not without many obstacles and triumphs on the road, we finally see our passionate and beloved soccer heroines flying off to realize their dreams. <br /> <br /> With great performances by Bollywood veteran Anupam Kher (Mr Bhamra), Shaheen Khan (Mrs Bhamra), Juliet Stevenson (Mrs Paxton) and Frank Harper (Paxton) this is really a movie that captures the urgent passion of adolescence and crosses all ethnic borders. <br /> <br /> Pinky Bamrha (Archie Panjabi) and (Taz) Trey Farley are fighting for their struggles, but still they contribute greatly to our understanding of the main characters in the film. <br /> <br /> In its special way, this film tells an important story that is incidental to football. We celebrate the evolution in the understanding of ordinary people in ordinary families and the innate ability of young people to teach old people.
