A trio of friends, all sergeants of the British army, move and fight through imperial India. Intensely loyal to each other, they face their greatest and deadliest challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a horrible cult and its demented and implacable guru. Now they have to rely on the regiment's lowest servant, the GUNGA DIN water carrier, to save the Queen's soldiers' scores from a certain massacre. <br /> <br /> Based more on the Three Musketeers than Kipling's classic poem, this is a wonderful epic adventure - a worthy entry into the 1939 Hollywood Golden Year. Full of suspense and humor, while keeping the romantic interludes to the bare minimum, he grabs the viewer's interest and holds it until the (sentimental) conclusion. <br /> <br /> It is practically useless to discuss the nuances of the three-star performances, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., as they are really all third parties in a single body - inseparable and, in effect purposes, indistinguishable. However, this does not diminish anything of the great fun simply by watching them have a glorious time. <br /> <br /> (It is interesting to note, by the way, that McLaglen boasted a distinguished military career from World War I: Fairbanks would have had a World War II record - mostly in clandestine affairs and earning no less than 4 honorary knights after the conflict, while Grant reportedly worked undercover for British intelligence, keeping an eye on the Nazi sympathizers of Hollywood.) <br /> <br /> The real acting laurels here should go to Sam Jaffe , heartbreaking in the title role. He infuses the humble man with a radiant dignity and enormous courage, making the last line of Kipling's poem resound. It's unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Montague Love is really brave as the major of the regiment, while Eduardo Ciannelli is Evil Incarnate in the role of the Thuggee guru. The rest of the cast, Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote, Lumsden Hare, are effective but have little to do. Filmmakers will recognize Cecil Kellaway as Miss Fontaine's father. <br /> <br /> The film chooses the bad guys well. The demonic cult of the Thuggee, worshipers of the hateful Kali, the Hindu goddess of Indonesian and bloody destruction, was the ruin of Indian life for 6 centuries, ritualistically strangling up to 30,000 victims a year. In 1840 the British army, in collaboration with a number of princely states, succeeded in definitively suppressing religion. From now on there would be stuff from novels and nightmares.
