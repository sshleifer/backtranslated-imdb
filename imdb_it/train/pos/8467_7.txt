I liked this movie because it basically did more with less. It could have been more interesting if they had kept it even more confined to the studio (although some elements of the plot would have been more difficult to develop). <br /> <br /> The guy who plays the DJ has done a good job of showing someone scared and obsessed with his memories. I also found his dialogue with callers rather amusing. <br /> <br /> While parts of the film are seen to arrive a mile away, other parts that you do not expect are revealed as they did. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a rather minimal ghost story, focusing more on the living side of the equation. The last 5-10 minutes have been well done since everything has been revealed. <br /> <br /> Even though it was a shorter film, it seemed like the right time to tell the story. Again and would have started to drag.
