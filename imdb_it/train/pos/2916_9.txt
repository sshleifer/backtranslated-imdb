Of all the movies I have seen, and this is most of them, this is by far the best that is primarily U.S. Naval Airships (Blimps) during the WW-II era. Yes, there are other good LTA-related movies, but most use special effects more than any other real-time footage. This Man's Navy has many more real-time shots of airships etc. True, lots of trivial dialogues, but this is what makes Hollywood movies more interesting, even today. Postscript I spent 10 years (out of 20) and I have over 5,000 hours in Navy Airships of all types, from 1949 to 1959. Proud member of the Naval Airship Association etc. [ATC (LA / AC) USN Retired]
