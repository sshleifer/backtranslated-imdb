I watched it every night on VH1 last week. This is a terrific revealing portrait of the drug epidemic and how drugs have been exposed in the media in the 1960s and 1970s. Woodstock, Easy Rider, The Beatles, The Death of Morrison, Hendrix, Joplin are all here. Vh1 has modeled an intricate and complete portrait of life and times during the "drug years". From the Sanfrancisco Bay Area to Studio 54 this documentary shows the evolution and progress of the drug and death business and the new life it has breathed in American culture. From marijuana to LSD to cocaine, this documentary shows the way drugs were entering the country, the hippie movement, conservative resistance and the way drugs influenced the arts (music, movies, etc.) with tons of interviews fascinating and news films. <br /> <br /> Drug Films: The Trip Easy Rider Up in the Smoke Reefer Madness Blow Boogie Nights
