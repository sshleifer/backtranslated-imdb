I admit to having some trepidation when I first saw the previews of this film. Was the VH-1 trampling on a hollow ground here? I mean, Harris and Quinn really don't look like either John or Paul. But I have to admit that this film really surprised me. It is far from the exploitative film I expected. Instead, it is a study of the characters, a humorous, capricious and ultimately bittersweet look at friendship, and the last lesson we all learn: it is difficult, if not impossible, to capture what we have had and what has passed to us next.
