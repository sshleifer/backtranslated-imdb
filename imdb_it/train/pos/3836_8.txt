Extremely interesting and intriguing film. The similarities with David Lynch (which is actually literally quoted by the presence of red curtains in the film) and the novels of Franz Kafka (the keeper of this film is called Mrs. Grubach, like that of Der Prozess ...) are clearly present but in this case is accompanied by clear references to Belgium's colonial past in Africa. The exact content of the film cannot clearly describe: this colonialism is an important part, as is the inability to cope with such a past, but the personal memories of the main character are also a central issue, and his search for the social contact and love These are the symbolic themes that I have deduced from the film, but in reality they are nothing but impressions. <br /> <br /> But even if you only try to follow the linear plot without these symbolic backgrounds, you will still discover an extremely fascinating film full of splendid images (beautiful close-ups of beatles, larvae and other evil insects alternate with large sequences of dreams and even the dark atmosphere gives the film an extra style). Perhaps you can say that I did not "understand" the film, but I was watching as hypnotized for an hour and a half, deeply impressed by the visual quality and the fascinating mysteriosity.
