I'm a lousy movie like this. Movies that take you back and make you relive your childhood. I grew up now and have many responsibilities like a mortgage, children, dogs, a wife and a string of others. I enjoy my life but it is not as innocent and carefree as when I was twelve. Mike Binder's Indian summer knows it and explores it as if he were twelve. It takes you back to a time when life was easier and much more fun. It brings you back to a moment when you worry about your first kiss and you wonder if you could finish the marathon of the camp were important issues. Indian Summer is a fantastic film and it is one that should be seen at least once a year just to be able to sit and laugh ... and remember. <br /> <br /> The film stars Kevin Pollak, Bill Paxton, Diane Lane and Matt Craven (to name just a few) as childhood friends who are recalled to Camp Tamakwa by their former chief field adviser, the Uncle Lou. Uncle Lou is played perfectly by Alan Arkin. He is a kind of boy who is the patriarch of the group. He is also fully aware and understands the true spirit of a father figure and someone who understands the simple things in life. He has difficulty relating to today's kids who need a walkman at full volume when they are in a place of immense beauty like Tamakwa. This is a field in which the moose roam the field, leaves that transform the colors that God has given them and the water as far as the eye can see. Uncle Lou craves the ancient days and asks his former campers to return to the camp to see one of them take control of the camp. While they are all together again, we can see their trials and tribulations and perhaps a new love could arise between them. <br /> <br /> While the adults return to the camp, it is not long before they behave like children again as the typical jokes of the camp are played all over again. They take toilet paper from the stalls, put toothpaste on sleeping bags and so on. All this is done hilariously and with actors like Pollak and Paxton, it's all very funny. <br /> <br /> But beyond hilarity, we come to explore some real adult emotions that anyone can relate to. In one of my favorite scenes, Kevin Pollak and Elizabeth Perkins overlook a bay where they used to go canoeing as children. Pollak can't understand how small he is and Perkins finally tells him that the bay hasn't shrunk, they just got bigger. He doesn't hammer the point at home, but he does it subtly. We all grow up, we all go and unfortunately we can't live like we did 20 years ago. The more things change, the more they remain the same. <br /> <br /> Indian Summer is a film based on the character and was beautifully written by Mike Binder who attended the Camp Camp Tamakwa, as Sam Raimi, who played Stick in the film) and is his affectionate and vivid memory of his experiences that feed the film. There are many moving scenes and there are also many hilarious ones. Both are perfect. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I love this and it is a real hidden gem. <br /> <br /> 10/10
