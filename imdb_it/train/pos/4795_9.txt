Every time I hear a movie propagandize because it has no sex, violence, bad words, special effects and so on, my b. the detector turns off. Usually, a film like this is a sentimental nonsense that cheers for people who don't want anything to surprise them, but to say how much cowardly people are superior to us. So when David Lynch's STRAIGHT STORY started getting this kind of reviews, I was worried, especially since I wasn't a fan of his other "edifying" story, THE ELEPHANT MAN. For all the wonderful images and the good acting in that film, he seemed more interested in preaching to us than in inspiring us. <br /> <br /> I don't need to worry. THE STRAIGHT STORY is an honest movie rather than a sweet one. Most of this is due to the fact that Lynch and writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney tell it simply and simply. There are a couple of Straight homilies I could have done without, and the corn shots taken are repeated a little too much, but those are just quibbles. There is no heavy message, no sentimental thread that tears our emotions and no condescension towards us and his characters. Instead, they depend on history to build their power, and it does so, so from the final scene, we are genuinely moved. <br /> <br /> Of course, the casting of Richard Farnsworth adds realism to the part. It is really someone who seems very experienced but continues to persevere, and except for those homilies, the desire that must come back together with his brother does not seem excessively sentimental, because you can perceive that there is someone here who has lived too long and seen too much to be driven by anger for a long time. And he knows his time is running out, so he wants to make some peace, not just with his brother, but with his life. Sissy Spacek also does a refined and unconditional job as a daughter of Straight. And although I am a city and suburban boy, the landscape of Iowa and Wisconsin is beautifully filmed, which makes me want at least a day of visit.
