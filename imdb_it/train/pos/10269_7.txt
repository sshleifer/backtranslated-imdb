In the spirit of the classic "The Sting", this film strikes where it really hurts ... in the heart! A real female psychiatrist, hungry for adventures, meets the dirtiest and the most putrid of rogues. The vulnerable doctor falls in love with the career badman and asks to be involved in his operation. While the film moves in a "slow" way, the climax and the ending are incredible! You will especially like how the doctor "forgives itself"!
