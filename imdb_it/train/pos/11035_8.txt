Four prisoners share a single cell: the overbearing transvestite, Marcus (Clovis Cornillac); The idiot twin of Marcus, Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who will eat something in sight, including pocket watches, cockroaches and his little sister; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife; and Carrère (Gérald Laroche), the new boy who was involved in corporate fraud and is now focused on escape. After a brick falls from the cell wall, the men discover the hidden diary written by a serial killer obsessed with the "Fountain of Youth" who occupied the cell in the 1920s. Is this diary the secret to their escape? Or is there something much more sinister behind it? <br /> <br /> I was a little tired of getting into this film because the only other experience I had with Eric Valette was the terrible One Missed Call (2008), which I consider the worst theatrical film I have never seen. However, much of what was wrong with One Missed Call could probably be attributed to Klavan's terrible script, because (as I recall) Valette's direction was not the worst part of the film (unless she chose to include the child) . However, Maléfique was a good way to get my respect back. . . is a French film (obviously something I like) and takes place in prison (which is my second favorite horror setting after the asylums). So it's two points for him before the movie even starts. Fortunately, Valette had me once the movie was finished. Maléfique is a rather deep, rather complex, rather compelling story of obsession and despair. . . the desire and the need to bring fantasies to reality. Although it is not a terrifying film in the traditional sense, the strangeness of its power makes it rather damn scary. The period between the climax and the conclusion was one of the best films I've seen in a long time and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a decent psychological thriller with a bit of cold blood. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 8.5 / 10. A little respect earned by Valette. <br /> <br /> Note: Paramount has collected the rights to make an American remake (surprise surprise). It's scheduled for 2009. I'm not sure why, to be honest, as this doesn't seem like something that could be a big money investor here in the United States. But, I was surprised first. <br /> <br /> Live La France! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
