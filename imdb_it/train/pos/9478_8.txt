This is a beautiful film with a beautiful story, which plays the most important role in the whole film. <br /> <br /> It is a rather intriguing dramatic story, with even the romanticism present in it. The story is told slowly but this works too well for its accumulation. The characters are nice and well portrayed by his actors. I'm not normally a big fan of Asian acting style, but the acting in this film was simply good. <br /> <br /> Obviously the film is quite different in its approach and in style from other genre films produced in the west. In a sense, this film is already more advanced than its approach compared to western films made during the same era. <br /> <br /> I just wanted his visual style to have been a little better. For a film that is considered a kind of art movie, this film is certainly lacking in good-looking sequences. This was obviously a fairly inexpensive film to make and was done in a fairly general way. Not that this is a bad thing, it simply prevents this film from being distinguished from itself and rising above the genre. <br /> <br /> But oh well, this film is about its well-built history and the characters that are in it. In this regard, this film certainly does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> 8/10
