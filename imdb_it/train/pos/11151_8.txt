The only reason I knew about Midnight Cowboy was because it was in the Top 100 of AFI Critic. For a top 100 it is not a well-known film; in fact, I had to try hard to find a copy, I got the DVD version for about half the price. Surprisingly, only M15 + (the uncut version) was evaluated. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many will take note of this review (more like a comment) so I'll make it short. <br /> <br /> This is perhaps one of the strangest films I've seen, partly due to the use of montages, artistic shootings (very art-house) and the unusual theme. There are many things in the film that I still don't understand (I've seen it twice), and it makes a film emotionally confusing. <br /> <br /> Filming and acting were very good, and it's the biggest characters in life that make this movie memorable. The main character is Joe Buck, a Texas "cowboy" who moves to New York to become a prostitute. He meets the paralytic Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo and, obviously, they become friends who face the usual escapades. What makes the film interesting is that the two characters are so different. <br /> <br /> I heard that the film didn't really develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo because the audience had a real emotional connection, even if the ending is certainly rather sad and tragic. You probably already know what's going on reading the reviews, but it's pretty obvious from the start. I personally think that the film is magnificent and that it intensely explores its main themes. The deprivation of humanity (shown by the darkness of the city streets, by demolished apartment buildings). Most of the characters in the film exist outside the law (a conman, giggolo.etc) and yet you can't help them like him. Joe Buck is captivating because he is so naive and optimistic, as we begin to feel pity for Ratso later in the film. <br /> <br /> I think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very innovative for its period. At the moment (and even now) it was certainly not a typical film (rather art-house). At a time when cinema was dominated by tired westerns, musicals and dramas, a film with such an unusual theme as Midnight Cowboy appears. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I have to say that I really liked the film. The images conveyed a dreamlike quality. I particularly liked the party scene, the music, the images, etc. We stay in your mind for a long time after watching. However, as a movie for entertainment it was a bit lacking (not really my movie style) in chills. This is a film to be savored and appreciated, rather than an electrifying and inexpensive action movie. <br /> <br /> Although I would hardly consider myself qualified to analyze this film, the characters and their motivations were quite interesting. From what I understand from the flashbacks, Joe Buck was sexually abused by his grandmother, even if it doesn't seem to be relevant to the story. He is a happy and lucky young stallion that suppresses his darkest memories. Even the religious connotations in the film are staggering. Some have suggested a homosexual connection between Buck and Ratso, although I can't see where they got the idea. The subject of homosexuality in general is more than touched in their conversation, and later in Joe Buck's meeting with a lonely old man, but has little to do with the main story. <br /> <br /> Certainly from a technical point of view one of the most beautiful films of the decade (he has more than one 70's to feel him with a 60s touch) and revolutionary for his time that touches on topics that few other films have dared to do. While it has a simple and sentimental history (masked by a hard edge) the beauty of the film is in the strange, often psychedelic sequences.
