I loved "Dan in Real Life". A wonderful travel story of love like You've Got Mail or While You Were Sleeping, but not ridiculously full of gags of sight and rough jokes, and not so romantic to make you throw up. <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a well-known advice columnist who doesn't seem able to fix things in his life. Until one day, in a family / travel meeting, he meets and instantly connects with Marie (the always beautiful Juliette Binoche) a radiant specimen of a woman who seems to be framed by a misty filter that leads back to the stars of classic cinema. The chemistry happens to a cup of tea and muffins, but Marie has to be out for a previous engagement, and they have to part. <br /> <br /> We are then treated to Dan's close and fun loving relatives, who not only make great breakfasts together but also enjoy using Dan smart and sweetly rude as the target of many bachelor jokes. What I liked so much was that, although the characteristics of the family could be seen as unpleasant for some, I thought it was a great portrait of a large family that did not venture into parodies or crude exaggerations. The Burns family is simply a tight-knit group of people who are truly interested in Dan. There are wonderfully embarrassing family moments that are not unrealistic. The family is nosy, but never petty-witty or gossipy; eccentric, but never extravagant. <br /> <br /> And then Dan falls in love with his brother's girlfriend who is taken to the family reunion. And so begins a rollercoaster of restrained desire and amusing lovers. <br /> <br /> I could go on but I thought this movie was just great. He is not particularly "hip" or "intelligent", never too verbose and obsessed with dry humor or sharp spirit as many comedies are in modern cinema. There is a good balance between narrative graphics and fun but real dialogues. in fact, at the beginning of the film, the initial spark of love begins with a capricious discussion in a classic Hollywood-style conversation in which the characters say what they are thinking aloud. <br /> <br /> So I probably spoke poorly and repeated myself, but I highly recommend "Dan in Real Life". It's a great movie for appointments, believe me, you'll laugh, and only if you're a misfit like me will you have a few tears in your eyes. Full of fun and magical love, "Dan in Real Life" will not disappoint. <br /> <br /> =================== 3.5 out of 4 stars Grade: A
