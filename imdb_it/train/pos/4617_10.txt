I was a fan of Jennifer Connelly from Phenomena, and after hearing about seven minutes in heaven, I saw it as soon as I could. The film is not just a comedy if you think that many of these things that most of us have lived as children and are going through not only the terrifying movie driven by the phenomenal Jennifer Connelly, have fascinated my attention that this film was written in a terrifying and recited way it was a good deal that I liked and I looked at it again and again and for those of you who have fun with a good laugh or love Jennifer, who can't put off this movie !!!!
