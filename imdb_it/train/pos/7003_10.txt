The emotional impact of this film challenges words. It is elegant, thin, beautiful and tragic, all rolled up in two hours. This is Will Smith as he matures in his acting skills, the full range of it. Who knew? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought, this must be a stroke of luck for the blockbuster, over-the-top actor, Smith. His performances in both films represent a whole new dimension for Smith, a refinement of talent, the selectivity of scripts, I'm not sure, but now I see it differently. Seven Pounds is one of those films that you must suspend your conviction to fully enjoy its essence. Don't look at it for the plot, look at it for the fragile condition of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt, expiation, love and sacrifice.
