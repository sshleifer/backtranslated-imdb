I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I also work in a medical facility for acute care. Over the years I have seen people die due to hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions, I have participated in numerous conferences on blood pathogens and have seen many patients become seriously ill with blood-borne pathogen-induced pathogens. I have also heard several Jehovah's Witnesses say that they will die if they refuse the blood and after 26 years in the field I have never seen it happen, leaving the question "is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is the community to great advantage of the battle on this subject? "The question for Jehovah's Witnesses is moral. "You must abstain from blood" is not an ambiguous statement. Thanks for this movie and allowing comments on it.
