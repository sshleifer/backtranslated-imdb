This is an extraordinary film, which constantly deceives you. It seems that he is heading towards the clich√© in several places, and then something surprising will happen that really starts. It would give too much to say much more, but stick to this film and you will be fully rewarded. William Haines is absolutely delightful - he is certainly a star who deserves to be rediscovered. The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is surprising - there is even a scene in which Haines rubs Pickford's chest (Pickford has a cold). Both actors interpret this subtext subtly and with great depth of emotion, so that there are very moving moments. And I never thought I'd be so involved in a soccer game like I did in this movie - and I don't even understand the rules! Francis X also excellent. Bushman's son, Ralph, is Haines's rival for the girl (yes, it's not completely a gay movie). Wonderful silent classic - a great example of 1920s commercial cinema with an advantage.
