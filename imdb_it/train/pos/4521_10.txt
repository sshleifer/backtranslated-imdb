Julie Waters is always wonderful but Adrian Pasdar is a positive revelation in this ironic genre comedy about a transvestite who cannot suppress his obsession and the changes he undergoes when discovered. He infallibly avoids vulgar, raucous and easy jokes for a genuine spirit and true intuition, and has an absolute ball while doing so. A very beautiful, low-key comedy of well-being
