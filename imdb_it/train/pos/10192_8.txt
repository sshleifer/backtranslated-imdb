This is the most powerful WHO. Although before the masterpiece Who's Next, it would provide hymns like Baba O'Royily and Wont Get Fooled Again. This film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the 70s. <br /> <br /> Daltrey shows what it's front-man, Entwistle constant as always. <br /> <br /> Moon is fantastic, take a look at the ongoing conversation with the drum tech, and watch it play "side saddle", despite having replaced a bass drum! <br /> <br /> Even Townsend seems to have fun from time to time! <br /> <br /> Considering that they went on stage at 2 am no one in the crowd was asleep! <br /> <br /> There aren't many bands these days able to produce such a tight set and it's hard to imagine that none of today's bands will produce a concert that will be appreciated as much as this in 36 years.
