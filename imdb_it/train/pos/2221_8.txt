One night I came across this on the Bravo satellite station. Initially out of curiosity I decided to watch it. To be honest I was not disappointed. The main character is beautiful and his body is well shown. You would think of his talents. He would be wasted as an executioner but apparently not after seeing the whole movie! My only complaint is the acting cast of the support in particular the actor who plays Melnik. His Christ is bad! Even prison guard Hank is sad. gets drunk and makes attempts to pass to his co-guard Wanda, even if fortunately for us the spectator and for Hank he lowers and gets dirty with Wanda towards the end. The music used is rather tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the performances. This movie is watching the beautiful, talented and very sexy Jennifer Thomas alone
