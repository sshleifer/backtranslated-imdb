I found this film very good in all areas. The acting was brilliant by all the characters, particularly Ms. Stone and Morissey. Tramell's character gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute. The plot is interesting though, this film is more for the mind that plays between the main characters and how Catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels. The setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the film was that mysterious thriller like a masterpiece. Go see this movie now, it deserves better than the one it got from the audience, who was misled by some terrible bad reviews about the movie (before it even started) ..... You won't regret it, if you go see it ...
