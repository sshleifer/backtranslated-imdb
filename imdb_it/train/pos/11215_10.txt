I first watched the Walking Tall movies when I was about 8 years old and thought that both Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job, they have to have it anyway because I've tried to learn a lot about the truth since I saw the movies Sheriff Buford Pusser How Can I All 3 parts of the film gave me the creeps and Buford Pusser was a true hero, I just wish he were alive today and that there were more people like him. I'd like to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave. I am very sorry that your family had to endure such horror and pain. My heart turns to them. So, from a 30-year-old fan of Sheriff Pusser and the 3-part Walking Tall movies and the actors who portrayed him, please don't be negative about these films and actors, they were just trying to let us know what a wonderful man the true Buford Pusser was and what a great family he had. And to all the young people who might not have heard much about Buford, I suggest you watch the Walking Tall movies and learn more about him.
