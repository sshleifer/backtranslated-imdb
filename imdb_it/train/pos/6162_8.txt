I loved this masterpiece and frankly I also found Mary Poppins (although I adore Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke) being silly and sacrina-sweet. Angela Lansbury plays the character perfectly and I don't know why people think this movie is distorted. It was magical and it was a lot of fun to watch. Each scene had a certain charm because you knew the characters better. You really see how this small family united in learning to bond with each other, despite their age and differences. I thought the characters were well developed, especially Charles who was in "The Age of not Believing". Mary Poppins may be more popular and loved by others, but this little gem will be the one I will love and adore.
