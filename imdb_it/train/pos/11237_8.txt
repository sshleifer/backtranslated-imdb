Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a longtime fan on the Internet, completely made for the love of the series, and a must for Trek fans. The quality of the production is extremely high for a fan movie, although sometimes it can be said that the screen is green. However, this does not detract from the overall experience. The CGI ships are fantastic, as well as the space battle scenes ... On the negative side, I could say in the previous episodes (and even occasionally in the most recent ones) that some actors / actresses don't feel comfortable enough in their roles , but again, this does not detract from the overall experience of new Star Trek interpretations. The cast and crew really found something special here and, overall, I would strongly recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.
