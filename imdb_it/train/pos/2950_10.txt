If you've ever been sad about not being able to get a DVD movie, it was probably "Delirante" you were looking for. How often do you laugh when you look at standing comedy routines? I was too young to see Richard Pryor during his best time, and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" and "Raw" (not so funny) I never knew where Eddie had a big part of his inspiration. Now that I'm older and I've seen both Pryor and many of the comedians since Murphy, I can see two things: Eddie's Every STEALS, while Richard's Eddie LOVINGLY BORROWED. This is the huge difference: was Eddie original, funny, provocative, thoughtful? and more. It was something never seen before. It was everything we needed. These days Eddie Murphy is boring and old ?? but he was once the king, and "Delirious" was the largest castle ever built. Truly one of the most enjoyable routines of all time.
