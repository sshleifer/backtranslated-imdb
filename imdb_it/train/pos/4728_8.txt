After seeing "Break a Leg" in Vancouver at the release party I thought it was a very funny movie. <br /> <br /> I had a few laughter and some of the cameos (Eric Roberts in particular) were screaming. I didn't hear the actual release date even though I heard it's close. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple but it is primarily a vehicle for characters and situations. The script is fluid and smooth, the plot develops effortlessly and the acting is comfortable but fresh. This film has won at least one prize from EACH of the film festivals in which it was published, which is around 10-15 or so. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend "Break a Leg".
