I've seen virtually all of Cynthia Rothrock's films, and to me this is the most fun. It reminds me of the first Jackie Chan films. Of course, Rothrock may not be the greatest actress, but she is very good at seeing both a martial artist and a very pretty young lady. This film, although probably not the best of all his films, was the most fun.
