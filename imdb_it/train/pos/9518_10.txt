An excellent representation of one of the most unhealthy aspects of that era. I loved the graphics - very suitable for a story related to a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> I thought that Tom Hanks was really good at this, he came across very well in someone who was hardened by his work (which he didn't choose fully for himself) but still wants to have a normal life for his family. It does the best it can to see it happen. I don't want to ruin the plot - but YOU MUST SEE this movie if you are a person who wants more from a movie than the usual action / gangster movie. (It is however violent).
