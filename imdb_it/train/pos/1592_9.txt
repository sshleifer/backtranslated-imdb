'What I Like About You' is definitely a show I couldn't wait to see every day. Amanda Bynes is an excellent actress and I grew up watching her show: "The Amanda Show". He's a very funny person and seems to be down to earth. "Holly" is such a capable person and has an "off-court" personality. I liked how she always changed things and turned it upside down, so sometimes she got messed up. But that's what made the show so beautiful. <br /> <br /> I particularly enjoyed the show when the "Vince" character arrived. Nick Zano is very HOT and funny, as is "Gary", Wesley Jonathan. The whole cast was great, every character had his personality and charm. Jennie Garth, Allison Munn and Leslie Grossman were all very interesting. I particularly loved "Lauren"; she is the best! It helped make the show more fun and you never know what it will do or what it will say next! Overall the show is really nice but the reason I didn't give it a 10 was because there were no new episodes and because the episodes could have been longer and deeper.
