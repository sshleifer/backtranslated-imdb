Great movie, enough laughter and action for any audience. <br /> <br /> Since the last person who posted this movie took charge of calling Woody Allen incestuous and not commenting on the film, here I am. /> <br /> The film follows an unlikely couple, Johansson and Allen, as they follow a suggestion given to them by the ghost of a recently deceased English reporter. Their research takes them to the killer house, and eventually to a somewhat tragic end. But don't let the plot fool you, the film is really hilarious and the acting is superb. It seems that when directors reach a certain age they can really do things right. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack seem to do some of the most imaginative jobs in their respective careers. Also, by watching the movie in a theater, you can simply say that people really love Woody Allen and are ready for him to really make a comeback. The second one he walked on the screen lit up. There's just something in man and it really shines in the Scoop. <br /> <br /> Take a look, it's worth it.
