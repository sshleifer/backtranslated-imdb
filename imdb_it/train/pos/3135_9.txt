I loved this movie. I knew it would be chock full of camps and nonsense like the original series. I found it very exciting to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin and Julie Newmar all together again. Anyone who loved the Batman series of the 1960s should have enjoyed Return to the Batcave. It could be said that the actors had a lot of fun making this film, especially Adam West. And I bet he would have gladly returned to his Batman costume if the script asked him to do so. I told a number of friends of this film that he chose not to see it ... now they wanted them to do it. I have all the original 120 episodes on VHS. Now this film will join my collection. Thanks for the Adam and Burt meeting.
