My baby sitter was a fan so I saw many of the older episodes while growing up. I'm not a Scooby Doo fan so I'm not sure why I left the TV when this show was previewed. To my surprise I found it funny. For me Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters * dodging tomatoes from other fans * so I like them to concentrate on those two only. However, this could cause fans of original shows to hate it. I like dubbing, especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I liked listening to him before I knew he was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen as Robi sounds to me like he's really having fun as an actor. I also like taking out the techies with their slightly autistic personalities and their desire to play Dungeons and Dragons or play Star Wars scenes (not called by those names on the show, of course).
