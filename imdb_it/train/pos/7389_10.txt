No show can please all people. Clearly if your favorite movies haven't won, you will say that the show was not very good. It is comprensible. <br /> <br /> However, the 74th Annual Academy Awards will be remembered for a magical moment in Hollywood history: <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's first appearance at the Academy Awards. </> <br /> Allen has often avoided awards as self-praise and useless, and has never participated, although he has won many of the coveted awards. <br /> <br /> When the 74th Academy Awards were held, the nation was still weeping over the loss of life in the collapse of the New York World Trade Center. When it came time to pay tribute to the city of New York, they decided to show a video of the great moments of the film that make up the city of cities. Then the announcer simply said: <br /> <br /> "Ladies and gentlemen, Oscar-winning director Woody Allen." <br /> <br /> The place exploded in a long standing ovation. The entertainment industry has finally given its applause to the man in New York who usually avoids the Hollywood scene. While the applause subsided, Woody applied some of his legendary spirit to the situation. <br /> <br /> SOME HIGHLIGHTS: <br /> <br /> "Thank you very much - this makes up for the search for strips." <br /> <br /> "I thought they wanted their Oscars back," he joked. "I was panicked because the pawn shop was out of work for years and I had no way to recover anything." <br /> <br /> "But it wasn't. I couldn't work out because my film wasn't nominated for anything this year, then it hit me - maybe they were calling to apologize." <br /> <br /> Allen also revealed why he neglected his aversion to the Oscar for this special night. /> <br /> "For New York City, I would do anything, so I put on my tuxedo and came here," Allen said. <br /> <br /> "It is a magnificent and fantastic city. It was a fantastic, moving and exciting background for the movies, and it remains a fantastic and fantastic city." <br /> <br />
