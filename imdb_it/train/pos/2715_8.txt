As wanted to prove it was a brilliant television series and it was really one of the very few programs for which it's worth! I suspect that in this era of TIVO and recording devices it would have gone much better than it was in 1982. I look forward to its availability on DVD! <br /> <br /> Although it is true that it has some in common with other television programs such as The Wild, Wild West, The Bearcats and The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., of which I am a big fan, QED had a much more intellectual quality. However, he did not suffer for this - the dialogue was witty and the action was high. The show took place in the UK as Mastermind, and had something of the BBC feeling, but with better production values ​​than those typical of the BBC at that time. <br /> <br /> I was a nineteen year old boy when this series started initially and had too much to do in my life to save time for television. I remember my dear mother, however, calling to remind me that Q.E.D. it was on, and we sat on the phone and watched together. Wonderful memories. <br /> <br /> Really, Q.E.D. it's a sad loss and, if it could be done with the same quality and values ​​today, I'd like to see it make a comeback.
