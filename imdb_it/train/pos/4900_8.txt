This is a bizarre film that the British do so well. Low budget, cameo roles, well executed. The story is a bit weak, a recently widowed Judi Dench decides to gather the "blonde bombs", a band (almost all) that performed during the war in London, the forced son / daughter who thinks he is become stunned. I liked the way the film shows young people who do not have a monopoly on feelings, love and even lust! That even the "old wrinkles" can have a good laugh. Judi Dench was superb as always, too bad I won't see the other "blonde bombs" anymore, the end was a bit rushed, I thought. I kept thinking as I watched that David Jason would make a better Patrick than Ian Holm, although he was quite as adequate as the "disguised" drummer. All in all a cheerful movie that deserves a night in with the girls :)
