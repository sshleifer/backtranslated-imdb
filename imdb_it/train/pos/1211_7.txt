I grew up in this movie and I remember when my brother and I played in the yard and pretended to be in the Care-a-lot. Now, after so many years have passed, I could watch the film with my daughter and watch her enjoy it. If you are a parent and you have not watched this movie with your children, then you should, so keep them in your arms and see them excited about the bears of care and care! The songs, especially "Forever Young" are very sweet and memorable. Parents, I highly recommend this film for all children so they can learn how pleasant it can be to take care of others! When it comes to all the junk you find on TV, you can educate your kids to have the right mood of life with movies like these.
