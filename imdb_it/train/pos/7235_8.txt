"A Girl's Folly" is a sort of mez-comedy, half-mockumentary for film affairs of the mid-10s. Let's take a look at life in one of the first film studios, where we experience the assembly of a set, scrolling through a scene, managing adoring movie fanatics, even lunching the inspector. We are also aware of little known cinematographic facts - for example, did you know that "often the actors of the film do not know the plot of the image in which they are working"? <br /> <br /> The plot of this film, in essence, is the discovery of the movie star Kenneth Driscoll and the romance of a young budding star he discovers while shooting in the countryside. I think the 30 minute version I saw was abbreviated, included in the same tape with "The Cheat" by Cecil B. De Mille. It's a very credible film - an easy watch with a cast of great extras. As a bonus it includes some of the best illustrated captions I've ever seen that accompany a silent film.
