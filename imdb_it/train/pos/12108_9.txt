Yakitate! Ja-pan (translated as Fresh Baked! Japanese Bread) is the story of a young man named Azuma Kazuma and his journey to make the perfect Japanese bread or Ja-pan, for Japan and for the Japanese, which will be recognized as the whole world. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is only outside. Actually, Yakitate! Ja-pan is not really for bread, but the reaction that comes after eating bread and the pun that comes with the reaction. The series is lovely because of these word games. From famous anime titles like Naruto, Detective Conan and Dragon Ball to successful films like The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings. It's all there. <br /> <br /> So what makes this title different from other titles of the same genre like Cooking Master Boy or Mr. Ajikko? Well, unlike the others who use the kitchen for world domination, Yakitate! Ja-pan is purely comedy. Of course, there are times when the story turns into drama or even murder, but the comic atmosphere makes you laugh at them. You will laugh at their view of paradise. Just look at it. <br /> <br /> Just remember that this is also fiction, even if part of the bread made here is based on real bread, eating homemade Japan # 2 will not turn you into a Super Saiyan or transform your body into rubber.
