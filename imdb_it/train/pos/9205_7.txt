This grew on me. I love the music of RD Burman and despite the rawest elements of the story I found a lot to be moved by the fact that I kept watching the film. The plot of the brother-sister is powerful, I thought; there are also things that are more likely obligatory, such as fights with bars, a crazy criminal story, etc. which are simply distracting. (Although it is not disconcerting from a certain point of view.) Even the English translation is certainly from someone for whom it was a bit exaggerated, and as crazy as I am, I thank him for doing it. <br /> <Like many of the Bollywood films I have seen, this is melodramatic and lyrical, including here in particular a song sung for the first time by a little boy to cheer up his abused and unhappy sister, and then the same song sung 12 years later by the man who traveled to Kathmandu trying to reconnect with this girl, grown and upset (they had told her that her brother and mother had died), numbing her pain with drugs. <br /> <br /> A great thing about this 1971 movie is that it is the hippie movement, which brought hordes of researchers to India, from an Indian point of view, who see them as people led to India by a spiritual hunger caused by the failures of their societies, but nevertheless, in India, living only for the pleasures of the moment. The hippie scenes that sing and dance are really wonderful and accurate in their tone (I'm old enough to remember), and I'm pretty sure that the masses of white and zoned young children are real extra hippies, as I recall hearing about kids in the trailer to the east doing this kind of work in Bollywood. <br /> <br /> (This is not the actual Hare Krishna movement, although the hippies in the film sing a Krishna / Rama chant, as well as a group of true Indian devotees, strangers to the hippies, in the opening scene of the film.) <br /> <br /> ~ Virginia
