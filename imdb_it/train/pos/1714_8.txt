Watching the movie I was very light and this film is light too, but the end of the film is simply unexpected, leaving lasting memories in his mind. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Abhay and his profession of being a witness during the registrar's wedding. Soha comes for the wedding and her boyfriend doesn't, leaving Soha alone in the street can't go home and she has nothing to live here in this situation Abahy turns out to be a help for her, that's the basis of the story. <br /> <br /> The rest is only watchable and the end of the plot is bitter and sweet that Abhay has to face and that keeps you at the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> The dialogues and the music are good songs are OK, the direction is good and therefore, like the script, you feel that the film is slow, but looking for the question of the story is all right. <br /> <br /> Really watchable, especially with the bright atmosphere I liked this at home with coke and peanuts. my rating for this is 8/10
