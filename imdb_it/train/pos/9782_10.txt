Peaches is truly a wonderful film. I write this to refute a review by someone called "Auscrit", which appeared on this site. First of all, the idea that it's the first Monahan film "The Interview" or somehow TV is an extraordinary statement. Here is a film that has been praised around the world as it is simply one of the best Australian films ever made. He fully deserved to win the best image. Peaches is a courageous, bold and courageous departure. For me it works at all levels and now I've seen it twice. Monahan is a director who is showing great skill and incredible sensitivity. For 'Auscrit' to comment that this is another TV movie etc. And that Hugo Weaving is not good simply does not 'get' the film. Or more specifically he doesn't want to get it. Frankly, it's the kind of comment you'd expect from another jealous or bitter filmmaker or both. Or someone from within the industry or distribution, show or bureaucracy. Your average punter, I found just don't write comments like that. I noticed other comments on the site and references to the movie Sommersault. One has to wonder what the people watching are thinking. Unfortunately in Australia, at the time of the SS release, the push was, if you didn't like it, then there was something wrong with you, not in the movie. This media manipulation is quite common at the bottom. Reality is the only similarity between the two films: they are the rights of passing films. Unfortunately for me, SS is a film about nothing, which could have been told in 15 minutes. I see it as a one-dimensional film on anxiety. The comparison of peaches is a masterpiece. Personally, I can't wait to know what Monahan is doing, since he is clearly far ahead of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema. In conclusion, if the film does not win all these years, AFI and IF awards, then it is a rigged game. As for Auscrit, please find something more constructive with your time
