Magnificent and unforgettable, incredibly suggestive, and brilliantly performed by everyone. <br /> <br /> I really can't understand what kind of people are panning this masterpiece and giving the preponderance of votes like 8 (and nine!) <Br /> <br /> This, along with Grapes of Wrath, is John Ford's biggest film. I would say that Long Voyage Home is the next in line, even if rather backward. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10. Worth a 12.
