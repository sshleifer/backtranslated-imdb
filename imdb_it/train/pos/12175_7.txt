What would you say about a man who was getting married and was having his bachelor party with some of his closest friends in a Hawaiian type bar? All smooth until he takes off his "bachelor's hat". What would you say about him talking to one of the evocative dancers and then sleeping with her? What would you say if that exact girl were the cousin of her finances? A new low, right? Well, Paul Coleman, played comically by Jason Lee, leads this experience with nausea and a new bass. I must say that this is one of his good main roles. However, I believe his role in Vanilla Sky has been better interpreted. <br /> <br /> His finance named Karen is played by ascetic actress Selma Blair while Karen's character, Becky, is played by the adorable and talented Julia Stiles. Going back to where we left off, Paul now faces a problem that presents itself to another. He gets diseases, he has to deal with certain people, and he has to play his games of lies with stealth or any member of each of the families could get P.O'ed, including one of his relatives who didn't have a "movement intestinal "" for 14 days. * Vomiting * All this leads to the long-awaited marriage with a hilarious scene before reconstructing all the hell that Paul and his brother had to face. <br /> <br /> Overall, A Guy Thing "It's pretty funny and it's all ok. Sometimes the story doesn't seem to go anywhere and you get tired of the scenes here and there but it's a mixed movie. And if you're a Canadian and a friend of the CTV sitcom fan Brett Butt, Corner Gas "You will recognize a small role played by Fred Ewanuick, the same man who plays the hilarious Hank in the series. This film is fine. It's another feather in Lee's hat (a fairly empty hat so far, anyway). <br /> <br /> My vote: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
