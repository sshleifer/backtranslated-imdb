A funny and substantial film, Non-Stop has earned worthy comparisons with "Run Lola Run". The film quickly develops into a chase sequence, during which viewers learn about the three main characters through flashbacks and sequences of daydreams. The chase does not serve as a climax with a pressing rhythm, but as a journey that constitutes most of the film. During the "race" we see the characters grow and momentarily forget about their sad lives, the "macho" roles they bought, and eventually forget about why they started running in the first place. Just as the fight provided "clarity" to the characters of "Fight Club", the race offers the characters of this film a means to get away from the false values ​​that we can all allow society to create for us. Their execution serves as a way to savor life from a perspective without a shadow of light, and all three find a certain level of clarity and joy in the process. <br /> <br /> My appreciation and enjoyment altered slightly in the film's ending, where instead of learning from their experience, the characters seem to go back to playing those fake macho roles that I thought had escaped during their journey. <br /> <br /> However, the only real problem with this film is that it was not released outside of Japan before.
