I really don't know what people have against this movie, but it's definitely one of my favorites. It is not a sermon, it is not anchored to its morality, it should not be controversial. It is only God. Any God possible, no matter religion. And it's really fun. <br /> <br /> Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news, in a desperate attempt to prove to himself (more or less to himself) that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job. This unit is what is slowly driving its beautiful girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston). When the last blows are performed, he is ready not to laugh, but screams in the face of God, who in turn gives Bruce his powers. Bruce therefore improves his life for himself, until he is induced to help others, where he then continues to lose the sense of his powers. Meanwhile, his constant excitement for his life makes him more selfish, leaving his relationship on dangerous ground. <br /> <br /> OK, it's been a bit long. But as a plot, it works well. The step-by-step fashion in which we face the challenges of being God is much better than gathering its problems together, and being able to hide well enough. <br /> <br /> As you probably know from this film in the first place, the perfect acting of Carrey remains in the character (which, thankfully, he), and controls and gives atmosphere to the film scene by scene. Whether they admitted it or not, the role was written or rewritten exclusively for Carrey. Without him, humor would become flat, as humor is halfway through. And humor is very good in the first place. But without Carrey, it seems to be an A's Life's aspirant. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston is great and, regardless of what some may say, does not act as the only excuse for the third act. At least, don't think when you see it. It gives you a heartfelt expression and makes you forget you're watching a movie, she and Carrey feel just like a real couple. <br /> <br /> The film feels ggooooodd (see the film to understand), has a very good feeling, tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called together to save Carrey's career (which went nowhere).
