I came across this show several years ago and fell in love with it. He introduces TÃ©a Leoni and Holland Taylor and made me laugh, one episode after another. I guess it didn't get so big, and it was canceled after a few seasons, but I think it was a good run and I would suggest looking at it ... if the opportunity came.
