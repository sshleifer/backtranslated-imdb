This is a fantastic classic monster from the 50s! I love the look of the 50s in general like machines and music. However, I love the way the blob looks. I like it when everyone is on the stage of horror late in the evening at the cinema and the blob arrives and brings the party down. Another thing I like is that it takes place all night, just like Halloween II. <br /> <br /> When Steve and Jane are doing outside, they see a meteor falling from space. Inside the meteor is the blob. Every time the blob consumes a person, it becomes bigger and bigger. They try to convince the people of the city of the mushy monster, but no one believes them later. Can something stop this mushy creature? I highly recommend THE BLOB !!!
