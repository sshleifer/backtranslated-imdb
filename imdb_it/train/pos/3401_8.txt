The innovative Technicolor Cinematography (winner of the Oscar Special Technical Achievement) is truly enchanting. Add an infinite variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic movie dream team like Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer, and you have a pretty nice "picture". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the invented plot and the blown acting leave much to be desired. However, there have not been more stunning Technicolor films before this (1936), and very few since then, which can overcome this breathtaking visual experience of stunning colors. Movie fans who enjoyed the glorious color cinematography in "Robin Hood" (1938), "Jesse James" (1939) and "Gone With The Wind" (1939), will not be disappointed by the fantastic work done here. "The Garden Of Allah" will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography.
