CB4 was terrible, but could have given Cundieff the best idea. More like Spinal Tap than anything else, the film is smart from the start. Surprising anyone who saw it in the mid-nineties. The performances are interpreted as laughter, but not so much as to be cartoon characters, more like the Marx brothers. These guys are real and slightly different. They react to situations like any of us could. Well, we might not have a tantrum when our performance hats are late for the concert, or throwing guns and shooting down a record company executive, but you get the picture. N (n *** as) W (with) H (hats) takes you seriously enough to pull you in, so you're hooked. rent or take this at all costs, even if you are not really passionate about rap music, this will leave you speechless anyway. Comparing this with CB4 is like comparing George Lucas' Star Wars to Gil Gerards "Buck Rogers". I think you see my point
