This video is so hilarious, it makes the rest of Eddie Murphy (even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor, which just goes to show you how good this is) to look very disappointing. To be honest, I don't think I've ever laughed at anything as much as this, including Naked Gun and Bargearse, rarely seen. This show is surprising, although it must be said that it is certainly full of the word that starts with F which is four letters long (plus its extended version that starts with M) but it didn't bother me. Look at it, the funniest thing I've ever seen and probably the most fun you've ever had.
