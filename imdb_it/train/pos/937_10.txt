When it was first broadcast in 1984, my wife and I recorded it on our very first VHS recorder. I still have that aging tape, which I try to watch every year. It was the year my first child was born and seeing A Christmas Carol in this incarnation brings back fond memories of happy moments - many of which were spent with this film in the background. In the end I broke up this year and ordered a DVD, which prompted me to take a moment to write this short reaction to the film. The story of Charles Dickens is exceptionally captured here. George C. Scott is absolutely incredible and totally credible as Scrooge. The supporting cast is just as spectacular. This is, in my opinion, an impeccable production. Small details add a lot to pleasure. The game "similes", Scrooge's nephew and wife, play with their party guests and is a well-kept object. (Since then I have recreated it with my high school English students for a short break from class work!) Honestly, I can think of some way to have fun during the holidays. I like it more than just doing this CBS production, which was originally sponsored by IBM. (Incidentally, it's fun to look at the old tape with IBM's original ads ... which show how computers have evolved over 21 years. Amazing how things have changed!) and this surrender is a timeless classic. Enjoy ... and God bless us, everyone!
