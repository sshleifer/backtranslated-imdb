This is the second film based on the life and times of the ultra-hung porn star, John Curtis Estes, better known as John Holmes. Boogie Nights is also based on her life. Maybe one day someone will make a film about the life of Tommy Byron. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the story is not told very well. There are many episodes of Law & Order that have more twists than Wonderland, and the director never goes on the criminal case with any kind of enthusiasm. Val Kilmer has two problems: he is not as hanged as Holmes (and no prosthesis this time, unlike Boogie Nights), and he is much nicer than Mope Holmes. <br /> <br /> The director does not introduce a single amusing individual into the cast. The racist, the immature lowlifes he hangs out with, or his wife, and the police don't get much on the way to characterization. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is Eric Bogosian who tells Paris Hilton to "get lost". <br /> <br /> Having said that, anyone who is not interested in the more obscene side of the porn world in the 1980s or the real crime should not lose it.
