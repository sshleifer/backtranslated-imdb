First of all, I didn't know what to expect when I started the video. <br /> <br /> Whenever someone reports a cult-type film genre and adapts it to the present, something is inexplicably lost in the translation. br /> <br /> This is not the case. This movie starts right on the right track. It is part of the family territory but manages to bring it over. Crockzilla scene to someone? This must be seen, and just try to keep a straight face. This film takes some of the old classics of the cult movie and manages to blend it perfectly into a modern production. It's nice to see someone filling the need in this market. Very well done. <br /> <br />
