This is one of the greatest children's films ever created. I cry every time I see Shadow screaming "Wait, wait for Peter!" while the family car is moving away. This is a must see if you love animals! Best movie ever! The jokes in the film are sometimes stupid. Like when Sassy tells Chance; "The cat rule and the dogs drool!" Lines of this that I could have done without, but when I was six I bet I loved that phrase. The plot may seem a little affectionate to some, but I like it. Shade like the older dog who is preparing the Case to take it over when he left is really moving when you think about it. It reminded me of my childhood dog. I think everyone can find a piece of themselves in "Homeward Bound".
