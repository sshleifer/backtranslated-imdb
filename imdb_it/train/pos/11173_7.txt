Ah, cliché, cliché, cliché; They are a main part of a wide variety of horror films. This one has many. Still, it's Stephen King, one of the best masters of horror. This film was really good, just too predictable. And which horror movie doesn't have stupid people? This is overcrowded with retarded victims who practically implore their lives. Pet Semetary I found it a bit creepy. The way everything is set up was REALLY spooky, but not terrifying. For the most part, acting was credible, the suspense was not so strong, but the level of entertainment was put in an important position; My eyes were practically glued to the screen. All Stephen King fans have to watch this movie, but as for the others, expect an OKAY thriller.
