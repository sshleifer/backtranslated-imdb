If you saw a film by Ren√© Clair with that kind of distracted semi-attention that is the rule of watching TV, you could do something different. <br /> <br /> Watching "Le Million" with attention focused on what happens before eyes and ears reveal a wealth of delightful details that keep this musical comedy from beginning to end with its explosion of joy. <br /> <br /> In the Danish newspaper Berlingske Tidende a journalist once wrote: "In my younger days I saw a film that made me feel like I was dancing to the cinema at home. This film is on TV tonight - watch it! "
