The brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, really) duel not only for the affections of Debra Winger but in reality for a secret of their childhood that has left them in contrast with their powers. <br /> <br /> There are surreal touches (firefighters acting like a singing Greek choir), but there is also humor, spirit and romance. Even the soundtrack is fantastic. And similarly to the way the American werewolf in London used every great Wolf song they could get - but with fire and I don't think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), setting his own trailer even to a rocker "She's a lady 'priceless ~;) <br /> <br /> The best missing line in the quotation marks section btw ~' Once you've had a clown, never come back! '<br /> <br / > I love this movie (I just ordered the DVD from the United States) and if the comments written by the kind of people who would be happiest with Legally Blond 3 don't get discouraged ~ try it :)
