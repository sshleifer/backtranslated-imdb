This movie literally has all the clich√©s of the action movie and they all work to their advantage. Straight from Lethal Weapon Gary Busey wise, shoot and giggle through this movie with such reckless abandon that he can't help but entertain and amuse. There are tanks, helicopters, machine gun battles, grenades and ice cream vans and if they are not good enough reasons to watch this movie, then, with regards to the best ... Danny Trejo. And if you don't know who Danny Trejo is, you'll probably not like this movie.
