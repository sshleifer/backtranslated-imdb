I have no idea how IMDb generates reviews but I know that, as often happens on Amazon.com, there are a surprising number of very negative reviews for this film that repeat the same points of discussion, somewhat obscure, almost literally. A campaign? Only IMDb knows this. <br /> <br /> As for this movie: it's fine. It's a funny, cute and very simple movie. <br /> <br /> It's been over a decade since I worked in Brooklyn, lived in Queens and visited relatives in the South Bronx. But I didn't find anything inauthentic or exploitative about these guys. Is grandma a bizarre character? Yes. Do dialogue and plot recognize it? Yes, fortunately, they do. Are the other films set in the LES and are Dominican / Puerto Rican children possible? I bet this makes this movie a crime ?? how some of the comments (in my eyes, astroturf) would suggest? Almost. Make a thousand plastic flowers bloom. <br /> <br /> This is better than any episode of Degrassi JR. High or high Degrassi. Scoff in comparison but I never had it and I was touched, in the center, by the humility of this film and by the tender spirit. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I would like to know the background behind all these slanders! :-D
