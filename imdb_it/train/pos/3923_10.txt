This is a fantastic film, both for the incredible energy evoked by the frenetic flamenco dancing, and for the unique way in which the directors intertwine the history of theatrical production with the lives of the characters who are preparing for it. Spellbinding is the only word I can use to describe the experience. This is not the "Carmen of Bizet" according to a usual standard. This is not a regular movie of any level. Every nuanced look, every foot beat, every piece of music is woven so captivatingly that you can't look away from the screen. It is not necessary to love opera or flamenco (I do not) to be captured, captivated, fascinated by this film. Thin and direct; strong and still; One of the films, if not the best, is kind, because there are so few.
