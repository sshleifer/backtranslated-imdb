I went to see Vanilla Sky with a huge, huge, huge ... fan of Tom Cruise, my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend ... what can I say ... I was totally amazed by the film and above all by the performance of TC, I thought it was a very moving film and it was not at all what I expected. <br /> <br /> I had read the reviews and decided not to go see it, I'm so glad I was "forced" to see it. The strange thing is that I can't say why, all I can say is that I found it totally engaging and I could not stop thinking about it the next day. Regarding what I heard about the film, all I can say is, IT IS NOT HISTORY (it is fantasy, psychodrama, anything) about people and events that shape their lives and how small events, how to get on a car can change everything ...... <br /> <br /> As for what the criticism has written, yes, maybe l 'original was a fantastic second film for Alejandro Amen√°bar, but this was a completely different interpretation of the subject, and in no way a narcissistic remake for the benefit of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br /> I can't even think of writing a couple of trivial phrases to describe the film, just go to see it !!!! <br /> <br /> Yes, I know this is not a balanced and thoughtful review, but what? It's not that kind of movie.
