This is a good musical with a timeless soundtrack by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice "Parisian" atmosphere that gives the film a lot of charm, but in terms of a story ... well, it's not really there. Or at least, not very well developed. Even acting is not so smooth by Caron. But I liked some dialogues, I liked the Senna scene, I liked the character played by Levant, the colors; and the dance, of course, which is truly magnificent. <br /> <br /> A 7.5 - 8 seems poised for me.
