I first saw a track on this DVD in a hifi show in London in 2006 (I wasn't really keen on cream until now !!). It was through a high-end Arcam system, it sounded great with dts. and I'll tell you that this is by far the most exciting music DVD I've ever seen. The performance of Cream at their age was just amazing and the sound quality is the best I've ever heard on a music DVD. No matter what kind of music you like, this will surely grow on you. It's the sheer brilliance of their performance that will show you again and again. Even the new musicians don't cut mustard these days, like these old rockers do.
