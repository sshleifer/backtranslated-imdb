Having reviewed some of the other comments here, I have a major complaint with this presentation. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are attractive in their own way - the beautiful "victim" and the beautiful, obviously extremely "off-center", the protagonist of the blue collar (if really short of "totally unbalanced") ") - in turn they fight each other, a kind of Caucasian Kabuki scenario. <br /> <br /> Okay, and this is, of course, mainly a" ring-around "story, however, my complaint reference is that I believe the director was trapped in his desire to show Farrah's well-known and obvious physical attributes, starting with the fact that she is attractively dressed in a thin dress and with a number of scenes that show more than the necessary for any dramatic effect - while immensely pleasing to the eye, these distract from the intensity level of the drama. <br /> <br /> His roommates are certain that they give performances as written and directed - however, their respective skepticism and Histrionic and Singhiozzan blame you, don't sound real - based on Farrah's previous experience with this guy, the obvious proof that he came to their premises with only the worst intentions, and that you would have absolutely no reason to exaggerate what happened. <br /> <br /> But this is a compelling film and story, despite, because of, the director's work.
