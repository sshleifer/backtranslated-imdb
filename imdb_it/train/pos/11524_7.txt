This is a bizarre little movie, and I have to admit that there is also some eccentric acting. <br /> <br /> It follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous Las Vegas illusionist, and in part is following his dream, partly about the dreams of others, and all about the travails of the show. I thought the film was fascinating, and it has a moment or two of real magic that makes all the value. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is as fantastic as the magician who never was, and Max's mentoring makes him a fun and touching relationship. <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, probably, but if you like movies about traveling, I think you'll like this.
