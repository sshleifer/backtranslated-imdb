Alain Chabat is a good actor, writer and director, but maybe a little misguided to take a credit for an 'idea' for a story that probably made them roll down the corridors when Aristophanes was still learning that it's' I 'before' and 'except after' c '. But, as I said, Chabat is a good actor and can charm when he needs it. I am also gradually overcoming the aversion for Charlotte Gainsbourg which also turns into an accomplished performance. If you absolutely insist on knowing it, the "plot" is that of the boy who is forty and is satisfied with being single. This does not go well with his mother and his five sisters and to get them off he makes an 'agreement' with a colleague's sister to pose - for fifteen thousand euros - as his new girlfriend, to allow the romance to come enjoyment with a marriage and then shakes it, thus lifting it. Of course they end up together, but along the way there are some sub-Benedek and Beatrice who are dueling and all in all it is a nice painless minute and performs so well at the French box office that a sequel might not be out of the question.
