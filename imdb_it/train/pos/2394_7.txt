Beautiful, pleasant and fun, but not overwhelming. It does a good job of showing the world of behind-the-scenes theater groups and the lives of the actors. The three witches are fantastic - both on and off stage. I imagine the film works wonderfully (a lot of apparent talk) if you are involved in the theater (which I am not).
