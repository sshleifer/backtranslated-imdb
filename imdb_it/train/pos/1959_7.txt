Let me stay in front, I like the mush. However, it is like one of these "easier dives" that you see at the Olympics. It must be noted a little because it is easier to give an economic thrill than to drag yourself into the world of, say, a painter of the late Middle Ages. <br /> <br /> This is just a two-hour ghost train journey and while often (or more exactly, most of the time!) ridiculous and unlikely it always goes on and always entertains. If not always the right way. Take a look at the memorable quotes section for a chuckle. <br /> <br /> (However, because he was assigned a "worst movie", Razzie is disconcerting - I bet there were a thousand worst movies made in 2006, but this film got the treatment because it was seen as a fashionable victim.) <br /> <br /> Head case and popular novelist Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) ended up in London writing a novel, but death and destruction follow her like flies follow a horse during a warm climate. God, he can't even visit the toilet without tripping over at least two bodies, and I'm sure if he opened the closet in his vast attic apartment he would come out in big Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is clearly a very dangerous woman who goes around (if your pulse is above zero), but is she personally responsible? I mean, why would anyone put together two and start thinking that he might be a murderer? Likewise, his reaction to these accusations seems very casual. However, is it just a personality disorder (some form of b / s risk addiction) or further evidence of his guilt? <br /> <br /> For reasons that I cannot fully understand or explain, Stone is assigned to the psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) for evaluation rather than throwing down the cells following another "lover found dead in mysterious circumstances". Fortunately (for Stone) he is much more crazy than all his patients and has a problematic home / work life. In a blink of an eye the relationship changes from one doctor to another and therefore it is difficult to say because everything becomes something of a revolving blur. <br /> <br /> In this heady mix comes Roy Washburn (a strange Welshman playing David Thewlis) who tells the striking doctor love - in his capacity as a policeman of many years standing - that the woman in question could be dangerous . I mean, keep the first page. However, Glass now has eyes too glassy to make it or cure it. Like a dizzy boxer in front of Mike Tyson in prime time, he is ready for the big take-down, but not before discovering that Washburn could have a secret or two himself. <br /> <br /> Millena Gardosh (Charlotte Rampling) arrives a fellow psychiatrist and a rare example (in this film) of someone who is not barking crazy or a suspect in murder. Assuming that he actually watched the finished film, he must look back with nostalgia when his underwear came off with Stone's ease - fortunately (at least for us) those days are far away. Strangely, she doesn't think Stone is as dangerous as anyone else - or she doesn't think the script is good enough or her check big enough to do adequate acting. <br /> <br /> After several laps of the track roughly outlined above it comes to a climax that mixes the provincial representative with a cliff-hanger / twist, which despite being as farcical as the rest of the film, offers us enough space for the Basic Instinct 3 - highly unlikely to be at this point in time.
