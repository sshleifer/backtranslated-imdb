Although the style of this film is not as simple and realistic as a sound version probably would have been, this is still a great film. In fact, he was seen as an excellent film in his day, as he was nominated for the first Oscar for best film (losing to WINGS). I still consider WINGS a superior film, but this is excellent despite some exaggeration on the part of the protagonist, Emil Jannings. <br /> <br /> Jannings is a general from Tsarist Russia who is living his last days earning some dollars in the Twenties by becoming an extra Hollywood. His fortune seems to have changed as he receives a casting call - to play an imperial Russian general who fights against the communists during the revolution. Of course this is not the best for acting, but it also leads the old to think about the old days and the revolution. <br /> <br /> Exactly what will happen after I leave you, but it's a pretty good movie, especially at the end. By the way, look for William Powell as a Russian director. Although it was created in 1928, with makeup it doesn't look much younger than it did in many of its later films.
