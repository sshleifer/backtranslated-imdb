This is one of those movies that make trailers better than feature films. The concept was really beautiful and different, the humor was unique, I just heard that there were missed opportunities to put the "punch" in this movie. So many lines and gags have been hanging too long, without a definite ending and actually they didn't let me laugh. Wilson, Wilson, Farris and Thurman were fantastic. Wanda Sykes was underutilized in this film and needed more exposure and more opportunities to make her character run longer on screen. 7 out of 10 for me, more than a DVD rental. Also, I was looking for some sort of good quality music video during the credits, something that became something of a trademark for these romantic comedy films, at the Something About Mary, Meet the Parents but, once again, I was left feeling a little cheated by the fact that this could have been a much better movie with a little more music and punch punch lines. It looked like it was RUSHED in theaters.
