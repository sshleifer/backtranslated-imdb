Half a dozen stories of various interest illuminate us about life in Finland. These stories are intertwined and each contains a scene where a sonic boom is heard. This indicates that the events depicted occur simultaneously. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a bungy jump that promises a bit of excitement, but the first few stories are pretty sparse. The film improves so much. Two marriages broken into the stories that follow provide a lot of drama while a scene in a hospital gives us a terminally ill patient who begs for pain relief. The last moments with his wife are convincing and moving. <br /> <br /> While the various scenes of family life take place in Finland, the themes are of a general nature wherever you live to live. <br /> <br /> The story collections are rarely as satisfying as a good 90-minute drama.
