Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) in his FBI office. He claims to have information on a serial killer pursued by the FBI. When Agent Doyle arrives at the office, he tells him that the serial killer is really his dead brother. Agent Doyle requires some evidence and the man tells the story of his life, since his childhood. They were a simple family of three: his widowed father Meiks (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night, his father brings the two brothers together and tells them that an angel of God has just visited him and assigned his family to destroy the demons. What happens next is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie four months ago on VHS, and yesterday I looked again, now on DVD. Despite being a low-budget film, the script is sharp, without flaws. The cast is great, but I'd like to highlight Matt O'Leary's performance as young Felton. It is a very difficult and complex role that must be played by a young teenager. Bill Paxton's direction is remarkable. There is no explicit violence in this horror movie. A great debut behind the camera. I regret the Brazilian title of this film: "A Mão do Diabo" (The Devil's Hand). If at least it was "The hand of God", it could be acceptable. But to call this film "the hand of the devil" is really ridiculous. Brent Hanley, the screenwriter, did not deserve such a lack of respect from the Brazilian distributor. This film is highly recommended. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mão do Diabo" ("The devil's hand")
