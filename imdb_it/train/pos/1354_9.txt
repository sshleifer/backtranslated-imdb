For people interested in business and the corporate world, this show is simply the best of the best. As one of the show's former competitors, he wrote in his blog about this innovative show: People in business has finally had an audience. The whole idea is perfect; have a group of businessmen competing with each other in business-related activities, set in the best place in the world, New York City. Donald Trump is perfect as the leader, even though his ego is bigger than the entire universe, multiplied by infinity. It also takes many questionable decisions about who to shoot, which is one of the downsides of the show. <br /> <br /> Season 1: Great season in general, the best season of the "normal" ones. This season was the one that most concerned the real business skills. Later the series is almost drowned in marketing activities with too many product placements. Big and interesting competitors in general, with the funniest character ever in this series: Troy. I know I'm not the only person who suspects that the Trump World Tower episode, in which he was fired, was rigged for Amy and Nick to win this particular task. <br /> <br /> Season 2: Even a great season. The tasks were still quite OK, and had many interesting competitors. Jen M was terrible and should never have reached the final, IMO. Also, this season has had the worst shooting ever (Pamela). <br /> <br /> Season 3: Terrible. In fact, I liked the concept of intelligence in the book against street intelligence, but the cast was so terribly terrible (it turned out that Trump also hated the cast) that the whole season was a total disaster. The best moments were the second episode (a motel renovation), with PM Brian fired, a guy who added nothing but huge amounts of comic value. <br /> <br /> Season 4: An excellent season, very interesting and fun competitors this season (especially Randall, Alla, Marcus and the total disaster whose name was Toral). The episode "Get me out in the meeting room" is one of the absolute classics of this show, ending with the well-known quadruple ignition. Unfortunately, I think we were robbed for the Randall against the final. Trump feared he could win and prevented it from happening. <br /> <br /> Season 5: A boring season without really anything special. Brent was just an embarrassment and obviously just there to create drama. The tasks were terrible overall (how come you create a jingle whatever has to do with the business?). I guess the best man won, but personally I couldn't care less. <br /> <br /> Season 6: I understand why they wanted to try LA as a new location for the show, but looking back was a mistake. New York will always be the right place for this. This season has added so many new things, most of them terrible (like losing the team that has to sleep out in tents, winning PM continues to be PM, for example). The tasks were terrible and Trump also chose the wrong winner. James deserved it, no doubt. <br /> <br /> Season 7: Celebrity edition. The best season ever. Completely different rules (like the use of rolodex), but all the fun and entertainment. The biggest problem was that many of the competitors were not real celebrities at all, especially the women where everyone was a stranger, except for Omarosa, who is a total dishonor for everything he takes part in. It seemed to be Gene Simmon's season, but after making himself completely ridiculous during Kodak's task, another man emerged from the shadows: Piers Morgan. No one has ever dominated a season like he did. He crushed his opponents and even ran into a guy with a great sense of humor (although some grueling Americans (not all Americans, of course, don't mind me) unfortunately didn't have the social skills to understand it. TO GO PIERS !! <br /> <br /> For fans of this I highly recommend the English version starring Sir Alan Sugar as a leader. In fact, the English version is definitely better, and this says something since the American (and original) is really a great show. One thing about the English version is that competitors normally tend to behave like decent humans in the boardroom, unlike the constant screaming and rude behavior that occurs in the American version.
