This is an almost action-free film that follows Jack, an insomniac, as he crosses hallucinations, is visited by dead friends, throws himself from a building and, most of the time, cannot tell the reality from the hallucination. br /> <br /> Dominic Monaghan, like Jack, is really believable. Confused, frightened but lethargic and, by accepting at first sight what he sees, we follow him trying to understand what he is seeing and finding a way to sleep. <br /> <br /> Present a talking dog (another hallucination) and children who suddenly appear in Jack's bathroom and bedroom with no explanation as to how they got there (more hallucinations) and you have a interesting, shocking, 43 minutes And the shower scene is enough to make any Dom fan come back.
