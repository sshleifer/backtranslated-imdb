Don't listen to fuddy-duddy critics about this, this is a gem! The rich young Joan and her brother find themselves penniless after their father's death - and now they have to work to live! She, of course, becomes a reporter, and he, just as naturally, a driver for the crowd! With wild coincidence, their careers meet, thanks to the gangster Clark Gable. In the meantime there is the possibility for a swim of moonlight underwear for a group of pretty young things and for Joan to do a couple of daring dance numbers (with all the grace of a steam shovel). <br /> <br /> But none of these should be taken seriously - it's all very fun from those wonderful pre-code days, when Hollywood was really bad. Joan looks good and shows much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity (thank God she stopped the dance!). Gable is notable as a slimy gangster - he wasn't a star yet and so he didn't have to be the hero. Nice to see him play something different. And William Bakewell is as excellent as the poor confused brother. And there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director Harry Beaumont, who carries the piece in a decreasing pace - and an occasional wink to the audience! Great fun!
