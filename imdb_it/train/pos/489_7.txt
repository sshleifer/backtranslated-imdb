Coming home after the movie, I was humming the familiar waltz music that Natalia and Alexandre were dancing. I heard it before - where? Ah, from "Eyes Wide Shut" by Kubrick (track 2), "I understood just when I arrived at the door. It is" Waltz No. 2 by Jazz Suite No. 2 "composed by Dimitri Shostakovich, played here by the City of Prague Philharmonic "Orchestra. Yes, I went to get the soundtrack from Tower's. How wonderful! The soundtrack of Alexandre Desplat was rewarding: there are fifteen tracks plus two tracks of the delightful waltz. It is not often these days that you get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a complete soundtrack, it reminds me of the favorite scores of Maurice Jarre, Ennio Morricone (the initial notes of the song 6 have traces of "Nuovo cinema Paradiso"), Georges Delerue and John Barry. arcs, from the sky blue, from the piano and from the harp. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and John Turturro offered a matched performance that consumes credibly.The love story, their intimate connection, is very much understood by Alexandre and Na talia - her childish but tormented inner world, and her generous and bold understanding of him - a relationship only for both. The director Marleen Gorris of "Antonia's Line" (Best film in foreign language of the United States of America in 1996, Dutch film) gave us a silent and sensitive film, not without disquieting human conflicts, intrigues, obsessions, family efforts, kindness and respect. The front-end subject is the mental game and the mathematical logic of chess. Below it can be a mere tear of a drama set in the late 1920s. Cinematography captures the serene beauty of Lake Como in northern Italy near the Swiss border. I highly recommend the soundtrack if you don't feel like going to the movies. The soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat of "La defense of Luzhin" is complete.
