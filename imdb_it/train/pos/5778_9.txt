Despite its budget limitations, this is a great film, proof that effort and imagination can overcome the lack of money. The opening, in which the cave paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs have at least survived into the era of human beings, is a beautiful false trail. After that, a meteor descends into a lake and causes heat which, in turn, causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg (perhaps cave paintings suggest instead that this is not the first time such a thing happens) . When the prehistoric beast appears, it is a well-animated plesiosaur that is rapidly causing disappearances in the area. Well, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still real entertainment for monster movie fans.
