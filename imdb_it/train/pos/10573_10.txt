An excellent example of the spectacular Busby Berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930s. The public must have been very surprised to see James Cagney in this type of vehicle. A nice contrast to his "public enemy" 2 years earlier. Cagney adds spark and interest to a rather tiring storyline and molded plot. But the highlight of the film is represented by the 3 elaborated production numbers. First with the conservative number "Honeymoon Hotel", followed by the spectacular "By A Waterfall" sequence, followed by the closing "Shanghai Lil" sequence, Cagney participates only in the last issue on a bar contrasting with Ruby Keeler. The number "Shanghai Lil" with Cagney is excellent, but a little anti-collision and after the most exciting and incredibly amazing choreography of "By A Waterfall". If I were the director, I would have inserted the number "Shanghai Lil" in the middle and close with "By A Waterfall", which blows the other 2 numbers out of the water so to speak and in my opinion the best of the 3 numbers. The 3 production numbers are the icing on the cake and the performance of James Cagney is added to the decoration. An exceptional musical result, a 4-star movie, the latest musical, it's worth watching, you won't be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
