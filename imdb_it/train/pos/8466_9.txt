Like TALK RADIO, THE BOOTH is actually a bit predictable (TALK RADIO because we know the truth of what happened, THE BOOTH because - let's face it - the genre and the basic set-up). It is not necessarily a bad thing in this case. It means, in essence, that filmmakers do not punish the way they might have, for example, an American version of this story. THE BOOTH moves inexorably towards its (discounted) conclusion, but it is so beautifully crafted at every level that you can enjoy the journey as you could do a family cruise along a well-traveled stretch of (very scenic) road. It reminds me of the ghostly tale of Harlan Ellison, FLOP SWEAT. Claustrophobia is sometimes almost palpable. It is well worth a long look.
