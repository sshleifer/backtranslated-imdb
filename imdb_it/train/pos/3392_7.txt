This was a very inspiring film, especially for 1973. At the time it was actually a huge box office success. After the 1970s it seemed to have been forgotten, but its central messages were too important to disappear completely. In reality it was at least fifteen years ahead of its time ... no one had ever heard of the greenhouse effect before 1985, and the controversial subject of euthanasia was rarely pulled out. <br /> <br /> Sets and special effects might seem a bit outdated, but at that time science fiction money was a bet. If you look closely you will see that everything usually makes sense. This is a message film, not for fans of star wars zonked out that it can't stand a minute of thought stimulation unless it contains a million dollars in explosions. <br /> <br /> This was also Hestons, the last film, the end of his famous dystopian silly trilogy. After that it was all the epics of disaster overwhelmed and the big budget crowd likes garbage. This may not be the most enjoyable of two hours of film ever made, and the ending could be disturbing and depressing, but it's difficult to find a film producer with guts that would like to address a topic like this.
