The One and only was a great movie. I had just finished watching it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I'm an independent professional wrestler, and I thought it was a good portrait of what life is like for a professional wrestler. Now this film was made 4 years before I was born, but I don't think the rigors of professional traveling wrestling have changed much. Sad, funny and all around GREAT !!! **** 10+
