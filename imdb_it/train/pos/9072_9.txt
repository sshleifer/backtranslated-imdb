I remembered it as one of my favorite books as a child and wanted to read it for a while by my 5 year old daughter. I knew the movie would be released soon, so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us the preview passes for the next day! We ran home and spent the afternoon reading the book to compare them. It was not necessary The only thing in common between the book and the film is the main name of the characters, the fact that there is a bet and a lot of worm eating. Oh yes, I almost forgot, the child who cooks most worms loves to present his masterpieces with a French accent. As children know each other, the number of children involved, how the bet is born, the number of worms that must be eaten, the time in which they must eat worms, how they are cooked, the progression of friendships, the climax scenes, etc. ., NOTHING is the same. But somehow, it didn't ruin the film for me. The characters are all funny, and the movie didn't let me down. A word of caution for the parents, there was a time when the adults in the room could be heard breathing collectively and it was then that Billy's little brother was referring to his penis as a "jerk". The embarrassing part came when my daughter kept asking those sitting around us, "Does anyone know what the fuck it is?" lol. This and an occasional "shut up" is as foul-mouthed as this film gets. My daughter thought she could get sick around worms 3 and 4 (and she had the empty nacho container in her hand just in case) but it was fine for worms 6. Both she and I really enjoyed the movie and enjoyed sharing it 'experience.
