I question someone who says he doesn't care about this movie. Some reviewers have said that it doesn't have enough action, some say it's too long, etc. Do not listen to them !!! If you like Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> The recitations are superb! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are allsuperb and Liam Neeson does an acceptable job and is a very impressive character due to his size. Cinemaphotography was brilliant and breathtaking. It is one of the few films I have seen in my life (along with Shawshank) that has been practically flawless since casting, directing, writing, acting, etc. !!! <br /> <br /> I was amazed that this was not t among the top 50 or 100 films reviewed. I felt so passionately about it that I just joined IMDB so I could let everyone know the real scoop. I saw this movie about 10 times (each time with a different person) and everyone loved it! You have to be awake and pay attention carefully for the first 30 minutes because they introduce a lot of characters in the beginning. If you have the attention that lasts longer than most of these kids who write film reviews on this site, then you'll love this movie! Come on ... all 3 Lord of the Rings movies in the top 9 and Matrix in # 32?!?! This should show you the age range of most reviewers here! <br /> <br /> This is a top 50 movie !!!
