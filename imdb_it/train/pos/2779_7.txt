"Bend It Like Beckham" might not mean much to us Americans who know very little about other football (soccer), but for English sports fans, it's equivalent to "Hit it Like Bonds" or "Dunk it Like Jordan". Every young footballer dreams of folding a soccer ball around a player and into the net for a goal, just as the famous player David Beckham does, just like the young Indian girl, Jess (Parminder Nagra), in the movie Bend It Like Beckham. Jess loves playing soccer games, the kind forbidden by the traditionalist mother. However, as she plays one day, a passing friend named Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her play and invites her to try out all the girls for a soccer team. After meeting coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), he is a team, something he knows his mother wouldn't approve of. The film is not about disobedience to parents, but rather a girl who does what she wants, even if it goes against culture, not just parents. There's humor thrown during the movie, especially when Jules's mother thinks she's a lesbian. The film uses a somewhat clich√© moment, as the great soccer game is the same as Jess's sister's wedding day, but it's not a cheese game, but rather fun and light. Soccer action looks good, so sports fans will have fun and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world, the world of football will inspire some in the audience. Bend It Like Beckham is not just a matter of football, but rather a girl trying to find herself and satisfy her parents at the same time, something that turns out to be quite difficult.
