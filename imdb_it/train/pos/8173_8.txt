The splendor of this film is that even a competent dentist is rather scary. It is one of man's primal fears. This film is the nightmare image that every child has to go through in the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly non-sluggish performance like a mad dentist I think you try to kill people, but he only works on their teeth so it's not really working. In a particularly bloody scene we find the actor so-so Earl Boen who has his teeth completely destroyed with drills and whatever, which I imagine is the absolute worst that you can do when you are a killer dentist. It is a typical situation of Brian Yuzna, not well written but there is blood. The plot is poor and sometimes it seems to be done on the spot but, hey, it's a killer dentist movie, we all thought about it but they did it first.
