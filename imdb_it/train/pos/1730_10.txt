This unseen gem marks the true story of a prisoner escape during World War II. The performances are incredible, especially Anthony Steele. The film works on many different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual and literal. The dialogue is brilliant and sounds very true. Indeed, an unusual all-round authenticity puts this head-to-head above most war poems.
