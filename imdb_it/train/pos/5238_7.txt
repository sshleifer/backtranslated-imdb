I liked Top Gun. He kept my interest. Predictable plot, decent character development and plot. It is quite similar to High Noon in that the people of the city appear weak and scared to resist a villain. This film has some quality actors who haven't really had the chance to share all their talents. Furthermore, some of the actors did not receive credit for their roles. Denver Pyle was a handsome man in his youth. John Dehner, Rod Taylor are exceptional in their roles. Sterling Hayden did the best he could with poor material. It's hard to imagine him as a gunslinger. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was a nauseating character. She seemed flattered that two men might have quarreled for her. Ugh. Finally, how can people travel without luggage? Especially women.
