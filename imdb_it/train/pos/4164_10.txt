Those childhood memories ... when things were new and we were full of curiosity about the world around us; while we took those first first steps in the long journey we call life. <br /> <br /> One of the initial memories I have had since childhood is this animated program "Galaxy Express 999", about a boy named Tetsuro, who takes a train ride around the galaxy, hoping to get a mechanical body to avenge the senseless death of his mother at the hands of mechanical hunters with a cold heart and a trophy. Accompanying Tetsuro on his journey is Maetel, a woman of exquisite golden beauty who reminds him of the mother who lost all those years ago ... <br /> <br /> Back in the early 80s, as a boy who he attended kindergarten and the first years of elementary school in Seoul, South Korea, "Galaxy Express 999" was a phenomenal animation program imported from Japan, which inspired young boys who tuned in to dream of countless adventures in their often tumultuous and exciting journey through the life that awaited them. Memories to tune in to this animated program on weekdays between 8 and 21 before going to sleep ... <br /> <br /> They were wonderful memories, never to have ... <br /> <br /> While I was moving to America, and while residing here for over 2 decades, I sometimes wondered about that time and that place, in a country thousands of miles away divided from America by a huge ocean and vast, of this childhood program, with its hit theme, and of the boy named Tetsuro, his protective companion Maetel, the enigmatic train conductor and the Galaxy Express 999 space train. <br /> <br /> Many, many years have passed ... <br /> <br /> Last summer while I was in Korea, I was able to trace a copy of the original "Galaxy Express 999" (1979) on DVD, and it brought me many nostalgic and sincere memories. "Galaxy Express 999" remains as captivating as the first time you discovered it all those years ago, opening those nostalgic memories of new discoveries, an important launching pad for young boys who have tuned themselves and embarked on the journey of their life in manhood . /> <br /> Here are the wonderful memories. "Goodbye, Maetel. Goodbye, Galaxy Express 999 ... Goodbye, to my childhood." <br /> <br /> 10/10
