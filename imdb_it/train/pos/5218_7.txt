The flock is unjustly maligned as a cheat less than "se7en". There is really no reason to compare the two, except perhaps for the similar scenario in the final showdown. <br /> <br /> Now that it is out of the question I will understand why The Flock is very interesting in some respects. It is mostly a dramatic piece rather than a full-blown thriller about a very alert social worker who controls sexual offenders. At first you can clearly see that his work got the better of him. Evident in two scenes where you first interview a violator and slap him around and the second when a woman tries to pick him up and all that comes to mind are his standard questions from his questionnaire. <br /> <br /> Gere is as good as Errol Babbage, the social worker mentioned above. His way of doing his job is no different from that of a policeman, he has a gun and constantly checks the newspapers and provides law officials with information if some of his "flocks" could be responsible for a sexual crime. He is also a person who has lost all the happiness of living and his only relief seems to come from executing his justice vigilantes on his flock. Twice you see him smile, once when he apologizes for treating his partner rudely and the other after beating a member of his flock. <br /> <br /> Like a suspense film, The Flock is not as successful. A bit confusing and with some annoying holes in the plot, but it has a series of impressive pieces. <br /> <br /> Overall The Flock is a solid drama about a man who does dehumanizing work and ultimately has to work hard to avoid being swallowed up by the abyss he has surrounded himself with. The world in which we live is a rather sick place and the further can distance us from the worst of those who are happier. The Flock crosses that point well.
