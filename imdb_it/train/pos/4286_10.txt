I saw this movie (the English title is "Who's Singing Over There?") At the 1980 Montreal International Film Festival. It won the rave then ... and it disappeared. A terrible shame. Sublime is brilliant, ridiculous, sad and extremely funny. The script is a work of art. It's been 19 years and I've only seen a handful of comedies (or any other genre, for that matter) that can match its originality.
