This is my first comment on the IMDb website, and the reason I'm writing is that we're talking about ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER! 'Ne goryuy!' it will make you laugh and cry at the same time, you will fall in love (if you are not a fan yet!) with the Georgian choir who sings the tradition, and maybe you will accept the difficulties of your own existence and you will feel good after watching :) What you most like this film is that actors in non-leading roles create vivid and memorable characters and are just as interesting and important as the central character. The film is played by Vahtang Kikabidze (which is fantastic), but in the film you will remember every single face that surrounds it. You will find yourself citing their lines, which have become household names for so many Russian-speaking people. A film to live with. Simple, but profound, you'll want to see it again and again.
