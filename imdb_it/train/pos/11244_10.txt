One of my best films ever, perhaps because I was in the punk scene in the late 1970s and went to many hazel concerts, but the film was a good plot and a great nutty acting and a success Phil Daniels not sure of his latest project Eastenders !! excellent performance of many unknown actors that if you keep your eyes open you will see them in many of the UK's soaps today exp: Carver out of the Bill, the more I look at it the more I see them, well if you haven't seen it it's still a night with the video , don't forget to pull out the safety pin for your nose and heavy black eye makeup and shave your Mochanian style head .... Enjoy
