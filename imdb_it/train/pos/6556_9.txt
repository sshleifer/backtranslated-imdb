I really enjoyed this movie. I am a single dad with a 17 year old daughter who is smart, athletic and talented. I WISH my girlfriend applied so well to solve crimes and help others! So for me, maybe this is PG Fantasyland. I read a lot of Nancy Drew books in my teenage years, a long time ago. Surely THIS character was cleverly played by Emma Roberts, but it did NOT look like the Nancy Drew I remember from books. This is due to the script, not the acting. <br /> <br /> Emma is a lovely teenager, who plays a self-confident, industrious and proud character with good manners and good taste. It is not involved in the fashionable competitiveness that surrounds it. There are some weaknesses in the plot, apart from the fact that it doesn't look like the Nancy Drew of the books, and trying to understand what decade we are in. (How, what is that CAR, anyway?) <br /> <br /> I read the IMDb overview before seeing the movie, while I was researching Rachael Leigh Cook from other films. This is not one of his best roles, but I will continue to look for his other films. Rachael was too old to play this role, but he does a great job as the adult orphan at the center of the mystery. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed in other reviews written here. Some expect a perfect connection with books, some expect more credible situations or action movies for adults. I got what I expected! Good entertainment well aimed at young teenage girls, and their fathers who want good children with high standards of conduct and achievements. This is a Teen PG movie, not James Bond! What would you like for a role model for your teenage daughter?
