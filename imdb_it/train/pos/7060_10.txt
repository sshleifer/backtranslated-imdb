Many people have commented that this film has never been as beautiful as the first one. Well, maybe it's not for you. However, how does the child react? Well, mine loved her more than the first. <br /> <br /> Disney movies from the past can sometimes be a bit harsh for small children. (For example: Bambi's mother is shot.) This film was truly exceptional for my sensitive child who loves humor and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> If you want to be snobbish about what past Disney-based standards should be - skip this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a sweet little girl or a little boy with a tender heart, you really want to please yourself, buy this movie and treat your little children. This film is as good as a good night movie for happy dreams instead of nightmares. I'm happy with a movie that my son likes and doesn't need to impress his parents all the time.
