So Mary and Rhoda have aged - who isn't? I was a teenager when Mary debuted, and a "young adult" when she left the air. Yes, it was nice to see Mary and Rho together, and yes, maybe the film didn't support the comedy of the original series, but there were enough moments that reminded the spirit of the series to make this a fitting tribute. Example: the producer who hires Mary and then dictates the idea of ​​a new series of "old men". Isn't it typical of the mentality of the current Hollywood television series and the "bean counters"? This may not be the MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW at its best - but it's pretty damn looking back at one of the best shows we've grown up with in the 1970s.
