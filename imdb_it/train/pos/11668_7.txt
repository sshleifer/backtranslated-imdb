In 1945, and after a series of solid propaganda pieces from World War II, Errol Flynn's control of the United States box office began to decline, so, despite the increase in the weight of the falling looks, he embarked on a series of movies related to the genre that first made its name: the swashbuckler. The first of these was actually one of the best - ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN (1948) - but it also turned out to be his last great Hollywood film. The rest of his days armed with swords were wandered throughout Europe: in England for KIM (1950), THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE (1953) and THE DARK AVENGER (1955), in France for ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN FABIAN (1951 ) and Italy for the abortions THE STORY OF WILLIAM TELL (1953) and the CROSSED SWORDS little seen (1954). However, Hollywood beckoned him one last time to his old seafaring ways - albeit for a modestly budgeted Universal movie rather than an A Warner Brothers production he was used to when he was at his peak ... <br / > <br /> Again, the glorious Technicolor cinematography jumps off the screen here and, while an older and floppy Flynn may look like the pale shadow of his ex-self, his red-haired ferret Maureen O'Hara has a field day as a leader of a tomboy buccaneer who in the end craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady. Anthony Quinn was still a few years away from his most important vehicles in life, so here he is typically seen as the villain - pirate captain Roc Brasilian, a role he attacks tastefully. Like THE BLACK SHIELD OF FALWORTH (1954) - a vision that preceded this - AGAINST ALL THE FLAGS brings me back to my beloved childhood days of watching TV when vintage Hollywood movies were on the agenda both on local that on the nearby Italian channels. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, this may have been the first pirate film I've ever seen and I shudder at the thought of today's generation of young people who are supposed to believe that the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN trilogy is that that is the buccaneer! As I said before, AGAINST ALL THE FLAGS might not be the best pirate yarn ever brought to the screen, but it's still a solid example of this prolific genre. Nowadays, the persevering amority of the Indian princess (Alice Kelley), similar to a child, towards her pirate Flynn may seem terribly stupid, but the rest - despite clearly not having climbed the peaks of THE SEA HAWK (1940) and THE BLACK SWAN (1942), to quote the best seafaring enterprises of its respective stars, is briskly stimulated and reasonably engaging. Incidentally, the film would later be turned into THE KING'S PIRATE (1967) with Doug McClure! <br /> <br /> For what it's worth, the unprecedented box office success of that unfortunate modern franchise is most likely the one that prompted film studios reluctant to dust off their titles of cataloging bravado and publish them on DVD and, in fact, AGAINST ALL THE FLAGS was in itself a gem in a "Collection of pirate films of the golden age" badly studied by Universal which also consisted of obscure slag like BUCCANEER'S GIRL (1950, with Yvonne De Carlo), DOULE CROSSBONES (1951; with Donald O'Connor) and YANKEE BUCCANEER (1952, with Jeff Chandler)! Value for money, perhaps, but, so far, I've only acquired the movie Errol Flynn from other sources; even so, if the mood strikes me in the future, I might want to get my hands on such marine adventures as MUTINY (1952) by Edward Dmytyk, the nickname YANKEE BUCCANEER and PIRATES OF TORTUGA (1961).
