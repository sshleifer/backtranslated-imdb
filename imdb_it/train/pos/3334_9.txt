I really enjoyed this movie because I have a husband just like the guy in this movie. This movie is about Lindsey meeting Ben in the middle of winter when the baseball season is not in. He falls in love but when spring comes, he gets the shock of his life when a step is placed lower on his pedestal than Ben put it on. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie with all the obsession for Ben's baseball. He cannot be separated from what he loves most, this is what makes him so funny and why so many women can relate to Lindsey in real life. Even the people you sit with at baseball games are as obsessed as he is. <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie and you won't be scolded if you hire this.
