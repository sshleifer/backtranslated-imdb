As for films about parody, there are few that are worth the time and energy. but with the recent resurgence of hideous parodies like Date Movie and The Comebacks, it's a breath of fresh air to come back and rediscover a really funny farce like Johnny Dangerously. <br /> <br /> After his mother has no medical problems, little Johnny goes to work for the crowd. What comes in is a series of gags, most of which work, but there are, however, occasional flops. But a foreign gangster who can't master the American language (at least wise, at least), a rival gangster with a weakness to break his mouth (... once!), A younger brother with D.A. who's out to get Johhny Dangerously, and a hot young actress for his affections has Johnny busy. <br /> <br /> And the spectator will be busy laughing, for the most part, as every clich√© of gangster movies is skewered by a talented cast and decent writing. <br /> <br /> Not perfect for a long shot, but certainly good for a smile on a bad day.
