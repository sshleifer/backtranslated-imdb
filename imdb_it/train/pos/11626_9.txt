This is an excellent and fast thriller by Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street), which for 85 minutes leaves the supernatural aside and presents us with something even more terrifying: the evil of human beings. We are more likely to encounter the benevolent villain of Jackson Rippner than Freddy Kruger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) has an excellent job in presenting a sociable, friendly and even charismatic killer. The performances of Murphy and Rachel McAdams (Claire, by The Wedding Crashers) are exceptional. Most of the film takes place at a very intimate level, between two people, their eyes, their faces. This is a small-scale action, not the vast overview of the canvas, and is no less convincing due to these limitations. Cinematography is nothing special, although obviously you can do so much with a camera in the confines of a passenger plane, but the dialogue is excellent, the plot is tense. There are no distractions, no subplots confuse the problem that is at the center of a battle between the main characters. Keeping his concentration and avoiding distractions, Wes Craven is able to take what is a very minimal plot and turn it into an exciting action-packed thriller.
