Ettore Scola, one of the most refined and grandiose directors that we have worldly citizens, is not yet available on DVD ... (it is the summer of 2001 right now ...). Mysteries to watch out of your mind. <br /> <br /> This great classic is back in the theaters of my hometown thanks to a Sophia Loren - summer-retrospective, and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of watching on a video tape ... it is a true gift. <br /> <br /> To avoid a criticism, but still try to prove a point: I took my reluctant younger brother with me to watch this movie. He has never seen the film before and "he doesn't like those Italian Oldies ..." Like everyone else in the theater, he was intrigued by this wonder. Even during the closing credits, the theater remained completely silent. <br /> <br /> This SPECIAL DAY is really special. A marvel of refinement. And a big loss if you haven't seen it yet (yet) ...
