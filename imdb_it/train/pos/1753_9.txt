As we all know, the subgenre of sexual comedies is rather crowded. Being simply overly vulgar is no longer enough. I've seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sexual comedy really needs to have other positive points to attract me these days. <br /> <br /> Entering the Virgin of 40 years I knew practically what to expect; After all, I saw the advertisements; "It is true that if you don't use it, will you lose it?" What I didn't expect to find is a heart and sincere attempts at character development. There are still the funny "off-the-wall" characters that we see so much in Adam Sandler's movies and there is still enough inappropriate language to sink Noah's Ark but somehow the film has a noteworthy love story and yes also a message. <br /> <br /> The main character Andy is (unfortunately for me) a person I can relate to. In the first shot I see that he also shares my love for the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he has a poster for the film on his wall) and throughout the film we see his collection of really clean antiques. Andy also has many video games and a practical knowledge of film and technology. Andy doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. The most important thing of all; Andy is a good person, he doesn't swear and respects women so much that he keeps away from them. Combine all these factors and everyone starts thinking that he is a serial killer. It's like my life story. <br /> <br /> The other characters have little funny stories to accompany their somewhat exaggerated personalities and they all work at a certain level but not in the way Andy does. I felt that in a sense it was a kind of distraction since Andy and his girlfriend Trish are really the only truly human characters in the whole movie. I suppose, since I mentioned a flaw, I could also bring the other obvious to light. The story is intelligent but too predictable and as far as novels are concerned; it's quite simple. He deals with Andy's relationship with Trish for a long time and we all know what will happen in the end. Of course, his final deviation is a little different from what we might expect, but you know what will happen in the end, and I assure you he does. These are definitely small spots on the film, but there is so much here that I can easily ignore that they are few flaws. <br /> <br /> When I say "good" I mean "evil", of course. This is a sexual comedy and wants to be bad. For the most part I think he succeeded. There are so many hilarious scenes like Andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with Trish. Or the scene where Andy goes with Trish's daughter to a sex education class where he ends up asking more questions than anyone else. Ah and we must not forget the next sequence of classic waxing "Ooh! Como se llama!" An interesting little note about that scene; actor Steve Carell actually had his belly waxed and the pain shown is real. Obviously they only made one, but it was still a very brave thing on his part. <br /> <br /> Actually, since we are talking about Steve Carell, I would like to say that he has now grown up on my list of respected comedians which is a bit strange since I didn't even know who he was before he saw this movie. I was so impressed with his writing, acting and timing that now I really want to keep an eye on his future roles. This man has talent. The 40-year-old virgin proves it. <br /> <br /> To be honest I had doubts about this film, but the first words were positive and I knew it was something I would eventually see. I'm glad I did it because it's probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and it doubles as something you think is worth watching. It's not simply a series of sexual gags piled together, but it's a series of sexual gags intertwined with a very useful character and a truly moving love story. Now excuse me while I'm going to throw up my guts; I can't believe I just wrote it ... <br /> <br /> My review of Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin
