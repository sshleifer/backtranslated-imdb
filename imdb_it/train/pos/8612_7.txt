I completely disagree with the other comments posted on this film. For example, the film is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character, then as "Hollywood" he could simply insert a gay character into the film. And then there were two gay characters and I thought they reflected each other. One was normal and the other was more feminine but was not an exaggeration. And Diane Keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other review had the decency to watch the whole movie she would see that her character developed through the film interacting with the other characters. For example, when she and Adam went to see the car that Sara crashed into the dump, you could see her mother's side coming out and later in the movie you saw that she was invincible too. But I guess if you're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed, then this movie is bad. But if you are more open-minded and don't really know that you have any idea of ​​what is good, then you will like this movie.
