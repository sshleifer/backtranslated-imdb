"Film noir" is an abused expression when it comes to describing films. Every dramatic film seems to be a "noir". But "Where the Sidewalk Ends" is really a good example of what gender is. <br /> <br /> Very briefly, an overzealous detective (Andrews) accidentally kills a no-goodnik who works for the mobsters. The murder is attributed to the father (Tom Tully) of a woman whom Andrews meets and falls in love with (Tierney). To save Dad from Old Sparky, Andrews captures the rest of the crowd and turns into him. <br /> <br /> The morally guilty policeman is driven by impulses from the past. His father was a thief who was killed while trying to shoot out of prison. But this does not justify his actions after accidentally eliminating the no-goodnik in self-defense. He immediately goes to the phone to report the incident but hesitates. He's already in hot water with the department and this could end his career. Then, at the wrong time, the phone rings. He is Andrews's partner and Andrews tells him that the suspicion they are following is not at home. He hides the body and later gets rid of it by letting a guardian escape and throwing the corpse into the river. <br /> <br /> What motivates a guy to do something so stupid? All right. His work was at risk. But now he has committed more crimes. At least I think they must be multiples. I counted the obstruction of justice, aggression, the elimination of a body without permission, the quarrel, the dirtiness of the first degree and the false testimony against his neighbor. <br /> <br /> In the end, we don't know if it's root for Andrews or not. The suspect didn't deserve to die, true, but after all it was an accident because Andrews didn't know he was a war hero and "he had a silver platter on his head". Perhaps it is that kind of ambiguity that has made noir what it was, among other things like characteristic lighting. If noir involved nothing more than black and white photography, murderers, criminals, mysteries and suspicious women, then we should include all of Charlie Chan's films under that heading. <br /> <br /> Andrews is pretty good. It's a kind of Mark MacPherson (from "Laura") that has become bitter. He never laughs, and rarely smiles, even sitting on a Gene Tierney restaurant table, a situation that could cause smiles in many men. It has no sense of humor at all. His few lines are put down. When he puts a stoolie in a taxi and the stoolie says "Careful, I almost hit my head", Andrews's answer is "Okay, the taxi is insured". Andrews may seem at times a bit of wood, but this is a role that requires stubborn determination and without humor and handles it well. Its subtitling is perfect for the part. Small spasms or beats project his thoughts and emotional states. And I imagine the director, Otto Preminger, prevented him from pronouncing the bullet as "BOO-let" and police as "POE lice". I could never make a decision about Gene Tierney. It's fine in the role of Tom Tully's daughter, a model, but she's like Marilyn Monroe in the sense that you can't separate the mannerisms adopted by true personality traits. Did Tierney really have such an innocent and almost holy character? When he answered the phone at home, does his voice have the same quality of singer he has on the screen? Poor Tierney has gone through some nasty psychiatric things before there were effective drugs for bipolar disorder. And also Andrews, a good boy, even if it seems to have been, slipped into alcoholism before finally recovering and making public service announcements. <br /> <br /> Peter Muller's commentary on DVD is unpretentious, informative and sometimes amusing. /> <br /> However, this is a good film and a good example of a noir film. The good guys aren't all good, even if the bad guys are all bad. Perhaps that ambiguity is what makes it a movie for adults instead of a popcorn movie. For children, a single shot is fired at the screen and no one's head explodes. Sorry.
