In the late 1980s, Warren Beatty created and interpreted the literary epic Reds on the foundation of the Soviet Union seen through the eyes of the radical iconoclast John Reed. It was a profound film both entertaining and with a message presented by a cast of famous actors. At the end of the decade, Warren Beatty created another kind of epic in Dick Tracy that doesn't claim to be anything other than entertainment with a bunch of top actors around having a lot of fun with makeup. br /> <br /> That both Reds and Dick Tracy can come from the same individual, speaks closely of the range that this man has as a player. In this film, Beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in an original script. The big city gangster, Big Boy Caprice, is making a move to really eliminate the competition. The film opens with him rubbing Lips Manlis' henchmen in a massacre shoot-out of Valentine's Day and then Lips himself with a cement overcoat. But Caprice's moves are making him a target for Tracy. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a third mysterious and faceless individual is trying to overthrow Caprice himself. Will our hero solve this big crime? <br /> <br /> The fun spirit of this movie is really contagious. When people like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, William Forsythe, R.G. Armstrong is brazenly invented to resemble the comic book creations of the sheet music writer Chester Gould and then allows himself a carving exercise of the largest slice of ham, you must love this film. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but any of these guys could have, it's just that Pacino as Big Boy Caprice has the longest screen time. Only Beatty sounds it completely straight, the others all seem to play outside him. Dick Tracy won the Oscar for best art and set design, best song written by Stephen Sondheim and presented by Madonna, Sooner Or Later. The fact that he was even able to convince someone like Sondheim to write a soundtrack for this film only shows that Sondheim wanted to enter the fun. As for Madonna, the Material Girl does more than anything with acting heavyweights like Breathless Mahoney. <br /> <br /> Before this film, the films of Dick Tracy were handed over to photos of B and worse on Saturday afternoon series The only thing that rivals this extravagance of all the stars is a radio broadcast made for the Armed Forces Radio during the Second World War that came to vinyl. Can you believe a cast like Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan and the Andrews Sisters? Try to find a recording of that jewel. <br /> <br /> Until then the classic Warren Beatty comics for the big screen will be fine.
