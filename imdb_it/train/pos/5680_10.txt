Holy sucks, it's so hysterical! Why are American comedies not written this way? For anyone who thinks comedy has to be stupid, in the six episodes of this series there are more intelligence and intelligence than in a shelf of novels! Hugh Laurie is a blast. I couldn't believe he was the same boy as House! There are so many great lines and gags in this series that you can watch every show dozens of times and always shoot new things every time. Rowan Atkinson is as exhilarating as the verboso and takes care of the butler Edmund. This is my favorite of all Blackadder series. And Tony Robinson is wonderful as always the slightly obtuse heart of the series, "the oppressed mass" Baldrick. Some of my favorite phrases: "When someone makes you uncomfortable with a Wellington he really sets foot in it" and Baldrick explains how he got his name and cousin Macadder "the best kipper seller" and the Scottish homicidal swordsman.
