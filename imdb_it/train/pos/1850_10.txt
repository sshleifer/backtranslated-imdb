This is my favorite EVER movie. I watched it at least 10 times and I cry every time. My family begs me not to look at it so I won't have a cry. I think I love that it's a true story written by Antwone himself as much as I love the movie. The acting is top notch, and the actors were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie I've done so far. I took care of a child who was also born in prison. He was the most precious child I had ever met. He has now been adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years. I saw this movie while the fight was still going on and his future wasn't sure and I'm so happy that he's safe and loved. And I'm so happy that Antwone is happy and has found his family. <br /> <br /> I would like to know more about him and how he has been since he met his family. I can't say enough good things !!
