This is a wonderful film about a brothel in a fishing village, which could best be described with the constellations and direction of Kurosawa's old works, combined with Dostoevsky's themes on human psychology (O-shin - Sonia Marmeladova), the drama of Shakespeare and Hans Christian Andersen's tragic and cheerful. The script is wonderful, the scenes are colorful and beautiful, some scenes remain etched in my mind. The plot is interesting and unpredictable - each of the characters is very well developed and interesting - there is also a bit of action, so if you don't like all the feelings, you will also come at your expense -. These are not the mysterious Geishas and the proud Samurai with their Bushido that is pouring them all out, but of life, work and types of people that are everywhere at any time. A charming and charming tribute to Kurosawa, certainly to be seen.
