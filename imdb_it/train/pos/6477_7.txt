'Five Days' was published as something special, a criminal drama consisting of a series of episodes, each set on a particular day of a police investigation. But in reality, this element of the story turns out to be rather less significant than one might think initially, since the fact that the action in each episode is limited to 24 hours is barely perceptible and very little distinguishes the program from countless other crime stories . In fact one almost can't help making comparisons with the latest "Prime Suspect", as one of the sub-plot focuses on a cynical cop approaching retirement: and it's not just the absence of Helen Mirren that makes the unfavorable comparisons. There is a lot of overwhelming overlays, manipulative music and a series of seemingly artificial characters so that everyone is somehow likable, in another suspect. And it is possible to guess the culprit long before the end, not because of the internal dynamics of the story, but rather for the construction of the drama as a whole: certain things must be true, to justify the way the series focuses on certain characters at certain times. Despite these flaws, the series grew on me: in the end, I was pretty taken. But it is a sad sign that the BBC, which once did "The Singing Detective", boasted of "perhaps the best drama of the year": because here there is little true originality and the statement reveals a lack of ambition which is terribly disappointing. "Five days" is actually not rubbish; but it is formidable, and it is hoped that the best that the BBC had to offer would be something a little more innovative and fresh.
