This film is about subtlety and the difficulty of navigating the ever-changing limits of customs, racial relations and desire. Of course, it's not a movie for everyone. There are no car chases, no exploding buildings, no murders. The drama lies in the tension suggested by looks, minimal gestures, spatial boundaries, illumination and things left - sometimes very apparently - unspoken. It concerns identity, memory, community, belonging. The different parts of the film work together to strengthen the leitmotifs of self and others, identity, desire, limits and losses. It will reward the attentive and sensitive spectator. Will be sorry to those whose palates require an explosive, massive and spicy action. It's a wonderfully filmed human story. That's all.
