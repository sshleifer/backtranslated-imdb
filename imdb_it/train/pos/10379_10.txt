Plato's race is a fun movie with Gary Busey.it is a fairly unknown film, so I saw it in a boot I thought it was funny. Gary Busey plays Plato Smith a tough mercenary framed for the murder of a powerful Cuban crime lord now on the run Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by Steve Bauer (scarface) and the action star Jeff Speaksman (the expert). what I liked about Plato's race was the way the film never got boring, but the acting was fun to watch and the action was pretty fun, especially the climax Gary Busey makes a good ironic hero from the moment who normally plays the bad guy and Steve Bauer is as good as Plato's partner Jeff Speaksman also does a good performance and he can't even act well to finish Plato's film is a nice effort from film images and I give 7 out of 10
