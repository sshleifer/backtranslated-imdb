Scott is right. The best duel with the 2-person sword ever staged is in the middle of this movie. The sword fights with multiple fighters are not the best, though quite good. However, the fight in the middle is the best even compared to Japanese samurai films. The Chinese sword scenes in my opinion have never outstripped the Japanese in terms of entertainment value. Especially in scenes where a boy has to fight a group of enemies, Japanese films excel, for example the Lone Wolf and Cub series. Even if the duels in Japanese cinema last only a few seconds or a minute at the most, the intensity of those moments made them better. But this is an example in which the Chinese sword exceeds the Japanese. The scene in the middle of this film was a five minute fight with the most amazing choreography ever. The other fights in this movie are also good, but even if they suck, this movie would get a 7 for that scene. If you haven't seen it, you have to. John Woo is the man.
