this was a fabulous adaptation of Jane Eyre. the only problem I had was that I didn't like Zelah Clarke. I thought she was too old and Jane seemed very shy. in the book Jane seemed a much stronger character. I was really annoyed by his portrait. the part where he is the morning after Rochester asks her to marry him and she runs to him and always hugs him makes me laugh. I think they made a wrong choice in launching it. but Dalton was absolutely as wonderful as Rochester. makes this version of Jane Eyre worth seeing. another thing that made this version not entirely 100% was the quality of the film. I know it was made for TV in the 1980s. if it was a feature film and a better quality, it would have been perfect. my main complaint, however, is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old.
