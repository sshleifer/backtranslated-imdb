I have just finished watching the first record in a collection of 4 discs (26 episodes) created in collaboration with the UCLA Film & Television Archive (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (apart from the 1st episode), the image quality is quite good. The DVD box is shown on the title page here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" is as fascinating as when I first saw him (5 years at the time) and Wally Cox is really captivating in this role. If you're in the mood for a silent comedy that secretly takes you, instead of hitting your head, you'll appreciate this chance to try all the wonderful characters you could remember from your childhood. Although some of the gags are a bit trivial, most are ingenious and well executed ... and even the sweetest ones are fun. This is a TV series that lives up to my early childhood memories.
