Being the prototype of the classic adventure film Errol Flynn and having a good story, as well as two brilliant co-stars in Maureen O'Hara (how exquisite beauty!) And Anthony Quinn, I can only recommend this movie to everyone who also has the least taste for romance and adventure. <br /> <br /> Hollywood at its best!
