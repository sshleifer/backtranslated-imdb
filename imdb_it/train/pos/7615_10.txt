This show is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever seen on television. I mean, acting is great, suspense, drama, comedy, it has it all, and with such a simple story: an airplane crashed on an island. The characters are fantastic and Evangeline Lilly is HOT !!!!!! Matthew Fox shows us once again which great actor he is, Josh Holloway is so great, Jorge Garcia is fun, I could go on forever. Also, unexpected twists, the back stories of the characters, the music that is at the end of each episode. J.J. Abrahms has once again proved to be an excellent writer and producer. I mean, this is better than ALIAS, and I loved ALIAS. Anyone who is not watching this show should definitely consider taking DVDs and watching them, because they lack something exceptional. This show could be the best show in the history of television !!
