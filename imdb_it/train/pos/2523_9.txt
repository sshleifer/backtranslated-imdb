When I first heard of Moon Child, I thought it was a joke. After a few months, I thought it was true. The few reviews I read that WERE NOT made screaming of fangirls were not very promising. <br /> <br /> When I was given the opportunity to watch it, I was completely ready to moan, to wince, and in any case I had to close my eyes to avoid stupidity. <br /> <br /> I was more than a little surprised, and in a positive sense. <br /> <br /> Yes, Moon Child has his moments of cheese, field and general dorkiness - I think it's practically impossible to avoid when he involves Gackt Camui, a man not known for his sanity - but all in all, it was totally pleasant. <br /> <br /> No, it is not a work of cinema genius but it is very, very heartfelt, fun, with a funny choreography, a moving soundtrack and a funny cast. I know little about Japanese cinema, so I can't really judge acting, but considering the fact that the cast was speaking an extreme language or dialect to them at one time or another and that a couple of them have almost no experience of acting, I was pretty impressed. <br /> <br /> If you can enjoy a good action movie, good drama, good comedy, watch this movie. At least rent it from when it arrives in region 1. <br /> <br /> In a side note, in this film there is a zero homosexual / homoerotic content. I haven't even seen much of a subtext. Don't let people who read too much things ruin this.
