Bring this film for what it is, not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not an epic like the original, it's more of a popcorn thriller. Visually, it's incredible. Everything else was just OK. <br /> <br /> For what it is, I think the film is fantastic, but I like everything Burton did. People need to calm down and stop acting like it's the end of the b / c world of this movie. It didn't have to be a remake, and it isn't. <br /> <br /> The ending was beautiful. . I took it as a parallel universe.
