This is a great movie. Want to know the real reasons why so many here are beating this movie? I'll tell you. In this film, you have a black criminal who outsmart a white professor. A black policeman who tells the white professor that he is wrong to defend the black criminal and that the black policeman is right, then. making the white professor look stupid. We always go down to the race. This is an excellent film. Don't pay attention to the racist. If you can understand that there are characters played by blacks in this film that outsmart the white characters, then you should have no trouble enjoying this movie. I have recommended everyone to go and watch this movie.
