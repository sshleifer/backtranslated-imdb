This is a great start for Mickey Rooney's film career. His talents show that a long career is ahead. The pursuit of cars and trucks is exciting for the 1937 era. This beginning of the Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book. Spring Byington's performance is excellent as usual. Please, Mr. Rooney or owners of the film rights, take a chance and have it produced on DVD. I think he would be a winner.
