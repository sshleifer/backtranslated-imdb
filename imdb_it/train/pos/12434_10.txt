For a first film in a proposed series it reaches the right balance. It is made with style and class showing the early days of Modesty as a refugee and the beginning of his rise to power in the criminal world. I think it's an honest / faithful portrait of his character exactly as the writer Peter O'Donnell intended. Alexandra Staden as Modesty is extraordinarily beautiful and an excellent choice. It behaves very convincingly as the hard survived with a fresh / intelligent / innocent exterior. And full marks for Tarantino for choosing an unknown actress for the role - much more credible for having a new face that creates the part. I look forward to the next movie.
