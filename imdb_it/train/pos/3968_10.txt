I saw this movie for the first time as a boy and I bought it recently on DVD. James Stewart lends great depth to the role of Chip Hardesty, a dedicated and dedicated FBI agent. His life in the office is interspersed with his family life, which is not all a bed of roses. His wife (an excellent portrait of Vera Miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of her work, and they even separate for a while; Chip's best friend and friend, Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) is killed in a fire fight; Chip's son, Mike, joins the marines during World War II. Through all this, the family continues with courage and dignity. <br /> <br /> Action sequences are quite exciting and the film's semi-documentary style works effectively. And Max Steiner's music says it all; loyalty, courage and integrity. <br /> <br /> This country owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women of the FBI and, yes, also to J. Edgar Hoover. If the type of Hoover vigilance had been observed, we could have saved ourselves on September 11, the wave of crimes against children and many of the venal politicians we have had to suffer since his death.
