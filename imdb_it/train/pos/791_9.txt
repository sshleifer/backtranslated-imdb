Having had no knowledge of this film before seeing it on the Rialto Channel, I found it to be a pleasant, moving and enriching film. <br /> <br /> The casting was excellent. I loved all the characters, they were a bit exaggerated in places (but this is a movie). The way it appeared and the pleasantly dizzying turn of the main character lasted until it worked, as real life can do and does. Yes, I thought Andy MacDowell was great. I was particularly interested in watching this film once it started, because people often joke about his acting skills (I find this rather strange because he is always a solid actress in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I loved it In the end, where the character of Andy said "sometimes I feel he has never been here" etc., it was so completely as it is in such a situation (which I can personally identify), then there was that wonderful classic piece "Nocturne" I think of Chopin, which was a nice way to finish (exclude light comedy in the end, which probably wasn't necessary). <br /> <br /> I say "well done" to the filmmakers: I've seen 1,000 s of worst movies!
