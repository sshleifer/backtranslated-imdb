This is a totally delicious and unexpected film. You begin to follow a young man who hopes to enter the qualifying match between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran wins, it will enter the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is that the young man is a girl and girls (or women for that matter) cannot participate in football matches to "sit with men". What follows is a wonderful comedy, played with skill consumed by a small ensemble cast. The film explores the absurdity of restrictions on women's freedom (and moreover, young soldiers who have to corral them). There are some excellent pieces, not least when one of the girls has to go to the bathroom and, of course, the stadium has no toilet facilities for women. Camera work is the simplest and somehow this story could have been told as a theatrical performance. Yet it is the small scale that gives the film its bite. Great cinema? No, probably not; great entertainment - for sure.
