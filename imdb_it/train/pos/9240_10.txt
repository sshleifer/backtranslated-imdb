Found this film in a video store, it costs $ 2 to buy. The whole movie smells really bad! The so-called colonel, who would be the hero here if the cover could have been reliable, must be around eighty and barely able to walk. Nevertheless he manages to shoot some of the stupidest ninjas in the world. Then the story leaves the colonel, which makes sense given the old man's inability to do something worth mentioning, now two terrifying eighty-year-old boys take over, in what must have been some sort of story. I've lost hundreds of times, but I didn't mind, because the film is so ugly, it's really fun to watch. Trash at no cost with actors who don't deserve that name. Go take a look!
