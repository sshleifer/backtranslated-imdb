I too have gone through a very painful personal loss (twice) and this film portrays the harrowing reality of that experience very well, unbalanced life, nothing makes sense, well-meaning relatives, etc. ... <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Ally again. He's one of my favorite movie actors of all time. <br /> <br /> I laughed and cried as the story unfolded. Great history and cast. Very well!
