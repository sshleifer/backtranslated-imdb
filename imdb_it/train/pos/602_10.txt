I've never danced flamenco before, but somehow I feel like this movie was perfect. The colors, the cheeky dances, the gypsies and the adversaries put together made a film that seemed to have ended too soon. I have seen other films by Carlos Saura and I agree that this film could be his best production. I feel that the best features of his previous films have been put together and aligned to make Iberia. I appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing the current activity behind the cameras. While watching this film, I felt like I was sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, watching the dancers comfortably slam on a wooden table over a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this film is perfect as a glove. I don't know how I can get a copy of this film in the United States in the coming years. I recommend this film to anyone who is attracted to the sustenance of other cultures. It is safe to say that this film is definitely on my list of favorites.
