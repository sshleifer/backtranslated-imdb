As someone who has seen and followed Hartley's public work for several years, I think that much of what was once narrative through true stories has been elevated into obscure philosophical mind games. <br /> <br /> While entertaining, Fay Grim is another step in Henry Fool's line of thought, where the film reflects the quality of an object within the film itself. In Henry Fool, the object is memories ... In Fay Grim, the object is an encrypted memoir - which are themselves stolen, falsified and transformed into something so obscure that it can't really make any sense - that is, the process writing and filming in the modern era - where most successful movies are little more than a mash-up from the past. That is, in a philosophical sense, what Fay Grim is. The object, perhaps, is the tragedy that the shock is now clich√© and boring (as suggested in the opening scenes at the publishers' office). <br /> <br /> That said, many of the film's best points are lost if I don't understand Henry's character and the meaning of the memories he is looking for. Henry is a thinly veiled devil, first visiting Simon as a modern Faust, etc. Without understanding how tragic Henry's character is, much of Fay Grim's plot and plot has been lost. <br /> <br /> And there is not enough 'detail' expressed through verbal flashbacks - knowing Henry Fool's plot cannot be compared to 'feeling' the quality of the characters as they did in Henry Fool, and so I think that for someone who walks in this cold movie there is about 10 minutes of 'so what' responds to the highly constructed dialogue and then that's it. <br /> <br /> However, Henry Fool was also my favorite Hartley film until I realized it was bad - putrid and haunted - just because Henry Fool's confessions were bad ... not just vulgar or dirty , but inescapably broken. Henry can't even be a real bad guy - and this is perhaps the tragic flaw that makes him more captivating ... like Gollum in Tolkien's works, Henry is pitiful. <br /> <br /> Who does not come across Fay Truce, although Henry's dialogue is excellent. What he encounters is that the whole film is built like an encryption - a sort of modeling of another plot around what ends up being another bad story to add to Henry's confessions. It's an interesting twist, but it can't really be digested without viewing the first movie. Perhaps showing more of Henry than before would have been better than having the publisher describe the basic plot of the first film - even if this plot isn't exactly what the first film was about - unless maybe one is a casual observer. <br /> <br /> Part of the encryption? Hard to say ... a little disappointed by the tricks of sex though. Cheesy.
