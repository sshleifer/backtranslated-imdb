A remarkable documentary on the outstanding results of the Women Lawyers Association (WLA) in Kumba, in the southwest of Cameroon, to legally safeguard the rights of women and children from domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign over women, according to Sharia law, one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing legal rights on women and children. After 17 years of failed attempts, WLA leaders have recently started making some victories, and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories. <br /> <br /> The leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa, a state prosecutor, and Beatrice Ntuba, a senior judge (president of the court). Both act in this film, which can contain spontaneously shot movies, although I imagine that much, if not all, of it consists in successive recreations of real events for the camera. Four cases are examined, and all the plaintiffs also behave in the film. <br /> <br /> Two cases concern repeated wife beatings, with forced sex in one case; another is about forced sex on a 10-year-old girl; and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of an 8-year-old child by an aunt. Even one of the beaten wives seeks divorce. We follow the cases from the investigation of the complaints to the results of the tests. The results in each case are favorable for women and children. The perpetrators receive prison sentences and / or fines; divorce is granted. <br /> <br /> The aggressive process of the child who is beating shows that these female criminal justice officials are genuinely gender-neutral when it comes to enforcing the law. Noteworthy is also the respect with which all the parties are treated, including those found guilty. This is a very important and well done film. (Of interest is the fact that one of the directors, Ms. Longinotto, also co-directed the 1998 film, Divorce, Iranian style, which dealt with Tehran related topics.) (In broken English with English subtitles). My vote: B + 8/10
