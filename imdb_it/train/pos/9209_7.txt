STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** The little bit in between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br /> <br /> Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) is quietly doing the his way into the Wild West when he identifies a group of men who mistreat a lady. Being a gentleman, he spontaneously enters and puts an end to it and thus kills the son of a bad defender. This is just the beginning of a burning battle of all the guns to the finish line from which there will be only one winner. <br /> <br /> M Dudikoff is an action star who never really took off with me. Maybe I discovered it too late and after the other movie I saw with him last Monday, The Human Shield, it was just another Dud (ha ha) added to the list. But I have a thing for westerns, they are films that take me to another time and place and provide real fun for the escape and with this Dudikoff chose one of his best scripts, since his films still go. <br /> <br /> The film hits some low points in the form of a bad-tempered villain, playing like a Marlon Brando in white and some acting generally by some of the cast, along with the low-cost mandatory sets. But if, for some strange reason, your life always depended on watching a Dudikoff movie, this would be one of your best choices. ***
