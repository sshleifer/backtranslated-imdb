In one penitentiary, four prisoners occupy a cell: Carrère (Gérald Laroche), who used his company to commit fraud and was betrayed by his wife; the drag Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his protégé, the retarded Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who ate his six-month-old sister; and the intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), who killed his wife. One night, Carrère finds an ancient diary hidden in a hole in the cell wall. They realize that the book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) at the beginning of the last century and concerns black magic. They decide to read and use its contents to escape from prison, when they find the truth about the fate of Danvers. "Maléfique" is an original low-budget French horror film, intriguing and claustrophobic. The story is practically in the same position, it has no cliché and it catches the viewer's attention until the last scene. I'm a big fan of French cinema, usually novels, dramas and detective stories, but I noticed that I recently saw some good French horror films, like "Un Jeu d 'Enfants", "Belphegor" and "Dead End". My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sinais do Mal" ("Signs of Evil")
