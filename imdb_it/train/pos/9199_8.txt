Dead To Rights speaks of a police officer named Jack Slate who finds his murdered father and chases the man he thinks killed him. Jack is then filmed and framed for the murder of the man he suspected of killing his father. <br /> <br /> Several months later, the day Jack was executed, he escaped from prison and sought out the man who set him up for murder in the city. Jack's quest leads him through a trail of * beep * that doesn't end soon. Everybody's dead. <br /> <br /> Through the game Jack uses M4 Carbines weapons to his Shadow dog to kill endless streams of people in 15 levels. The game is basically "kill 30 people, find the passage to open door.kill 50 people, find the switch to open the door" over and over again until the level is finished. There are also fun mini-games like playing as a stripper to distract the bouncers in a night club, so Jack can get to another area of ​​the club, or disarming bomb. <br /> <br /> Dead To Rights is also a tough game. You will be put in an area buzzing with boys armed with Sub Machine Guns while you only have one gun. As the game ends, the skills turn to dust and you have to rely on luck. <br /> <br /> Dead To Rights is as bloody as it is difficult. If you shoot a guy in the face with a pistol shot, the blood will splash on the walls, ceiling and floor. And since there are many kids in every area, the walls will be painted with blood. <br /> <br /> Family fun for everyone.
