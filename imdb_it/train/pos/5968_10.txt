When you come across a gem of a movie like this, you understand why the 80s were the biggest decade to live. Rock music has dominated, and so have movies ... especially horror movies. The filmmakers knew how to entertain us, and "Trick or Treat" is obvious to this. When the rocker Sammi Curr, which was probably written after W.A.S.P. singer Blackie Lawless, dies in a hotel fire, her # 1 fan Eddie, is upset. Go to a friend and the local DJ Nuke (Gene Simmons) for support. Nuke gives him a copy of Sammi's last recording; this is the only copy available. It was given to the radio station to be played live on Halloween night. When Eddie plays it, he somehow reports Sammi. Help Eddie with the bullies at school, but then he loses control. It's definitely a great movie. The bad thing is that this movie is sold out. I paid $ 25.00 to finally get her out of eBay. You should also ... $$ well spent!
