Love is overwhelming ... In all its manifestations ... Splendid, absolutely beautiful ... Tudor Chirila, Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu, a truly dramatic story about love in all its forms, a story about indecipherable ways of young hearts, on life and innocence lost, all directed by the skillful gaze of Tudor Giurgiu. With a magnificent soundtrack with Faultline and Chris Martin and Vama Veche surprising in every way leaving behind the sour taste of a misunderstood love ... Really remarkable ... Is it me or the Romanian cinematography that progresses slowly and surely gaining respect? This is a brilliant movie ... Two thumbs up to everyone involved.
