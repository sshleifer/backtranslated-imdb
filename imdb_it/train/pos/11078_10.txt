I watched the movie today and it just distracted my mind. It's a real masterpiece of art and I don't understand why most people think it's junk. The main idea of ​​the film: take away your ego and then you will have real power! This was the main battle at the end of the film and Guy Ritchie demonstrated it beautifully. "The greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look" - do you remember this from the movie? Because our true enemy is in us - it is our ego ... That voice that always tells us that we are important, that gives us our pride, that tells us not to give, but only to take, that creates our aggression , who wants to be in control, creates all negative feelings and thoughts. GR expressed this idea surprisingly and showed that the only way to get true control is when you lose control and let go of your personal importance. A superb film!
