This film is one of those that has a resonant familiarity with it. It is earthy, founded and a film that will make you think ... and smile. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk take you on a journey you will never forget. The soundtrack is wonderfully varied and suitable; and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air. This certainly deserves recognition for both the film and the actors! Finally, a work of art that starts from the evident love story and the frequent special affections that are seen today. I never came out of a film with such a profound warmth and a feeling of care in my heart; because it looked like someone had just wrapped it in a soft fleece blanket. To see this film is to find a real treasure and delight in it.
