This is a film that everyone should see. In addition to raising extremely important points (while South Africa is on the road to recovery there are still many countries in similar situations now), it is superbly directed while Denzel Washington, in my opinion, offers the best performance of his career so far. Kline also offers a good performance, although perhaps not as surprising as that of Washington. John Thaw also has a good position as police chief. <br /> <br /> There are so many possible areas where an apartheid movie could fall, but all of these have been avoided. It would be easy to simply portray whites as villains and blacks as good guys, but Attenborough did not. Of course, there were some white characters who seemed intrinsically evil, like the Captain of the Soweto revolt, but adding further dimensions to all the characters would have made the film unbearably long. Some people complain about the length of the film as it is, but I think it takes two and a half hours to tell the whole story, because it's really incredible. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the film is that of Steve Biko's funeral. When the whole crowd starts singing the South African national anthem, it's probably one of the scenes, if not the most moving I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you haven't already seen this movie: watch it. It may not be comfortable, but it's definitely worth it.
