Let me be the first non-Australian to comment on this :) I got the movie for Hugo Weaving and I saw it until the end. It is one of those "life drama" films, as my mother called a film that describes a real life story without extraordinary events and which is mainly descriptive. <br /> <br /> I liked the light and the girls. The rest was without too much fault, but without too much merit either. I wanted something like The Interview, or at least some element of villain of matrix here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary. History teaches us to face our destiny and free ourselves from the environment that others build for you, but this happens when the life that gives the peach factory in the area is about to close, so no effort is needed to change things. <br /> <br /> The American Beauty "smart" song in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack, but only the one that sounded endlessly became annoying after 100 minutes of film. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think he did his job of presenting a part of Australian life, but to me it didn't seem specifically Australian (it could have been placed anywhere) and it didn't seem as attractive as history. <br /> <br /> I believe that one has to be in a certain mood to appreciate the film.
