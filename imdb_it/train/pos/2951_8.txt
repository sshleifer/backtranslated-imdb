Yes, it's a chicken movie and it moves a little slow, but it's actually pretty good - and I consider myself a manly man. You must love Judy Davis, no matter what you are in, and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural and convincing performance. <br /> <br /> The scenery of the small coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the film's main theme. Unknown actors and actresses (at least unknown to me) lend a realism to the film that attracts you and attracts your attention. Overall, I give him an 8/10. Go see it.
