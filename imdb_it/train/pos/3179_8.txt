Who made this film? Do I love this movie? Someone has a strange sense of humor ... <br /> <br /> This film style of Zany, surreal is attractive, but it's difficult to create - or easy to forget - that substance and characters that actually have a soul, they are what gives depth to a film. Without this a comedy is just a bunch of ideas. Who cares. It can be a laugh, but it goes through you like a half-good burger ... the next ... <br /> <br /> Crosseyed may not want to change anyone's life, but I appreciate the depth and substance. They undermine you. I started this movie thinking "Oh, I understand - indie comedy - from the wall - gonzo ... yes". And that's it - but if you pay attention there are subtext and moments of character that fill it. In this sense the film breathes. He makes proposals that pause - if you are willing to see them - and then, of course, proceeds in a madly cheerful way. <br /> <br /> You will miss the point if you do not sign a contract to suspend faith in the moments of the film. Moving from reality to surreality It is one of the points of this film. <br /> <br /> Crosseyed is not perfect, but smart people have made it. I want more. <br /> <br /> The dining room scenes are an absolute HOOT. <br /> <br /> Put on your seat belt.
