It makes no sense to step over the story as enough reviewers have done it. Here are some different points of view from one of those "religious madmen", as a bigoted reviewer puts it so tolerant. <br /> <br /> 1) "Baby Face" (1933) offers perhaps the classic example ever put on the film of how women can manipulate men with sex. There is a lot of truth in what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this movie: it looks cute, you blink, you offer your body for free ..... and men will fall in love with yourself to help you with what you want. <Br /> <br /> In this case, it was the development of the work with the ultimate goal of money ..... a lot. At least four men in this film provide just that, even if they ruin their lives in the process. <br /> <br /> 2) The ending - which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate - gives another great message: all the money and material goods in the world will not make a person feel satisfied. A sad comment on the fact that so many "critics" here prefer to have immoral messages, preferring the substance to the substance. No surprise, I guess. <br /> <br /> Whichever way you look, the film is fun from beginning to end and Stanwyck has some great lines, especially at the beginning, when he tells his crude father and his unruly bar customers. At just over 70 minutes, this movie moves at a fast pace and is finished before you know it.
