This episode is a bit confusing. Some say you have to start from the beginning but I have to say that I was a little confused from the beginning! <br /> <br /> Clark gets a headshot and wakes up on the floor of Fairview Mental Institution and makes fun of himself as a superhero. Clark is told that the life he knew was all in his head. Delusional. He also finds some unusual things: Martha is married to Lionel; Lex is tied to a wheelchair with his limbs cut off after the accident on the bridge; and Lana is devoted to Clark. But he finds a familiarity; someone else who is devoted to Clark: Chloe. He also discovered that a mentally ill person also comes from the known world of Smallville. And the doctor is a fugitive from the Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode reminds me again of an episode of Buffy called "Normal Again" where Buffy starts having lively daydreams about an asylum. The doctor tried to convince her that everything she knew was a figment of her imagination and that, in fact, she was crazy. His parents were still married, they still lived in Los Angeles, his friends didn't exist, Angel had never been his boyfriend and he didn't have a sister named Dawn. Even demons and vampires did not exist. Both episodes are a bit sad because the doctors are not just telling the characters that it is all a figment of his imagination, but he tells us what he really is: fiction, and brings us back to reality. It is nice, however, to have a sense of reality from time to time, but let's look at these shows to escape reality. It's nice again because the characters have to overcome new challenges.
