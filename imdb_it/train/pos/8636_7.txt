So-so thriller with Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, joining David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a journey to the west. This last couple is doing research on known murder sites for an outgoing book; Pitt is a serial killer on the run (unbeknownst to Dave) and Juliette is his poor, not-all-companion. This is a good cast and the story goes on, but Pitt is not scary as a serial killer, even if it is one of his previous roles. The best thing is Michelle Forbes, who always manages to shine, both in her roles on "Homicide: Life on the Street", and in the short series "Wonderland". <br /> <br /> Rating: 6
