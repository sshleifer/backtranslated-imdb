I just never get tired of watching FREEBIRD. My husband was an extra so I was involved from the start. They stayed in touch with Jon and helped promote the film both in Cinemas and now in the DVD version. Also with regard to the distribution of promotional postcards on cross-channel ferries and in various places throughout France. FREEBIRD has been expertly written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments and choice of casting. Only Phil Daniels could adapt to the role of Grouch. Great privilege to meet Jon and cast at the party after the January premier. All you want to do is just ask, either by email or by phone, you know how to get me. Sue xx
