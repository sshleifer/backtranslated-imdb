I saw this movie on DVD a couple of times now, the first time, I looked at the second half after the hour and then I returned to the first hour. a funny and compelling film, thank God there is no Kiera Knightley, who refreshes and gives us a genuine vision of Queen Victoria's difficult life and the difficult choices she had to make. Nothing wrong with the film, no bad language or something of a sexual nature that would offend the vision of the family. It could push the kids to do some research on Queen Victoria and perhaps less well-known characters like Conroy and Lord Melbourne
