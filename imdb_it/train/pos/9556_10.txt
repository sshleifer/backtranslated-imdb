When our local TV station was first launched, it filled a lot of its program with the old British programming. "Block your daughters!" it was duly broadcast, and I - obscured by the first few seconds of the film - appeared in an empty tape. The best thing I've ever done. <br /> <br /> The actors are magnificently suited to their characters and take them on a delightful life, complete with appropriate accents (Christopher Plummer's Foppington will leave you drooling, like Hoyden and his family). Double senses abound, the dashed wheels inside the wheels mix and match the characters, hilarious gags lurking in every scene, and comments are made on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> I showed the film to some friends years ago and called the piece "a lost treasure", both for the cast and for the story. Until today I can only break up thinking about dialogue. If this gem finds its way to a DVD version, I will be at the forefront.
