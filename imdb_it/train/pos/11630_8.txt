Red Eye is a good little thriller to watch on Saturday nights. An intense acting, a great rascal and an unexpected action. <br /> <br /> Some may not want to see this movie because it goes for a good 85 minutes and 88% of the movie is on a plane and is just talking. Don't worry, they do it very well with intelligent and witty dialogue. <br /> <br /> A PG-13 film seems to be a new motif for director Wes Craven. But surely he has implemented as much violence as possible in this thriller. <br /> <br /> The strength of this film is the cast. This film needed good actors to offer dialogue and thrill. If they didn't have those actors the film would have been lost and boring. We had Rachel McAdams of Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers. Cillian Murphy of Batman Begins and 28 days later. To complete this cast Brian Cox from X-men 2. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of this film was fantastic. Just when you think it will get boring they will give you a twist. Fortunately this is not a long film and he doesn't even want to. Much better than the flight plan of other flight movies. <br /> <br /> Here is my comment on the flight plan: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I recommend. Not too long and not too shabby. <br /> <br /> 8/10
