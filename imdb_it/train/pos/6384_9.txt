It is written in stone that Disney animations must simply be musicals. Right? Where is it? Let me see. Because I found this attempt to be a lot more fun for ~ not ~ containing the standard Disney music fare made for five years. <br /> <br /> Although the story was not as compelling as it could have been, it was still pretty good, fun and adventurous. I had hoped for a little more, yes, considering the subject, but this film is not the ~ bitter disappointment or total failure that has been declared to be. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is average, but the dialogue is quite compelling, as are the plot, the plot, the sub-plot and the extraordinary creativity I found in this production. I will refrain from delineating the plot, how it was done and done, but this film deserves a vision if you are a fan of fantasy. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, THE BEST Disney Animated Feature Length Film. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 9.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
