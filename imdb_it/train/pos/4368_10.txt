This is a very exciting and romantic movie. I've seen it several times and I never get bored. Everything is realistic and it's a good plot. The actors are excellent Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. Actually I prefer this film to Braveheart because Braveheart contains so many historical missta. There are many exciting scenes: watch out for the Bridge Scen and the last fencing scene. They are really beautiful and surprising scenes. <br /> <br /> The music is lovely ... it really fits the movie. The setting is incredible.
