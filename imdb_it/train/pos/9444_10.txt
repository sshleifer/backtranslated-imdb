*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Full of memorable moments (like the quote above, immortalized by Primus), Deliverance tells the story of four boys who are traveling in the wild woods to go rafting and get away for a little from the big city only to discover that soon their fun takes a bad turn. This is not a Hollywood movie. There are practically no special effects of any kind, the setting is extremely realistic, and nothing is sweetened or made nice. The boys of the city look like city boys, and even the soon-to-be boy, played accurately by Burt Reynolds, is clearly at the mercy of this journey. This is a perfect example of a what-if movie. What would happen if some friends did rafting in an area of ​​woods that none of them knew, and in the end they tried desperately to avoid being tried and convicted of murders they had been forced to commit to save their lives? > <br /> There is clearly a very strong element of the film concerning the social and class structure and the relationship (or lack thereof) between rural and urban populations. When the four boys arrive in the woods at the beginning of the film, they clearly don't know how to interact with the people who live out there and talk to them as if they are not sure if they will understand or will be able to communicate. This communication block is memorably illustrated in the scene of the duel benches, in which they are trying to gass the car and the truck and convince someone to drive the vehicles downstream for them. While Drew and the obviously in love boyfriend and probably mentally mentally deficient on the porch are dueling with their guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the film), Louis is having some trouble buying gas, and Bobby makes a comment about genetic deficiencies and how pathetic this is When the boy leaves Drew, who offered to shake his hand after their wonderful jam session, Bobby tells him to give the boy a couple of dollars, knowing that none of them is quite sure how to react. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing we see in Deliverance that creates so much tension to follow. This great scene where a lot of fun was made (including the funniest "red neck dance" scene up to O Brother, Where Art You?) Ended with everyone embarrassed, unsure what to do one around other. These people are apples and oranges and live according to completely different rules of life. The people that Louis, Bobby, Drew and Ed meet in the hills have grown apart from modern society and modern laws, and live by the rules of nature, which do not include killing. Confused by their embarrassing behavior, the four friends leave for the river, hoping that the strangeness ends and the adventure begins. <br /> <br /> (spoiler) When they are briefly separated from each other and Ed and Bobby come across the hillside buildings by the river which quickly become unpleasant, uncertainty about the way these people live - that was established by the scene above - comes into play to create the greatest tension during the scene. I think a good sign of a quality thriller like this is that the tragic element of the film, namely the real assaults and murders, takes up a very small amount of screen time but remains some of the most memorable parts of the film. There is no gratuitous violence here, it's all there for an obvious purpose and achieves a surprisingly powerful effect. <br /> <br /> The move involves a violent confrontation between two very different kinds of people, and what can happen when they inadvertently find themselves at war with one another. The journey along the rest of the river after the assault, which takes up most of the film, offers spectacular and effective tension, and keeps you on the edge of your seat without bombarding you with so much success that it becomes numb. It is surprisingly effective when we find that Ed could very well have killed the wrong man up there on the cliff, and the tension in the film does not stop even when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river, because they give the police a questionable explanation of that what happened down there on the river and why the deputy's brother-in-law disappeared. <br /> <br /> This is a very disturbing film, which is a testament to its success, because it is quite obvious that a film like this is meant to shake people a little. The hillbillies are the human (ie more realistic) version of the sub-human rednecks seen in childish films but quite similar as Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, none of which could ever be compared to a timeless film like Deliverance. When we follow these four men through their fatal weekend in the woods, the natural element is so real and we know men so well and so subtly that it is almost as if we, as individuals in the audience, are really a fifth member of the team. It is not often that a film is able to come across that way.
