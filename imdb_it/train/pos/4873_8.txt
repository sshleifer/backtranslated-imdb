For those of you who are not aware of the theme that Kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films - the Western assault on traditional Serbian values ​​- it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives. This continuous theme, expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as a vehicle, is one that Kusturica has chosen to entrust. From his fantastic work and Magnum Opus' Underground ', Kusturica's films'' Black Cat White Cat ',' Life is a Miracle ', and recently with' Promise Me This', his slapstick and carnival style emphasizes the westernization of Balkan culture, its ambivalent arrival and the assault on the traditional idiom. In the case of 'Promise Me This', the paradoxical world of urban space (urban space) and of the village (traditional idiom) is in contrast. The world of the city reflects the western attributes that have settled the spatial and temporal environment; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a sense of identity broken and vehemently disregarding traditional values ​​- expressed towards the boy - villager. The end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and a wedding on a one-way dirt road. I'm on a gross collision; appropriately, marriage, which represents the life line and pulse of the village, ie traditional values, are about to clash with mourning funerals, exemplifying the death of tradition in this context. Yet Kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through its unique stylistic uniqueness. With its outrageous and garish style it serves as a vehicle in its representation.
