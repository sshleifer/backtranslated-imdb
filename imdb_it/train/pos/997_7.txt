I have to agree with most of the other posts. Was it a comedy? a drama? he leaned a little too much towards the comedy side. It could have been a great film without comedy and it was horribly invented. Jamie keeps running in the Julio and what is his name. In New York, how many times you meet someone you know in downtown Cleveland. And how could Robert Pastorelli dig in Yankee Stadium to hide the gold. Once again, a comedy or a drama? But it was still fun especially for a Sunday morning. I liked the performance of Kimberly Elise, definitely a beautiful actress and seems to take her art seriously. She is a younger actress who will be vital.
