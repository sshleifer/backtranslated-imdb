one of the funniest mario I've ever played. the levels are creative, there are fluid controls and good graphics for his time. there is also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight. Sometimes the levels get frustrating, and if you leave out some of the difficult levels and still, you need to get more results to fight a boss, it can be annoying. another complaint is the camera angle; although it works quite well most of the time, it can be a pain in certain situations. if you are a big fan of the mario of the time; this is for you. even if you are not a big fan of him, I would recommend him anyway. It's a great game, and getting what you need can take a while, but it's very satisfying. good for playing in short periods of time. it will almost certainly interest you; definitely keeps mine!
