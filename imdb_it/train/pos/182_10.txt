If you are not aware of the Gundam world, this is a good starting point. If you are burned on Star Wars or Star Trek, here is a compelling and realistic science fiction series where you can dive. Not the simple story of the giant-world-in-giant robot you would have expected, but rather a complex, exciting and thrilling space war drama in which the line between "good" and "bad" boys is decidedly less obvious . <br /> <br /> Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of Al Izuruha, a young, naive boy who lives in a neutral space colony. He spends his days dreaming on Mobile Suit and playing with his friends. During this series, Al makes friends with an "enemy" soldier, Bernie Wiseman. In the end, little Al learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the suffering and sacrifice required. <br /> <br /> I loved this OAV series, with its fantastic mecha drawings, which involve history and cute characters. I recommend this series to all those who like realistic science fiction anime, or those who think that anime is just silly or sexy entertainment.
