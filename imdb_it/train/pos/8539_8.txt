Moving and sad film. Find the trials and tribulations of a writer who tries to come to terms with the paralysis caused by a bicycle accident. The film focuses on his relationship with his married lover, to whom he is often very hostile, and his interactions with other accident victims, particularly a black and extremely popular motorcycle rider. The film is often funny, often sad and always credible. Exit the kleenex box and watch it on a cozy Sunday afternoon with your partner.
