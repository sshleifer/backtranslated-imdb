Kay Pollack (the man behind this film) is a real great man who tries to share his philosophy of life in different ways. He has written a lot of good and well-written books on how to control your senses and keep your soul happy. The message in most of his books and in this film talks about the fact that your thoughts are actually what causes your problems and that the reason for your anger is almost never caused by what you think. The main message is that you can choose to be happy, but almost never do it. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and learn something very important about life, you have to keep your mind very open and LISTEN to all the "hidden messages" (or guidelines to overcome life) that contains the most part of the parts of this film if you listen and watch. Watch it with your ears. <br /> <br /> You will not learn the meaning of life, but you will learn how to live and get the most out of it ... <br /> <br /> So, while you watch, keep in mind: <br /> < br /> "The mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work unless it's open!"
