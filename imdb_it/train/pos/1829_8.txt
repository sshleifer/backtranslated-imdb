What a fun movie is St. Ives. It reminds me of the type of film made during the 1940s. Classical history, completed by characters and a plot that is neither dramatic nor overtly complicated. In reality nothing is over. The story of Robert Lewis Stevenson - here adapted to the screen - reads like Jane Austen for men. We get a story that has a love story in the heart, but there is also a lot of fun: battle scenes (kind of), prison leaks, mistaken identities, sword games and the funniest line I've heard in years: "Only in Scotland's guests will be announced by name in a masquerade ball". There is a lot of hilarity, discomfort and not a little broken heart when St. Ives tries to fight and finds the way back to a family and a life he barely knows. <br /> <br /> The cast is absolutely stellar with the too little seen Jean Marc Barr absolutely perfect in the lead role. Anna Friel is a regenerating delight while the enterprising Flora and Miranda Richardson almost walks away with the film as his essay and mundane, was there and saw all of Aunt Susan. Richard Grant provides top-level comic relief. <br /> <br /> This will not be the greatest film anyone has ever seen, but its charm is undeniable and the whole film is rather bristly with an energy that bursts with life.
