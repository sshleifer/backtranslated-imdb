well i wasn't sure how the movie would have been since i had only seen a small clip but i was thinking it would be good and i was right i watched it twice the day i took it and good is my favorite movie . <br /> <br /> I think that Alison Lohan played the part of Beth well, she is such a grateful actress and the writer must have done a lot of research to find out about bulimia, even though the ending when beth is in the hospital has 2 observations of Horus after meals because I was told that 1 house is OK and that even hospitals do not help bulimics as has been said, probably because they are still at home even though my sister and mother would like to have me hospitalized to have bulimia but this is a graticule film I recommend it to anyone with or without a eating disorder or for people who know someone with eating disorders as it can let them get into the life of a bulimic person and see the world as they do a bit more of a grid film and I recommend it to any and all types of people
