"Bell Book and Candle" was shown recently on cable. Having not seen for a while, we decided to take another look at this play. Based on the success of James Van Druten on Broadway, which was a vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early 1950s, the film was adapted for the screen by Daniel Taradash. The film was directed by Richard Quine, who turned the game into a delightful comedy. <br /> <br /> Evidently, judging by some of the comments presented by IMDb, the big problem seems to be the combination of the two stars, which had collaborated on "Vertigo", published the same year. The cinema audience didn't think about the age difference when this film was released. In fact, most of the old male stars of that period were always involved with very young women. <br /> <br /> The film set in Manhattan during Christmas is a delightful comedy that enchanted viewers. Kim Novak was at the peak of her beauty as it is clear that the camera adored her, no matter what she was playing. Like the witch who becomes human, her Gillian is fascinating. James Stewart, who plays the publisher Shep 'Henderson, is also seen at his best. Mr. Stewart was an excellent comedian who shows up here because he was at the top. <br /> <br /> In supporting roles the wonderful Elsa Lanchester, who plays Queenie, is a welcome addition to any film, as shown here. Even Nicky Holroyd of Jack Lemmon, Gillian's brother, is good. Ernie Kovacs is also considered the writer Sidney Radlitch. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching "Bell Book and Candle".
