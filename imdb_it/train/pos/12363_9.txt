This 1986 French-Italian remake of the 1946 film of the same name makes the heat rise soon, and doesn't let us get in the air. The story is about a high school student (Federico Pitzalis) who can't look away from that mysteriously beautiful young woman (played by the Dutch phenomenon Maruschka Detmers) who lives next to the school. One day, he follows her, and his persistence pays off. There is only one problem: she is engaged to a sketchy character (Riccardo De Torrebruna) who may or may not have committed an atrocious crime, and if he regrets, he will probably be released with a slap on the wrist. Furthermore, the young woman is a bit "funny in the head", and this is confirmed when we find out that she saw the boy's father, who is a psychiatrist. Giulia's emotional instability is matched only by her prodigious sexual desires. Hot, hot, hot, from the beginning, with beautiful gossip and a performance by Detmers, who plays us like a yo-yo (like a boy) from one scene to another, with enough suspense to make us guess up fund until - and even after - the end. Available in nominal versions R and X (!).
