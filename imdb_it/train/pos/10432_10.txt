I have to admit that at first I was rather reluctant to watch this movie. I thought it was this stupid little romantic movie about a French woman who meets an American on the train and decides to visit Vienna with him. I wasn't really charmed by this kind of script, since it kept making me believe it was just a movie. And yet, I saw it! And I was amazed ... "Before Sunrise" is one of the few films that dare to speak in a rather philosophical way, wondering that at the time of our birth, we are condemned to death, or that it is a mediocre idea that a couple should rest together for eternity, or that we humans can sometimes afford to live in fairy tales. <br /> <br /> The finale was wonderfully chosen (we don't know if they will meet again in six months, at exactly six o'clock, at the Vienna station) - in our optimism, we sincerely hope so. The actors played in a very good way, so, I started to believe that I could live a love story just like this.
