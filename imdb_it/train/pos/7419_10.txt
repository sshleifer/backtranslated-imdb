Based on the preview I saw, I went to "Shower" expecting a sweet little comedy; what I found was a dramatic drama of family life told in some of the richest photographic images I've ever had the privilege of seeing. Furthermore, the subsequent reflection made me appreciate the abrupt cuts to the scenes of the past (in the arid countryside of northern China and in the high plain of Tibet): isn't that how memory often works? One moment I'm here, the next one is in a landscape of the past, just like that .... <br /> <br /> I wouldn't strongly recommend this film, I'd put it between the two or three most beautiful films I've seen in my 60s years. <br /> <br /> By the way, a couple of years ago another Asian "comedy" was released in the US as "Shall We Dance?" (Japanese). Just like with "Shower", the preview did not give the slightest indication of the depth of that film, which turned out to be a subtle psychological study (although chock-full of funny moments). Is there a fear on the part of distributors of making films look too "important" or "profound" to attract US spectators?
