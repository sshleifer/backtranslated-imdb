Some say this is the best movie the PRC has ever released, I'm not too sure since I have a fond place in my heart for some of their mysteries. I will say that this is probably one of the most unique films that they, or any other studio, major or minor, has ever published. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. The ghost of an unjustly executed ferryman has returned to the swamp to kill all those who have lynched him and all those who have passed away. In this mix comes the niece of a ghost victim, the current ferryman. He takes control of the ferry business while the ghost approaches the man he loves. <br /> <br /> Wrapped in thick fog and set mainly on the marsh set, this is a more musical poem than the normal movie. rhythms of dialogue, especially in the first scenes, their cadence is poetic for them. Likewise, there is a cadence similar to that of the camera as it travels back and forth across the swamp as if it was passing back and forth between life and death, innocence and guilt. The film reminds me of an opera, an oratory or a lesson in musical objects rather than a normal horror film. It is an extraordinary film that is probably unique in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> This is not for the Guild. This is a low budget horror / mystery that tells you a little story well done that will entertain you. His story of love and revenge is what counts here, not the poetic film and holds the attention in the first place (the technical aspects are only conspicuous). If there is a real flaw is the convenience of production. The fog creates a state of mind but also hides the fact that this swamp is entirely on land. The constant constant back and forth is ok for a while, but even after 58 minutes you'd like to see something else. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I really like the movie. It is a good little film that I somehow want to be slightly less affected by poverty. It's definitely worth a look if you can find it.
