Dan, the widowed father of three girls, has his own column of advice that is likely to come into syndication. After his wife died, he took time to raise his daughters. Not having known any romance for some time, nothing prepares him for meeting with Marie, in a local book store in a small oceanfront town in Rhode Island, where he went to celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of his big family. After appreciating Marie at first sight, little prepares him when the beautiful woman appears in the family complex. After all, she's the date of Dan's brother, Mitch. <br /> <br /> It is clear from the beginning that Dan and Marie are made for each other, and although we hear what the outcome will be, we will go to the fun race that Peter Hedges, the director wants to give us. Mr. Hedges, author and screenwriter on his own, gave us two excellent novels, "What's Eating Gilber Grapes" and "An Ocean in Iowa", and the delicious indie, "Pieces of April, which he also directed. just a coincidence that both films deal with families during Thanksgiving meetings. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film was the natural chemistry between the two stars, Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche. and in many ways reminds us of Jack Lemmon, in his version of comedies and serious material, what can be said of Mrs. Binoche, a clever actress and a brilliant presence in every film, she is right to make the comedy, to convince us of her Marie. <br /> <br /> The only sad note is the waste of talent in the photo: John Mahoney, Diane Wiest, Norbert Leo Butz, Jessica Hecht, Emily Blunt, Allison Pill, Amy Ryan, they have nothing to do , they serve only as secondary music for the Dane Cook decoration, which is seen fr s atello, Mitch, behaves better because he can play more lines than the others. <br /> <br /> "Dan in Real Life" is a delightful film that everyone will like.
