It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag. Just a beautiful feeling and yet it is never lowering to be mawkish. There is fantastic cinema and the main girl is quite brilliant. It captures more than the nostalgia of time. He has a real heart. It is the Achilles wound of childhood that is exquisite and painful. A simple story is always effective if done right. This Glendyn Ivin has a great future and I'm the first one, I'm looking for her next project. The following is always the most difficult thing. It's like the second blues album for most people. <br /> <br /> I just hope your next movie is not something lame like a shark movie. Greetings to all. Enjoy your cinema.
