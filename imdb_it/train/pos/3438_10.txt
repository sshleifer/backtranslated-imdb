The film was exceptional despite the evaluation of the NC-17 and the disturbing scenes. In reality things like this happen and this is why this film shows many. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in superb show), whose recent start in college has everything for her. Meet Jared (Chad Faust in a terrifying performance) at a fraternity party that turns out to be a true gentleman and sweet. He invites her out to dinner. They look at the stars from a bridge and end up going to his apartment. They talk and take her to the cellar if they become flirtatious with each other. Try to end this, but he violates it. This incident is the scar. She goes to a club meets a bartender / DJ Adrian (played beautifully by Marcus Patrick) who sees that he is getting drunk and helps before she goes too far. Affect a friendship. He also uses drugs and Maya starts using him too. In other words, he introduces it to a different world. He starts going back to school and works as a TA (Teaching Assistant) and sees Jared as one of the students. While the students are taking a Midterm, he catches Jared cheating. Jared tries to pave the voice for Maya, but she still has the upper hand and decides to invite him to her house. Will history repeat itself? Or will Maya have a surprise for Jared? Watch the movie. Excellent A. Rosario Dawson plays the role with attention and resistance. He doesn't like Chad Faust to be a rapist, but he does a fantastic job like Jared. Marcus Patrick is a very brilliant man who saves Maya and trains her in a new world. This film deserves an award.
