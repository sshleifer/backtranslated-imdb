Based on Robert Louis Stevenson's St. Louis, the film tells the story of a young French Hussar captain (Jean Marc Barr) during the Napoleonic wars. Captured in battle, he is sent to a prison camp in the Scottish Highlands, directed by Major Farquhar (Richard E Grant). In a short time he falls in love with a local girl (Anna Friel), makes a friendship with the major, and discovers that his long lost grandfather, who fled from France during the revolution, lives right on the street! Enthusiastic performances of the entire cast and some memorable lines make this offer above average.
