This is French and Belgium does what they do best. It is an eccentric, visually inventive, exhilarating and emotionally stimulating storytelling. Director Jaco van Dormael takes us into the world of Georges, a patient with Down syndrome and his search for a meaningful relationship with someone, just someone. This is not done in a paternalistic way but with a great sense of fun and also honesty. The intertwining of Georges with the corporate management guru, Harry is run dazzlingly, moving from comedy to tragedy again with breathtaking comedy. <br /> <br /> Eighth day stages similar Hollywood dishes such as Bar Man Levy by Barry Levinson or Robert Forrest Gump by Zemeckis well and truly in the shade. Sometimes, it evokes the humor of Milos Forman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with the nuances of Dennis Potter projected for good measure. <br /> <br /> As the yuppie emotionally contented and hopelessly alone, Harry, Daniel Auteuil turns yet another sublime performance. But it is equaled by the brilliant Pascal Duquenne as Georges. It is a film with uniformly strong performances and many memorable sets - the shoe store scene, the car showroom scene, George's dance to "Jesus He Knows Me" by Genesis, the conference scene, the fireworks scene. 'artifice. If you haven't seen it, there is only one thing to do. Just rent it or take part in a screening in a retro cinema near you and see what you missed. Better yet, buy this movie. Pure genius .....
