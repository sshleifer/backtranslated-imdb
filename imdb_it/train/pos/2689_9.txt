This is a warm and fun film, almost like Almodovar's works. Sure he has a 10-year-old boy sucking milk from the breast, but the style is so playful that I can't understand at all those readers who found him sick or perverted (but I'd be willing to let my 10-year-old play the part ? It's not so safe!). <br /> <br /> Spanish cinema is often quite sexual, but in a very open and healthy way that leaves the viewer without any sense of voyeurism or twisting. I think if we guys from northern Europe had the same attitude, we would be much better as a result. <br /> <br /> This liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious character of "Fartman Maurice". As his lover tells him: "Most people are embarrassed by the farts. You turn it into an art form."
