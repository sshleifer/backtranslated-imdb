it's a funny thing, I was the child in the movie, the one in the cradle. :) I'm 19 now. my parents took me to try the part, at that time we lived in Texas. I think I only made $ 80 for this, but I didn't stay there very long. My parents said I would cry when I should have been happy and I would have been happy when I should have cried. I was all confused. I think strange and funny I suppose .. and no I am not a child actress. I'm living in San Antonio, working at a walgreen. I graduated here in Texas, but I lived in Maryland for most of my life. This film is a great movie, however, a good concept. I've seen it several times in my 19 years.
