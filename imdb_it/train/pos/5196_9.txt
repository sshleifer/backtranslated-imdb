Human Tornado (1976) is in many ways a better film than its predecessor. The director knew what he had to work with and was concerned about Rudy Ray Moore's limits as an actor. It's a funny movie that is more technically valid and played. Artists do not take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time everyone is on the beat and follows the flow. Rudy Ray Moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as rigid as he is in Dolemite. I really enjoyed the movie and highly recommend it. Just like his first film, it's aimed at a certain audience (I highly doubt that Mr. Moore was trying to expand his audience at this point in his career). Check! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
