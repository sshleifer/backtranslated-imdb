"Foxes" is a film I remember for his portrait of teenagers in the late 70s. Being exactly the age of Jodie Foster, I referred to this film. He deals with the frustrations, temptations, relationships and youth rebellion. The soundtrack is fantastic with rock inspiration, eg. "More Than a Feeling" from Boston and sad numbers like "On the Radio" by Donna Summer. The music of my last years. Yes, I will always remember, even if it wasn't huge.
