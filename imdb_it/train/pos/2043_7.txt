I just watched this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival, where he was playing in the Midnight Madness section. To tell you the truth, the only reason I chose this film is because it shared its name with the Radiohead song, and also because my friend bought the tickets so I didn't have a choice: be something like The Silence of the Lambs, but it turned out to be a semi-gore movie. Someone has already said that none of the characters is nice, and this is absolutely correct. I didn't care much less if the character of Potente had his bowels torn from the Creep. I was rooting for the homeless to make him live with the character of Potente who was making sweets for her. Christopher Smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film. However, the story is rather weak, but then again the whole point of the film was to scare the crap out of you and did it quite effectively. The score of a Bristol group called The Insects was first rate. This really scared me more than anything else. <br /> <br /> The director was a really decent guy and it was pretty fun during the question and answer session. I really hope he can make better films in the future. <br /> <br /> This is strictly for fans of the genre, but I would still recommend non-fans to try it anyway. It was a fun ride.
