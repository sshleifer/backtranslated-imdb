A brilliant film about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal and love. Macy is a great actor. It was almost a shame to see him in the same scenes with Campbell, who seems to be part of a neurotic sexual object but has no ribs to work with him at the level required by the script. But he is such a good actor that he played at his level to make the scenes work. I really appreciate the casting of Tracey Ullman as a neglected wife. Who knew? Sutherland is also very good. The way he moves makes his character appear taller (and even younger in some scenes). Almost everyone knew what they were doing. <br /> <br /> The portrait of Macy on the only situation in which her character is unable to pay attention is nothing short of complete.
