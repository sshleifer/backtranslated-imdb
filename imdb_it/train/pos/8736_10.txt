You will be amazed at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation, and the novelty will probably not end in the first, second or third vision, but you will be attracted by characters that are so simple yet intriguing, that you could find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way which may or may not make you feel a little childish because of the medium. <br /> <br /> Disney continues to hold the title of "Greatest Animation in the World", with "A Bug's Life" is one of their greatest hits. One of the innovative attachments is the delicious "out-take" added to the end of the film. The DVD has two series of these out-takes in which, as I said, the VHS cassette has an alternate tape version. The DVD also features "Gerry? S Game" which is a delightful little short PIXAR that was also shown before the film in theaters. <br /> <br /> Is this by far the top insect movie compared to Dreamworks? "Antz", which in all honesty is quite good, but something is missing in the animation and development of the story and the characters. If you look at the stellar voices of both films, "Antz" is mostly screened with a big-name "movie star" with some familiar "TV" voices, where "A Bug's Life" is just the opposite, loaded with "TV" sees Kevin Spacey as the only exception. But the difference in quality is distinct and obvious. <br /> <br /> Dreamworks cannot be blamed or surprised, but when you go head-to-head with Disney, you have your job to do for you. This is the kind of film that almost makes me want to have children to share it with. Don't think for a second that this is just a children's movie, though.
