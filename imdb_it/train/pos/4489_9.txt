This film is NOT about a cat and mouse fight, as stated in the other comment. It is a cat that has consumed 8 of its 9 lives and now lives in fear of losing its last. The cat is nervous and scared to death all the time, hence the name "chilly cat". Fraidy Cat's previous lives haunt him as ghosts that belong to different eras and constantly try to kill him, but he is more afraid of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the shape of number 9 and spits out the bolts lighting. very old now, but it would still be fun for the kids if you had a copy. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie almost every day as a child: o)
