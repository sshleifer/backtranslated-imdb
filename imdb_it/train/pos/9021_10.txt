2 sisters and I watched all 3 Tenko series and we agree that this is by far one of the best BBC series. The whole cast was very convincing in the parts they portrayed and even though the third series was a little slower without the same. I don't doubt that we'll see it again because it's a series that I would never tire of watching. Great view and top marks on the BBC for such a brilliant series and casting. First rate in all departments and I would recommend this series to anyone, even if some age limits must be considered due to some material for adults. I am grateful to the BBC for having released this series on DVD and Video.
