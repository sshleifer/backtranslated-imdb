I saw this movie when the Mystery Science Theater directed it in 1993. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. So badly, in fact, that for sheer strangeness, this film must have a score of ten because it must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has written this script with children in mind should be beaten. I mean, really, the devil against Santa Claus? Visions of hell? A reindeer-like nose with a creepy nose? Forced child labor with racial stereotypes? It's not Sesame Street, that's for sure. As Crow says, during MST3K, "This is a good old fashion nightmare!" <br /> <br /> There is a lot of strange allusions and messy theology. Merlino (presumably the Arthurian Merlin) hangs out with Santa Claus in his crazy castle in the clouds (ie Paradise). Santa speaks of little Jesus and sends letters to "Mr. Stork" for the children who ask for brothers. There are symbols around the castle that look like RAF staves or stars. <br /> <br /> My best friend and I have been watching it every year since 1993 and we submit someone we can hold for 2 hours to watch with us.
