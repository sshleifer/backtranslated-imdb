I love this movie and have seen it several times over the years. Enhance with every vision. I agree with all the positive reviews here. Yes, it is as gritty and brutally realistic as life on the prairie was in those days. I found myself making comments as I watched him. Someone here said that Rip Torn was a mixed bag. I could not disagree more. He is as brilliant as the gloomy, miserly Clyde Stewart who says little and works as a slave / workhorse. Conchatta Farrell is as fantastic as the widow Elinor, whom Clyde hires as a housekeeper / cook (along with her 7 older daughter). Lilia Skala is excellent as a distant neighbor called grandma. Even a star is the rigid Montana prairie. It is both beautiful and brutal country in which to settle. There are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary. No special effects here, what you see is real! He also has an extraordinarily perfect soundtrack and a fantastic script. Once you see Heartland, you will never forget it. It is worth every 10 years that it arrives here.
