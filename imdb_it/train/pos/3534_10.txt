This is a very unusual film in that the star with higher billing does not literally appear halfway. However, I got caught in the Phantom Lady's hook. Curtis, though competent as the fake prosecutor Scott Henderson, seems a little harsh to be sympathetic to (he should have shaved his mustache) and his behavior when he returned home should have convinced the cops at least to some extent of his innocence. While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone as Jack Marlowe, I found his portrait of the character extraordinarily complex. It's not a bad set. The superb actor character Elisha Cook Jr. is again in excellent shape as the "little man with great ambitions". His percussion in musical numbers added a touch of erotic welcome. This film, however, is played by Ella Raines, very capable and handsome, since the devotee would be Henderson's lover, Carol Richmond. He certainly has talent and his screen presence is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall. This is the first of his works I've seen and I'm definitely inclined to see his other roles. The rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent. All in all a very gratifying noir mystery that, seen today, fully conveys the dark and complex urban world for which it is intended. Recommended, 8/10.
