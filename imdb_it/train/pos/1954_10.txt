I thought this movie did a good job. He was not creative or original like the first, but who expected it to be. It was a lot of fun. the more I think about it the more I like it, and when it comes out on DVD, I will pay the money proudly, to the last penny. Sharon Stone is fantastic, she always is, even if her film is horrible (Catwoman), but this film is not, this is one of those films that will be underestimated for life, and will probably become a classic in 20 years . Don't wait for it to be a classic, watch it now and enjoy it. Don't expect a masterpiece, or something that is compelling and touching, allow yourself to get out of your life and get involved in them. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is fun and I recommend people who haven't seen it see it, because what critics and box office say doesn't always count, you see it for yourself, you don't know never, you could just enjoy it. I recommend my hat for this movie <br /> <br /> 8/10
