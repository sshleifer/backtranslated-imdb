This film contains personalities who interpret their parts so delightfully, I love the ending, when nobody knows what they will do with their lives, but it's great when you see and understand that the priest is right, he's around for two, so what are they doing The other people? The film envelops you in a new life, in experiences, to be able to dream with the other person and reach those dreams. It also shows you life itself, difficult as it is. But it gives you the possibility to choose what you want and what you really need. I hope this comment works for you. The film worked well for me. By the way, I bought the movie;) Take care of yourself.
