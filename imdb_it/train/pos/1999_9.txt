Oliver! the musical is my favorite. The music, the characters, the story. Everything looks perfect. In this version of the timeless classic novel turned into a musical, director Carol Reed brings the Broadway success to the movie screen. <br /> <br /> The transition from musical to musical is not easy. You must have the right voices, the right set, the right script and the right game. All signs indicate yes for this game. It almost seems like it was written for the screen! <br /> <br /> Our story takes place in vibrant old England, where a boy named Oliver manages to get out of the orphanage. He makes his way across the country to London, where he meets a group of juvenile delinquents, headed by Dodger, the smart talking, the pick-pocket quick-pick. The head of this band is called Fagin, an older type who sells all the stolen goods. <br /> <br /> But all is not well in the city of London when Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed and his loving girlfriend Nancy tangle with Oliver, Fagin and his young troops, and the law. What follows is a wonderful love story, affection and great musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Whether you like musicals or not, listen to these songs and you'll hum them all day long. Oliver! it is a triumph in and out of the stage and is a timeless work of art.
