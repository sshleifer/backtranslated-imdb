I saw this movie a few months ago on cable, and it was fantastic. William H Macy is one of my favorite actors, and his performance was simply incredible. It makes you take care of your character, even when it's clearly doing the wrong thing, and Neve Campbell gives a performance that is undoubtedly the best performance I've seen from an actress this year. She is fantastic like a wild young woman who is wise beyond her years. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is just as disturbing as Macy's father, and John Ritter is as good as an asshole stuck in the middle of everything that's happening. <br /> <br /> I'd like it to be in the theater because I think it's a film that should be seen by a wider audience. It's a shame, because it's hell to say that most new movies are coming into the theater now. <br /> <br />
