Dramatic history and arrival history involving free black people in the pre-civil war in New Orleans. Start off slow but steam up again once you've learned about the main characters and the real action can begin. This is not just a story about the exploitation of black women, because these were free people. They may not have had all the rights of whites, but they certainly had more control over their fates than their slave ancestors. The young men and women in this story must each make their own choice on how to live their lives, either to give in to the depravity of the system or live optimistically and contribute to their community. I liked all the characters but my favorites were Christophe, Anna Bella and Marcel.
