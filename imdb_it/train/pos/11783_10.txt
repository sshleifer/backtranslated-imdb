Rock Star: INXS was the best music TV series I've ever seen! He had some of the greatest rock n 'roll songs ever written, performed by 15 very talented singers / artists. He also had (in my opinion) the finest endings, felt good, surprisingly in all TV reality. In fact it made me shed tears of happiness for the winner !!! During the 13 weeks of this TV competition, the viewing audience got to know and become familiar with all the competitors. After 30 episodes, the remaining competitors seemed more friends than some other strangers who challenged each other in a reality TV show. And the fact that INXS was, and still is, one of the biggest rock n 'roll bands, has simply added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful series of realities. If you don't have the recorded series, ROCK STAR: INXS the DVD is a great alternative.
