"Antwone Fisher" tells of a young black enlisted from the United States Navy and the product of child abuse and abandonment (Luke), whose hostility towards others makes him take a ride with the Shrink base (Washington) to introspection, self-evaluation and return to its roots. Pat, sanitized and sentimental, "Antwone Fisher" is a solid film of good quality on the reconciliation of past regrets and closure. The good old Hollywood-style entertainment family values ​​entertainment with a pinch of corn. (B)
