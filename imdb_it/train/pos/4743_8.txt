This is a very strange HK film in many ways. First of all, many of the action sequences are not so funny. The first firefight in the film was simply silly. Not foolish foolish, or even silly, but just silly. This does not mean that there are no great action scenes, but they simply do not reach the level of some of the other films I have seen. The opposite is that this film actually has CHARACTERS, not just people. All the main characters are interesting (except for the bad boss, who is flat like a billiard table) and most are quite well played. All the protagonists of this film are just fun to watch. The dialogue is quite witty and does not seem to lose much in translation. This film is worth seeing, but I hope that the uninitiated American public does not think this is the best service offered by HK.
