What a thrill! Twisted and stimulating. Once again, Sharon Stone flawlessly shows off her wonderful and fascinating character from the author Catherine Tramell. The original basic instinct takes place in San Francisco. The sequel takes place in London, where Catherine has moved. Both hectic cities known for excitement, haute couture ~ and a perfect place for someone like Catherine Trammel to take up residence. David Morrisey, ("Derailed"), plays the smooth role of psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass. The character David Thewlis plays as Roy Washburn with Scotland Yard is a refreshing departure from his role as Lupine in the Harry Potter series. Flashy cars, designer clothes, sex, drama, humor, tension, - all the "basic instincts". Mind that bends everywhere. Great script. From the opening opening scene to the surprise ending, this film is anything but boring! Everyone in the theater was glued to the screen.
