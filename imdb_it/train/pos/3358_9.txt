First of all for this film I have only one word: "wow". This is probably one of the best films that touched me, from his story to his performances, wonderfully played by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. I was very impressed with it, because it really brought depth to the character, as it was a very difficult role. However, the two formed a couple, which surprised me, from beginning to end, showing in the way, a friendship full of love, which develops throughout the day, is established in the film. The story takes some time to move forward, as the introduction of the characters is long, but in the end we are rewarded with a wonderful story about love and humanity. If you get the chance, see, because it's a movie that will stay in your mind for many times. Simply fantastic - 9/10.
