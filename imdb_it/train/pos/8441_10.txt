For all those who liked the series this film will be something to watch. However, it leaves you even more. I loved the way each character (detective) made an appearance. At least with the end of who is the fourth chair because they leave a reason for another film. My hypothesis is obviously Bayless. This as the series was a series of very well combined scenes. This is a series I wanted to live in. Thanks to the cast of some wonderful TVs.
