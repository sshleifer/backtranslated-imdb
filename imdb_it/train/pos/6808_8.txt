1967 In Cold Blood was perhaps more like "the real thing" (Think about it: would we really like to see the real thing?), But it was black and white in a world of colors, and many people don't even know what it was, and there it was the opportunity to do it again for television. Also, if you do it again, you can show some things not shown in the original. Truman Capote's book In Cold Blood was the first "nonfiction novel". Truman's book was not 100% faithful to the true story. I thought the Canadian position was enough for Kansas for a TV movie. Look for the elements of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll: Dick's womanizing, Perry as an aspiring addict, Perry playing blues guitar.
