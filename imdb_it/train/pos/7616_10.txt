Here is an innovative television drama; which so easily mixes a compelling story, brilliantly drawn character development, humor, romance and drama in every episode. Here is a show that sings at its own pace, regardless of whether the audience chooses to follow or not. How many other shows on television these days change so boldly from one season to another? Where most of the other top shows on this site have found a formula that works, that brings viewers and dollars and remained glued to that formula (Prison Break, 24 and Desperate Housewives come to mind) - LOST takes a different path where , even after reaching that level and that winning formula, the executive producer team has the courage to completely reinvent the show to serve their highest goal of compelling storytelling. This is where LOST differs from normal television. This is the so provocative way of conventional TV. And that's why LOST is one of the most innovative and cutting-edge creations of modern television. Forget the opponents: LOST is, has been, and always will be, there to appease his cult after the first and the next public. But it is a testament to his inventiveness that has gathered a fan base that consists of the best of both audiences.
