This film is undervalued. I loved it. It was really sweet and heartfelt. A family that struggles but is not transformed into a dysfunctional family that is so typical of today's films. The film has not made it a problem that they have little money or that they are Dominican Republicans like Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Instead the problem is that Victor is immature and needs to grow. He does it, slowly, at the end of the film. He has a way to go, but it was a sincere attempt to move forward. His grandmother is very pretty and the scene where the boy throws me made me laugh for the longest time. A truly sincere indie
