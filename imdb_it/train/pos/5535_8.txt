The very first picture of the film shows a mountain ridge in the autumn mist of early morning, and my thought was: "This is almost too good". And it continues like this: images of landscapes and animals that look like a series of romantic paintings, each one perfect in every detail. Even the girl's room, her father's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. This may seem old-fashioned and elusive, but it adapts to a story that is in itself a silent beauty, which takes place on the border between life and fairy tale, between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince. I loved every minute. The extreme parsimony of the film, with a simple and slow story, a single actor and almost no special effect, has exerted a strong magic. I therefore find it regrettable that this parsimony has been abandoned in the last few minutes, when suddenly two additional actors are introduced (the girl as an adult woman and her son). Another gap is music, which is often intrusive, similar to Hollywood and sometimes inappropriate: I could not bring an English pop song along with the French glory of the mountain. I went to the film with my two young daughters, but I also recommend it to adults, as they appreciate this type of film. Obviously, not everyone does it.
