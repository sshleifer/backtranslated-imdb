Legendary director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his most beautiful films in his historical career in this very tense and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children. With an A-list cast headed by Philip Seymour Hoffman (an Oscar-winning show here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet has captured not only elements of failed criminal stories like Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories like People common. <br /> <br /> Many viewers could be confused and feel disappointed by the construction of the plot with which Lumet left. Instead of showing it in a linear fashion, he followed Tarantino's route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view, all out of order. Personally I found this very satisfying and let me constantly guess what would happen next. The script is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei, as well as between father and son, Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are totally compelling to watch and Lumet is obviously enjoying himself directing a style that usually doesn't go deeper. A lot of action and suspense to keep the audience for two hours, this is a rare film that does not disappoint for a moment.
