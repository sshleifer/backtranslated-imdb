What a class of British cinema! It's almost time. And a split to start! <br /> <br /> Anyone who is trying to relive a bit of freedom from split youths, this road movie will prove to be the ticket. <br /> <br /> It's a mix between "Withnail and I" and "Easy Rider". The film runs at a solid pace and doesn't let you drift for too long ... Sometimes there are reflexive moments, but I think they are well justified and add to the characters that the actors are playing. At first I was a bit worried about the character of Phil Daniels, but luckily I won half of what was one of the most fun scenes in the whole movie! Generally I found myself laughing out loud through the film, probably bothering some people around me. Oh good. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. This will become a British cult comedy. Worth a visit.
