I really like this movie even though I don't like James Belushi very much. In this film, you can see several big names on the rise, Linda Hamilton and Courteney Cox in particular; Caine's was already big, of course. The plot of this film is simple; it's just like that Sliding Door movie. However it has been said carefree and I like the comic moments in it. It made me try to relive my important moments live, for example, if I took that girl for a movie, and not the other etc. It tells us that the people around us may have taken on different roles in our lives if the slightest details had to change. It also reminds us to be careful about what we want. Life is not always good on the other side as we think; perhaps, what we have now is the best for us, all things considered.
