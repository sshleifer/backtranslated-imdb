"The Last Hard Men" is a typical 1970s western. Most seem inspired by Sam Peckinpah. This too, but director Andrew McLaglan is a John Ford student and this can obviously be shown in many scenes. IMO the beginning is very good. In a way, McLaglan wanted to show the public a journey from civilization to wilderness. In the third part there are some illogical flaws and I complain a little about Charlton Heston. He must play an old ex-man named Sam Burgade, but he has a fantastic physical shape. I've never had the feeling of really having trouble getting on a horse or a rock. For me he didn't seem very motivated as usual in most of his epic films. The same goes for the beautiful Barbara Hershey who plays the sheriff's daughter. Perhaps both had problems with the director or were unhappy with their roles. Hershey and Coburn are not showing their best, but they are still good. What if the writer had John Wayne as Sam Burgade in mind? Even Michael Parks as a modern sheriff is a bit underutilized in his role. On the other hand there is James Coburn as an outlaw Zach Provo. Coburn is a really big villain in this. He is playing the villain between cunning hatred and intelligence. His role and his acting are the best in the film. <br /> <br /> Landscapes and Shootouts are fantastic. The shooting scenes are bloody and the violence seems realistic. Zach Provo and his band have had bloody and violent scenes. What I miss is the typical western action in the middle of the film. I would have appreciated a bank robbery or something similar. Overall it's a fun western movie. Not a great movie, but above average because of a great Coburn, a great start and some bloody and violent scenes.
