Dani (Reese Witherspoon) has always been very close to her older sister Maureen (Emily Warfield) until they both fell in love with their neighbor Court (Jason London). But it is not after a terrible tragedy that the two sisters realize that nothing can keep them apart and that their mutual love will never vanish. <br /> <br /> This was really a heartbreaking story about first love. Probably the most painful story about young love I've ever seen. All the acting is extraordinary and Reese Witherspoon gives a great performance in his first film. I would give The Man in the Moon 8.5 / 10
