You are using the IMDb. <br /> <br /> You gave heavy votes to some of your favorite movies. <br /> <br /> It's something you like to do. <br /> <br /> And that's all for that. Fifty seconds. One world ends, another begins. <br /> <br /> How can a ten be given? I ask those who give this seven or eight ... exactly how could THE FIRST FILM NEVER BE DONE to be better? For the record, long and still open shooting is a great show, a superb innovation, perfectly suited to the situation. And the dog on the bike is a nice touch. All this within fifty seconds. <br /> <br /> The word genius is often abused. <br /> <br /> THIS is genius.
