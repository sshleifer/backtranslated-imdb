I thought it was a beautiful showcase for Mandy's body body. If you don't expect anything else, like smart twists and credible character development, you won't be disappointed. Consider this a Sports Illustrated shot whose character goes around killing people, especially those who threaten to get in between her and her 'Mom' (Suzanna Arquette, who obviously doesn't want to play the sex kitten - leaves it to her daughter ) <br /> <br /> Mandy's face is a little too perfect, but her body is a complete 5-alarm fire, up there in the ranks of Sophia Loren when it comes to natural agitation, a perfect 7-10 relationship between waist and hips and legs beautifully configured, down to the feet. (There must be an ideal configuration of the thighs at the knees, at the calves of the ankles which is quite pleasing to the eye, Mandy is certainly the model for this idealized relationship). <br /> <br /> And without the flat bottom, which seems to be the bane of many, a busty woman with curves everywhere except in the "lower hemispheres". Mandy could have used a double of the body in the back shot to lose the towel as she descended into the candlelit hot tub with victim n. 2 of her blindfolded German boyfriend, but from everything I could see from her bikini photos, she had her ass for it and didn't need a double to prove it. <br /> <br /> Mandy's acting skills had little to do with her impression of a psychotic "Mother's Mom" ​​with the obvious erotic lesbian undertones. His bisexual nature (which he took for a ride in the hot tub after a long flirtation with the German Guy n. 2, who was also his mother's lover) added an additional dimension to a one-dimensional caricature of the female adolescent cornea in conflict with pathological murderous impulses (always from water with men - the ultimate destiny of the Latin housekeeper was modified in the television version for some obscure reason). <br /> <br /> Mandy's Uber-Nordic features coupled with his Uber-voluptuous body could be a blessing or a curse. If Mandy really wants to promote her career as an actress, I'd advise her to immerse herself completely in the Romance languages, particularly in Italian and Spanish - and perhaps in French, though I don't know if they would go for her type. But this would have allowed her to reconcile her face with Bo Derek's body of Vida Guerra - but maybe her face is just a little too northern, and showed too much of her extraordinary body in a cheese film to allow her to advance to any more fame that was appreciated by Michelle Johnson of the 1980s, whose initial fame in Blame it on Rio was followed by a series of skin sklicks that failed to take off. <br /> <br /> Vambo Drule.
