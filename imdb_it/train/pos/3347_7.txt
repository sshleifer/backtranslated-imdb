Robert Mitchum plays the role of Clint Tollinger in this short but tough western: Man With The Gun. Tollinger is a professional city trainer, as in, when a city needs someone to save itself; he is involved to do it. Tollinger's last concert comes as an accident: walking around the city in search of his former adventure, he comes across a city that is played like a puppet by a local gangster. But many citizens begin to regret the day they hired Tollinger, as his way of cleaning up the city becomes very expensive (suddenly High Drifter of the High Plains seems less original). <br /> <br /> Man With The Gun starts as a mediocre western movie, but it starts to surprise you more and more as the movie progresses. What begins as forgettable and run-of-the-mill ends dark and centered on character. The whole movie is shot very well and the cast is a lot of fun. Mitchum is his usual fine here in Man With The Gun - not one of his best shows, Mitchum still has his classic and effective presence on the hard screen in high gear and beats the action-packed, meaningful and shocking scenes of the film just out of the park. Man With The Gun is a nice Western Mitchum and is easily worth it.
