After seeing Deliverance, films like Pulp Fiction don't seem so extreme. Perhaps by today's standards of blood and bullets it doesn't seem so edgy, but if you think this was 1972 and the film had a really sinister core, then it makes you think differently. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie nothing seemed really unusual until I got to the "Dueling Banjos" scene. In that scene the brutality and the edge of this film are really visible. While watching Drew (Ronny Cox, Robocop) going head-to-head with an apparently retarted guy really shows how edgy this movie is. When you think the child has a small banjo, which could probably be done by hand, compared to Drew's beautiful guitar, you can really see how far the four men are from their territory. <br /> <br /> While the plot continues, it is very credible and never extends beyond its limits. But what really sets this film apart, about four businessmen who get more than they expected on a canoe trip, is that director John Boorman (Excalibur) breaks all the characters from simple caricatures or stereotypes. So, while the film enters full horror and suspense, I really cared about all four men and what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> Acting is universally excellent. With Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Enemy of the State) and Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights, Striptease) leading the cast. Jon Voight probably does the hardest thing of all in this movie and that makes his transformation from a family man into a very credible warrior. Unlike Reynolds whose character is a warrior from the beginning, the character of Voight is transformed during the film. Ned Beatty (Life) is also good at an extremely difficult role, being raped by a hillbilly, while Ronny Cox turns into a credible performance. <br /> <br /> One thing that made this movie really powerful for me is that the bad guys were terrifying like no one else I've ever seen. Bill Mckinney and Herbert "Cowboy" Coward were excellent and extremely terrifying as those of Hillbilly. <br /> <br /> Overall Deliverance was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone, except for people with weak stomachs and children. 10/10. See this movie.
