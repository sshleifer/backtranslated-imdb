I loved this movie. It is a film of definite inspiration. It fills you with pride. This film is worth the rent or worth buying. It should be everyone's home. The best movie I've seen in a long time. It will make you angry because everyone is so bad with Carl Brashear, but in the end it gets better. It's a story of romance, drama, action and lots of fun lines to keep you tuned. I love a lot of quotes. I always use them. They help me keep the task of what I want to do. It shows that anyone can make their dreams come true, all they have to do is work for it. It's a long movie, but every time I look at it, I never notice that it's as long as it is. I'm so absorbed by it, that it goes so fast. I love this movie. I watch it whenever I can.
