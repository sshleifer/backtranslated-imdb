Everyone should definitely watch this movie! It's scary, but it doesn't resort to "things that jump over you-to-you-just-to-surprise-you-and-pass-by-how-scary" It's really cool. Watch this awesome movie! The director is Stanley Kubrick, easily the greatest director I've ever lived. Every single one of his films is a masterpiece, including this one. The Shining is about this family that goes to a hotel in the Colorado Rockies as guardians for winters and that has snowed. Well, the house is haunted by ghosts. The boy is psychic. The husband is easily influenced by wicked haunted hotels, and ... well ... HILARITY IS STILL !!!! Not exactly. It becomes this thrilling thriller in which stuff is thrown at the viewer from all different directions, and becomes frightening. Not just the classic "Here's Johnny" scene. It's memorable, but he can't speak for the whole movie. It's one of those things where words don't adequately explain it, and you just have to see it. So go to Netflix and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
