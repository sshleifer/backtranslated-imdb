This film is cold, naked truth. We often think "oh no, it won't happen to me." But can. Drug smuggling is big money and people are often unknowingly (or deceived) doing things for smugglers. The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them, they just wanted an exotic vacation - which turned into a nightmare. People need to know that this type of event is not unlikely or exaggerated - this is a major problem in today's society. <br /> <br /> I will recommend this film to mature viewers because of the understanding needed to truly appreciate this movie. It is very emotional and raw. It is worth looking at and certainly remains in your memory.
