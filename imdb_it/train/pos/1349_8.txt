RKO had a reputation for creating folkloric and homely pieces of Americana. <br /> <br /> Anne Shirley (like Dawn O'Day) has been in the movies since she was little. In 1933 he was in limbo - having played Ann Dvorak as a child in "Three on a Match" (1932) and a "flower girl" in both "This Side of Heaven" and "The Key" both in 1934. George Nicholls Jnr he remembered Anne's work from a previous film and that's how he got this part. He also adopted Anne Shirley as a stage name. The memorable stories are there - Lady of Shallot in a leaky boat, the "stolen" brooch, the "red hair" incident. Anne was so fit for the role of the screaming, moving orphan. It was heartbreaking because of its intensity, its eagerness to please and even its fiery temper. O.P. Heggie was wonderful, since Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley agreed as Marilla. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger, who had also been in the movies as a child, was as good as Diana Barry. Sara Haden showed that she could play someone other than Aunt Millie in the series Andy Hardy, it was Mrs. Barry.
