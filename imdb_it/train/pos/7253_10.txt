It is not certain that an anti-war film can be defined, it shows war at the elite level. These are elite troops who know what they are doing and are proud of it. Even when they are pacifists, they still enjoy the skill level and defeat their enemies, even if it is against being a pacifist. The film is slow and rather quiet and in many ways it is quite docile since war films are more in keeping with today's standards, with no body parts flying away like in modern movies. But it is brutal in other ways, as you see on a personal level. This is more a film of a thinking man. Once you start looking, you don't want to lose anything. The thoughts of men in the film and their interactions, is what the film is about - not the fighting itself or a great exciting storyline. This is perhaps called a war triller. <br /> <br /> If you like the skills of war, if you are reading or viewing programs on SAS and so on, you WANT TO WATCH THIS FILM !!!!! <br /> <br /> Comparable films are The Hill (1965) with Sean Connery, 49th Parallel (1941) with a cast of famous actors, The Naked and the Dead (1958) with Cliff Robertson. All are unusual in their own way and show war on a personal level. To enjoy!
