Elmer Fudd is laughing as he lies in his chair and is reading his comic book, his dog sitting comfortably next to sleeping in front of the fireplace. Everything is quiet until a bouncing flea arrives. (The flea is dressed with a peasant sombrero and carries a folder with the name "A. Flea" on it.) He takes out his telescope and sees the dog. (We see a big shot of the dog's ass and the flea whistles in excitement, shouting "T-Bone!" Then he sings, "There is food around the corner, there is food around the corner!" /> <br /> This creates the texture of this nice but hateful flea that torments the poor dog. The bastard is hilarious while reacting to the flea. <br /> <br /> The designs of his huge teeth that creak right next to the fleeing flea are intelligent and the dog's dialogue made me laugh out loud a few times. This could be the funniest dog I've ever seen in a cartoon! The poor dog, under the threat of having to bathe, does not react when the stupid flea causes him pain. It is almost painful to observe how the flea uses picks, hunting hammers and the like on the dog. He puts firecrackers in the dog behind. It's brutal!
