Yes, as incredible as it may be, in 1968 a musical won the Oscar for best film - and it was the third musical to win that award over a period of five years, the first being My Fair Lady in 1964 and then The Sound of music in 1965. The difference between My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Oliver! however it is Oliver! it is immeasurably better! No comparison. The first two films are tasteless and moist spaghetti compared to Oliver, extraordinarily robust. The acting is great; the songs are fantastic; the story is great and the dance is fantastic. This film is dynamic, topical, relevant to the human experience and, unlike the whimsical New York gangs, Oliver! offers a representation of poverty in nineteenth-century London, which evokes sympathies without condescension. Oliver Reed was a great actor and he shows it in Oliver! The other actors and actresses, particularly Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are equally wonderful and offer powerful portraits of characters that evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures.
