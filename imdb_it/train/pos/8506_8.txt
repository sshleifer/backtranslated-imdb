. . . but it was on a UHF channel and the reception was very confusing. I would really like to own the film, since the reason I saw it is that I am a bus driver and at the time I saw this film I was driving the bus of this model. It was only (during his murder trial, about 15 years later) that I vaguely remember that OJ was one of the stars in it. I only remember that he was the driver and that the bus was fired and driven wildly. I've been looking for this film everywhere without any results, since I saw it in the mid-80s. I liked the movie, I don't usually watch thrillers, but after reading the summary in the TV guide, and seeing its beginning (even if confused) I stayed for the whole thing.
