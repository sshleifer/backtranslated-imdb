My wife and I have seen this whole series at least three times. I can't imagine how it could be better. This is not the "complete" story of World War II, no library could contain a similar story, but it is the best summary of that story. Lots of details, lots of personal stories, and still keeps the big picture in sight. <br /> <br /> Olivier's narrative is excellently written and, of course, superb. The interviews are from all sides, except Russian, because producers were not allowed to talk to many Russians. It is very important to have this complete program on DVD. Let us treasure our copy. <br /> <br /> The producers do an excellent job in providing images and actions where there was hardly anyone existing in any archive: there are almost no convoy and underwater battles films, for example, but still, the episode on this topic is very well done.
