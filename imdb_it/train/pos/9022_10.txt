Well, Tenko is undoubtedly the best British TV program ever, the performances, the direction, the casting, the suspense, the drama ..... everything is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Even though the show fell a little later in its last season, this final film has nicely gathered threads and has woven a superb story for show fans and newbies. I can't recommend this movie more, find it and watch it. But I recommend watching the series first, because the first 2 seasons are even better than this fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> An obvious (10/10)
