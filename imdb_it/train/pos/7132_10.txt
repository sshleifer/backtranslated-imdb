A moving film. The usual superb acting of John Thaw, recently passed. A man who was always so modest. He was one of the top 10 British actors of my time. <br /> <br /> Can be remembered for his famous role as inspector Morse. Like Jack Regan in the hit television series of the 70s, Sweeney and as a lawyer in Kavanah QC. A must see for the whole family and a great DVD for my collection. The filming will bring back some memories for people who remember Great Britain in time of war and certainly those who have been evacuated from London to escape the German attacks. The interaction between the two main characters. Tom and the boy William were really well acted and true to Michelle Magorian's book.
