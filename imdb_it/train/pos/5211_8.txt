After their bad divorce from the Disney Company (with Disney holding the Miramax brand) the Weinstein Company seems to specialize in above-average films that are then under-promoted and seen by few. THE FLOCK is a great example. <br /> <br /> A story about public servants who have the terrible task of keeping track of registered sex offenders, this photo will tell you more about the sexual criminals of an entire season of Law and Order - SVU. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere offers his absolute best performance, as the agent with the soft voice is worn down by the activity. Claire Danes for once has the opportunity to enter a solid role (instead of the garbage she normally gets stuck in) and does most of the beginner's game. Cinematography, rhythm, editing, everything is top notch - and I have not seen any trace of the attention-deficit-disorder camera that jumps around or excess camera cuts others have complained about. The topic is treated in moderation, but it is still a difficult topic and could make you sick. <br /> <br /> Fifty years ago there was almost no problem with the types of sex crimes shown here in abundance that shock even the tired. Then came the decisions of the Supreme Court that simultaneously tied the hands of the police when the "rights" of sexual perverses were opened and America was transformed into a paradise for shoppers for sexual perversions, both willing and unwillingly. Each of these passages was greeted with praise by the Liberals, who celebrated the evil deeds of Warren's Court with glossy covers on Time and Newsweek. Everyday liberals have also praised the court's action and mocked those who disagree. In 2007, how many Americans know that the kind of pornography that describes the savage violence and torture of young women - can be signed, and the delivery of it is subsidized by the periodic discount rate at the US post office. Only part of the problem - a problem that can tear everyone's family to shreds. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere is a liberal, but gives his best in his performance here. Perhaps in his mature age he gained a measure of wisdom.
