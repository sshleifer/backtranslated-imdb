I try to watch it most of the time every day, and even though I've seen it for the last 4 years, I haven't seen every episode. <br /> <br /> The show concerns Danny Tanner who is a guy who makes news for the sport. His wife is killed by a car accident by a drunk driver and asks Jesse, an Elvis maniac with a motorcycle and has an obsession with his hair. Joey, an adult guy who plays comedy and always has cartoon voices to take care of his three girls, Donna Joe, they call her DJ, Stephinie who is the second oldest and Michelle, the youngest. <br /> <br /> They all live under the same roof without anyone helping them. <br /> <br /> Later on the show, Jesse receives a girl and is later married to her and has twins, Nicki and Alex. (this starts to happen in the new seasons) This show is fantastic, if you like life in Zack and Cody's Suite, That's So Raven, Boy Meets world, and Designing Woman, you'll love it. (Starts to improve in the final seasons) Look at it, you'll love it!
