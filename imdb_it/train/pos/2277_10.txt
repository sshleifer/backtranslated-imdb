While the film feels a little long sometimes, it's worth it. Gordon directs in a style that recalls the writing styles of Vonneguts. Ruthless, thoughtful, ironic, bizarre and obscure, this is a film that will stay with you for a while, imploring answers to impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman and Arkin are all incredible. Even Sheryl Lee is wonderful, in a role that will remind us of Lynch fans of her days Laura / Maddy. Don't miss this!
