This film is so wonderful, it's hard to find words to describe it. This is the only time I can't decide which one is better, the book or the movie. Whoopis Goldberg is fantastic, and Oprah Winfrey, such a good actress, could be fun, happy and sad at the same time. All together the film was well directed by Steven Speilberg and should not be abandoned. 9/10
