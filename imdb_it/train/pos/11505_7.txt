A couple of years ago I bought (and enjoyed) the MGM dual feature DVD of Kolchak's two TV films, THE NIGHT STALKER (1971) and THE NIGHT STRANGLER (1972). When the universal set of the next TV series came out, I intended to buy it immediately - but the rumors related to playback problems with the dreaded DVD-18s prevented me from adding it to my collection; recently, I placed an online order that consisted of a series of discounted Universal Box Sets and decided to also collect the KOLCHAK 3-Discer. <br /> <br /> After looking at it now, I can safely say that I don't regret having acquired a little this beloved (if short-lived) crime / horror series: it could follow a standardized formula - the tenacious journalist and resourceful Carl Kolchak, played wonderfully by Darren McGavin, enters the hair of everyone with his attitude (agitator editor Simon Oakland, fellow long-suffering, assorted authority figures, a myriad of monsters and villains), faces the inevitable ( and usually supernatural) threat, but, in the end, she is forced to keep her story hidden - but winning (further enhanced by an impressive line-up of guest stars and behind-the-scenes awards), making the show a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> That said, the quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets offered give results with specific effects of make-up and make-up that sometimes leave a lot to be desired (for example, the werewolf in the 'eponymous entrance and the stupid alligator creature in the last episode) - not to mention the fact that these were limited to 50-minute programs and destined for the consumption of the family to start rather preclude a simplified and complete rendering of its psychological and metaphysical themes often intriguing (in the case of the werewolf, once again, he has never seen anyone bite but, in a somewhat crazy way, is made to simply throw people around)! <br /> <br /> While the cynical narrative of the hero does much to drag one into the imaginative plots, there is a good deal of relief from the comedy involved in each episode (often, but not exclusively, that revolves around the relationship of McGavin with Oakland or geeky reporter Jack Grinnage) - not to mention a reasonable atmosphere (the setting, for the most part, is Chicago) and suspense. To make the ride even more enjoyable, there's a soundtrack by Gil Melle 'and Jerry Fielding. <br /> <br /> For the record, the monsters encountered (but not always defeated) by Kolchak throughout the series are: a Jack The Ripper shoot, a variety of cults (voodoo, Native American, Aztec), aliens, vampires, werewolves (bypassing his overly familiar concept having this particular episode entirely set on a cruise ship!), Doppelganger, Satanist, swamp creature, mass of electricity, robot, apeman, witch, headless motorcyclist, succubus, the armor of a knight who takes a murderous life (the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast) with John Dehner as a police captain, Hans Conried and Robert Emhardt), Helen Of Troy (!) And crocodile. Some of the actors (other than those who play Kolchak's collaborators) return to the same roles - Keenan Wynn and Ramon Bieri (both as law officers), John Fiedler (as a shrewd morgue assistant) and Richard Kiel as two distinguished nemeses of the 'hero. If I were forced to choose the best (or funniest) episodes, I lean towards HORROR IN THE HEIGHTS (co-starring Phil Silvers and Abraham Sofaer) and the aforementioned THE KNIGHTLY MURDERS - while, as the weakest, I go for THE WEREWOLF (due to reasons I have already explained) and CHOPPER (based on a story invented by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale!). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the set contains no extras: it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the many concepts discussed in KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER, as well as putting the series in the context of where the TV was at the time of its aired original, or even denoting the enduring influence it had on the seemingly endless series of popular science fiction series today. In fact, Kolchak himself - in a much younger and apparently more obscure role - returned to a 2005 revival; this version is available at my local DVD rental shop ... but, for various reasons, I'm not sure I would like to verify it right after the 1974-5 classic!
