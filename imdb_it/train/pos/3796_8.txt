Jim McKay has made one of the best films you will see throughout the year. The silent simplicity of this film attracts you from the opening film and never gives up. There is not a single false note in the entire film. Not one. Everything works. The freehand camera never ever distracts where it should be. The three young women whose lives we follow are always real. There is not a single beat in which the public is reminded that we are watching actresses playing a role. These are just real girls trying to find themselves. There is no political agenda, hidden or not. This is the cinema at its lowest level, and although it will probably only be seen by a handful of spectators, it deserves a much wider version. a special hat for Hugh Hefner for providing the directors with the money to get this important film. I can't wait to see what Mr. McKay will do next.
