Sidney Stratton has difficulty maintaining jobs in various textile factories mainly due to his experimentation in textile laboratories. Stratton is experimenting with a formula for a new fabric that would create the ultimate fabric, one that never gets dirty, never wrinkles or wears out. When Stratton eventually creates the fabric, he creates enemies in all the textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money since a mill has exclusive rights), so Stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in England. The film is ideal and only Ealing could have done it. Guiness's performance (and a big helping cast like Greenwood, Thesiger and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction make the film a pleasure, but the true hero is the story itself, a beautiful satire for business and industry with elements additional drama, romance and suspense. Evaluation, 8.
