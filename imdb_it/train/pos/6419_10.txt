This film is an excellent military film. It may not be an excellent Hollywood movie, but it doesn't matter. Hollywood has a reputation for sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment, but this is not the case with this film. Other reviewers found this film too slow for their tastes, but ?? like a retired soldier ?? I appreciate the rhythm that the film crew deliberately used to tell their story as completely as possible, given the two hours and nine minutes provided. The story itself has been told and repeated several times, but remains for a professional soldier ?? and an African American in this ?? to report on the story presented by the film crew, and how it presents the US Navy to the world. The story of Brashear's work to become a Navy Diver, and his life as a Navy beyond his degree, is not the only story that is presented. There, I also recounted how Master Chief Petty Officer on Sunday challenged the illegal order of his Commanding Officer that the second-class Petty Officer Brashear would not go through his trial dive, no matter how well he did, and paid the price of a loss of a strip and a change of assignment. He also told the true story of how Brashear found the third hydrogen bomb lost in the Atlantic Ocean off the Spanish coast in the 1950s, and how he saved the life of another sailor who was on the line of the line that would be broken he in two if Brashear hadn't pushed him away and shot himself. It was a complex story that was worth telling, and I'd admit that two hours and nine minutes weren't enough to tell the whole story, and from the DVD scenes I deleted I can say that the crew did their best to tell a story history as complete as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to see such a great story told so completely and to see the traditions and honor of the navy preserved so naturally and fully.
