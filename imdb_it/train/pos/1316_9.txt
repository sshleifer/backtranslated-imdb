I just finished watching this finely designed and beautifully acted / directed movie. He was undecided whether I would waste time watching a movie on the Lifetime Movie Network due to the horrible distraction announcements. Reading the previous comments convinced me to try. After all the worst that could happen would be that I could fall asleep during one of the boring but long spray bug announcements. So why did I see it? mainly because when IMDB gives a movie a "WEIGHTED MEDIA" OF 5.8 THE STATISTICAL AVERAGE OF WHO WAS 7.3 It must be a sure success. <br /> <br /> I was totally happy to have had the time to see this movie, commercial smallpox and everything. Helen Hunt continues to amaze me with her ability to take on difficult roles by adapting her main character to fit every role. <br /> <br /> The portrait that he painted in this film of the police officer, hard but noticeably human, was beautifully executed. When the scene requires a quick and timely verbal report, he can stand up with any actor. Yet he is adept at providing emotional response volumes without uttering a word based solely on facial expression and body language. Without the ads, which by design kill the continuity of every good movie, this would have been a real cure. I gave a 9.0
