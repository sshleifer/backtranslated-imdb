When I saw this movie for the first time, I was with my father. He encouraged me to watch this film because it was one of his favorites. After watching the film it immediately became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> River Runs Through It talks about two brothers who each take a different path in life. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is the older of the two brothers and is on the path of education. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is the rebellious little brother who travels on a path full of obstacles. The film follows these characters while everyone follows their own path. <br /> <br /> There is no downside to this movie. You will be entertained all the way. The acting, the direction and the script are all perfect. The two exceptional things are the cinematography and the score. Both envelop you in the world that Robert Redford creates for you. <br /> <br /> This is a great all-around movie that is destined to be a classic. It's safe in my book. If you haven't seen this movie, look at it as soon as possible because it will stay with you forever.
