Corbin Bernsen offers an extraordinarily intense and compelling performance like Dr. Alan Feinstone, a wealthy and successful Beverly Hills dentist who is obsessed with perfection. When he discovers that his adorable blonde trophy wife betrays him and the IRS starts to haunt him for fiscal problems, Feinstone crashes under pressure and goes around violently. The director Brian Yuzna, working from an appropriately dark, witty and demented script by Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paoli and Charles Finch, exposes the seething neurosis and psychosis that boil under the shabby and clean well-groomed surface of the respectable rich America delightfully full mischievous. Furthermore, Yuzna further strengthens the macabre sense of humor of the black gallows. Bernsen shines positively as Dr. Feinstone; expertly projects a disturbing underlying creepiness that lies just beneath Feinstone's deceptively calm and reassuring veneer. The supporting cast is equally excellent: Linda Hoffman in the role of Feinstone's brooding bitch wife, Brooke, Earl Boen in the role of IRS agent Marvin Goldblum, Molly Hagan as an animated assistant Jessica, Patty Toy in the role of lively assistant Karen, Jan Hoag in the role of manager of the Candy office, Virginya Keehne is the sweet and clumsy teenager Sarah, Ken Foree as Detective Gibbs, complete and unscrupulous, Tony Noakes as the equally keen Gibbs companion Detective Sunshine, Michael Stadvec as a muffin seasoner for the stud pool Matt, and Mark Ruffalo as on the make sleazeball Steve Landers. The first-class f / x tricks are just as bloody, coarse and shocking as they should be. The refined cinematography of Levie Isaaks boasts many fantastic inclined camera angles and some tasty magnified close-ups. Alan Howarth's vibrant soundtrack also hits the spot where the meat crawls. A pleasantly deformed delight.
