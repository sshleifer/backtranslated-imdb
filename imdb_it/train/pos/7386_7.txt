OK, so the Oscars seem to be advertised a little more each year. And I was rooting for "Gosford Park" to win (come on, Robert Altman had earned an Oscar for years!). That said, I think it was time for an African American to win the best actress. Unlike the previous reviewer, the role of Halle Berry in "Monster's Ball" was much more original than that of Nicole Kidman in "Moulin Rouge"; I never thought I'd mention the latter for nothing, especially in a year that saw "Mulholland Dr.". Among the things I had planned were the things about the September 11th attacks; I knew they were going to say something about freedom. Yes, yes. Robert Redford should know better. But unlike the previous reviewer, Whoopi Goldberg is not the worst guest (among the former presenters was Bob Hope, for whom I have no respect); I really liked his John Ashcroft jab. <br /> <br /> So even though I wouldn't have given the best movie of "A Beautiful Mind", "The 74th Annual Academy Awards" I still liked (I have to admit, I like the Oscars more than my own birthday). And the next day, while my parents used to hang out in Bandalier, New Mexico - it was spring - I thought to myself when Jim Broadbent won his Oscar, most people looked at "Jim who ?!" I wonder if Woody Allen will never attend the Oscars again.
