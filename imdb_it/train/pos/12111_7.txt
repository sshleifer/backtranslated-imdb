When I started watching this anime I never thought that something about making bread could be interesting, but fortunately I was wrong. From the moment I started watching it, the souls have just entered the world of bakery, I was captured. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage of this anime is the humor, which is very clever and very funny, with some recurring gags. But the animation, the soundtrack and the character development are below average, while these disadvantages are not seen so much in the first few episodes, because of the excellent work on this anime, it really starts to show in the last 20 episodes , when recurrent reactions and gags age and are not as fun as before. <br /> <br /> For my part, if this anime ended with episode 52 I would have given a 9, but the last one leaves only a bitter aftertaste, which unfortunately cannot be swept away by the impressive 50 episodes. <br /> <br /> 7/10
