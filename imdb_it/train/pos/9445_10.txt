This is without doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen. The first time I saw him I was about 9 or 10 years old. I started watching before the rape scene. And when I saw it I was really shocked to think "what kind of sick movie is this?" Today I saw it from the beginning and I really understood how beautiful this film is. It's exciting, scary, shocking and in its own unique way of disturbing. But the best thing is the ending in which the public is shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lives. They will torture their conscience and worry about the bodies found in that river for the rest of their lives. And there's nothing they can do about it, it's something they have to live with. This ending is one of the most unhappy endings in film history and very clever, brilliant and horrible <br /> <br /> And acting is also exceptional, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds. Magnificent acting in this film. All in all, John Boorman has created one of the best films in the history of cinema based on the novel by Dick Chaney. A must see for all movie lovers
