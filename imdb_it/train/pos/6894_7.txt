Men can enslave Lollo, if they want (or his lollos - he gave his name in slang terms for breasts in French), but the ladies have an even more tasty morsel in the divine Gerard Philipe, which is not only beautiful but can act . Don't be discouraged if your version doesn't have subtitles because in this simple and fascinating story of love and war, in which everything is right, they are not necessary. All you need to know is that, at the beginning of the film, Lollobrigida reads Philipe's palm and tells him that he will marry the king's daughter. From then on the story is clear enough from the Gallic gestures and from running, jumping and playing with the sword. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, the obviousness of the story and the heavy tone become a bit tiring, and it is annoying that the French seem to consider themselves too superior to Hollywood to even worry about proving the plausibility of the his exciting stunts. And of course the non-Francophone lacks the occasional piece of ooh-la-la, such as: Girl virtuous: I must tell you that my heart belongs to Fanfan. Seducer: My dear, what made you think I was interested in that bagatella?
