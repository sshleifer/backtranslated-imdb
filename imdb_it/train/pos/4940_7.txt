This film is about human relationships. Fascinating, fun and well written, with a meaningful text. It looks like Morgan Freeman definitely enjoyed the set. Good music Paz Vega is a beautiful and intelligent woman. I really like acting. A woman like her is a good motivator for learning Spanish. From the moment Morgan Freeman meets the nice Paz Vega, the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers who learn to care about where their lives are headed. 10 articles or less is about the joy of living. If you like this movie, see also The Pursuit of Happiness with Will Smith and his son. That is not an action movie or a naked comedy. It is human relations.
