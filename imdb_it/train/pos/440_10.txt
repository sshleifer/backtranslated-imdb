My favorite movie of all time. A work of the caliber of the Oscars of all those involved, both in front of and behind the camera. The screenplay is perfect and fine-tunes the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfactory way, unlike the novel. The care with which the other protagonists were designed is a tribute to writer Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty should have won Oscars for director Mike Newell and director of photography Rex Maidment. It is by far the best work by Josie Lawrence and has transformed my opinion of Joan Plowright. After seeing this movie at least 50 times, I can't find fault. The music of the famous composer Richard Rodney Bennet is a marvel.
