This film is brilliant in every way. It touches on the complexity of love relationships in a meaningful way, but never takes lessons. The script never fades to any character, not even the unfortunate Johnny. In addition, it benefits from spot management, production design, casting and performance. The fact that Cher is so perfect in the film and is more unlike "Cher" than it has ever been is a wonder to me. I look at Moonstruck at least once a year and I just saw it again this Christmas Eve with my 16-year-old twin daughters and they too loved it. It has something for everyone with a heart and in the end it fills you with joy.
