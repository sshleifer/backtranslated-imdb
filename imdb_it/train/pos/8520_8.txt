I thought the movie was actually pretty good. I liked the acting and it moved well. The director really seemed to grasp the story he was trying to say. I have to see the biggest budget coming out today, obviously they had a lot more money to throw it but it was very watchable. When you see a movie like this on a limited budget, you have to take that into consideration when you watch it. There were some things that could have been better but most are budget related. The acting was pretty good, the F / X and the stunts were well done. A couple of extraordinary people were the people who played the asst camera. and the boy who played the child. This type of film made LA work, and this went well.
