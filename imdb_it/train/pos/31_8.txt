Once upon a time in a castle ...... Two little girls are playing in the garden castle. They are sisters. A blonde girl (Kitty) and a brunette (Evelyn). Evelyn steals Kitty's doll. Kitty chases Evelyn. Walking down long corridors, they reach the room where their grandfather, sitting in an armchair, reads the newspaper. Kitty complains about Evelyn, while Evelyn is looking at a photo on the wall with interest. Evelyn begins to repeat over and over: "I am the red lady and Kitty is the black woman". Suddenly Evelyn grabs a dagger nearby and pierces Kitty's doll and then cuts it (the doll). A fight ensues. And Evelyn almost uses the dagger against Kitty. The grandfather intervenes and the worst is avoided. <br /> <br /> Later, the grandfather tells them the legend linked to the image hanging on the wall in front of them, in which a lady dressed in black is stabbing a lady dressed in red: <br /> <br /> "Long ago, a red lady and a black lady lived in the same castle, they were sisters and they hated each other. One night, for reasons of jealousy, the black lady came in. The red lady stabbed seven times and a year later the red lady left her grave, killing six innocent people, and her seventh victim was the black lady, and once in a hundred years, the events are repeated in this castle and the redhead kills six innocent victims before killing the black lady herself. "<br /> <br /> Grandfather ends his story by saying that according to legend, in sixteen years, the red queen should come again and kill seven times. But he assures them that this is just an old legend. <br /> <br /> Sixteen years pass ..... <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of the film. There are many twists and surprises in the film. It is better for you to forget the logic (if you really analyze it, the story doesn't make sense) and simply follow the film with its wonderful colors, beautiful women, clothes, tasteful decor, lighting effects and soundtrack beauty. <br /> <br /> Enjoy Barbara Bouchet, Sybil Danning, Marina Malfatti, Pia Giancaro, among other goddesses. There is a Sybil Danning nude lying on a sofa that is something to dream about. And don't forget: the lady in red kills seven times! <br /> <br /> If you liked "The Red Lady ..." check also "The night that Evelyn came out of the Tomb".
