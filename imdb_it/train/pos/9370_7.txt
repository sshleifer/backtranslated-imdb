I had never heard of this film before seeing it, I was wondering if it was an independent film, and I was right, but with a good cast I decided to try it. In essence, Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the city of Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for work, and meets the owner of the bar Wayne Brown (Pleasantville's JT Walsh) who is given a large sum of money, exchanged for a killer who hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct it, takes the money and goes to warn Suzanne, and after she has made a counteroffer, he decides he must leave. When Wayne knows his true identity, he chases Michael by shooting a big gun until he gets into a car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realizes that Lyle is the killer he exchanged, and quickly retires. He returns to Suzanne and, knowing that they are both in danger, they plan to leave the city together and add another complication to each other. However, before leaving, Suzanne insists on stealing a large sum of money in the safe. Obviously things will not go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle approach them, and Lyle forces them and now he links Wayne to go and get the money buried. In the end, Lyle and Wayne both get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne ride together on a moving train, but it's obvious that she cares more about money, and also gets what she deserves. Played by Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Vice Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, except perhaps a disgust of Boyle, are all beautiful and dandy, and have a good feeling noir for a black thriller. Very good!
