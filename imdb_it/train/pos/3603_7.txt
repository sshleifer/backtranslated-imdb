"Girlfight" is much more than an approaching story than a fight movie. And what a relief to have one in an urban school, with realistic and realistic Latinists and a credible use of the Brooklyn project's settings. <br /> <br /> It made me realize that practically all Hollywood high school films are set in luxurious suburbs or small towns. (Even the somewhat comparable "Love and Basketball" centered on teenage African Americans was set in the suburbs.) While these children share some of the same problems among colleagues, these problems narrow with respect to the other struggles of these children, where the diploma high school could be the most important result of their life. <br /> <br /> The feminist element here is compelling in its originality, as you hold your breath to see if it can have a relationship - and a victory - on its terms. A lot of public sympathy goes to the guy who is challenged to stand up in a situation of gender bending expectations. <br /> <br /> The film drags a bit here and there, but this is not a "Rocky" economic thrill to fight movies, since the practices and struggles have complex outcomes, and all relationships - especially with fathers and paternal figures - occupy a central place with respect to the central ring. <br /> <br /> In the end there were a lot of interesting music titles, but I didn't really notice the songs. <br /> <br /> (originally written 10/7/2000)
