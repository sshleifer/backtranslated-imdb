A short comedy LAUREL & HARDY. The Boys come to sweep the chimneys at the home of Professor Noodle, a mad scientist who has just perfected his serum for rejuvenation. Stan and Ollie continue with their DIRTY WORK, spreading destruction inside the house and on the roof. Then the Professor wants to try his new potion ... <br /> <br /> A very funny little movie. The finish is a little rough, but much of the slapstick that leads to it is terrifying. Particularly good is Stan's and Ollie's race at the opposite ends of the chimney. That's Lucien Littlefield as a professor.
