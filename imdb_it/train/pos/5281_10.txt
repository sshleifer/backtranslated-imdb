this is not "Bonnie and Clyde" or "Thelma and Louise", but it is a good road movie. set his two main characters gently and easily. viewers quickly learn the underlying tensions, which is a tribute to the director. there is the young French (and English) son who wants to do well in France, he has a French girl and he drinks alcohol, parties like young people do. And there is his Arabic (and French) Moroccan father who devoutly follows his Muslim faith, with generosity and wisdom of the elderly and who rejects the new culture that surrounds him (like cell phones). the film could explore a very powerful policy - the strange couple crosses the former Yugoslavia, crosses Turkey and then crosses the Middle East to reach Mecca. these are areas where Muslim populations have been involved in wars, repression, ethnic cleansing; where dictators have pursued torture and summary executions to maintain power and where religious communities are in constant mortal struggle with each other. yet the film moves through those places and possibilities with only hints of such programs. the relationship between the two is the key to this film, and faith, politics are the background. it seems to say that we are all human and that we must understand and take care of each other in order to manage well in this world. certainly not "Natural Born Killers" and it is better this way.
