Certain elements of this film are dated, of course. An all-white crew, for example. And like most Pre-Star Wars Science Fiction, it tends to take too long to admire. <br /> <br /> But, however, no film has ever captured the flavor of Golden Age Science Fiction like this, even down to the use of "electronic tones" to provide the musical score. Robbie the Robot embodied the Asimov robots and was the inspiration for everything that followed, from C3PO to Data. <br /> <br /> The plot, of course, is "The Tempest" by Shakespeare. Morbius is Prospero, and an exiled magician who finds his kingdom invaded by intruders ... It was a film that treated science fiction as an adult genre, perhaps the first.
