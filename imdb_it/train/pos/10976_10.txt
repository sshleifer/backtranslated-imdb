This is why I love this site! I saw this film in the 1980s on British television. Over the years it's one that I wanted to learn more about as it has remained with me as one of the most extraordinary things I've ever seen in my life. With a few key words to remember it, I tracked the film here and a lot of information, including the fact that it's about to become an off-Broadway musical! <br /> <br /> Interesting, unlike the previous commentator, I don't remember finding this film sad or exploitative. On the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between mother and daughter has remained etched in the mind as a testimony of great strength, honor and dignity. You can think ironically, considering the squalor of their lives. Perhaps it is because I live in Britain, where the fading grandeur has a consolidated language in the life of old money, where squalor is often tolerated as a proof of good education; I saw it as a rare and unique portrait of enormous spirit, profound and profound humor, whose extremely fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it balance and respect. In a sense, I was sorry to see it discussed as a "cult". Over the years, as it faded into my mind, the brightest shone, especially as an exceptional and extraordinary television experience. It was such a deeply private exhibition, it seems strange to think that it becomes so public as to be a New York musical. But perhaps somewhere, the daughter will be amused by such a result. It is she who will have the last laugh, maybe ... (They did a musical with her before you, Jackie O ')
