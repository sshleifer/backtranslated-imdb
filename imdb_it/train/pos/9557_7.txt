I love this anime! I was laughing out loud with all the jokes and the violence (mostly "girlfriend" of Akane Ranma, reluctant but short-lived) is so disgusting but Ranma deserves it but does his best to make amends ... awkwardly. The main character Ranma goes to China to train only to fall in the damned spring of Jusenkkyo and turns into a girl when she is sprayed by cold water. From then on it is pure chaos one after another. Among the stand outs include the deranged brother and sister sister of Kuno and Kodachi, the sexy Shampoo, the perverted Happosai that cause problems to our hero / heroine. However, it is the egoistic parent of Ranma, Genma, who ends up being the culprit for the confusion most of the time. If anyone wants an anime that is fun, this is it. It's nicer and better with Japanese dub.
