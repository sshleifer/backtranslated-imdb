There are movies and there are movies. Films are often "cinematographic" snacks, while films are true works of art. Fraulein Doktor is certainly well positioned in the latter. Like many spectators, I was very impressed with the battle scenes, but the intensity of the central character's portrait is what I consider the most exciting quality of the film. Having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of Germany, all the while in the grip of morphine addiction, Ms. Fraulein is treated in a very squalid high German command despite all her efforts. The scene in which the Doktor is transported on the back seat of a Mercedes Benz control car, alone, desolate and sobbing, is perhaps one of the saddest and yet most truthful depictions of a "spy" in life. Only the emotional pain presented by Richard Burton in the Spy that came from the cold is approaching. Fraulein Doktor is a much deeper film than what can be achieved with a singular vision. I only hope that its producers consider it appropriate to publish it on DVD so that those who have never experienced it can, and those who have seen it can again (perhaps again and again) enjoy this exceptional film.
