This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris, a high school baseball science / coach teacher, who is inspired by his players to try the pros and fulfill his dream of playing in the majors for a long time. Dennis Quaid, not a stranger to sports films, plays Morris with enough conviction to make the part work and the producers do a credible job of recreating real-world events that have brought Morris a short time as a reliever pitcher rays of the devil from Tampa Bay. The first half of the film, which deals with his group of High School Baseball players (who all seem too old to be in high school) is less effective and probably a little too long. Overall, the film suffers from some stimulation problems and some extra subplots that we probably could have done without. However, it is still a fairly engaging film with an inspirational theme that shows once again that baseball is the national pastime for a reason. GRADE: B-
