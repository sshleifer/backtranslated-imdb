I rented this movie from Netflix for two reasons: I was in the mood for what I thought would be a silly sci-fi 50s fool and why it's Superman's first feature film. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes, I found myself completely engaged and very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> An experimental oil well has penetrated about six miles from the earth and is closed by the sponsor. Lois and Clark show up to get the scoop but are disappointed that the deepest well ever drilled will no longer be in use. A day later, strange events at the well create a more appropriate story for Clark Kent's Superman. It appears that the radioactive Mole Men invaded from their house six miles deep near the center of the earth. <br /> <br /> Supermen and the Mole Men is a piece of simplistic but well-made social realism. Released in 1951, played by a leading actor who served in World War II, the moral of the story seems to be that Americans are just as capable of becoming fascists as anyone else. To bring this point home in a typical Superman way, Reeves even accuses the lynching chasing the Mole Men of being "Nazi" at some point. <br /> <br /> Even in the 1950s, the science behind this film was non-existent. Six miles of drilling through the continental crust would not have even penetrated the upper mantle, not to mention the "empty center of the earth" - which, in any case, does not exist. Forgivable, keep in mind that this film is based on a golden vintage comic. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit uneven. Although the Molemen are interesting, a bit creepy and well represented, there are several Corman scenes that spend too much time redundantly showing their strange behavior. The script is smart and cheap. By today's standards, the costume is poor, but for the moment, the special effects and costume of this movie have been pretty good. Cinematography is also generally very good and acting is much better than one might expect. I was particularly impressed with Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.
