The great Vincent Price has made many fantastic horror films, some of which are among the greatest jewels of all time. Price's greatest successes were undoubtedly his films in the 1960s, with films like Roger Corman's brilliant cycle (still the greatest horror cycle of all time), "Witchfinder General" (1968) by Michael Reeves or "The Last Man" by Ubaldo Ragona. on Earth "(1964) which marks the salient points of the career of this brilliant man. The films that made the man famous and that made him the immortal icon of horror that is, date back to the 50s, with "House of Wax" (1953) which marks his rise to fame "The Mad Magician" of 1954 follows a plot very similar to that of his successful predecessor This does not mean, however, that this film is not a gem original, deliciously macabre and absolutely marvelous As suggested by the previous lines, Vincent Price is my favorite actor and, even if personally I wouldn't let myself lose anything in which the man was, none of my fellow fans could lose this little one gem. <br /> <br /> The award is played by Don Galico (known as Galico the Great), an underrated magician and inventor of magical devices, whose chief, a squalid businessman, stole his wife ( Eva Gabor) When the boss takes away one of the in Galico's genius and handing over to his rival, The Great Rinaldi (John Emery), Galico snaps, and starts a bloody series of revenge ... <br /> <br /> love Vincent Price when he's out for revenge? Some of his most famous and greatest films such as "The Abominable Dr. Phibes" (1971) or "Theater of Blood" (1973) concerned absurd and delightfully vengeful macabres, and this previous film in his Horror career is another proof that nobody takes revenge like Vincent Price does. This film offers an extraordinarily eccentric leading role for Price, who, as always, offers a brilliant performance and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously fun and macabre entertainment for every Horror fan. Another must see for my friends of Price.
