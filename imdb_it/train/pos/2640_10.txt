Evidently, not many people have seen this film, because nobody is posting other comments. This is not a movie you can't miss. After all, he won the George Peabody award and the Humanitas award. Paul Winfield should have won a prize for his fantastic performance in this film. Eugene Logan, co-author of this TV movie, was part of another film about humanity, or its loss, being a technical consultant to the Truman Capote film at the Glass House. This film is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I will post another letter that tells how Eugene Logan became the technical advisor for a film by someone as extraordinary as Truman Capote. Thank you for reading this and I hope you will find a way to see these two films.
