Lauren Bacall lived through the illness and death of her husband Humprey Bogarts when he shot this film. Rock Hudson was close to his celebrity in the 1950s. Dorothy Malone is in great shape and wins an Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated and falls short for his role. <br /> <br /> The story has been a bit lathered for some time, but just as valid as most of the dramas. Unbelievable how well drunks can drive in this film and also how quickly Stack reappears in a couple of movie sequences. <br /> <br /> You can understand why the cast is so good and actually the film is very productive well. You can tell Bacall that he is distracted during this movie while his acting is fine, he seems emotionally drained in some sequences. <br /> <br /> The sexual references in this film are so slight that many of today's young viewers do not realize what they are. The film does a good job telling a story and actually leaves a sequel to be made at the end, even if no one has ever been made - even if Written Beyond The Wind would be a good title.
