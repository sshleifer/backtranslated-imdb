I'll start by saying that this has been immensely rethought by almost everyone! The fact is that it wasn't what anyone expected, especially from Guy Ritchie. What everyone expected was the cockney geezers and the beautiful covers "do you like dags?" etc., but this is much more mature than his previous work. I agree that he is confused, but all the facts are there for us, we just have to see them and listen harder, this movie requires all your attention! Looking beyond the fresh and dazzling aspect of the film, try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and I think we will all have a more complete understanding of the whole film. <br /> <br /> Yes, this has its influences from modern classics (fight club, pulp fiction etc), but it is in the whole original in both directions and rhythm with a score of music second to none. I feel that if everyone watched this movie over and over they would understand it much more and maybe they would appreciate it for the beautiful piece of modern cinema that it is and I also hope that Ritchie will continue in this compartment because I much prefer this to his "masterpieces" joker. .
