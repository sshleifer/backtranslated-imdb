This is an excellent documentary, full of beautiful images of racing action and a great story. IMAX cameras offer you a very wide perspective, since a DVD movie is perfect. Feel all the speakers working almost all the time, the film is not accelerated and gives you the natural feeling of 230 miles per hour. Of course there are some added sound effects, but I think they are good, they give depth to the driving scenes ...
