Footlight Parade is one of the best extravagant shows of the 1930s musical comedy. A snappy script and an all-star cast including Jimmy Cagney, the beautiful Joan Blondell, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler make this film a cut above the rest. Directed and choreographed by the creative genius Busby Berkeley, this film will make you smile from ear to ear from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Busby, of course, is the undisputed master of the Hollywood musical with "Gold Diggers from 1933" and "42nd Street" to his credit (as dance director). Footlight Parade is adorned by hundreds of succinctly dressed chorus girls, a Berkeley trademark. The elaborate dance numbers were shot with just one camera and Busby was the first director to shoot close-ups of the dancers. His obsession with shapely legs and "rear view" shots is amply demonstrated here. The overall effect is highly erotic and mesmerizing. <br /> <br /> Our boy Jimmy Cagney plays Chester Kent, a producer of "prologues" or short musical theater productions that have been featured in theaters to entertain the audience before the talkies were shown. He is surrounded by dishonest partners, a corporate spy and a girlfriend who digs gold. Although Cagney had a solid background in vaudeville, this was the first film in which he showed his dance talents. Joan Blondell is as memorable as Cagney's wise and clever secretary. And Ruby Keeler is adorable, as always. <br /> <br /> The film culminates with three outstanding production numbers, "Honeymoon Hotel", "The Waterfall" and "Shanghai Lil", each of which is a masterpiece and is not likely to be duplicated in today's Hollywood where so-called "special effects" have replaced creative photography. <br /> <br /> Claudia's Bottom Line: Intelligent and erotic, with some of the best music production numbers ever put on celluloid. A very pleasant Depression adventure.
