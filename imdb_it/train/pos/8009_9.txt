Ah, real memories. At the time I lived in Holland and looked at him impatiently every Sunday evening and then Tuesday. I saw it during my 14-16. Very good for my English (at school time), as Dutch TV provides subtitles for other languages, except for children's shows nowadays. Then you will hear the original voices and language. - The best series were the first three and then after the third series, the great character, Naz Von Gelb, who was such a formidable enemy, disappeared from the series (I don't think they ever captured him, he always ran away, leaving space to make it appear again in a later story) because obviously the series was also distributed in Germany, and a Nazi enemy would not have gone very well! Too bad, because Geoffrey Toone has done such a convincing and convincing job of portraying the clever Nazi aristocrat, who had this obsession to take revenge on England. It was a real pleasure to see this kind of high quality performance in a youth series, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good counterpart and the young people were so normal. They were very credible to me at that time and as a child I could only imagine being part of these guys, who at the time were about four years older than me. It was a very exciting series for me, which impressed me in the memory of those times as a special show with "the Prisoner". I hope they will release a good quality DVD from the series, it would be wonderful. Even bad copies are still nice to look at. The subsequent series were not as good, watered down and not as fun as the first three. I hope they also find the other series with Von Gelb to put on DVD. Greetings from Canada.
