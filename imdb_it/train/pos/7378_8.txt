After watching this movie last night on Sundance, I realized that much of Nakata's style was made for the first time in this film. Here we have many of the same elements as the RINGU series, especially the idea that the media is the source of the supernatural. Instead of the cursed videotape, we have instead a haunted studio and strange images that appear on the film. In fact, the strange images that appear on the film immediately bring to mind the cursed video recording of RINGU. The only thing missing was the obsession with the water flowing in Nakata's later films. The final scenes are rather chilling, with a small nod to Murnau, who with the door opening by itself and the ghost entering the room, immediately reminds me of <br /> <br /> NOSFERATU. A chilling film that will make you think twice on a catwalk.
