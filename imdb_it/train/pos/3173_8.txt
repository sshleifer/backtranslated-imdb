Imagination is a terrible thing to waste ... especially when you have talented actors. Writer / director Jones wastes no time in lining up the viewer with his protagonist. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has shared an apartment with a bad one would cry with laughter. Anyone who has arrived while a waitress will put a ticket on the windshield will just cry. We all wanted to rip a terrible toupee from a man's head. These are just fragments of what is in store when you look at "Cross Eyed", a sincere film that should be a springboard for Jones and his sense of humor both in front and behind the camera.
