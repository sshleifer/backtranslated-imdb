"Before the devil knows you're dead" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time at <br /> <br />. The acting of <br /> <br /> the excellent ensemble cast is incredible. Philip Seymour Hoffman performs exceptionally well and is thrilling whenever he is on the screen. Ethan Hawke matches the scene by scene and Albert Finney simply chews the screen. Marisa Tomei is, however, <br /> <br /> abused, but looks incredible for her 42 years. The script is excellent, the plot not linear but easy enough to follow. Sidney Lumet, although not known for his blockbusters, has become a real gem!
