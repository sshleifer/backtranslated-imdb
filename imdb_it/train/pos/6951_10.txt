I've never been a big fan of television until I watched 24 for the first time. I entered the series very late. Season 5 ended before I even saw my first episode. It was an episode of series 3 that was in the box of my parents DVR (digital video recorder) while I was at home sitting for the weekend. It took me an episode to make me a hook and a diver in the world of Jack Bauer. And the boy was hooked !! I watched the next six episodes without blinking. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited subscription for twenty dollars and needless to say that it was the biggest success I've ever spent. I watched the first three seasons in three weeks. There are 72 episodes of forty minutes !!! I will say that finding out what happens next is easier on DVD than waiting for a whole week. I can only imagine waiting to watch the Season 6 week after week !! I find it slightly tortuous and cruel, but I'm going to try it and look at it like the rest of America !! The DVR is set and you can bet I'll be crazy in pieces !!
