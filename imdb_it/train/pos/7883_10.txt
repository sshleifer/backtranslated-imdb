I saw this movie with my friend and we couldn't stop laughing! I mean, there was nothing scary in this movie! All the phrases that Freddy said were hilarious was fun! I don't think they even made a new nightmare and just switched to Freddy vs. jason. Although some parts were coarse (like the exploding head). and any elm street film from 1 to 5 sucked. this was the best besides the number 1. I would not recommend this movie if you want a good horror. But if you have nothing else to do, rent this and you will laugh a lot. I want to see the Texas chainsaw massacre, I think it would be scary. Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare overall grade: B-
