The Road Rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the Master to fight crime all over the world. The show was nothing short of exhilarating. Simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages. Performing jokes throughout the series that could generate an alcohol game. The action was fascinating and skillfully set. The characters were very original, each with a very different personality. But what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters. Each of them has difficulties and emotional difficulties that are never expressed but implied. I hope one day there is a way to see the Rovers again in action.
