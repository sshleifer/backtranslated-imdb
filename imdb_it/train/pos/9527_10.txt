This is the best mob movie ever made. He deserved more than he got at the Oscars. Named for his soundtrack, art direction, supporting role (Newman), this film could easily have been named as best film, director (Mendes), actor (Hanks), supporting actor (Newman and Law) and won !! Hanks gives one of his best performances, and the guy who played Michel Jr. was so good that I'm surprised not to see him in other movies today. The critics themselves have not given enough credit to this film. But in addition to incredible performances, another real star of this film is the incredible music. This was by far the best score of the year. He was nominated but did not win. This is a great movie that should be seen by everyone. My Grade-A +
