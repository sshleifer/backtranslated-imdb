Any film adaptation of a John Grisham story deserves a traditional Hollywood approach, and Robert Altman talks about the last director I'd go with to make a mainstream on anything. But this pot with boiler in the south is quite good. Although he is not among the best of Altman, it certainly is not among the films he has made that leave you scratching your head and wondering what he was thinking. <br /> <br /> Altman had turned his hat upside down to the mystery thriller with noir shades first, in his 1973 film "The Long Goodbye". "The Gingerbread Man" is nowhere near as good as that movie, but it holds up pretty well by itself. Kenneth Branagh is an arrogant lawyer who finds himself framed for murder after being involved in a client (Embeth Davidtz) who got his help protecting her from his father cuckoo (Robert Duvall). The film is set in Savannah, Georgia, during the approach of a tropical storm, which gives the film an overwhelming atmosphere that I liked very much. The twists towards the end of the film become clunkier and clunkier, and Altman proves not to be very good at staging shootings, but overall the film is not a bad addition to Altman's canon. <br /> <br /> Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen. <br /> <br /> Vote: B
