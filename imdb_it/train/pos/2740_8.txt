The tremendous black and white, and in abundance, cinematographic cinematography highlights this apparently real life story of a murder in the 1950s in Kansas where an entire family was wiped out by two men. <br /> <br /> was written by Truman Capote, in order to get the liberal anti-death message at the end of the film, which is ridiculous to know the facts of this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson interpret the two atheist losers who have distorted ideas about life and who needlessly kill this beautiful family. <br /> <br /> Despite the annoying inclination at the end, this is a compelling story from the beginning and the cinematography makes it even more fascinating. The famous photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job on this. It makes me want the most modern films to have been made in black and white. Watch it on DVD. Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and the entire supporting cast are excellent here. My third vision of this film came in early April 2005, shortly after Blake, in real life, was declared innocent in his wife's murder trial. You can't help but look at Blake and this movie differently after this.
