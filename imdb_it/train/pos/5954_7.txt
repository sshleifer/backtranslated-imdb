I feel out there a mix of confusion and varying degrees of personal taste in the reactions to this film. Yes, there are stereotypes of vampires. Yes, there are scientific stereotypes covered here. Even the stereotypes of martial arts. Everything is fine, and certainly not all perfectly done. However, I feel that a crucial point about this film is overlooked ... by the cultural meaning of its position. The film is set in Pensacola, Florida, and doesn't try to avoid saying it. This is a bold move in today's movie world and a rarity for indie film fans. And indeed, it may not be the last. Pensacola is famous throughout the world as a city of the navy, a city of aviation, a city of timber, and sometimes even as a hotbed of political controversy. It is rarely seen as a growing film city. But everything is changing now. Other film companies are coming to shoot. And other Pensacolian natives are discovering the power of cinema for themselves. This film is part of a growing trend of Indian films from Pensacola, and others are on the way. Pensacola is making a big noise in the global film community and, little by little, the world is paying more attention. Look and listen, world. The Pensacoli are coming. Like a virus
