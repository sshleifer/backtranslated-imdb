I didn't really see too many Columbo movies ... actually, I think I only watched one or two of them apart from that. Anyway, I've always liked Columbo, somehow without even seeing much of him. Peter Falk is and has always been the perfect choice for the character, for his appearance, his voice and his charm. The perfect proof of this is that although the series began in 1968, the last (and probably not the last) of the films was released in 2003. It's been 35 years. And Falk was 40 when he did the first one. The series includes 68 films (unless my count is turned off), all TV products. Everyone knows the character, even though no one has ever seen a movie with him in the cinema. This is a good result, if you ask me. The plot is pretty good. The only problem I have with this is that the killer and the murder are revealed at the beginning (although it could be the same for all Columbo films), without leaving any mystery, but as Columbo solves it, making it a bit boring (since there is not much to expect at the end of the film). The pace is good, there's hardly a scene where you're bored. The acting is very good, in particular that of Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have some great exchanges of dialogue in the film. The characters are well written and credible. The dialogue and script are unusually good for a TV movie. All in all, the film is, yes, surprisingly good for a TV movie, and certainly worth watching for any Columbo fan and / or yellow / yellow movies. 8/10
