Probably the best film of Jackie Chan in the 80s and the one that put it on the map. The scope of this self-directed police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes, during which an abusive village and a shopping mall are demolished. There are, of course, differences between the original Chinese and the dubbed English versions, with many jokes that fail to make their way into the second. The latter is also hampered by stars that sound nothing like their Chinese originals. In fact, the only thing the dubbing has corrected is the trial in court, at the time, the trials in the Hong Kong colonial were conducted in English, while the original has this scene in Cantonese! <br /> <br /> However, Chan's fighting style and martial arts choreography inject humor where possible so that non-Cantonese audiences do not miss much. It is not, after all, the dialogue that makes a Chan twist, but the action and the painful realization. The story is easy to follow: Chan plays an incorruptible Hong Kong detective chasing a gangland godfather (Cho Yeun), and assigned to protect a star witness (Brigitte Lin). The action is superb from start to finish and there is not much time to breathe. He will never let you think about it, but what a fun movie and together tense together. Probably, this is one of the best martial arts films out there.
