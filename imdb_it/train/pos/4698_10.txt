Just like wine, "Johnny Dangerously" gets better every day. This clever, witty, well-made film could very well stand alone - but as a parody of the gangster genre, it's truly exceptional. Indeed, it is obviously the best film of its kind ... the most enjoyable parody of the mob films and also the respective period - although, of course, this position is probably easier to obtain when its main competitors are such primitive pseudocomedias vulgar and boring as "Jane Austen's Mafia".
