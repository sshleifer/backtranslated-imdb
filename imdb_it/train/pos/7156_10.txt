Holes is a fantastic film. I like it a lot and it's one of my favorite movies. It is one of the few films produced by Disney that is not poor. The holes are generally a very beautiful film. I wish Disney would have taken more pictures like that. Holes is really a rare breed of Disney flicker that is beautiful. Don't have the wrong idea, I don't mean Disney by bad mouth, but most of the stuff is aimed at kids and THIS is OKAY. Even children deserve to have fun. But Disney was guilty of trying to address the teenage public and they usually fail. But not with Holes. It's the kind of movie that anyone of any age can watch and have fun and not once thinks it's trivial. Actually, it's the kind of movie that could interest even a lot of young coffins since there are characters that they can relate to. <br /> <br /> Holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but don't be too vulgar and live a little on the edge. I hope that Disney carries more risks and produces more angular films like this.
