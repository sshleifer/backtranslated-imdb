Going to see this movie I was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea. Especially a romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> I didn't know I was going for a spin through cinematic magic. Everything in the film, from the plot to the dialogue, was in fact very close to perfection. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes shines like the star in this movie. From the beginning to the end you fall more and more in love with this character. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is threatening as an evil witch, determined to capture the star for eternal youth and beauty. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest comic relief since the film is gaining momentum towards the pinnacle. <br /> <br /> Overall this was a film that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan. If you are looking for a fun and entertaining movie that is fun for children and adults, Stardust is the way to go.
