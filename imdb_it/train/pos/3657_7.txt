This film is like a 1950 version of dirty and bad Brutti by Ettore Scola. Less sex and less realism, but a story with great humanism and warmth. I would not call this neo-realistic image. It is very sentimental and more like a fairy tale, and should probably be classified as a comedy, although it deals with serious issues (a bit like Chaplin or a 1930 comedy). Typical Italian, however, very emotional, and difficult to resist except for a person cold of stone. Sentimentalism is a disappointment, although this image was not meant to be a realistic drama. It is not a masterpiece like Umberto D or The Bicycle Thief. But it is an amiable and exhilarating comedy, with good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
