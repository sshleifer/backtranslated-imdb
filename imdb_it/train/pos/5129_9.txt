I can understand why this film was nominated for an Oscar for best live short film, having been masterfully built. Even if you don't particularly like Blues (although for me, this sounded much more like jazz), you can easily enjoy this movie. It's simply very well done, even if for the life of me, I can't understand why the director Gjon Mili has only directed a film - this. In other words, the film was nominated and yet the director did not get any kind of career boost. As for the black artists, I realized that this did not push their careers to shift gears, since unfortunately most white society has indifference (or worse) to blacks or "that kind of music". <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, if you don't particularly like the previous portion, it jumps forward around 5:50, where it increases considerably. When the lady stopped singing and the artists started improvising, the pace improved a lot.
