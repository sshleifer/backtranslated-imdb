I really enjoyed this movie. Britney is an excellent role model for teenagers and should be more appreciated. This film is about following your dreams and never giving up, regardless of what people might do or say to discourage you and criticize you. Holly realizes her dreams just like Britney. <br /> <br /> There are moments in everyone's life when people judge them for what they are not who they are. Watching this movie will make you understand that you are special in your own way and that you should follow your dreams, whatever happens. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. He will never know how much this means to me. Bravo Britney. You are the greatest !!!
