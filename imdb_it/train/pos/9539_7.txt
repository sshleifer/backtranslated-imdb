For fans of Troma or the Cyberpunk genre mixed with some spilled blood, then this movie for you! There is a good amount of blood shed within the boundaries of this film, even the effects can be impressionable and fantastic. The plot is ridiculous and refreshing, not being chained to what the public is expected of the cinema these days. <br /> <br /> Also the small aliens are remarkable, which I found nice. All in all, it's a good movie for fans of the genre. Movies like Tetsuo: The Iron Man and Versus are also recommended for that bizarre approach to the Japanese film, full of wonderful darkness and bloodshed. Obviously, seeing this movie you should already have knowledge of the two.
