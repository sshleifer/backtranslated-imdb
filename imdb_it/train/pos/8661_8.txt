I have long enjoyed the Criminal Intent Law and Order series. Kathryn Erbe, Det. Alexandra Eames, the female detective is quite tough and seems a little bitter about the Criminal Intent series. Look at its opposite side in this film. <br /> <br /> This film shows the wonderful soft side of these talented actresses and if you are a fan of Criminal Intent this film is a lash in its acting and you get a pretty damned family yarn in the South. I didn't like it the role of Albert Finneys in this film because he did such a convincing acting job for the older colleague from the South who is tough, intolerant and does not accept change. It reminds me of many men of my youth and the portrait is divine, but you will probably find it difficult to love in this film. <br /> <br /> Katryn Herbs is easy to love in this film and because I recommend it is 10 stars for Criminal Intent fans, law and order.
