I recently bought this movie and I don't regret having seen it actually I'm very happy to have this movie to add to my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, directors, took less than a month to shoot and spent about 1 million euros to produce this great film. This shows that not only large productions make great films. <br /> <br /> The title of this film fits perfectly. In computer language, BUG means program error that causes reactions in the computer's function. Our reactions can cause these negative side effects, but also great moments of beauty. The dizzying events in this film begin with the death of a BUG. A man is witness to the "crime" across the street ... From then on everything gets complicated ... <br /> <br /> Stresses John Carrol Lynch ("Fargo"), Wallece, the man who can't make everything right for everyone.
