I show this film to university students in the law of speech and media because its lessons are timeless: because speaking against injustice is important and can lead to the changes required by the oppressed. Because freedom of the press and freedom of speech are essential for democracy. This is a must-see story about how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world through Steven Biko's activism and Donald Woods journalism. It also gives an important lesson in freedom of expression: "You can blow out a candle, but you can't put out a fire: once the flame begins to catch fire, the wind will blow it higher." (From Biko by Peter Gabriel, on Shaking the Tree).
