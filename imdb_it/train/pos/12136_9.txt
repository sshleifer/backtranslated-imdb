Arriving just before the imposition of a moral code obscured the spirits of writers, directors and actors, the first film adaptation of "Of Human Bondage" by W. Somerset Maugham titillated countless spectators. Today it has no shocking value, just acting. <br /> <br /> While the cast is excellent, this is the first major role of Bette Davis and one of Leslie Howard's best shows. Howard is the ambitious Parisian artist Philip Carey who feels kindly and firmly that he has no talent and that his dedication cannot replace true genius. Taking the lesson to heart, he returns to London and enrolls in a medical college (one, by the way, seems to have no female students - at that moment there would have been at least some. Perhaps the author / physician Maugham didn't care for him the rock doctors). <br /> <br /> After having tea some day, Carey is fascinated by a waitress, Mildred Rogers, Bette Davis in a morally silly and basically bad petty role. His cockney accent is as strong as Eliza Doolittle's. His repeated attempts to go out with her are greeted with the less than enthusiastic response, "I don't mind," a sure signal for every man with a screwed head probing the depths. Maugham's Mildred completed his advice with the waitress with some old-fashioned pastime, something that was not clearly brought here. <br /> <br /> Carey's infatuated prostration serves the miserly need for Rogers's financial support. He is desperately in love with her - she interprets him as a Sunday church organist wearing his instrument effortlessly. No sex here. Recognizing that he is not going anywhere, he begins a chaste relationship with Norah, a woman who loves him. Mildred comes back, full of a child, and in her usual need to be cured. Get out of the broken heart Norah. <br /> <br /> Another separation from Mildred and Carey begins a long-term friendship with Sally, enthusiastically encouraged by her father who seems to consider marriage as a good thing for the two young men and a chance to be relieved of one of his nine children. <br /> <br /> The film, reasonably but not entirely, follows the excellent novel by Maugham. Howard's Carey is naive and vulnerable and for most of the film his sad eyes remind a doe of a double-barreled rifle. Mildred is wildly wicked, a user of the worst kind, his only concern for his own needs barely disguised when he tries to trick Carey with a thin veneer of affectionate words (and offers - at one point he promises he will) anything " ] wants "a bold statement for the times and one I'm sure the public has fully understood." Pre-Code could be but the rapid dissolution of Mildred's march would have satisfied the League of Catholic Decency. The ending is conventional - sin loses, the triumphs of the basic behavior. <br /> <br /> The director John Cromwell has made excellent performances from his two main stars, one well established, the other founded mainly because of this film. London and the journey back in time it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Available on DVD. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (for performances by Davis and Howard)
