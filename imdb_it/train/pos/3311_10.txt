A common plot in the films consists of the main characters who leave the hustle and bustle of the city behind and find themselves in the tranquility of nature. In the Kangwon Power province, two stories of individuals doing just that are shown, trying to find themselves through a trip to the famous Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon province. However, rather than epiphanic moments, we have two characters whose journey into nature was just another form of escape. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of this film is slow, contemplative. In the end we learn what led each to the Kangwon Province and learn how they are connected. For those who want Hollywood glam and a film to give them a definitive answer, this film will not satisfy. But for those who want a film that leaves them to think, to wonder, to influence them for years, this film will more than satisfy that desire.
