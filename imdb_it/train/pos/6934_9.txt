Winchester '73 is a great story, and that's what I like. It's not your daily western - use a gun, which passes from various characters - like a mechanism to tell the story of these people. Rock Hudson plays an Indian chief, Jimmy Stewart plays a great leader with heart and strength, and Shelly Winters plays a girl who has to cope with the realities of her husband and the wild west. It is important to note for those politically correct types: they kill many Indians in this film without remorse. By today's standards, it is still quite violent. But it's a good story and worth a look. To enjoy!
