SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and VERY realistic documentary on the WTC attacks.2 French filmmakers in New York to film the actions of a NYFD face this event and take advantage of it. Before 9/11 nothing really happens that gives the film an even more horror scenario. The day of the attacks seems just another boring day at work, but this will change soon. As the filmmakers go around the street with the firemen filming the first plane that crashes, this is the only footage of the first impact. Drive with the firemen to the WTC and enter the building. As the second plane crashes, people understand that this is not an accident. In the next period of time we see the firefighters making plans to save as many people as possible, while in the meantime we hear the sounds of slamming, these are the sounds of people jumping off the tower and falling to the ground, this is the most grueling moment of the documentary. Then the tower collapses and our French friend has to run to save his life, you hear him breathing like a madman as he runs out of the building. Then a big sandstorm hits him and the screen goes black, he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of central New York. Since this documentary has gotten so much historical material and because the film was something totally different, this documentary will probably remain in everyone's memory. I saw live attacks at home because I had the afternoon, so this makes it even more realistic to watch. 10/10
