Warning! Spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I have seen films in German, so it could be, that I lost some clues. <br /> <br /> Despite some weaknesses in the plot, it is a film that arrived to me. I particularly liked the acting of Lexa Doig. Sometimes I got the impression that she * is * Camille. But I can't stop wondering what happened in the end with Bob, Cassie and baby. I think she, after being initially set to Bob, ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him. Otherwise, it's a little weird, that you bring your baby and you love it. It is up to the viewer to decide - and I don't like these endings. Dean Cain was as good as ever, Eric Roberts ... well, I saw him better but even worse. <br /> <br /> I believe the film is more an analysis of human relationships and reacts in unexpected situations than a crime story. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I really enjoyed it.
