When I saw Birthday Girl I liked it so much that I decided to see all the Nicole Kidman movies I could, only to find them all a disappointment with it. I theorize that while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality thanks to their artistic control, with Nicole Kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to the enjoyment of the film - IMHO. So, for example, Dogville, even depriving the viewer of anything visual to diminish the existential intuition that is pounding at home, or other films that promote homosexuality and lesbianism as worthy of someone else's attention, or others family causes of Kidman. <br /> <br /> Here she is a natural woman and does a really good job. I don't know how or who was able to hold it, but apparently it worked. The way the film describes its openness, despite its resistance, reaches the heart of what makes a woman a woman. And consequently, what makes a man's most desperate hopes at a marginal level attainable. <br /> <br /> Of course, the fact that the male protagonist transforms from a billionaire clerk into a macho man in the space of a film sounds like a fantasy of expansion of the male ego, but its transformation is adequately credible. It is not conceived with care as it would be in a film designed to strengthen the male ego. Instead it accurately records the necessary growth resulting from the film's unique circumstances. <br /> <br /> Also quite fascinating is the way criminals are portrayed as perfectly human, apart from their criminal mission. His gang has a rough and uninhibited brotherhood that is foreign to American culture. And while they are his opponents, they are never really his enemy. In fact, they taught him to compete. I was really amazed at Kidman's ability to look physically Russian. I wondered if his ancestry was Russian, but none of the photos I examined showed any clues. Maybe it's just the trick but it was great. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that you throw it in your head again so soon that you can make another great movie. Despite my free digs at Mrs. Kidman, the message is that this is a superior film in every way and probably the role of a life.
