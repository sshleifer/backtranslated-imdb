Well done. A lot of anguish. Friendship cannot stand everything, but in the end it is all that matters, or so a group of friends learns. I looked over and over again. The music is fantastic too. When Kei loses his only friend, he surrenders until he meets Sho, an orphan who is not rejected by his true nature. In the lawless streets of Mallepa they struggle for their place amidst a crucible of Asian races, and they learn that sometimes being at the top can cost more than you are ever willing to pay. A surprise ending that grabs as much as the entire movie. I just can not get enough. Gackt and Hyde do a great job of acting, proving that they are more than just nice guys singing.
