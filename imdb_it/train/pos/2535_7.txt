Prof. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) discovers Radium X - a powerful force to be used for atomic power. Unfortunately Rukh has been contaminated by Radium and begins to shine in the darkness - and his touch causes instant death. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) develops an antidote - but Rukh starts to go mad because of the Radium E of the antidote and decides to kill everything that wronged him. <br /> <br /> The plot is stupid and the "effects" that make Karloff shine in the dark are ridiculous, but this is still a fun little cooler. It moves quickly, has a nice atmosphere (note Rukh's "house" and the film starts on a dark and rainy night) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) give great shows. There is also a good performance by Franic Drake (as Rukh's wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (as his mother). So all is well, but only a notch below all the other Karloff / Lugosi films. The plot is too far-fetched for me to swallow. However I liked him I give him a 7.
