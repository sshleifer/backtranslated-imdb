The photography of this budget production is surprisingly negative. The colors are muddy and brownish and the photograph has a very eighty appearance. Direction and editing are often rather uninspired and even TV movies. * And * in the beginning the film seems to want only to torture its viewers with frightening images of sex and violence. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is also a typically simple and bland work of this exaggerated and talented composer. <br /> <br /> But if you're willing to watch the movie, you're rewarded with a moving family story, a kind of Edna Ferber epos Giant family version. While at first you wonder why Clara married this idiot man, her character also gains more depth and more background in which you can judge him. Clara offers the spiritual lesson of the film, a great and moving affirmation against the terrible events in her country. His daughter, whose lover is a young Antonio Banderas at the beginning of his international career, understands this lesson and eventually tries to live it. The way the plot was built with the end that reflected the beginning was great. Even the actors do a great job. I was wondering "Who is the actress who plays Blanca?" all the time, but of course, she was a very young Winona Ryder! <br /> <br /> All in all, this film really made me want to read the book.
