"Citizen X" tells the story of "The Butcher of Rostov", nickname of a perverse and perverse criminal serial killer who has caused 52 victims since 1978-92. The film focuses on the novice detective (Rea) who stubbornly persecuted the murderer against all odds in the face of a non-cooperative bureaucracy in the selfish and convenient denial. A HBO product for t.v., the film offers a solid cast, good interpretations, saves the public most of the gruesome details, but unfolds like a docudrama without the stylistics of similar Hollywood dishes. A uniform and direct dramatization of a serious and relatively little known story more interesting than "Jack the Ripper". (B)
