The horse is really a beautiful animal. The picturesque depictions of wild horses and their grace could never have been more majestic in an animated film. <br /> <br /> The entertainment is simply superb. Fine animation is the backbone of the beauty that horses encourage through the film. Even more so when the stallion crosses different terrain, it jumps through cliffs and brave waters. <br /> <br /> Even the soundtrack is very impressive. The wonderful instrumental music attracts you to appreciate the film. <br /> <br /> "They say the history of the west was written from the saddle of a horse." Eh? Well, the story of a beautiful horse was written from the saddle of West. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film is clearly there with the best. It's one of the best animated films I've watched. It would be an excellent choice on a lonely night. An easy 9/10.
