Hi Dave Burning Paradise is a movie for those who love Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones. The main protagonist of the film is certainly the bastard son of these two strange fathers. As for the other characters, they are familiar transformations of similar stereotypes on the action film. Where this film is original is the fusion of Hong Kong's traditional film style with the Hollywood adventure. Unfortunately this was not true for the films he made in Hollywood.
