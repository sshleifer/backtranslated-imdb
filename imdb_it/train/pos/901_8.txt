Well ... Vivah is a beautiful film, but typical of Sooraj Barjatya. Show different aspects of Indian families, wedding ceremonies, etc. The film is more than good, but not extremely good. <br /> <br /> The great advantage of the film is the direction, music and acting of Shahid and Amrita (especially the last scene). The film begins with a common factor in the Indian film --- A girl doesn't like her stepmother. Story is a somewhat common film, but it is good, good enough to make the film a success. <br /> <br /> The negative point is the common history of the Bollywood film. In general, I would say that you need to watch a movie twice, if you want to see the typical values ​​of the Indian family and of course love!
