This Night Listener is better than what people generally say. He has weaknesses, and he seems to have a gender identity crisis, no doubt, but I think his scary atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for it. The whole thing looks like one of those hearths "happened to a friend of a friend of mine" ghost stories. A big complaint about the film is the rhythm: but the slow and sometimes embarrassing rhythm is intentional. Everything that takes place in this film is well preserved in the realm of possibility, and real life is just a kind of long arrangements, isn't it? So there are no flashy endings or shocking revelations, no "showdown" scene. Thank goodness. You have to enter the area when you watch this movie, forget your reservations and your expectations about what makes a (conventionally) good movie. Williams is not exceptional, but easily meets the needs of history, and his character should be a bit generic ("None") because he is the Everyman, the avatar with which we ourselves enter history. Toni Collette's performance should be nominated for an Oscar (although perhaps she should not win it). Give it a shot. Only for quality and content, The Night Listener is certainly among the top twenty percent of the films coming out these days.
