"Hatred of a Minute" is an incredibly beautiful film. A psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer, Eric Seaver. The strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a "must" for every film or horror student. The reality of history and the human side of Eric separate this film from other psychopathic films. Some cries to the film's producer, Bruce Campbell, as well as to the movie "The Evil Dead" add some humor to anyone who knows the genre.
