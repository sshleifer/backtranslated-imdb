My opinion: a silly but imaginative mess. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves (Yes! That Keanu Reeves) and Alex Winter return as two punk-rock idiots in this sequel to the top comedy adventure BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, now a cult classic. In this sequel, Bill and Ted have much more to do than travel through time. They could even travel to heaven and hell! During the beginning of this sequel, Bill and Ted are preparing for a "Battle of the Bands" competition that could make them more famous than ever. Meanwhile, many years in a futuristic civilization, the magician of the time of the first film (the always watchable George Carlin) is leading a university praising the names of Bill and Ted. There, an evil tyrant (Joss Ackland, from THE HUNT FOR RED October) tries to get rid of the two idiot rockstars once and for all. Then send two identical replicas of android (in the words of Bill and Ted: Robot Us's) to do the dirty work. <br /> <br /> Afterwards, Bill and Ted experience death and must find their way through Hell, with inhabitants who happen to include the worst memories of the duo, and then through Paradise in an attempt to get back on Land to save their girlfriends ... and their show. Along this journey of whacked-outs, they play board games with none other than Death (William Sadler, of DIE HARD 2), which recalls a similar moment in the 1957 foreign film THE SEVENTH SEAL, the help of a pair of alien beings smart and more. <br /> <br /> The range of exuberant tricks of the special effects of BOGUS JOURNEY has no updated standards, and even a bit of humor and look and feel for the time are a little dated (to Sincerely, also the film seems to have been released in the wrong year, even for the 90s). But with not a little lack of imagination and a lively breakthrough in both performance and direction, BOG AND TED BOGUS JOURNEY is fun, imaginative and yes, fake. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
