I didn't know what to expect from this film considering his extraordinary collection of stars and directors, but in the end he didn't disappoint me. <br /> <br /> For me one of the highlights was the final episode with the American tourist talking to a horrible French accent (which made me feel better than mine) which was actually quite moving and a great way to conclude the film. <br /> <br /> The story of the paramedic and the stabbed victim was also very moving and by pure comedy the Coen Brothers and Steve Buscemi take the prize. Tom Tykwer's clip was also impressive, although rather ambitious in its field of application. <br /> <br /> However, the segment of Bob Hoskins was totally cringeworthy and the history of vampires was completely farcical. The dialogue in the Wes Craven section also felt very forced and the Chinatown story was completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Overall this film deserves to be seen for beautiful pieces and has a strong ending. It is not too painful to go through the wrong sections - they still only last 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Ca vaut la peine !!!
