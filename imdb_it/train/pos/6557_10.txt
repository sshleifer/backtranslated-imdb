I am a 53-year-old university professor. I went with my wife and 12 year old daughter. We liked the whole movie. The film is original, witty, fast and absolutely fascinating. The plot was easy enough for a 10-year-old to follow, but tortuous enough to keep an adult interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job and the rest of the cast was good. My only criticism is that the LA sets weren't as interesting as they should have been. They were functional, but nothing could be distinguished. On the other hand, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and direction were excellent. Overall, I thought it was an absolutely pleasant experience. I am disappointed that professional critics (almost all adult males) have savagely attacked the film. Apparently, they have something against movies that portray strong, intelligent and independent young women. Their writings reveal more about their own sexist nature than anything else about this wonderful family film. I highly recommend it to all children and all parents.
