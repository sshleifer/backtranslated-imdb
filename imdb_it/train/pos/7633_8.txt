Reading the various external reviews of Roger Ebert and other well-known film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much I love this film, even though I only have a video version dubbed in Japanese. <br /> <br /> Apparently, many critics seem to regard it as a flaw that the premise of the story was used previously, the most famous in the huge "It's a wonderful life". For me, a great premise is a great premise, no matter how many times it is used, and I would be happy to see other films using this particular premise - the unhappy man who has the chance to get a new perspective on his life through a little of "divine magic". I suppose people and critics of a more intellectual inclination are not so involved in the story, but I don't go to the cinema to criticize them with the notebook in hand - I go to the cinema to throw myself in and let them take me where they want. <br /> <br /> If you are a sentimental type like me, you will be well rewarded by seeing this photo. The performances are excellent in everything, and the film was very well done. Excellent choice also for music. Michael Caine is as superb as the friendly bartender. Jim Belushi does a great job as an "average Joe" guy who wonders if his life went as it should. Linda Hamilton, always excellent, has again reason about how the loving wife. Jon Lovitz entertains as usual, and also has some surprisingly moving moments in "Mr. Destiny". <br /> <br /> No, "Mr. Destiny" is not "It's a wonderful life", but who says it must be? "Mr. Destiny" is a funny, well made, fun and moving film. I've seen my dubbed video in Japanese many times, and I'm sure I'll see it several times. If this somehow makes me an "intellectual", so be it! I'm glad I didn't read any "Mr. Destiny" reviews before seeing it. <br /> <br /> I suppose I should have the courage of my convictions and give the film nine or ten stars, but I couldn't help but doubt myself after reading all the critical reviews!
