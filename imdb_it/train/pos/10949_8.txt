First of all I would like to say that I am a big fan of Sarah Silverman, and having other people say it and then shred the pilot is beyond me. Everything in the pilot was in the typical form of Sarah Silverman, perhaps not directly funny, but the situation and delivery are what matters. <br /> <br /> If you liked Jesus is Magic, then I don't see how you wouldn't be so. It has the same flow and the same rhythm. It is only true for real fans, but if you are, you will be happy. <br /> <br /> Once again only for real fans, there's no way around it. If you're not used to his style, you wouldn't understand why it's fun. However, it is, and I hope you think so too.
