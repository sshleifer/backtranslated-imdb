This is a great movie to watch with your girlfriend. Both me and my friend love to dance and we came across this movie in the video store. We had to take it. Without violence and such a warming story it is a great movie to relax and enjoy the night. I would recommend this movie to any family or just a group of girls looking for a nice movie.
