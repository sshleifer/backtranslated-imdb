Normally the best way to annoy me in a movie is to include some reference to Orson Welles. But here is a science fiction comedy that cites the transmission of the War of the Worlds ... and it's gold! The very concept of a small group of tiny, aggressive and stupid aliens who are mistaken as children in Halloween outfits is magnificent. Don't be fooled by the idea that, because it looks like a children's movie, it's not sophisticated - it's not, there's a lot of hidden treasures ... A gem!
