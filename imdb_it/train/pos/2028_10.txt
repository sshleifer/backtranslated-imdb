Burlinson and Thornton give an exceptional performance in this film, along with Dennehy. Even if it is initially thought to be about love, it actually goes much deeper. The beauty of nature captures this film, placing it among one of the best I've ever seen. The horse scenes are absolutely fantastic !! All horse lovers out there will love this movie! <br /> <br />
