This family history of an older man / younger woman is surprisingly difficult. Bikers, hippies, free love and jail bait blend surprisingly well in this indie effort in black and white forgotten. Lead actress Patricia Wymer, as "Candy", offers the best performances of her career (covering all 3 epic drive-ins). Wymer was precocious and attractive in THE YOUNG GRADUATES (1971), but gives a more serious performance in THE BABYSITTER. Occasional violence and periodic nudity are somewhat surprising, but well managed by the director. Leads Wymer and George E. Carey to credibly sell the May / December story. There are enough similarities between THE BABYSITTER and THE YOUNG GRADUATES to ask ourselves if the same director has also skippered this last film. Patricia Wymer, where are you? <br /> <br /> A native of Seattle, WA, Miss Wymer had appeared as a dancer in the television rock and roll program MALIBU U, before covering the cover (as well as appearing in an eight-page spread) of the August issue of 1968 of "Best For Men", a tasteful magazine for adults only. She also appeared as a witch of the coven in the famous 1969 cult drive-in THE WITCHMAKER. <br /> <br /> THE BABYSITTER has finally made its home video debut, as part of the BCI eight-film box set DRIVE-IN CULT CLASSICS vol. 3, available from Amazon.com and some retail stores like Best Buy.
