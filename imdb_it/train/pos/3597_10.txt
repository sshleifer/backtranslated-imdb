(spoiler) <br /> <br /> I was blown away by this movie. I rented movielink for a while and decided to watch this movie. A lot of boxing movies seem to go overboard with blood. In this film he shows it at amature level. Although I hope that perhaps more attention would have been paid to improving his grades. The film highlights the problems that some families face with gender. <br /> <br /> I was a little worried about the ending. But the ending was not a disappointment. <br /> <br /> I think it was clear enough from the title he would have won. What was unexpected was that the two returned together at the end. <br /> <br /> I loved the soundtrack of some scenes. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Entertainment: 10/10 <br /> <br /> Replayable: 10/10
