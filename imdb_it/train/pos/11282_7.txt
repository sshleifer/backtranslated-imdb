This was the second series of 6 "classic Tarzan" films with Johnny Weismuller in the title role and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane. <br /> <br /> As usual, this was a wonderful film in this series; and perhaps it stands out as a film "in the middle" in a progression that could almost exemplify the development of cinema from the early 30s to the 40s. As such, it showed a good rhythm, although not as good as the following films. Similarly, cinematography is less successful than the later Tarzan films in this series. The material I saw was of uneven quality, with some grainy landscapes and some underexposed and overexposed scenes. What is missing here is the clear display of Tarzan's later films. On the other hand, there is a scene, very soon, in which the jerky movements of a camera with foliage moving in front of her while the camera stops, showing the safari men advancing in the jungle, was really almost modern in its style, and stands in stark contrast to the fixed shots that make up the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, an interesting feature here was the almost mutability and inconstancy of Jane, when she was subject to Martin flirt. The kiss ?? and the dazed, and partly guilty, reaction of Jane ?? foreshadow something of the Jane that we see in the future in these films. Compare, for example, in Tarzan Finds a Son! Jane's double actions that deceive Tarzan and deliver Boy to his family. Later he admits to Tarzan that he is wrong. Here, nothing so explicit, but we have Jane who "returns" to the Jane Parker of yesterday, and in a series of almost repentant actions, stripping herself of the evening dress worn by Martin and Harry to lure her away from Tarzan. /> <br /> There was a whole series of representations and sequences that particularly impressed me in this vision. <br /> <br /> First, the image we get of Tarzan's domestic life is here, as after, a combination of sensual idyll with always the near possibility of violent death. This for me is very much at the center of the Tarzan experience. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised by some pretty violent scenes even by today's standards. <br /> <br /> There was a whole series of scenes that gave me a special pleasure: Tarzan bringing the elephants to the Valley of the Elephants cemetery; Tarzan was saved from the watery death of the hippopotamus and then cared for by the monkeys; Cheetah will look for Tarzan when Jane and the other men will be trapped at the foot of the escarpment; Cheetah in particular that crosses the river on the trunk. The final battle scenes of savages and lions on the ground and wild and monkeys in the trees. Jane, showing us that she's really from the world of Tarzan now, quickly showing off her resourceful woodworking to work out a line of fire to keep the lions away. <br /> <br /> The final series of scenes is splendid: Tarzan is suddenly on the scene, throwing savages from the trees and taking charge of the lions, and summoning the elephants for the rescue! The last cry of Tarzan in triumph, holding a happy Jane in his arms, with a dancing Cheetah and happy beside them, is a memorable image and indeed a beautiful summary of the story of Tarzan and Jane. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is another wonderful classic Tarzan movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
