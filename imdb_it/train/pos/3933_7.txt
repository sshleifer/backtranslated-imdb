The problem with portraying an individual in real life is that the performance can be good, but it doesn't work if the public doesn't believe the actor portrays the person. This is the main problem with "Young Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda offers a formidable performance, but I found it difficult to believe that Abraham Lincoln was as soft as Fonda interprets him. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a court drama with a young Abraham Licoln at the forefront. Whether or not this was a true story, I don't know, but if it isn't, then why say it using Lincoln as a central character? It doesn't matter though. In the film, Lincoln is defending two young men accused of murder. <br /> <br /> There isn't really much to the film and, as a result, it looks pretty empty. I wanted more character and character development. The film lasts 100 minutes, but doesn't feel like it. There are some small scenes with Lincoln and the thriving relationship with Mary Todd, but they seem superficial. <br /> <br /> The acting is good all around, but as I said, Fonda's performance works like a character, but not in Abraham Lincoln. I just don't think the real Lincoln was so quiet. Of course, he has a great voice when he needs it, like when he persuades a group of drunken lynchings to accuse the accused, but Fonda plays Lincoln too meekly. However, the other performances are solid, especially Alice Brady in the role of Abigail Clay, the mother of the defendants. She is a good lady that we can really try. Simple and uneducated, yet very sweet; we can see why Lincoln wanted to help her. <br /> <br /> John Ford seems to think of this film as epic, and by the time of its release, it probably was. But even then, there is not enough material to present it as such. <br /> <br /> It's a nice watch, but it's not a classic.
