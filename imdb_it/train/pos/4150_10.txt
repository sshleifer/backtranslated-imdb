I look at Cold Case because of the real life experiences represented. This was very close to me and touched me deeply, so beautifully managed, thank you, Merideth. All the characters are well developed in 3D, in particular Coop. The material is still difficult to approach, the United States is far behind the developed nations of the world. only this kind of honest and real experiential representation and treatment has an impact on the population. obviously, not everyone sees things the same way, but I am heartened by the fact that 3/4 of the men interviewed in the under 30 crowd voted like me 10. you are reaching the difficult ones - I will always reserve the "best episode" for this episode, please continue to take risks and accept my heartfelt gratitude.
