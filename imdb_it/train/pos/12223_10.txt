I saw True Crime when it was first released in the mid-1990s and I've seen it many times since. It's a big mystery about Mary (played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school student in a city in California who was tortured and killed by an unknown younger sister. Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police cadet who sees her brilliance and they decide to work together to try to find the killer. <br /> <br /> Many suspects in this. True Crime seems very "real" or real to me. I read a review of a newsgroup in which someone wrote that the total suspension of disbelief is present here and is so true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job, as do the other actors. The locations are correct and the writer / director, Pat Verducci, really captures some of the realities of Maria's adolescent life and loneliness (see the scene where Mary wakes up from the dream sequence after seeing the photos she took of Tony) . I would like Verducci to make more films. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen any other films like True Crime. 10/10
