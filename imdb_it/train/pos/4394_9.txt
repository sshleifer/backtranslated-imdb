So the neighbor was killing the neighbor. It reminds me of Iraq. While I was looking at the American flag (50 stars in 1864?) Dragged behind the horse, I understood why burning that piece of red white and blue didn't bother me as much as our destruction / indifference to the Declaration of Rights. I am a southerner, and I must have some historical memory. <br /> <br /> Watching the character of Tobey McGuire learn to respect the dignity of a former slave, while watching the black and German scalps (his ethnicity) being wagered in a poker game ..... it was interesting. Many twists in this film. The wife, who is forced to marry, shows both lust and a strong will, characteristics that we are not used to seeing in the "respectable Victorian Southern bells". <br /> <br /> The rebellious rebel of the rebel Southern gave me some insight into why my cousin, head of the Copeland Horse-thieving Gang, Inc. in Mississippi, was hung up at that time. Homeless bands roamed the countryside, armed. Does it remind you of Iraq? And how similar are we under the facade of religion and the ethnic background? And why the southerners are still fighting that civil war today. <br /> <br /> Too bad that we cannot use the same knowledge in the management of the country we have just invaded and that we are occupying, fomenting civil war everywhere. It is Mesopotamia, now called Iraq, which happens to have the misfortune to sit on oil. Missouri-eyed assassins raiding Lawrence, Kansas, could easily be the insurgents we are fighting with without success. <br /> <br /> Another anomaly was the father's tribute to the Yankees who move to Lawrence and set up a school "even before they build a church and for this reason they will win". Huh ????? I was taught history in Birmingham, Al and we were taught that the North was much more industrial and richer ..... that's why they won. Of course, LITERALLY had God on their side. As you see here, when the freed slave indicates that he is cutting out to free his mother, sold into slavery in Texas. God, what a horrible bondage he has given us. <br /> <br /> Acting quite well, so much blood and blood as the warriors ride happily in battle (but you have not heard any rebel disgust, so remember the soccer games in Alabama). You also have the real feeling of how stupid the war was, while bushwackers and jayhawkers gather their strength for another raid. They have lost sight of why they are fighting, and so are we. Just a more carefree mess. <br /> <br /> You are also up to date with the artsless children returning home from Iraq, as the bushwacker (ahh, what connotations) first has its arm closed, trying to save it, then amputated it and then he dies. So much suffering for such a stupid cause. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is fantastic. Now I have to go back to the DVD and take the production notes, one of the favorite parts of any movie. I suspect that this film was written by a Gore Vidal, as the spoken language is of a type that would be associated with that era, if I knew History. The dialogue is very stimulating. Not your normal war movie and blood, by any means. See the wounded soldiers but still in active service, still fighting because they have nothing else to do. See the southern raiders, who live off the land, who steal indiscriminately. Yet at the beginning, you saw the end of the battle, so women could be evacuated from danger. As I read the growing number of women and children who die in Iraq, I think, "Where did we lose our sense of honor as a people?" I forgot why I looked for this film and bought it after 20 years, but some books praised it. With good reason Tobey at his best, pre-Spideyman. Buy the DVD or rent it. And tell me why the others praise this, not only the liberals accept moi.
