Although it is not as disturbing as its classic predecessor (ZOMBI 2), I like this much more. This is due to the faster pace, better settings and the soundtrack of the 80s. It is full of action and has the sweetest effects of Lucio Fulci. Zombies don't look ugly like in ZOMBI 2, but they look good. It has been rendered quite well, but it certainly has its share of cheesiness; for example some zombies move very slowly while others are as fast as the ninjas. some are braindead while others say funny lines, but who expects consistency when it comes to Italian horror? There's even a flying zombie head! How radical is it? Absolutely not to be missed for the gorehounds and zombie fans. it will probably satisfy most action movie fans too. Also check out Zombi 4.
