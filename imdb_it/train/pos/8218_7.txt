With Harry Callahan rising for years, the inevitable story of the "old man with a splinter on his shoulder" had to come into play at the end. Callahan, at times he seemed fragile and out of place, his behavior was still unshakable. Fortunately, this film took some time to develop a different kind of story, one that could reinvent Dirty Harry and the whole genre. Although the film was not up to standard, it was still an excellent addition to the series, although it was becoming a bit out of place during a period of silly New Wave fashion and music trends.
