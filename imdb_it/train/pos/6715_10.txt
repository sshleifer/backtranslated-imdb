I enjoyed watching "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" on Friday night on ABC's TGIF. I think this was one of the best shows on TGIF. My friends and I gathered every Friday just to see this show and we never missed an episode. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was Salem. He was adorable and so funny. I also liked Sabrina's boyfriend, Harvey. It was hot. I think Melissa Joan Hart also played a good teenage witch. My favorite episodes were "Sabrina Through the Looking Glass" and "Hilda and Zelda: the Teenage Years". These episodes were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Overall, I really miss this show. I hope that one day the ABC will report it with new episodes. I give this show a 10/10 star rating.
