Bette Davis plays a coolly entertaining performance like Mildred Rogers in this 1934 movie. The film looks pretty dated now in 2003. It's definitely worth watching for movie fans and Bette Davis fans, but it may no longer appeal for the average film observer today. It was surprising to me to see how young Mrs. Davis looks in this move. Actors turn into shows that are basically healthy and the story is meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard is well cast as Philip Carey, the club-footed medical student. This is a film with a strong message about who we choose to love and why. However, "Of Human Bondage" does not seem to have a strong impact on me mentally or emotionally. I felt slightly indifferent and detached about the film after seeing it. I realized that this could be the reaction the director was looking for. You are the judge! <br /> <br />
