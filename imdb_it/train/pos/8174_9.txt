I love this movie. As a child, this was one of the first movies I saw that startled me. Sure, it's mild now, but in the past, it's been fantastic. Dentists are something that many people fear, so why not make a film about a killer dentist? It's fun, it's fun, sometimes it's scary, but it's great. And I've always had a love for medical horror. And Corbin Bernsen plays Dr. Feinstone perfectly, nobody could have done it better. And for a low-budget horror movie, the effects and the like are pretty good. And I also love theme music, it goes well with the film. Even Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) is a nosy cop, and he does a great job. There is a good amount of blood and some really interesting torture / death scenes. Check this out!
