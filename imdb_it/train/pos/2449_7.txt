when I saw commercials for this I thought "NO WHAT IT DID DONE!" because it was a "fresh prince" slot. well, I still love the fresh prince. but george lopez is a surprisingly good show. i love how benny is not stereotypical. carmen is a pretty good character, it's really fun to see how stupid and over-impressionable he can be sometimes. I feel bad for the guy who plays at the top, he looks much younger than he really is! but max is a fun character and has done well. and yes, angie is a bit stereotypical, but she has her funny moments. ha ha george has a big head! nah but can also be very good. fun show! surely it should be more often than home improvement.
