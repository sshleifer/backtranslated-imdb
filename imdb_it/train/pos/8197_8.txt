**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Good <br /> <br /> ** Fair <br /> <br /> * Poor <br /> <br /> `Go ahead, do my day! <br /> <br /> The fourth photo of the series is directed by Eastwood himself (who was rumored to be directing most of Magnum Force) and reports the violent society from the first two films. However, the film still lacks impact and credibility. This film was released in the early 1980s, at the time of Regan and young Republicans. The premise of a raped woman taking revenge on her rapist does not appeal to this time period. This plot would have been better for the Enforcer, which actually would have made a good movie. What needed Sudden Impact was a plot like on Wall Street but with Dirty Harry in the middle. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3 STARS
