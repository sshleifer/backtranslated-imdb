Congratulations to the director and the cast for such a realistic film. The grit, the lack of charm and despair drew me into the film and kept me there. I was really impressed by the way dates and information were reported in the film; that is, newspapers, letters, etc. He kept the film moving at such a fast pace that I didn't feel the urge to go fast once. Personally, I thought that all the principles did an extraordinary job ... it was good to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such difficult roles. It made me want to cry sometimes. Val Kilmer didn't surprise me ... his performances of this nature usually leave me in awe. Overall, this is a fantastic movie not to be missed!
