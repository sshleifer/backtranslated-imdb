There seems to be no middle ground in this movie! Most take place in a dream and, like most dreams, it is often crazy and illogical. It's also a wonderful production with some great songs and excellent performances, especially from our angel. <br /> <br /> Jeanette's dead sentence, unconscious insults and various other false steps on receiving the dreams are hilarious, and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a joy. At one point, he arrives to sing a fragment of Carmen, followed by the final trio of Faust (who is holding a little dog, for some strange reason), then "Aloha Oe" on the beach! <br /> <br /> It is a surreal comedy - extremely entertaining if you can get it underway.
