A long time ago, I watched this film by cable. Then I had a crush on Mary Moronov. I saw her again in Eating Raoul. I was convinced that she was the sexiest woman on the screen. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm a little stunned about this movie. 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This is the only movie I own on the original tape.
