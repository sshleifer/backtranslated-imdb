William H. Macy is by his side more likeable and compelling as a successful man and loving father who wants to get out of the family business without making his overbearing parents angry. He treads much of the same territory as "The Sopranos" on TV in terms of a midlife crisis of a criminal theme (even here he visits a shrink), but it is still worth observing thanks to a certain tension from Brommel (I don't see the time this guy runs after), an excellent script, and all around great shows. Macy's is excellent as always. This is probably his best role as "Fargo". Donald Sutherland is at his best to be creepy as a bullying father. Tracy Ullman makes a surprisingly dramatic turn of events like Macy's wife. The young David Dorfman is excellent as Macy's brilliant and sensitive son (many of his lines sound advertised and are wonderful). Even Neve Campell (who I usually find aberrant) is as compelling as the tormented young woman who captures Macy's gaze. All this is punctuated by a moving score and an incisive rhythm that lead to a predictable but still powerful climax and significant and moving consequences. This film deserved a much broader publication, as I suspect it would connect to the public.
