This makes funny jokes from all Cheech & Chong's gestures. It's the first I've seen with these guys. I found it really good. My father actually recommended that I take it. WHAT A GREAT MODEL OF ROLE, and my GRANDMA bought it for me, knowing how it was. What a family I have. Well, this film is very beautiful and nice to rent when you want to see a good classic. I must warn you, though, it's not funny. It has its moments but it's not as funny as there is something about Mary. Take a look anyway. I'm sure you'll laugh. Unless he's an anti-drug activist or something.
