There are moments in the film that are so terrible, your teeth hurt. But knowing that it was only a few weeks before the Code rendered the films harmless and insignificant, Paramount brought it into production before the insinuations and leering became fashionable. The vanities are so horribly anti-females that it's delicious. As Kitty Carlisle sings, women are exposed with price tags that would insult a prostitute from the Bronx. They emerge from the clams (pushes, shoves, winks, winks) in postures of absolute submission. Minion of the law, so stupid that I couldn't find the door, look for their skirts and chuckles. The bare-breasted chorus girls sit uncomfortably in the giant cacti (they could be a source of hallucinogens, perhaps?) While we listen to "sweet marijuana" and watch as the blood falls on a horn's chest. <br /> <br /> Of course, Carl Brisson has learned his lines phonetically and does not seem to have the slightest idea of ​​what he is saying. But it's worth it, since Norma steals the show while nobody is watching. <br /> <br /> Taking a moment of this delicate down means losing the point of the whole exercise. Watch this with a founding member of NOW and get ready to justify the whole tick of Hollywood schism in body shots. <br /> <br /> Toby Wing, by the way, is the icing on the cake. And neither does Duke Ellington hurt. <br /> <br /> A must down at Memory Lane.
