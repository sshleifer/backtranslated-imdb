This is the most fun lift I've ever seen and I think it's the most fun I've ever seen. If you are not choking laughter with absolute hilarity, then this is not your cup of tea. But honestly I don't know anyone who has seen this that they didn't like. It's been 17 years and my friends and I still mention everything from Goonie Goo Goo to the fart game, Aunt Bunnie, to the ice cream maker, Ralph and Ed to GET OUT !! There are so many individual and collective scenes of hilarity that if you honestly haven't seen this movie, you're missing out on one of the best stand-ups ever. Take someone from Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, The Dice, George Carlin or even some greats like Richard Pryor or Red Foxx and this will surpass him. I don't know how or where Murphy took some of his material but it works. This is what it comes down to. It's fun to die for. <br /> <br /> Could you imagine how this show must have shocked people who were used to Eddie making buckwheat and Mr. Rogers and so on SNL? If you listen to the audience when it breaks its first joke or when it says the word F for the first time, I'm in complete shock. <br /> <br /> The first time he says the word F is when he makes the skit because Mr. T is homosexual. <br /> <br /> "Hey boy, hey boy, you're very cute in their jeans, now come here ef @ ** me up the ass!" <br /> <br /> The crowd explodes in bursts of laughs. No one expected the dirty mouth that sparked on them. But the results were simply fantastic. I have never been struck by a relentless comedy like I was in this situation. In fact, the next time my stomach hurt so much it wasn't until 1999, when I saw SOUTH PARK: LARGEST LONGER AND UNCUT. That play was raw and unrepentant and went to the jugular, as did DELIRIOUS. I don't think it's possible to watch this piece of comic story and not laugh. Almost twenty years have passed and it is still the funniest thing in the video. <br /> <br /> "I took your children to fish last week and put the worm on the hook and the children put the fishing rod back into the boat and slammed their heads in the water for two minutes Gus "Normal children don't do a shit like Gus's. Then they started to move their heads around like this and the M **** f came up with the fish, then they looked at each other and said Goonie Goo Goo !, I said, can you believe this fucking shit ?! "<br /> <br /> Watch it again and prepare to laugh with your ass out! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
