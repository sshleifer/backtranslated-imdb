"Dance, Fools, Dance" is a first Crawford-Gable vehicle from 1931. Crawford plays a Bonnie Jordan, a rich young woman whose life consists of parties, booze and getting rid of clothes to jump off a yacht and swim. All this ends when his father dies and leaves her and her brother (William Blakewell) penniless. Bonnie gets a job in a newspaper using the name Mary Smith; his brother goes to work for the smugglers. The chief man is Jake Luva - played by Clark Gable while playing another swindler. Later, of course, he would become a romantic hero, but in the early 1930s, MGM used him as a villain. Not realizing that his brother is involved in illegal activities, Bonnie joins Luva. <br /> <br /> Gable and Crawford have made a great team. His facial expressions are a bit exaggerated, but this, along with his dance, is one of the things that makes the film fun. Look for Cliff Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket, like Bert. <br /> <br /> It's always interesting to see the pre-coded films, and "Dance, Fools, Dance" is no exception.
