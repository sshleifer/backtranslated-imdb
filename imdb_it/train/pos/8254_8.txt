Set in a bourgeois neighborhood in the imaginary city of Willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with a light touch plays with American obsessions such as gun mania and violence, materialism and the maintenance of the Joneses, fear of others, slavery , golf, and the disposal of the dead. Yes, it all seems a little heavy, but trust me on this, it's almost as light as a feather. <br /> <br /> Zombies are featured among the characters. Crucial questions arise, such as: who will become a zombie (90% of the population of Willard choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)?

And what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the reincarnated type of dead person? <br /> <br /> Somehow, director Andrew Currie, who also co-wrote the lively script (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), keeps this material unlikely by leaking for an hour and a half without wavering once for lack of a good laugh. A super cast helps: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the protagonists, helped by the young K'Sun Ray in the role of Timmy, the innocent boy with a good heart that acts as a loyal witness to all the madness of adults. (Having seen her only in "Memento" and "The Matrix", I had no idea that Miss Moss had beautiful fashionable hairstyles. <br /> <br /> The design and music of the production are exquisitely 1950s, for "A tee.
