This film is one of Tom Cruise's most beautiful films. Capture the public's imagination with his role as David Aames. His character can affect us all in some way. The plot is very intelligent and keeps the audience uncomfortable throughout the film. I've never seen Cruise's films so much before, but after seeing this, he shows me his true talent. My favorite part in the film is the end where everything comes to a great conclusion and he discovers the truth. If you haven't seen it yet, you should give it a try. It's one of those movies that once you've started watching it, you've seen it to the end or it will make you think and you'll regret it. My opinion is that you should simply buy it and take the risk which is what I did and it has become one of my favorite movies of all time. It's A * 10/10 I promise that once you look at it, it will stay with you and you'll like it forever.
