I have rarely emerged from watching a film with such a warm and happy feeling. I felt like I was out with good friends and I had a great time! I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was superb, although in particular I should mention Bill Nye as an absolutely flawless performance. Bill is an excellent actor and I would like to see him in more films. Even Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are the favorites and always love to see them while giving such a solid performance. And Billy Connolly, as always, absolutely gorgeous. It was a wonderful performance by all concerned. Such a refreshing experience to see a well written, superbly performed and good looking movie.
