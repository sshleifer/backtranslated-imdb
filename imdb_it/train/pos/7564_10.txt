In my line of work, they are occasionally contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to advertise their film. Whenever I can, I take a look at these low-budget films and often make me think that the future of Hollywood will go to dogs. Sometimes, however, there is a film that comes from pure passion and desire, as if it had been created in order to remind the film industry that good films are still possible. The short film BROKEN, directed by Alex Ferrari, is a real surprise and deserves a second look. <br /> <br /> With a minimum of 20 minutes, BROKEN tries to tell a compelling (but surreal) story with almost no previous story. The audience is shot down in the middle of the action without knowing what's going on. A young woman (Samantha Jane Polay) wakes up from a dream to hear a gunshot and is later kidnapped from her home. When she wakes up, she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs who seem to be at home in a comic book. These bad boys and girls are bigger than life. They are all guns and knives. There is no way out. <br /> <br /> The kicker is that, despite being a low budget movie, it doesn't sound like one. From the beginning, the feeling is that B R O K E N was shot, edited and produced by professionals. It seems that Quentin Tarantino did something on his day off when he was jamming with the Wachowski brothers. The film is sharp and beautiful, it looks beautiful and looks like something big. <br /> <br /> Acting is much better than what I usually see in these smaller films. Polay and Paul Gordon (who plays the chief assassin, Duncan) have been chosen well. Like two of the few roles in the film, it is up to them to bring the film. No special effect, no matter how good, would have saved this film from bad acting. Fortunately, Polay manages to convey the real fear and Gordon manages to come out as a true psychopath. Some of the more limited roles seem to be full of lesser talent, but it's hard to see. <br /> <br /> The downside of B R O K E N is that it lasts only 20 minutes. The story ends with a Twilight Zone twist that seems a bit forced and hardly thin. Looking at him, I felt like I had some epiphany, but there was only the feeling that it was much more banal than I hoped it would be. The film strives to be one of those puzzles that lets the audience talk for hours at the local caf√©, but turns out to be unsatisfactory. I still think this is the first 20 minutes of a longer movie. <br /> <br /> MY RATING: 8 out of 10.
