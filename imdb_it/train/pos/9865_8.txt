I saw the film with two grown children. Although he wasn't as smart as Shrek, I thought he was pretty good. In a cinema surrounded by children who were on spring break, there was no sound so I know that children liked everything. Even there the parents seemed to be engaged. The death and apparent death of the characters produced the appropriate rales and comments. I hope people understand that this film was made for children. As such, he was successful even though I liked him too. I personally liked the Scrat !!
