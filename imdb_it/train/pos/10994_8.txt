This is my first comment! This is a fantastic movie! Luckily I watched everything one night on TV. In the first 5 minutes I thought it was a B series movie, but later I realized what a fantastic product it was. <br /> <br /> I suggested to some friends to see the movie, just to tell me it was a bad B movie. How wrong. Superficial criticisms. <br /> <br /> I think the film is almost a brilliant product! The well-known director has done an excellent job here and it's a shame to say that he's been out of the game all this time.
