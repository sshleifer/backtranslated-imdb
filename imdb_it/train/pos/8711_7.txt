It is beyond my understanding that so much rubbish from Norway has been remastered for DVD release, and yet gems like this fail to regain their past glory. I give this to 7, not because it's very good, but because it's one of the few SciFi movies made for Norwegian television. This film is nothing more than a historical cinematic gem that in many ways prefigures the first Alien film. And, my word, Blindpassasjer was the first! Did Ridley Scott or any of the crew see the miniseries? Although unlikely, the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar. Ok, the budget is _mily_the first in the Norwegian film, but since, it is a work really well done from the desolate age of Norwegian film production, which incidentally lasted until the 1990s.
