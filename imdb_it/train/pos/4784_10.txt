It's nice to see a movie with real people with honest feelings. Sissy Spacek is so absolutely convincing as a simple but pretty daughter of Robert Farnsworth, who finally, in her last role, manages to show which actor she was. It is hard to believe that this is a David Lynch film. It is slow and uniform, sweet and moving. One of the best unless you like car chases, sex scenes and violence.
