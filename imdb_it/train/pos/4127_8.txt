I know that there are purists out there who are shitting something that is not exactly like the original, but sometimes the spin-offs can hold their own. I like the new Iron Chef because it is quite similar to the Japanese version but at the same time it appeals to the American spirit. I love Alton Brown as a commentator, because he explains things with enthusiasm. The Iron Chefs themselves are very interesting. I know the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at the time, but Bobby Flay is the only American Iron Chef to beat them. Mario Batali seems to be the most fun when cooking, comments and is flashy while creating. I saw the series and found that all the players work well together. Judges are not always the best choices, however. There are some exceptions, like the lawyer who turned into a gourmet, but most of the judges are questionable in being able to manage what is being served. I like to watch the chefs move and the challengers are amazing. The food in the end always seems fantastic and sometimes inspires me in the kitchen. Perhaps it is all that anyone can ask, really wanting to eat what is served. The only thing that I would really change in the series is to ask people on the show to rejoice a little. Sometimes the mood gets a little too tense, and it's not always fun to watch when you expect more fun. I liked the version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA) because it was so exaggerated as the original, but I can say that it was a rather expensive proposal. I wish he had stayed with this version and been the guest - between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown, who would have made me smile for an hour. Until you expect the original Japanese version and can accept this series for its merits, you may find it a pleasant hour.
