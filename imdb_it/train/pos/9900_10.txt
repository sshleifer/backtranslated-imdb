they are films like these that make you wish you had never chosen nerd to grow up at school. If you liked this movie, I'd suggest you look at Valentine. I just found out today that the guy who played Marty (Simon) committed suicide shortly after the film was released, which is a shame because he did a good job. I wonder if it's because of the part he played in the film. It starts when Carol forces him into the girls' bathroom to act as if they were going to do it. When it was changing in the showers, Carols popular friends would sneak into the bathroom and get everything ready, camera, electroshock, polo. When Marty opened the curtain, he realized he had been tricked. He tries to cover the shower but the children open it, grab Marty and start to be mean to him while the camera is turning. They picked it up, crushed its head in the toilet as it was washed, and electrified it (lightly). When the children are punished, given by the coach, 2 of the boys give Marty a cane that will make him vomit. Skip breaks one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to convince the teacher to excuse him. While Marty is throwing up in the bathroom, Skip sneaks into the Science Lab and mixes things that look like cocaine but I'm not sure what it is. The lab explodes badly disfiguring it. 5 years later the children who tormented him that day received invitations for a 5-year school meeting in the old school that had burned that day exploded. People are killed one by one. I don't understand how the drowned girl really drowned. he could get to his feet after Marty left. It almost came out the first time.
