Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to make a documentary about New York City firefighters. What they got was the only one filmed in the World Trade Center on September 11th. <br /> <br /> After working with James Hanlon's ladder company, Jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak, while Gédéon remained at the fire station in case something interesting happened. A plane flying over the city distracted Jules and pointed the camera upward, a few seconds before the plane crashed into Tower One. Jules asked the captain to follow him to the Towers. The first thing he saw were two people on fire, something he refused to film. He remained in place for the next few hours, filming the reactions of the firemen and others who were there. <br /> <br /> The Naudet brothers were very concerned not to make the film too violent, grizzly and bloody. But the language of the fire brigade is a bit coarse, and CBS showed a lot of balls that sent it without censorship. The Naudet brothers' films filmed with individual interviews so that the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis. <br /> <br /> Unlike a feature film of similar title, most of the money from DVD sales goes to charities related to 11/11. Very well done, emotional, moving and completely devoid of political propaganda, is the best documentary of the genre to date.
