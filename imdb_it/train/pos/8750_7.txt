Brokedown Palace is the story of two best friends, Alice and Darlene, who travel spontaneously to Thailand and end up in prison after being caught with drugs stuck in their luggage. In this way, the film had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film, like "Return to Paradise", but instead the film chose to focus little on the situation of girls and more on their friendship. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both have excellent performances, and the film is much more about the interaction between them - suspicion, jealousy, interrogation and testing of their friendship and, ultimately, the sacrifices made in the name of friendship. This film chooses not to dig too deeply into politics or even into the harshness of prison life (which is somewhat ignored) and focuses more on these problems of friendship. <br /> <br /> There were some holes in the plot here, and some parts that didn't seem credible or realistic. We did not feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as we might have. And we feel very little feeling of life outside the prison walls, with Bill Pullman playing the apparently squalid lawyer who actually turns out to have a heart of gold. In short, this should, at all costs, have been a much darker film than it was. <br /> <br /> But overall, I liked it. The acting was good, the soundtrack was perfect and the plot had enough turns to stay interesting. Worth seeing.
