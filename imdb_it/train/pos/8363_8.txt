This is one of the best classic films of Edgar Wallace of the German series - it has all the bases for a very pleasant crime film Wallace of the 60s: although his majesty, Mr. Kinski, the young Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger is still missing, played once again as the typical intelligent American 'womanizer', you have the young Eddi Arendt in his best (and equally typical) ever role - the cool and sophisticated English butler - and you (not so much younger) Lowitz as the melancholy but very 'dry' ironic (and therefore: very funny) police investigator. You will also be offered a bizarre and very campy "evil" behind a frog mask (hence the title of the movie!), You will have a fluctuating soundtrack, classic b-movie action scenes, partly filmed out of perspective. wild (remember the time of its origin!), screaming the queens of screams, and so on ... All those ingredients are well-shaken in a sweet tasting cocktail of pure German camping Edgar Wallace - highly recommended !!
