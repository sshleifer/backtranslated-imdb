"The dessert is never so sweet without acid." This quote was essentially the theme of the film in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who has received everything in his life. He takes things for granted and arrives at full speed in this great film with an exceptional twist. This film will keep you busy in the plot and won't be able to pause it to take a break in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> It is a film that really makes you take a step back and look at your life and how you live it. You can't really appreciate the best things in life (the sweet), like love, until you've experienced evil (acid). The theme will really bring you to "open your eyes". <br /> <br /> The only complaint is that the film becomes very convoluted in the points and is difficult to understand. I think the end is perfect anyway. I suggest you look at it and see for yourself.
