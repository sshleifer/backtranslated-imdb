I saw this movie today and I have to say that it was much better than I had expected for a couple of hours before going to see it. Personally I had some prejudice due to his language, but he completely changed my idea. The film was in most cases surprisingly good with the great performances of actors and actresses. It was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to reach it. This really touched me and as a film, based on a true story, convinced me. A new school, a psycho principal and a boy who make themselves known to a new teacher, a little different from others and to fight for things even if they don't seem to work. He showed how small things can bring about huge changes in many things and how differences can sometimes lead to difficult situations. I also think that the selections of the actors have succeeded perfectly. It really seemed like you were someone watching episodes as a stranger when they happened. Before ruining this film with praise, I have to admit that there were some things and situations that didn't seem and seem realistic ... like the one in which the principal of the school beat Frits aka. Martin in front of the class at the end of the film. He was really badly beaten, but the only thing that caused him was the blood coming from his nose when you compared it to the first beat at the beginning, when Frits got points ... well I think every movie has its faults I must say that if one day one day I find this DVD from the store, it is safe, I take it with me.
