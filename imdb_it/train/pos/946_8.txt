Because the celebration of Christmas has evolved over the years, whether focusing on religious or secular traditions, it is a time when people should behave a little better with each other. Somehow he passed in front of an Ebenezer Scrooge, merchant and lender of money in 19th century London. <br /> <br /> As his nephew points out to his uncle, he does not keep Christmas in any way because Scrooge feels everything is bullshit Scrooge's humanity has been driven out a long time ago, it is a difficult case, very similar to his 20th century counterpart, Mr. Potter of Bedford Falls, New York. <br /> <br /> But as Charles Dickens told this story, redemption is not too late for any of us and a lone ghost and three spirits visit Scrooge and show him how. <br /> <br /> A Christmas Carol is a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much social nineteenth-century British commentary as Oliver Twist. The characters in this film are middle and lower class. The Cratchits are a pair of pegs over Oliver Twist's street people, but they have to struggle to stay up there. Still love and happiness radiate their home, no thanks to the guy Bob Cratchit works for. <br /> <br /> Like George Bailey who did a lot of good in his life and just had to remember how much, Ebenezer Scrooge needed an alarm clock regarding the potential he still had to do good in this old world. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart practically replaced Scrooge in his live performances and in the movie. But George C. Scott catches the old miser quite well in this movie. His wickedness, but with a trace of sadness that makes us uproot for him to change. Scott joins a beautiful tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim who both played Scrooge in a fantastic way. <br /> <br /> Among the supporting roles, I particularly liked David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward, a severe Christmas gift spirit. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb this is one of the 32 versions of A Christmas Carol made that have been archived and is one of the best.
