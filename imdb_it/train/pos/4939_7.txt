This film is not exceptional, but it is beautiful and fun. It looks like an independent film made from a script. Morgan Freeman practically plays himself, even though the director swears that the script was not written for him. And there is the small irony of the actor who goes to a supermarket to do research for a film he has not yet committed to. I mean, in the end he made the film and we're watching it :) <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue a little too positive for my taste, but still refreshing. This is a film that inspires the viewer to take a look at their lives and choose the direction in which to go. A little too much emphasis on appearance, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: a good movie, made in two weeks, with basically two actors and some extras, guided dialogue, makes Morgan Freeman look good :)
