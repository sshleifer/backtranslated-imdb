I was introduced to "Eddie" for the first time by friends from "across the pond" who know that I like intelligent humor. I prefer the comedians who can be thought provoking having fun like George Carlin and Dennis Miller. In "Dress to Kill" Eddie offers the same kind of social observation humor that stimulates your thoughts on a subject, while at the same time causing your part to split at the same time. There is a wide range of topics in this stand-up and they are simply hysterical. The piece on how to decide on Englebert's stage name will leave you breathless! <br /> <br /> Thanks Andrew and Catherine! ... and "Do you have a flag?"
