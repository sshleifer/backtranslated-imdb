There is not much to do in this story - just two men who employ very different ways of handling memories of Vietnam. But what is lacking in the introduction, more than compensates for acting and realism. It is a quiet film about the bonds of friendship and shared experience. We also have romance (not free - just another very real piece of this story). It is worth seeing.
