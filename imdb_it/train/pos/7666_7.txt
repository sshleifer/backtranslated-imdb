Two sorcerers fight in the fourth dimension, one (Brian Thompson as Kabal) trying to destroy the Earth, the other (Jeffrey Combs in the role of Anton Mordrid) trying to save him. "Doctor Mordrid" is a fun fantasy fare that offers a lot of cheese.The plot is pretty stupid and the blood is completely absent, but the movie is very short and fun. So if you have enough time to kill give this a look. my vote: 7 out of 10.
