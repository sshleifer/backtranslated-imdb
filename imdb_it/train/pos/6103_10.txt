I saw the movie recently during the Boston Film Festival. The film was a lot of fun and it's something I believe in the world, and black America is ready to see. It has comedy, drama, the soundtrack is great. It's a nice movie all around. The characters were well developed and the film had a wide variety of prominent actors, such as Wood Harris (Remember the Titains, Paid in Full), Brian J. White (Trois 3, Mr 3000) and the wonderful Zoe Saldana (Drumline, Pirates of the Caribbean). The film addresses many relevant topics in today's society in a short period of time, and does so with class and grace. This is not just a story about hospital life, but it is a story about people and their personal journey to discover who they are or who they will be.
