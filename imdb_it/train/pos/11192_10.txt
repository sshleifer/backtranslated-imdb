It takes a while to get in, but in the end the whole room screams, screams, screams, repeatedly rewinds the scenes, repeats dialogues, and completely and completely absorbed by the cinematic experience of Pia Zadora in "The Lonely Lady" "Scenes after scene of the movie TRASH more skillfully filmed, poorly written, horribly played, you are launched into an all-out assault that ranks as the most fearsome thing I have (no small statement, friends.) For me, nothing compares to 2 U, Pia ... and I don't think I'm the only one who ever felt that way!
