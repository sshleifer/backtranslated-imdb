This film is extraordinarily beautiful. The art of Goldsworthy really benefits from the cinematographic medium because you can see art in its most beautiful, moving, changing and flourishing form. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. I can't think of anything else to say about it. It's just the kind of movie you MUST see, because it's so visually compelling and left me very up to date when I left the theater.
