Yes, I will say before starting to comment, this film is incredibly undervalued. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is great in her role as Catherine Trammell as Morrissey as Dr glass. He is an analyst sent to evaluate her after the death of a sports star. Glass is attracted by a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mind. <br /> <br /> The acting was good (apart from Thewlis) <br /> <br /> Stone really has a talent with this role. It's smooth, mischievous and seductive and doesn't look like a day bigger than before. It really impressed me (like in Casino). Even Morrisey was good. He showed a lot of winnings in a role he needed. Thewlis however was lame. He ruined his character and was exaggerated all the time. He really sucked. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is not the first, but Stone is a hoot to watch. Simply ignore Thewlis.
