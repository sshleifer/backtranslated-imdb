This comic-style movie is fun, has a nice action and a great futuristic style. Screenwriter Steven de Souza, who also wrote Commando, gives Arnie lots of lines to highlight: "Send me a copy", after signing a contract and stabbing a pen to lawyers; "What a pain in the neck", after strangling the subzero with barbed wire; "He had to split", having cut his body between his legs; and finally, as Killian slams into a billboard bearing his own face, Arnie concludes: "Now is the time". Strangely, it brings some similarities of total appeal, another science fiction film starring Schwarzenegger.
