Although this film has some weaknesses, it is worth seeing. I chose it for the cast and I applaud Bonham Carter and Branagh for choosing different roles from those they took in the past. Both portray very troubled people, complete with warts, but they make them nice for their humanity. The story is touching, but the performances are rising. Bonham Carter's "Jane" is a remarkable achievement, whose search for romance opened my eyes to aspects of being disabled that I had never thought of before, but it was interesting for other reasons too. I heard that the film ended too abruptly, but better than an emotionally manipulated ending (see "Enemy".) The real English environment has enriched my fun: it was England in the 90s, both urban and rural, without be depressing.
