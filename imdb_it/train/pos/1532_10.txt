This, like Murder She Wrote, is one of those shows, which after a stressful day at school, I sit in front of the TV, and watch. Why? Because I really enjoy it, and it's a shame that it's not on the air anymore. Dick Van Dyke is incredible as Dr. Mark Sloan, a medical investigator-investigator, who solves murders with his son. He is joined by a largely unknown but highly competent support cast, namely his real son, Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I noticed that in each series her hairstyle changes. I also liked Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but in particular I loved Michael Tucci as Norman, and I was perplexed about how he suddenly disappeared. This show is so funny, with big guest stars, sometimes it's a bit obvious, like Colombo, but in every episode there's always something to laugh about. In conclusion, a great series, with two thumbs up and a 10/10. Bethany Cox
