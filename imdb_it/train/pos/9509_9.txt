Wow, this film was absolutely brilliant. I really don't know why everyone says it has a slow pace. I thought the pace was perfect. The film is about Michael Sullivan played by Tom Hanks with perfection who is a kind of killer / murderer who works for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He doesn't like this job, but he does it because Rooney paid his house and helps him financially. He had nothing and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But his children do not know that this is his job, and when he witnesses a cold-blooded murder on his part, he is put in an awkward position. And when an atrocity occurs, he leaves with his son and is determined to take revenge. They rob abanks and much more and build a bond. I'm the perfect team. Hanks does a great job as always as Jude Law who plays his role by thrilling perfection. This drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and shows to a great extent what the 1930s were like.
