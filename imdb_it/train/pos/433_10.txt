This is one of those rare films, it is adorable and compelling, dignified and extravagant, a true gift. I consider it a prerequisite for any trip to Italy, or for any vacation, because it reminds you to open yourself to a wider experience (yes, find the magic). In particular, I appreciated Josie Lawrence, like Lottie Wilkins, but in this film all the main and supporting actors are impeccable. Furthermore, if you are attracted by fashion and costumes, the costumes are extraordinarily well made. I just hope they release it on DVD because I'm wearing my tape version! <br /> <br /> Absolutely worth your time, be sure to settle for watching it, without interruption.
