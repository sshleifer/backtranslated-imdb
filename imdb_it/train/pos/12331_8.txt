Being someone who lists Night of the Living Dead at number three of his five favorite movies of all time, and at the same time loving this parody of a student film, I feel I have to defend this film against the reviews criticism previously published. This short but sweet work has always been a pleasant surprise for the marathons of horror and science fiction movies in which those who attend have a love for the genre and know not to take zombie movies too seriously. This film is a tribute to the original, not an insult. It's meant to be fun, and many others I've heard singing and applauding agree with me that it succeeds. Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD more than 50 times. Watch the director's cameo as journalist Jeff Drexel, and even if you have the opportunity to catch his alien parody, loaf.
