THE SOPRANOS (1999-2007) <br /> <br /> Number 1 - Television series of all time <br /> <br /> Everyone thought it would be a stupid thing not to go beyond a pilot episode. The sopranos have become a cultural phenomenon and universally recognized as one of the greatest television programs of all time. <br /> <br /> James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic New Jersey crime boss, Tony Soprano, accompanied by a stellar cast. Edie Falco is superb as a worried and loving mother of the upper middle class; Tony Sirico is a superstitious and greedy adviser, often very funny. <br /> <br /> While the show has often been criticized for the negative stereotype of Italian Americans as mobsters, and to some extent this is undeniable, I can see so many positive aspects of the show. The portrait of strong family values, friendships, love and compassion; could this be present in a vulgar TV show about gangsters? Yes. Furthermore, other burning issues such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs, etc. are discussed. This is not a superficial and boring sight about tough boys and violence. It has much more. Many of the problems we see on the show are very real. <br /> <br /> The writing, which was very beautiful, infused the current problems so effectively and managed to harness them in the lives of the characters, which makes the whole thing more interesting. <br /> <br /> Credit must go to David Chase who created an excellent television treasure and James Gandolfini, for imagining, the most complex and enigmatic character on television. <br /> <br /> Simply outstanding. <br /> <br /> 10/10
