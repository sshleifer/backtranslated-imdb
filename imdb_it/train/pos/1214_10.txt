It all started with True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse to secure the club. Noble Heart Horse meets Dawn & John and takes them to see True Heart Bear. Later, the health meter went down to check if it was Dark Heart but they can't go unless the club takes care of them, so they ask Dawn & John to take care of the club. After True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse are back, they send Dawn & John back to the camp. Then the club and cousin's bears grew to get ready to fight Dark Heart. Eventually, Dark Heart kidnaps the bear and the children (Dawn & John) have to tell Christy that Dark Heart is evil. Working together to save the Care Bears. Later, True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse discovered that the shadow of the Dark Heart returned to take care of the earth to discover that they were leaving. The children (Dawn, John and Christy) come but were not powerful to stop Dark Heart. True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse come to help Dawn, John and Christy free the other healing bears, but Christy intrudes and is struck by the magic of the Dark Heart. Than Dark Heart saw Christy hit and stop fighting the bear to help her, but he can't do it because Dark Heart (he) doesn't have the power to take care of saving Christy. Care bears and children help Dark Heart save Christy. Now Dark Heart starts to worry and becomes a real boy to fall in love with Christy. Dark Heart is now a real boy and helps Christy work in the field. <br /> <br /> This is a great move ever and the best Care Bears movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I like all care bear movies and I can't wait to see "Care Bears: Big Wish Movie (2005)". <br /> <br /> Who likes this movie?
