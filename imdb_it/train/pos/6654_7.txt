The film took on a new point of view in Gandhi's life, which is beautiful to see and shows how human he was. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was upset about and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> My big gripe is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly inconforming in the film. He could have been better interpreted by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too complacent and seemed as if he were intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The film is not really all-round, but focuses only strictly on the relationship between father and son. The rest is blurred and used only to show the time frame and general settings of the film. <br /> <br /> Generally nice movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete image.
