I can give you four reasons to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Four of the best directors of contemporary Mexican cinema. <br /> <br /> 2. Four good stories, related to a great scheme. <br /> <br /> 3. A surprisingly good cast. <br /> <br /> 4. A bitter reflection on the biggest problem in this country (and many others). <br /> (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens this film with a beautiful story in a comic mood about the authority that practices extortion against normal people and still expects to be appreciated by his efforts. <br /> <br /> Then Antonio Serrano becomes more dramatic in the second piece with an heir to the history of Italian neorealism with an anecdote similar to "Peter and the wolf". <br /> <br /> In the third floor, the one that seems more independent from this series also in context, Carlos Carrera tells the story of a man who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. But after the recent lynching in Tlahuac and the tradition in this terrible issue in the State of Mexico, this story could not be more updated. <br /> <br /> And in the end, Fernando Sariñana returns to the dark humor in the "grand finale" in which he brings together most of the characters from the past sequences into one of the best comedies ever shot. Repeating the central scene from one of his previous films "Todo el poder", Sariñana gives the final lesson of the theme. And by the way, give us the scene that steals the film with Anna Ciochetti doing a brief striptease. <br /> <br /> Once the film is finished, you have a bittersweet feeling of having watched a good (and perhaps amused) movie with a very painful subject. They say that in Mexico people laugh at their shame and this is the best example. This film is the testimony of how Mexicans have learned to live in the midst of a criminal state (and perhaps have accepted it), between two fires: the criminals and the so-called authorities full of corruption. This film is also a wishful thinking because almost all good people have been victims of crime and are unharmed. If you had an assault without a scratch then you are lucky. In the meantime, don't miss the chance to see this highly recommended movie. <br /> <br /> And it's a good life in Mexico ...
