Young people, sexuality and the French countryside: one of the most unique films you will see. If you can see it, it is no small feat considering how difficult it is to find copies of it (a combination of scarcity and censorship). Sometimes it's erotic, sometimes disgusting and occasionally fun. A little boring even in the middle, but all in all you can't call yourself a fan of bizarre movies until you've seen it at least once.
