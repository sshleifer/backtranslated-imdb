This film had terrible reviews but because it was unusual and because critics don't usually "get" unusual movies, I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately they were largely right in this case. <br /> <br /> The film has only an embarrassing aspect, even the most daunting one. The kind of feeling that is impossible to describe, but it is not good. To further confuse things, the script is a boring and aimless thing, which is only vaguely interesting. <br /> <br /> The immensely talented Thurman goes adrift in this mess and hardly makes an impact. Hurt and Bracco try in vain to add something to the film with exciting performances, but there is nothing in the script. It might have been less embarrassing for them if they had simply chosen to drift off with Thurman. <br /> <br /> One thing the critics of the film "esteemed" didn't mention is that the movie is actually quite funny. Whether it's moments of accurate satire or extravagant and bizarre moments like when the cowgirls in question drive away from their ranch with the smell of their unwashed ... um ... front bottoms. <br /> <br /> Chortles continued to be, while I would not recommend this movie, there is entertainment to do and watch Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is useful for something different.
