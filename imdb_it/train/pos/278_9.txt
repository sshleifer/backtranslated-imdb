I have to say that Clive Barker's Undying is by far the best horror game ever made. I played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and the Evil Dead and Castlevania games, but none of them captured the sheer joy with which this game faces its horrific elements. Barker is good at what he does, which is the horror of our world, and shows how clearly his hand is everywhere in this game. Heck, even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters. Packed with lush visuals and an atmosphere sufficient to shake a stick, Undying is the game to beat in my books as the best title of horror. I only hope that this has come to a console system, but unfortunately the poor PC sales have crushed that in the bud.
