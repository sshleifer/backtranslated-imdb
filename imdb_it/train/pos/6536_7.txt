Let's face it; Nancy Drew has never been a great literature. It is in the same category as babysitting clubs, magic tree houses, goose bumps, ABC Mysteries. In fact, it was one of the original formula stories. Nancy is perfect, cute, caring, "cute", she has never had internal conflicts! and it never changes. Ned is pretty much the same. The film was true to that style and I must say that I liked it. It will never be a great film, but it had the same nostalgic taste as books. He had the right amount of suspense for my children (8 and 10). There was almost no offensive language. I liked the push for more conservative clothing. <br /> <br /> Corky was a little annoying. He was a little out of place on the campus of a high school. I never understood why he was there in the first place.
