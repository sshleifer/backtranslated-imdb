Child Sexploitation is one of the most serious problems our world faces today and I feared that any film on the subject would jump directly to scenes of an explicitly sexual nature to shock and disturb the public. After seeing both "Trade" and "Holly", a film prompted me to actually want to see a change in international law. The other seemed a miserable attempt to make me cry for five minutes with emotional music and the strange suicide. <br /> <br /> I don't think that turning this problem into a Hollywood tear-jerk is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt and I have to commend the "Holly" brands to engage subtly but powerfully with the terrible conditions of these children unfortunately they are forced to endure. "Trade" oscillated between the serious and the stupid with scenes involving the death of a cat in search of images that represented children forced to commit horrendous acts. I found this disengagement and sometimes offensive to the cause. If I wanted a cheap laugh, I wouldn't have signed a film about child trafficking. <br /> <br /> For anyone who wants to see a powerful movie that actually means something, I would suggest you save on the movie ticket for the release of "Holly".
