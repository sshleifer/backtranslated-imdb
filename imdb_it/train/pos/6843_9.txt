Screenwriter and director Brian De Palma is best known for his series of films that have been called, somewhat unjustly, "Hitchcock imitations". Contrary to popular belief, De Palma does not care Hitchcock; it borrows elements of history or character that may have been seen in a Hitchcock film and then expands them in a more violent and modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known to have mixed blood-soaked death with macabre humor. <br /> <br /> "Dressed to Kill", created as far back as 1980, is perhaps the most famous Hitchcockian film by De Palma, and is probably also his best. The story involves a disguised serial killer who attacks both a burned-out housewife (played by Angie Dickinson) and a street-wise prostitute (played by Nancy Allen). <br /> <br /> Yes, he will remember him distinctly from "Psycho", but De Palma's film is technically ingenious and obscurely creative. The sequence of the museum is particularly well structured and modified; the elevator scene is also one of the most extraordinary shooting murders ever staged. "Dressed to Kill" may not be a complete original, but I'd say it's definitely worth your time. Rated R. 105 minutes. 9 out of 10.
