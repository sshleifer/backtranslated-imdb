An absolute classic !! The management is impeccable, the acting is simply superb. Words are not up to this great job. The most definitive film on the Mumbai police. This film has passed the test of the times. <br /> <br /> Om Puri gives a stellar performance, Smita Patil no less. All the actors did their best and the film contests excite you at all times. This film shakes your whole being and forces you to rethink many issues that affect our society. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a policeman (Om Puri) who starts his career as an honest man but eventually degenerates into a killer. Bollywood's first attempt to go behind the scenes and denounce the depressing truth about Mumbai cops. Congratulations to Nihalani !! <br /> <br /> After this film a large number of Bollywood films have been published that have exposed the political-criminal-police connection. So this movie was really a trend setter. This trend has dominated the Hindi film scene for over a decade. <br /> <br /> This film was a moderate box office success. <br /> <br /> A must for the most demanding cinema enthusiasts.
