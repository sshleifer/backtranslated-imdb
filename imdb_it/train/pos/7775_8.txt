Another does not like that category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in the closet still qualifies as a clean, sometimes exaggerated fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their peak as Hadley's disturbed brothers, and they really took the roles and ran with them. Malone won an Oscar and Stack was nominated in the support categories, both honors were well deserved. Contrast the slightly bland cables. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called bad actors, but they both had better parts and interpreted them much more convincingly than they do here. It's a bit difficult for me to accept Rock Hudson who plays a red-blooded heterosexual like he does here, but it's more a personal injury than anything else. But this does not detract from the overall entertainment value of the film, which is considerable and this film is extremely watchable. If you're awake a few nights and this movie comes, I'd say watch it. It's worth it.
