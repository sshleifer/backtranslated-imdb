One of the great things about many of the superb Chinese films that can be found, if you are lucky, in video stores, are the very accurate descriptions of real and real stories. Goodbye, my concubine, the emperor and the murderer and this film are perfect examples. The directors make a true story and work hard to accurately create a film without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience - the hallmark of much of Hollywood, and especially of Disney movies. <br /> <br /> In this story we follow the last years of a famous local street artist nicknamed the king of masks for his mastery in Sichuan Change Art. After losing his only son many years before, he looks for a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that prohibits women from having such work. Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader. Everything is fine as he prepares with joy to pass on his art. But in the end the child is discovered to be a girl. From there, the story becomes very interesting, with a good performance by Master Liang of the Sichuan Opera - a regional operatic style linked to the Beijing opera. Fans of Farewell My Concubine should look carefully at the portrait of a man who plays the female role in Chinese opera. It can help them understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrated, but people who were psychologically conditioned to be totally unaware of their sexuality.
