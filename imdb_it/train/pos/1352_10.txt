I've never seen this movie and consider it a great classic with great veteran actors. During the time this film was made, people in America were different, there was no TV or all the modern things we have today, except for Radio and the beginning of great movies made in Hollywood. Sweet innocent stories of a young love story between a girl or a boy have been viewed differently than today. Ann Shirley, "Murder My Sweet", '44 played a young orphan girl named Carrot Top because of her red hair and found herself in the home of two elderly people, who were like two wise owls and watched over Ann Shirley. It was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if something had happened, the whole city discovered it in a few minutes. It's a down-to-earth movie with nice people trying to help each other in a very simple way of living. Today it really looks like a corn ball and stupid, but believe me, this was the way people were in America during 1920 ". And 30 and they were a great generation that loved good family movies.
