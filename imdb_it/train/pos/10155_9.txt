I really can't understand the negative comments on this film. Yes, it is a typical love story between boy and girl, but it is made with so much elegance and brilliance that time simply passes. Henstridge (talks about winning the gene pool lottery!) It's magnetic and fascinating as always (who says that the golden age of cinema is dead?) And Vartan keeps his. <br /> <br /> There is a latent chemistry between the two cables; the film is more alive when they share a scene: a lot! It's so well done that you find yourself wishing you could be together ... <br /> <br /> Ignore the negative comments - if you're feeling a little blue, watch this movie, you'll feel much better. If you are already happy, then you will be euphoric. <br /> <br /> (PS: I am 33 years old, male, from the UK and a hopeless romantic who is still looking for his princess ...)
