*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Directed by Richard Shepard. <br /> <br /> A well-formulated story and film, all together, Brosnan has never been better in a film role than his "Bond" films. After 2004, "After the sunset", his new role brings laughter and a great moment. The professional killer, so to speak, Julian Noble with a job in Mexico City ends up meeting the exact opposite of himself to a high-level businessman, Danny Wright (Kinnear, perhaps one of his best roles) also there for business. The two on the screen produce a comically laughter of laughter and fail to deliver laughter. Davis in one of his best roles in "American Splendor" offers another fascinating and witty performance. One of the funniest years and best movies. My final vote 9/10
