I saw this film for the first time during the course of international film studies. I am a "non-traditional" student and, perhaps for reasons of years lived or matured in wisdom, I appreciated the slow and reflective rhythm of the film's narrative. Linguistics with the heat and dust of an arid climate, the plot is profoundly psychological, full of symbolism on several levels and a complex inversion of the theme of being the Other in a land that is not understood. the understanding that comes is fraught with unresolved memories and the subjectivity of the stranger. Made almost 20 years ago, it is also a precursor in a genre of numerous other international films that explore colonial themes in colonized spaces, with no trace of the nuances of the cultures in which they entered. Much more generously filmed - and heavily funded - works that have been made since they reflect the same themes: Indochine, Nowhere in Africa are two that by comparison perhaps make Chocolat look pale and boring. It has no adrenaline action or extreme violence. The struggles are mental, emotional and subtle. But having said that, it is a beautiful film, it deserves a vision.
