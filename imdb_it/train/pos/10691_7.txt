I got it on the plate last night. I liked the movie. I traveled to Russia 3 different times (adopting our 2 children). I can't understand exactly why I liked this movie if I didn't see "bad" turn "good" and "good" turn "semi-bad". I liked the look that Ben Chaplin had in the whole film. Like "I can't believe this is happening to me", whether it's good or bad is the same (and it works). Grand finale. 7/10. Rent it or take it on the plate like I did.
