"I moved here to escape this kind of thing!" The sheriff of the small town complains. <br /> <br /> "Does Chicago happen much?" His deputy asks. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not really. The plot is that a group of Martians swap a Halloween portrait of Orson Welles' War of the Worlds as an account of a true Martian invasion, and concludes that they need to get in on the action! What follows are a bunch of setbacks that concern Martian's random attempts to conquer the city of "Big Bean, IL". Everyone concludes that they are children in really good costumes, except for the sheriff's daughter and her friend, a child with a duck costume. <br /> <br /> Martians are comedians and one gets the impression that they are not a threat to anyone but themselves soon enough. It's a fun family movie.
