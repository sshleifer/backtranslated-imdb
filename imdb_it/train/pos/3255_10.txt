Every scene has been perfectly realized. This film had a wonderful cast and crew. I mean, how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr. in it, no one has ever existed and never existed. He has the ability to cheer up any film with his incredible talent. This movie was perfect! I saw this movie sitting all alone on a shelf in a movie in "Blockbuster" and as he was calling me, I couldn't resist picking it up and bringing it home with me. You can call me romantic, but this film has just touched my heart, not to mention the fact that it made me laugh with pleasure at the same time. Even if it made me cry, I admit that, in the end, the whole movie simply illuminated my vision of life from then on. I suggested to my horror, action and pure humor of a brother, who absolutely loved this movie. This is a film with a good sense of feeling. It could make you laugh out loud, touch your heart, make you fall in love and enjoy life. Whenever you intentionally move beyond this film, keep in mind that you are consciously making the choice to live and feel this inspirational movie. Who knows? And if it could really happen to you, and keep an open mind to the mystical wonders of life.
