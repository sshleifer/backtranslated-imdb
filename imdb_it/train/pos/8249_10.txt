Mamma Mia. This film really shows the talent of the actors. Billy Connelly flexes his acting muscle. Really a fantastic man, if you look at him in Absolution like a rebel, Boondock Saints like a madman / assassin, and then finally in Fido like a zombie! His character in Fido looks pretty scary, absolutely fabulous! Cariie Ann Moss is not a hacker! Jumping into the Matrix career and Momento as a darker character, for a conservative housewife of the fifties who warms the heart! Rarely these days to see the actors not being able to be so cast. <br /> <br /> Now in the plot (No Spoiler, don't worry). This movie would make happy the joy of Max Brooks (author of Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z)! Finally a touch of zombies and well done comedy. <br /> <br /> If you like zombies, if you don't like zombies, if you're just bored, or if you're too busy, go see this movie!
