Starting from the beginning! This is not an action movie, even if there is a lot of action in it! I think you can compare it to American sports movies! Where a team of bad players succeeds in the unthinkable, winning a game or a tournament beyond expectations! In this case it is not football or baseball, but Taekwondo! At first these street thugs seem to be good for nothing! But soon we will discover that they do not want to be hooligans and actually get something in life! It's nice to see them fight and train! I was surprised how fun this movie was! From beginning to end you will laugh in pieces! The young Korean actors are very convincing! Go see this wonderful movie, beautiful!
