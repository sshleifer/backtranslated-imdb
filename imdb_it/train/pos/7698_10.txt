But this is a great martial arts film. Liu Chia Liang is second to none as a combat choreographer, only Sammo Hung at his best comparison. This is immediately clear from his exhibition of technique, rather than from disturbing looks, etc. During the fights. The direction is strictly controlled to not only excite the viewer for speed and movement, but to admire it with the precise skill displayed. This film also benefits from Liu's participation in front of the camera. Liu's performance at the banquet scene with which the film opens is one of the highest points in the history of kung fu cinema. Liu is supported by the beautiful and talented Hui Ying Hung (of My Young Auntie fame) and by 'Hsiao Hou' whose acrobatics are breathtaking, and preferable to any kind of wirework. As for the plot, this film follows the not rare theme of revenge, but with character and moral development along the way, and a perfect resolution. The humor in this is also the best. If you only watch a kung fu movie, this would be a good choice, it has everything.
