This is one of the best Bollywood movies I've seen so far. Family and friends feel the same way about it. This film is really romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion we need more films or films like this to keep South Asian culture alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao played very well in this, even their couple attracts many people to the cinema. This is a must-see movie, it's a family and romantic movie. This film is also the creators of Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kon. This film is the best right now ... the setting of the film was beautiful and this too is a huge attraction. This film is a must see ... recommended to everyone !!
