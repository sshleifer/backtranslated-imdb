This was excellent. Touching, full of action and perfect for Kurt Russel. I loved this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 stars. This film is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns that there is more to a soldier's life and people who learn that there is a time to fight, a need to defend. I cried, laughed and mostly I was awed by this story. Good job of writing for an action film, and the plot was appropriate and quite solid. The finish was not tortuous, but it was still excellent. If you like escaping from New York or rooting for the loser, this movie is for you. Not an undue amount of blood or violence, it was not difficult to look at in this sense. Something for everyone.
