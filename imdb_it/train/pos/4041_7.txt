Tenshu is imprisoned and sentenced to death. When he survives the electrical discharge, government officials give him the opportunity to be electrocharged or accept some experiments. He chooses experimentation and is placed in a large metal cell with a villain with a bad ass that survived even the electric discharge. They can have everything they want in the room (within reason), but they can't leave. after a few days the meals are reduced to one per day and the room temperature is set to 100. After some other alarms are issued at intervals so that they cannot sleep. One day a "witch" enters their cell (even if a glazed portion). What happens next I will let you find out. I could be in the minority here, but I liked the build up, it was intriguing for me. Now, if the gain were halved compared to the build up, I would have considered this much higher. <br /> <br /> My Grade: C + <br /> <br /> Media Blaster Extras DVD Set: Disc 1) Director's Cut; Trailer for "Versus", "Aragami", "Attack the Gas Station" and "Deadly Outlaw Rekka" Disc 2) Theatrical Cut; Commentary with Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhei Kitamura, Sakaguchi Takuand Tsutomu Takahashi; Interview with the cast and crew; Making of; Original trailer; and Promo Teasers
