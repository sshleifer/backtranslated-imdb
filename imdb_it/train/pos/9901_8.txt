This movie looked like a classic in the 80s slasher genre, which is my favorite genre of all, so when I saw it was Free on Demand, I had to watch it! It concerns Caroline Munro, both of Dr. Phibes' films (his wife died!), Dracula AD 1972, Sinbad's Golden Journey, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, The Spy Who Loved Me, Maniac and Faceless. /> <br /> Brought to you by the people behind Do not Open Til Christmas and Pieces, Here are my thoughts on this ... <br /> <br /> April Fools Day opens, where a group of children play a elaborate joke about the school nerd - promising him sex in the shower, and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet (all while he's naked!). The coach stops him, but both sides swear revenge. But the fantastic guys end up burning the nerd alive. <br /> <br /> Cut to the future, and at its High School meeting, or so they think (bwahahha?). The only ones with invitations were the band that burned the baby, and his April Fools Day (or actually, the day before April Fools, but the fun starts at midnight), yet they can't see the coincidence and stop in front of the school until dusk Then they finally break into the school and begin to storm. <br /> <br /> Inside they find food / drinks and a small shrine for each of them, each of their lockers and personal items, along with Marty's locker (the nerds) and yearbook. They also find the old black janitor / caretaker who spends his time saying "Oooh yesser! Yesser! I don't want any trouble, sir!" and then he is killed instantly. Pretty useless character, but it's still my favorite. <br /> <br /> The film takes a page from Alien's book, in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see! That's when everyone realizes they are there to die, and they start to go crazy, except for Shirley, who decides it would be better to take a bath in the old school showers at a time like this. Sure, he pours blood and acid and his face melts (very nice, mind you) The rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs and Marty kill everyone while wearing a jester mask. What is their plan? "All we have to do is stay awake and wait until noon, Marty won't kill us during midday!" Seriously, this is what he said. Apparently you can only kill at night. But will they survive all night? Who will live and who will die? And why are all bodies disappearing? Rent, buy or steal this fantastic movie to find out! The movie is actually very good, full of clich√©s (the car doesn't start, DAMMIT!) And it's simply fun slasher. Not to mention everyone has names like Carol and Nany and Frank, Joe and Susan. I recommend it to you all! And, not to mention, it has a Spin Off! The 1989 cutting class is a spin-off of this slasher gem, and that movie starts the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene: 2 people having sex, the boy wants to finish but the girl doesn't. "You talk dirty, Frank !!" she screams "Uh ... boobs!" "Dirty!" "Uh ... boobs. F * ck. Tits. Tits. F * ck.". It seems to work for her and at its peak, the killer strikes them both!
