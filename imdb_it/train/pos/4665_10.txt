I saw this movie for the first time about 11 years ago, when my former accounting university professor advised me to do it. I was stunned by the fact that a 1968 film could interpret computer crime so consistently and exhilarating. Maggie Smith is delightful and Ustinov perfectly interprets the "retro hacker". "O Nolo Mio" !!!!!
