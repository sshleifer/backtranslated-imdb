I saw this film when I was about 8 years old and I liked it but it wasn't until I looked at it again at 13 that I understood it for what it is; a cartoon about a criminal dog with a real heart of gold "adopts" a little girl to use it for her talents to talk to animals. The dog star, Charlie B. Barkin, is killed by his formal business partner, Carface, (who is absolutely diabolical, by the way). His soul therefore goes elsewhere, but only Paradise to find a gold watch that is really the time of his life, that Charlie, being the sneaky but adorable cadet who steals and rewinds, sends him back to Earth. Once back on Earth, Charlie goes in search of revenge on the evil Carface. This is how he comes across the young Anne-Marie, the little lonely orphan who can talk to the animals that Charlie intends to scam for his talents to return to his enemy Carface. But the rascal Charlie actually takes care of the young Anne-Marie and her plans not in place, because she has to decide what to do after Anne-Marie finds out that her "best friend" Charlie really used her to make money for a new and better casino. Now he must save her from the frightening Carface. I still love this film even at the age of 22. The idea and the plot are very different and original compared to many other animated films. I especially like the idea that a dog plays the role of villain for once. Carface was even better than him in the sequel to All Dogs to Heaven. In that photo he looked rather dubious about his role as a villain.
