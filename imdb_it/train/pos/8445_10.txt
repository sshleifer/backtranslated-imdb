Murder: the film turned out to be a good summary of a well-written, well-directed and well-performed series. The details that were not correctly addressed at the end of the final season have been relaxed. The entire series, and in particular the film, provided a realistic look at life (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate. My attraction to the series began long before I moved to Baltimore, but once I lived life here on my own, I realized how realistic it was. And the film has certainly maintained this spirit. I will definitely miss the new original episodes of the series, but I'm very grateful to NBC and the producers and cast for giving us a last look at the dark side of Charm City.
