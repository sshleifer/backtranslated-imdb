Shakespeare's works have a way of transcending time. The language somehow breaks the barrier of time. but maybe the actors really do it. <br /> <br /> after the disappointment of Romeo and Juliet (the version with Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio), she was hesitant to consider another modern version of Shakespeare. To my surprise, Otello was fantastic! <br /> <br /> The character of Iago was played so well by comrade Kenneth! even though Iago is really evil and despicable, the character has been interpreted so well that he did what Shakespeare meant by the character, a pleasure that the public hates. I must say that the fishburne performance here was really good. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to shakespeare scholars and lazy students (who refuse to read the book) in the same way.
