Seeing this film again it seemed infinitely superior to me than I had seen it before. The acting is incredibly wonderful. The characters are drawn very clearly. Brad Pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels. The other actors and actresses are equally good in every respect. Robert Redford has been creating a marvelous vintage piece from the 1920s speakeasies. The scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western Montana. All in all, this is one of the best films made in the 90s. <br /> <br /> You must see this movie! <br /> <br />
