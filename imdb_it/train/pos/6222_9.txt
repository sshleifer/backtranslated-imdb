This is really a great movie. Some of the songs have become immortal classics and Fred and Ginger's dances are among the best ever. But basically, all of Fred and Ginger's films are the same. After the singing and dancing are over, the other characters in the film make the film work. What really bothers me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His love story with Harriet Hilliard and the secondary plot of the film is the reason why I look at it over and over again. He adds to this film, he takes nothing away. He has a winning personality and a big smile. Randy is on my list of the top ten of all time. It's nice to see it as something other than a cowboy. OK, so he's not really a great actor, but like so many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. He was very nice and on some occasions managed to reach the summit. All of Fred and Ginger's films had subtasks that depended on other actors to fill the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the film would have to be shortened by about half an hour. I just hope more people appreciate Randy and I felt the need to defend him.
