While this may not necessarily be a so-called "classic" movie by today's standards, it is still worth seeing. The main reason is because, after experimenting with this film, you have the feeling that you have also experienced the counter-cultural idealism of the 1960s, though it doesn't matter whether it's beautiful or ugly. <br /> <br /> I happened to see it in a course of English literature at SUNY Geneseo, and although at the beginning it seems to be only an insignificant composition of the icons of the 60s, the film is far from to be simply "thrown together". <br /> <br /> My point is that if you leave the film unsatisfied and confused, the film has done its job: it conveys a desolate vision of the future that leaves you insecure and angry. It was perhaps the same feeling that the film tried to explore in youth exemplified. <br /> <br /> As such, "Zabriskie Point" may not tell a very good (or interesting) story, and at the same time its characters may be unilateral and predictable. However, it also conveys this type of clich√©, a rebellious desire to get out of the existence that Mark and Daria must share. Even the anti-establishment students are not authenticated as the government they rebel against.
