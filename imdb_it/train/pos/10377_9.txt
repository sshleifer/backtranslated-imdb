A film of which I expected very little and I only saw a quiet hour pass, but now it has turned out. Roll is an excellent, if not too serious, little story of 'country-boy-lost-in-the-big-city-fa-good', it's fun in everything, the characters are captivating and the pace is right. <br /> <br /> Toby Malone is the real star of the film with his captivating portrait of Matt, he said the country boy and the local Australian football hero comes to the big city to try one of the great teams. He is superbly supported by John Batchelor as a local gangster Tiny. Pay attention to these two. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
