This is a very beautiful and poetic story. Beautiful scenery. Magnificent musical score. I went to Japan twice last year and the film gave me this typical Japanese feeling. The movement of the camera is superb, as are the actors. Get deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic. The Japanese are very sensitive and kind and it's all very well brought to the screen here. The director is playing beautifully with lights and colors and shows the public that it is also possible to make them enjoy a film with subtle and refined details. Once you've seen this movie, you'll want to see more from the same director. It's a really nice movie and I can only recommend it to everyone.
