An American In Paris is an integrated musical, which means that the songs and dances blend perfectly with the story. The film was inspired by George Gershwin's 1928 orchestral composition. <br /> <br /> The film's story is interspersed with frantic dance numbers choreographed by Gene Kelly and broadcast on popular Gershwin notes. Songs and music include "I Got Rhythm", "'S Wonderful" and "Our Love is Here to Stay". He set a new standard for the subgenus known as the musical "songbook" with dozens of Gershwin songs buried in the underscore. The culmination is the ballet "The American in Paris", an 18-minute dance with Kelly and Caron set at Gershwin's An American in Paris, with a daydream impressionist style in the style of various painters, is one of the sequences of uninterrupted dance longer than any Hollywood movie. The ballet alone cost more than half a million dollars, an impressive sum at the moment. <br /> <br /> It's funny to think that a work of art born in a billiard game between the film producer Arthur Freed (SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN, WIZARD OF OZ, ON THE CITY, MEETED ME IN SAN LOUIS and THE BAND WAGON) and Ira Gershwin. Freed's idea was to buy the title so he could use it in a film about Paris and Gershwin's idea that he would only use Gershwin's music. <br /> <br /> The original cast was supposed to have Cyd Charisse but discovered that she was pregnant before filming began. One of the main reasons why Gene Kelly suggested to Leslie Caron as a female protagonist is because he felt that this film needed a "real" French girl to play Lise, not just an American actress playing one. Gene Kelly discovered Leslie Caron while on vacation in Paris, where he saw her perform in a ballet. When he received the call for an audition, he said, "Who is Gene Kelly?" According to Leslie Caron, his introductory dance sequence, which included a seductive dance with a chair, was considered too suggestive by some censors. Gene Kelly directed the short fantasy dance sequences shown with Lise. <br /> <br /> Vincente Minnelli first wanted Maurice Chevalier as Georges GuÃ©tary and "Celeste Holm" as "Nina Foch". > <br /> Minnelli was a very innovative musical director with Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), An American in Paris and The Band Wagon (1953). He used colors and songs in ways they had never been used before. He used space and time in an imaginative way. Best of all, though, he allowed himself to free himself for the long ballet sequences that end all his films. An American's ballet in Paris could be his best work. <br /> <br /> Although Vincente Minnelli is considered the only director, he was sometimes tied to his divorce from Judy Garland and other directing projects, leaving Gene Kelly to take on the role of executive. <br /> <br /> The other highlights include Guetary's surrender of "Stairway to Paradise"; Oscar Levant's fantasy of directing and performing in "Concerto in F" by Gershwin (see why he was preferred by Oscar Levant). <br /> <br /> The ballet sequence, now that we know it was successful, everyone now wants to take credit for it, Freed, Minnelli, Kelly ?? but before the film was completed, MGM's New York office said no to spend half a million dollars on a ballet. So Freed went to the Louis B. Mayer studio and convinced him, New York said no. Eventually Gene Kelly showed at the New York office as a British film, THE RED SHOES used a long ballet sequence and that the film became a worldwide success ?? and is still today considered the premium example of a successful art film. Well, the financial guys eventually gave up and signed the checks. <br /> <br /> There was an interruption in production after November 1, 1950, when Gene Kelly began to try ballet choreography. When the production for that final sequence resumes on December 6th, Vincente Minnelli has finished directing another film - Father's Little Dividend (1951). <br /> <br /> Irene Sharaff designed a style for each series of ballets, reflecting various French impressionist painters: "Raoul Dufy" (Place de la Concorde), Edouard Manet (the flower market), Maurice Utrillo (one street of Paris), Henri Rousseau (the fair), "Vincent Van Gogh" (Place de l 'Opera), and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (the Moulin Rouge). The backgrounds took six weeks to build, with 30 painters working non-stop. <br /> <br /> Roger Ebert said after seeing the recent restoration: "An American in Paris has many qualities, not least his famous ballet production number, with Kelly and Leslie Caron symbolizing the whole story of their courtship in dance. "An American in Paris is often compared to SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN for which he is the greatest musical ever made, and one critic put it better when he said:" SINGIN' IN THE RAIN me makes you happy and An American In Paris makes me feel good. " The ballet represents Kelly's fantasies painted by the great French artists (Renoir, Rousseau, Lautrec, Dufy) whom he admires. By organizing a screening for the then ill Raoul Dufy, the actor and the producer hid until the end credits. There, relieved, they found the artist, moved to tears, asking for a second help for the sumptuous finale. <br /> <br /> The film was also the first to win a Golden Globe for best film (comedy or musical.) <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly received this year an honorary Oscar for " his versatility as an actor, singer, director and dancer, and in particular for his brilliant results in the art of cinematographic choreography ". It was his only Oscar.
