In Iran, the Islamic revolution has shaped all parts of life, including everyday things. But people continue to live their lives, generally just by doing the things you would expect, like going to soccer games to cheer for the national team as it is running to qualify for the World Cup. Except for women, it is not permitted to go to the football stadium to watch the game. <br /> <br /> A small, often humorous film follows the small group of women who were captured as they sneaked into the soccer stadium and the small group of soldiers charged with keeping them in an enclosure just outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple desire of these women to cheer up the team (nothing subversive there), and little human touches on everyone's life, adds a nice comment on humanity against ideology. <br /> amateur acting, good screenplay and dialogues, a really nice movie. Bend It Like Beckham, a kind of - a warm heart and a joy in people's daily interests and pleasures.
