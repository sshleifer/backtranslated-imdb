Here is a decent mid-70s horror movie on an Inferno gate in New York that appears to be an old brownstone. There seems to be a lot of hell doors around, but of course this unconscious model happens to need some space from her boyfriend / girlfriend and so she happens to pick one, which is disguised as a nice apartment at reasonable prices. Meet several unknown neighbors and even attend a birthday party for a cat. Meeting with the real estate agent because he hears strange noises at night from upstairs, he discovers that she and an old priest are supposed to be the only tenants. Whoa! So who are all these weird? Her boyfriend (a slimy lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) starts rummaging around and discovers that things are not what they seem, not for a long time. This has some decent gruesome scenes and the idea of ​​the creaky old men who are his "sometimes" neighbors to be different from what they appear is quite intriguing. A bit of good blood and even a parade of non-normal people towards the end make this a decent watch, and while I've seen the full version of the DVD on TV many times, it's much better, of course. Not a bad horror movie, maybe a good piece to go with "Burnt Offerings". 8 out of 10.
