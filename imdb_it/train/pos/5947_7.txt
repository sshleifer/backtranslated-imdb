50 years, this musical comedy may seem old, but wears it with dignity. <br /> <br /> This movie is still a lot of fun. Crosby has never been a truly romantic lead material, but it offers the material with the slightly humorous side it needs. Bendix plays in a broad way and is very fun in a part that calls its strengths. Hardwicke: how joyful it is for a knight of the kingdom - genuine - to throw himself into somersaults like this with such abandon. And Rhonda Fleming has fun in the less showy of the main roles. Only Murvyn Vye disappoints as unconvincing Merlin. <br /> <br /> Although not a musical, the songs are very good, and the "dance" routine that accompanies Busy Doing Nothing is perfect - fun, appropriate, skillful without being demanding, and making a virtue of movement musical by Crosby which, let's face it, was in itself funny, never being his greatest strength. <br /> <br /> The color is good, the sound is a bit muddy in some places. br /> <br /> And the story - well, it takes a bit of freedom with the original, but I suspect that Mr Clemens could have been satisfied with the result.
