I saw it on an 8-hour flight and (presumably because of the pressure and altitude) I actually found it slightly funny (the emphasis on "mild"). <br /> <br /> The idea behind the film was brilliant: a woman dies, her boyfriend falls in love with someone else, decides to make sure they don't join, but in the end lets him do it. Unfortunately the film was not so good. OK, there was some laughter and all the actors worked well. But from the beginning the plot was as predictable as the destination of the flight I was on. I think the whole part of gay-but-gay history could have worked out much better. The talking parrot was a good idea, but to be honest, it wasn't really fun. <br /> <br /> In summary the film was more interesting than fixing the seat in front of me, but it was a call.
