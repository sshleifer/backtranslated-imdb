I saw his film in Dallas, Texas, when it was released in 1986. I remember that they were giving out prizes for showing up to see the movie. After seeing the movie, I can understand why. The film was not bad, nor was it great. The problem with this film is that it has tried to tell a secondary story. They created a new story, new characters and tried to wrap up the Masters saga. My biggest complaint is that the plot is about a second wave of Robotech Masters attacking the Earth. They also used the same scenes from the Saga Master but with different dialogues. As a child, I loved the movie. But unfortunately I didn't see him as an adult and I can't give a better review. Looking back I was disappointed but now I'd like to see the movie and re-evaluate my position on it. Having said that, would anyone release this film for the whole world to judge? I love Robotech and I'm looking forward to The Shadows Chronicles.
