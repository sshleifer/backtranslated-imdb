In the aftermath of Watergate, a number of conspiracy films appeared, like this one, written by the late Adam Kennedy (based on his novel). <br /> <br /> Gene Hackman plays former Vietnam veteran 'Roy Tucker', a loser who ended up in prison. He receives visits from Marvin Tagge (Richard Widmark), who claims to represent an organization designed to assist the unjustly convicted. They offer him freedom and, despite being wary of Tagge, he accepts. But he carries a cellmate with the name Spiventa (Mickey Rooney). Exactly because it is difficult to see, since Spiventa is an irritating little man who drives Tucker crazy with constant sex talk, not what you want to hear when you're behind bars. <br /> <br /> The benefactors of Tagge kill Spiventa before Tucker astonished eyes. Gathered with his wife Ellie (Candice Bergen), and given a new identity (strangely, he does not try to change his appearance. Taking off the cheese mustache would have been a start), he settles down, but discovers that there is a hold - Tagge he wants Tucker to do nothing less than assassinate the President of the United States. Reject, so Tagge kidnapped Ellie ... <br /> <br /> I'll leave the synopsis here, but I'm sure you can guess the rest for yourself. The script has enough holes in the plot to make you want to read the book (which is a trick!). The people that Tagge represents are never revealed. Allusions to the killing of J.F.K. they are unmistakable. Despite the results of The Warren Commission, the doubt that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone persists to this day. <br /> <br /> This was Stanley Kramer's first film in years, and while there is no turkey, he lacks the grip to say "The Manchurian Candidate" by John Frankenheimer or "The Parallax View" by Alan J.Pakula. Being a left-wing conspiracy film, it tends to wander around its subject instead of taking it in hand. I prefer the right ones - they're more fun! 'Domino' has the look and feel of a product for T.V. film, and boasts what must be the simplest escape route in film history, not to mention the finale of the Michael Caine classic "Get Carter". <br /> <br /> What makes it watchable is Gene Hackman and Richard Widmark. The latter, sadly disappeared earlier this year, is as superb as the mysterious Tagge, who initially appears to be behind the operation until he is ruthlessly eliminated, starting a chain of deaths designed to remove all traces of tests as one by one. the perpetrators of this evil plot fall - just like the dominoes. Like Tucker, the innocent pawn, Hackman is wonderful. One has to wonder why he chose to hide in such an obvious place. In his shoes, I would have fled to the other side of the world, anywhere to get away from these fanatics. Hackman's love scenes with Bergen slow the plot, and it's almost a relief when kidnapped. Presumably even the producers have thought of it, which explains why it opens with a bizarre prologue that defines the entire premise of the film - voiced by British actor Patrick Allen - that warns the public that "they" are out there, and that " they "are out for us. Comedian Les Dawson later spoofed this opening in his B.B.C. 'The Dawson Watch' exhibition. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney had previously worked with Kramer in "Its A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World". His "death" scene here looks like an outtake from that photo, with the actor appearing to have been stung by a wasp rather than killed. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy films were made only on the left but now even the right is coming into action. Last year "Taking Liberties", an absurd mixture of lies and half-truths about Tony Blair's government turned out to be Britain's response to "Reefer Madness". At least, "Domino" had the delicious Candice Bergen. The best film by Chris Atkins may have been Anne Widdecombe! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, "The Domino Principle" was made by Sir Lew Grade, the legendary British television tycoon behind "The Saint", "Jesus of Nazareth" and "The Muppet Show". He worked again with Adam Kennedy in 1980 in "Raise the Titanic!", Whose failure was so great that it plagued Grade's ambitions to be the new Louis B. Meyer. Being rather open, I would not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy.
