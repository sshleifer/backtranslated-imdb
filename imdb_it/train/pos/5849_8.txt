Damn ... this show was a real ass in the past and still continues to overshadow the cartoons today. I can't wait to track down some of the DVDs to share with my little one and see the same sparkle in his eyes. I have already presented it to Voltron (the one of the 5 lions, not the one of the 15 vehicles) and I started laughing when one day he told me "Dad ... you have certainly watched fantastic cartoons when you were a child !!" . <br /> <br /> Come to Hollywood, brush up on this and give it a live action attempt. It couldn't be worse than Spiderman 3 was ... Man oh man ... 2007 was pretty lame so far for summer movies. <br /> <br /> OK, I will suck now <br /> <br /> Greetings
