This is a fantastic film, a western about a worried man (Jimmy Stewart) who goes to Klondike for gold. On the road, he is annoyed by a local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntire, who recites a wonderfully evil performance), to whom he returns. McIntire threatens that he will be a dead man if he returns to his city, which is, unfortunately, the only way to return to the United States. The main part of the story concerns the peaceful city of Dawson, Klondike, which is overthrown by the new residents of the city of McIntire. Ruth Roman, for example, who came with Stewart and her two companions (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen, who plays Stewart's best friend), builds a saloon (a Hollywood front for a brothel) and tries to manage the city ​​restaurant and meeting place outside the market. The road also clears for McIntire and his henchmen. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann created one of the peaks of the Western genre, The Naked Spur. The Far Country is only the smallest, and contains 99.9% of what made the film so special without, of course, feeling like an economic copy. Like The Naked Spur, The Far Country boasts beautiful cinematography on the spot. The landscape is beautiful. Stewart offers one of his best performances (almost equal to his greatest success of 1954, Rear Window). I suppose it can be considered a cliché, since it starts a selfish solitary and learns how this kind of existence eventually develops. Still, Stewart sounds so damn good, makes this character very human. And the support performances are universally fantastic. In addition to the ones I mentioned, the lovely French actress Corinne Calvet is very good. And I should also discover Walter Brennen. Seems to have specialized in playing best friends. His relationship with Stewart is very touching, since he is, at first, the only character able to bring out any humanity in cynical man. The script is very well written and Mann's direction is impeccable. A masterpiece. 10/10.
