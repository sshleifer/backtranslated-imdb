I remember seeing this movie in the West End of Louisville, Kentucky, when I was a boy. The scene in which Dr. Carmus finds the gardener's coffin and the dead man's lifeless body was the scariest part of the film for me, only intensified by the darkness of the film. I also marveled at the people hanging from the trees at the end, until I recognized the part of the film where the Blackwood family name was changed by Blackblood, due to the fact that there was a character in the family history he was known for his many hangings of various people. Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to have the courage to add to the deaths caused by his family. I also noticed that when Foster enters the cemetery for the first time, he is careful to notice the sharp object of the gate, where he meets his end. I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to horror movie lovers.
