Modern viewers know this little film mainly as the model for the remake, "The Money Pit". The greatest spectators today look at him with strands of nostalgia: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas were all "superstars" in a simpler and less complicated era. Or was it? Time, of course, has a way of changing perspectives, and with so many films that today are ulcerated by social and political comments, there is a natural curiosity to question the controversy in older, seemingly less provocative films. In "Mr. Blandings builds his dream house", it could therefore be more than what the public was looking for in 1948. There is a political commentary, however subtle. Finding a home in the late 1940s was a truly exasperating experience, only slightly softened by the arrival of Levittown and the like. Politics in the film? Blandings children always seem to talk about progressive ideas that are taught to them at school (which in real life could get teachers accused of communism). Even in real life, Myrna Loy was a residential activist, a democrat and a feminist. Melvyn Douglas was no less a democratic brigand: he was married to Congressman Helen Gahagan Douglas, whom the young Richard Nixon accused of being weak on communism (and ruining it). Jason Robards, sr., Has a small role in the film, but his political activism has not been less obvious. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, Jr., would have been a very active liberal democrat for many years. Almost the strange colleague was Cary Grant, whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in Hollywood that was already slipping away. But this was 1948: communism was a perceived real threat and the blacklist was around the corner. It would be another decade before political activism reappeared in traditional films, and thus not so subtly.
