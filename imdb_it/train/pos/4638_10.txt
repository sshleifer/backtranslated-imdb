I saw this movie when I was in Israel for the summer. my Hebrew does not speak fluently, so the subtitles were very useful, I didn't feel lost anywhere in the film. We tend to get used to the subtitles after about 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie upset me !!!!!! It describes two of the most important Middle Eastern taboos today: a homosexual relationship between an Israeli and a Palestinian. It allows a person to enter both realms of conflict simultaneously. The dilemma, the emotions involved. The film culminates in tragedy when anger and rage push one of the lovers towards an extremist side! an absolute must see !!
