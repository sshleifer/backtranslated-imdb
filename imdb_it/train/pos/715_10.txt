Everyone who sits here and says that the weak link in this film is the Ramones would probably say that Amadeus was okay if it wasn't for that annoying harpsichord player. The Rock and Roll High School was centered around the Ramones. As anyone can watch this and not kick Joey Ramone while eating bean sprouts in the backstage in an attempt to keep him in perfect condition, he is obviously a daddy. Mrs. Trogar, the exploding white mice, the pavilion patrols ... instant classics. The Riff Randell character doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> If you don't like the Ramones, then you don't know rock and roll and you don't deserve to watch a movie called ROCK AND ROLL High School.
