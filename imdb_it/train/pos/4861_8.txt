Joan Fontaine is "A Damsel in Distress" in this 1937 musical with Fred Astaire, George Burns and Gracie Allen. The plot, what there is of it, speaks of an English woman (Fontaine) in love with an American, who is mistaken for Astaire, a musical comedy. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by George Stevens, contains some wonderful music by Gershwin, including "Nice Work if You Can Get It" and "A Foggy Day". The best scene is the "Stiff Upper Lip" number, which takes place in a fun house. <br /> <br /> The singing voice of Astaire plays in this more robust film than in others, and has a couple of excellent dance numbers. Burns plays the role of a publicist and Allen is Burns' secretary. She is hilarious. The problem, as others have pointed out, is Fontaine, who has to dance with Astaire at the end of the film. Stevens could easily have used a double because it shows the dance in a long shot, and takes place in the trees. I would have thought it was a double, except that the dance was so lousy. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing despite its flaws.
