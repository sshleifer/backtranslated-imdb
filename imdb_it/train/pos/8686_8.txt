The second official episode of the series "Columbo" ("Murder by the Book", shot later, hit the radio waves first). Robert Culp, who would be able to match the hiring with Peter Falk's detective in several future episodes, is terrifying as the irascible head of a sophisticated private detective agency that kills a client's wife when he refuses to enter his schemes of blackmail. The two stars combine well with this clever cat and mouse exercise that is one of the best in the series.
