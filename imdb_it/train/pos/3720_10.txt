Joel Schumacher He made an incredible choice when he decided to choose this cast and this script. The story is well written and well structured, and this completely new cast of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant. There seemed to be 6 "leads" and half a dozen media, and this is by far the best thing about the movie, the young and fresh faces of tomorrow. It's been a long time since Hollywood touched the controversial Vietnam war films, which says something about the "story that needed to be told" (as stated by Schumacher) and Tigerland lands in that handful of films of the best war movies. Yet it cannot be labeled as a war movie because it seemed to be based more on the human spirit of Bozz and the others. I think anyone just wants to see a good movie without all the special special effects, but just a good and gritty drama should go see Tigerland, obviously Shumachers Best has been working for the past 8 years.
