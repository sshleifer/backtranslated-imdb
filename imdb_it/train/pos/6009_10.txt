Mark Frechette plays Mark, a leftist radical of the college. Mark is accused of killing a policeman during a campus riot, and flees to the desert. He does this by stealing a small plane at the local airport and doing it alone. <br /> <br /> Once out of the desert, Mark sees a car from the air. A young woman named Daria comes out and sees Mark hovering in the plane. Mark swoops down the plane several times, causing Daria to be killed or hit. When he lands, he meets Daria, who is strangely fascinated by Mark's aerial heights. <br /> <br /> After entertaining a romantic conversation for hours, Mark and Daria get naked and make love in the sand. But with Mark evading the law, they realize he has to keep running. So the brief attempt by Mark and Daria is quite moving, because it does not develop into a full-blown love story. <br /> <br /> Zabriski Point was the Eraserhead of the early 1970s. Both films have a wandering and vague quality, along with complicated meanings and characters. Frechette was reckless in person, as his character was in this film. A few years after making Zabriski Point, Frechette stole a bank in real life. While serving his prison sentence, Mark died of an ignoble death. He was killed by a weight of 150 pounds, which fell on him when he was lifting weights. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film was the splendid cinematography and special effects. The incredible slow-motion scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion were a stroke of genius. Although not a revolutionary film like Easy Rider, Zabriski Point still echoed with the counterculture of the early 1970s. I recommend it, for those who love avant-garde films that show the upheaval, of youth rebellion during the early 1970s.
