War is hell. But this WWII documentary is a paradise. <br /> <br /> Not only is this series a breathtaking and almost exhaustive look from the Second World War, it is a poetic masterpiece told clearly and superbly by Laurence Olivier. /> <br /> This documentary series defines the genre. It's long, no doubt, but you'll like them all and would like to come back for more and more. (I have the series on DVD and I probably watch the series three times a year). <br /> <br /> Really, this is an impeccable film. In addition to Olivier, the best part of the series is to listen to the veterans who tell their stories; whether it's a real battle or finding a butcher's pig so you can have something delicious for dinner. <br /> <br /> I'm going to go see him right now (again, my ... eleventh time).
