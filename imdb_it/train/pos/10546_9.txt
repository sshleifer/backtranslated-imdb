I came across this film because I had a free new version of Blockbuster and I needed to grab something quickly, as the store was getting ready to close for the evening. The simple white cover and the title intrigued me. I am an "old" lady (relatively speaking) and my son is a young man of 30 years. I love movies that are pure entertainment, like The Sixth Sense, Interview with a Vampire, Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. My son, on the other hand, is a film graduate and enjoys very specialized foreign films, such as those directed by Bergman or Hertzog. Generally we hate each other's movie choices, HOWEVER, we both watched and LOVED the movie NOTHING! It was different from any movie we've ever seen before. We are both types of cynical / critical personalities and we usually make films as we watch them - but in this case we just laughed and enjoyed the film from beginning to end. It is our opinion that if this film had been promoted and shown in major US cinemas, it would have worked very well.
