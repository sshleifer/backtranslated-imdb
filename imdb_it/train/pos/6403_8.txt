MEN OF HONOR presents Cuba Gooding Jr., in what is probably his best performance to date. He plays Carl Brashear, a man of enormous courage and heroism. He is a poor peasant from the south, who wants to become a diver of the Navy, but he has problems because of his race. The head of the diving school, played by Robert De Niro, is a racist male who respects Brashear anyway. The film is about how Brashear has to agree on the almost insurmountable probabilities, not once but twice. Performances are what make this film special. Gooding is fantastic, and DeNiro, the best actor in the history of cinema, gives an impressive performance, his best dramatic work in years. Charlize Theron offers another solid performance as DeNiro's much younger wife. The film is based on patriotism a little too strong (though not close to the level in THE PATRIOT), and some of the characters are just the wrong size (Mr. Pappy of Hal Holbrook is so evil), but the film is a rarity among today's films. It is uplifting and unnatural. A wonderful film.
