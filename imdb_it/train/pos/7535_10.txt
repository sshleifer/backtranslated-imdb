The Club 700 offers a great perspective on world events. Some have described it as dishonest or cheesy. I find the program informative and challenging. It is natural for many to throw mud on a program that has proven to be so successful. There are very few shows that can indicate a 40-year track record of success in the world of television media and The 700 Club is one of them. While Mr. Robertson may have been wrong to say that someone should be murdered, I find it curious that so many people will literally stumble on themselves to jump on the chariot of criticism. I certainly said some silly things in my life. I would certainly be willing to forgive Mr. Robertson since he performed a great show.
