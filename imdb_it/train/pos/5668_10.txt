I came across this series rather by accident. After half an episode, I was captured. American Gothic was a strange and dark series with Gary Cole as the mysterious, probably evil Sheriff Buck trying to gain control of his illegitimate son Caleb, played by Lucas Black. I was impressed by the sinister sheriff of Gary Cole and was even more impressed by Lucas Black. Lucas Black's Caleb was able to confront Sheriff Buck, one of the most terrifying characters ever created for a TV series. I have rarely seen a child actor with such presence or talent as Lucas Black. If you haven't been lucky enough to see Lucas in American Gothic, see it in Slingblade. It was an extraordinary show with many ambiguities and mysteries that were never explained during its short run.
