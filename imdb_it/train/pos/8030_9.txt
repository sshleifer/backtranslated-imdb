This was another great Tom Berenger film .. But some people are right it was like another SGN BARNES character but it was still amazing .. Tom Berenger played a great sniper in the Panama jungle! Billy Zane was a bit like Cpl Upham from Saving Private Ryan in the beginning, but eventually he got a little more aggressive! Sniper was great and action buffs should watch it .. I remind you that he would have no more action than an action movie. I also have this on DVD and it's excellent!
