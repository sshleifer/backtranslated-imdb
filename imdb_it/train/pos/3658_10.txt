This film is like an allegory of the Gospel. It has such honesty and innocence that one cannot believe that it was made after the World War when Italy was devastated and devastated, and was full of a huge homeless and poor population. It is a monument to the best qualities of the human spirit, as well as the infinite creative resources of that land of inspiration. <br /> <br /> Toto is a character like "Idiot" by Doestoevisky, a modern Christ who finds his way in a big city. He is good and purity fortified by love, and his actions change the people he meets, as much as the dove that works miracles. The story is told in a natural way and with a simple style, but imbued with a magic that is almost a premonition of Fellini's surrealist fantasies. It is one of the most stimulating and uplifting films ever made.
