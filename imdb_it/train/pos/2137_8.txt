This is much more than the fascinating story of the middle-aged man who discovers the pleasures of ballroom dancing (even if it is). It is the story of a person who learns to love life again, overcoming all the pressures of work and money to discover joy once again. The bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern Japan towards anything from ballroom dancing to physical contact. There are scenes that will make you laugh out loud ... some where you want to get up and tango ... and many others where you will feel good. <br /> <br /> This is a great introduction to contemporary Japanese cinema for those who might have the impression that all Japanese films are "heavy" and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
