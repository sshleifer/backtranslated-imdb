Trapped: buried alive takes us to a resort that has just opened, and is about to close. <br /> <br /> Let's start with a guy on the march who blasts the dinghies, to avoid the possibility of avalanches. somehow, this makes no sense. in any case, a particularly large one is about to blow away when it notices that the resort is open. despite his best efforts, a higher authority tells him his day is over. <br /> <br /> soon, as everyone expects, an avalanche strike. <br /> <br /> Look, I won't reveal it anymore, all I can say is that this was a B-movie designed for the family channel (which I just saw on this, and the fact that it had no advertising shows which is a B-movie) however, it's a pretty decent movie, but it's partially unreal. <br /> <br /> in the first person, when people are buried by ice and snow, they are buried. not just traced by the dust. or, what about a CD for a screwdriver? It is not possible. and finally, what I cannot stress enough is that an explosion cannot stop an avalanche, guaranteed. <br /> <br /> in addition, it is worth a rental or TV viewing, but not owning. 7/10. <br /> <br /> The movie is rated PG, but perhaps it should have received something a little stronger. a boy almost loses his foot in an elevator, but his leg is cut around the ankle, a guy is toasted with electricity and diesel, and in the weight room, the dead lie around. <br /> <br /> have fun.
