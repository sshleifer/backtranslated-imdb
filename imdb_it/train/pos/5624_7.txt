I've never been a fan of Farrah Fawcett ... Until now. She was really amazing in this movie. The emotion that must have gone through footage taken after the re-take is not naked. This was a very difficult film to watch, the subject is very unpleasant and you feel so helpless sitting and looking at a woman who is abused for what seems like an eternity. I actually felt that the whole thing had somehow deflated when his friends came home and I didn't find the plausible conclusion. The director seemed very excited to use height in his shots and loved to use mirror reflections, I think he should have paid more attention to the rhythm in the second part of this piece. I'm sure this makes a piece of powerful theater, for me this film, even if it had a merit, has just failed.
