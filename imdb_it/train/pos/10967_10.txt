I saw this film for the first time in my acting and dramaturgy course in Tulane. I was amazed by how beautiful and crude this documentary was. It is a sincere look in the new reality of a life of solitude. The family is fascinating and I thought it really showed little Edie in her core. ** As a side note My professor also told me that during filming, Little Edie became infatuated with one of the camera men. ** Beauty, I find, comes from the naturalness of family dysfunction. It is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither of them could work in society alone and the rehabilitation of little Edie in society began to be desired. In all, the film is compelling for its aesthetic quality and its portrayal of surprising beauty. Two thumbs up!
