In 1943, a group of RAF officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decided to escape from a prison camp using an athletic flying horse in the courtyard. In 1950, it was decided to film his story, and he started a strange British Film Genre - the story of the Military Prison Camp that reached its apogee in Danger Within (1959). <br /> <br /> The Wooden Horse is one of the most peaceful films I've ever seen. There are no great dramatic moments, but a constant plot eventually reaches a climax that has more tension because the story does not give way to unlikely dramas, jumps or outstanding music (something that will happen!). It is absolutely of its time and works beautifully. <br /> <br /> Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead an extraordinarily low cast of actors and (I suspect) not actors. Without exception, all are constantly mono-tonal and silent. They keep the emotion out of their roles. As many were, until recently, ex-service, I suspect that they recreated their wartime roles as "officers and gentlemen". <br /> <br /> This non-emotional approach does not take away any dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most war escape films, the story does not end on the barbed wire: and this fact alone keeps me glued to the end.
