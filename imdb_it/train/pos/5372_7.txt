Among the first five episodes of Hammer's "Hammer House of Horror" series, this fifth episode with the wonderful title "The House that Bled to Death" is probably the most disturbing. As a big fan of Hammer Studios' Horror Gothic movies for many years, I wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series quite recently. So far, I've only seen the first five episodes and I have the distinct feeling that the best is yet to come, but even if the series remains as fun as the first five episodes, I will be satisfied. Considering that the second and third episodes were great to watch for their morbid and ingeniously obscure sense of humor, this fifth voice is surely that of the top five which offers the most genuine of horror. The episode begins when an old man kills his wife for unknown reasons. Years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) move into the house with their little daughter Sophie (Emma Ridley). Shortly after moving out, however, the family must find out that there is something terribly wrong with the house, which is apparently haunted ... The second episode directed by Francis Megahy is much better than his mediocre previous entry, "Growing Pains" " (Episode 4), and quite unknown actors offer good performances. The film is also well done in terms of effects, cinematography and scoring. "The House that Bled to Death" is a solid episode that offers the elements that my fellow Hammer "Fan would like to see in a short horror story. The film conveys a disturbing atmosphere, moments of genuine fright and clever twists, and is full of suspense and very funny from beginning to end. Overall, this is highly recommended to Hammer fans.
