I have no idea what people are complaining about. I saw this movie yesterday and I really enjoyed it. Stone has once again brought a great character. She was as good as she was in the first Basic Instinct. He still has those clever but complicated answers. Even if Sharon could be 48 years old ... it seems incredible! I don't care if it's as false as a Barbie. It's fine and that's it. Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first. Sex, violence and a fantastic ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours! Half of the people commenting on this film haven't even seen it. So don't listen to them.
