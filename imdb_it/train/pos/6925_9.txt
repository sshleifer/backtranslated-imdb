Lin McAdam (James Stewart) wins a rifle, a Winchester in a shooting contest. Henry Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) is a nasty loser and steals the rifle.Lin takes his horse and goes after Dutch and his men and shotgun with his friend High Spade (Millard Mitchell). The rifle has several hands on the road. Will you go back to the right owner? Anthony Mann and James Stewart worked together for the first time and invented this masterpiece, Winchester '73 (1950). Stewart is the right man to play the lead role. He was always the right man to do anything. The terrifying Shelley Winters plays the part of Lola Manners and she is fantastic as always. Danea Duryea is terrific in the role of Waco Johnnie Dean. Charles Drake is as brilliant as Lola's cowardly boyfriend, Steve Miller. Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson are also seen in the film, and are played by Will Geer and Steve Darrell. Young Rock Hudson plays Young Bull and young Anthony (Tony) Curtis plays Doan. There are many classic moments in this film. At one point the group is surrounded by Indians, because this is a western. It's great to see this survival game in which the winner and the sharpest shooter are the winners. All true western fans will love this movie.
