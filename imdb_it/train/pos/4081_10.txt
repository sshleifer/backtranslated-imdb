I have seen almost all of Miyazaki's films, and they are all beautiful and endearing. But this rises above the rest. This film really impressed me! <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta and their sweet and caring friendship. They were what made the film for me. Obviously the animation is superb and the music perfectly captures the feelings of the film. But the characters are the bright spot of this film: they are so well developed and full of personality. <br /> <br /> Now, I would like to clarify: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the film (with English subtitles). While English dub is good (above all), it simply pales in comparison to the original language version. The voices are better, the dialogue, everything. So I suggest seeing (and listening to) the movie the way it was originally.
