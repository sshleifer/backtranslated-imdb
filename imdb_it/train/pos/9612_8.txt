The good thing about this movie: the concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes. It also makes you think of those little things in life that could greatly affect someone else's life without you ever knowing it. It's a small world and this little movie shows us. <br /> <br /> The Bad Thing: there are too many characters and it's hard to say who the protagonist is, but it's still a great film. <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful film and many people compare it to Magnolia that I have not seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Not evaluated --- I would say that I voted PG -13 for brief violence, some languages ​​and sexual situations.
