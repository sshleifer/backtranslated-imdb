When we talk about Hollywood Hotel we could talk about one of three things, the real hotel, the radio program and this film that was partially inspired by the first two. Dick Powell was a guest on the Hollywood Hotel program on the CBS radio network where Louella Parsons highlighted the weekly star scoop. <br /> <br /> Powell and Parsons presented the Hollywood Hotel program in 1934, then in 1937 its fair share of the radio audience. Powell hosted, sang and made friends with Louella and her movie stars. With the power she had with her column, she was able to get the various stars to go ahead and connect their latest films for nothing. <br /> <br /> Then the American Federation of Radio Artists intervened and demanded that they pay their salaries accordingly and won the case. The Hollywood Hotel program ended in 1938. Obviously both Powell and Louella went to other places on the radio. The whole story is covered in Tony Thomas's book, The Films Of Dick Powell. <br /> <br /> But before the plug was pulled out, this film came out of the Warner Brothers Powell home studio inspired by the radio show. Powell plays a singer / saxophonist with Benny Goodman's band who is signed for a Hollywood contract. But when he comes out in Hollywood he gets involved with an elegant movie star, Lola Lane, his twin sister Rosemary Lane and an actor at Alan Mowbray. <br /> <br /> When Mowbray is called singing in a Civil War epic he's doing with Lola Lane, it's Powell's voice they use. So Mowbray develops a problem with Lina Lamont when asked to go to the Hollywood Hotel program, broadcast by the Hollywood Hotel. He has the study in the mood. Let's say the problem is not solved in the way it is Singing In The Rain, but Powell's manager, Ted Healy, proves to be resourceful. <br /> <br /> Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer provide a very beautiful soundtrack for the film. The hit song comes at the very beginning, when Benny Goodman's band with scat singing Johnnie Davis sings the Hollywood anthem, Hooray for Hollywood. My favorite is Powell and Rosemary Lane singing, I'm Like A Fish Out Of Water. Just listening to the lyrics of Johnny Mercer on Ginger Rogers who runs the Brooklyn Dodgers or Sally Rand without his fan, is a compendium of American popular culture in the thirties. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley choreographs here and while the film does not "I have the imaginary things that stand out with his previous work with Warner Brothers, the numbers are well staged. The great moment of Berkeley is in a restaurant where Powell and Healy were forced to take work, the number starts with Benny Goodman transmitting from the Hollywood Hotel doing Let That Be A Lesson To You and then at the drive-in Powell, Lane and the whole place begin to join the song for owner Edgar Kennedy's exasperation, and you know what you can expect from Edgar Kennedy's exasperation. <br /> <br /> Benny Goodman can show why he was named King of Swing when the band with drummer Gene Krupa and xylophonist Lionel Hampton as part of his ensemble, along with Frances Langford who sings.And probably the last cast member left in the group was a guy who had a small radio presenter. before of to become the 40th President of the United States. Ronald Reagan has always credited Dick Powell and Pat O'Brien as the two Warner Brothers boys who were the most useful for a young player eager to make their mark. <br /> <br /> Hollywood Hotel is a delightful and fun movie show, dated but so fascinating.
