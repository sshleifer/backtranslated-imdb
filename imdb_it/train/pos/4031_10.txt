I have been a fan of Hindi cinema since the age of 4 but never in my life have I seen such a moving and engaging film, especially as a Hindi movie. In the last few years, I stopped watching contemporary Hindi movies and went back to watching the classics (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay, etc.). But this film changed everything. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I found it not only in motion, but I also found it very educational for someone who is a first generation Indian woman growing up in America. It helped me understand my family history, which was always something very abstract to me. But to "see it", to hear it and understand it helped me to sympathize with the generations that preceded me and with the struggle that the Indians have endured. The film helped me put many things into perspective, especially considering the current world events. I never thought that a film could change my way of thinking before ... it did. The plot is fantastic, the acting is superb and the direction is impeccable. Two thumbs up!
