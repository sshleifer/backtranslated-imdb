I've seen a lot of episodes of Cold Case since its debut (especially now that it immediately follows The Amazing Race, but this was one of the best examples of writing and acting I've seen from Bruckheimer's house, especially the younger officers, it was perfect, and the script and editing, the soundtrack and the acting made this episode an effective tour: if I had been a producer, I would have presented this episode for Emmy's consideration, the portrait was made by Coop and Jimmy within the confines of the 48-minute episode, which requires a lot of talented people doing their best. I hope there's a warning in advance about when this episode is repeated, because I'm sure I'll notice a lot that I didn't notice first time.
