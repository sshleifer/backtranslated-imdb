I will always have a soft spot for this Disney movie, another of their live action / part animation episodes that tried to recreate the success of "Mary Poppins" and never did. When I was in elementary school, we would occasionally have a day at the cinema, where the whole school would crowd the cafeteria, and a film would be projected in the old way, more rolls and everything else. At the time, it seemed an important occasion when this day came, and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is one of the films I remember seeing this way. <br /> <br /> And from what I remember, it's quite fascinating. Angela Lansbury never gave her name to something that was not at least competent, and she is winning here as a witch with a magic bed (boy, that could be misunderstood, isn't it?) Who can take her and a pair of young children in magical adventures in distant places. Come on, which guy wouldn't want a bed like that? <br /> <br /> Vote: A
