Updated version of a story that was transformed in the film in 1938 in England (Return of the Frog) concerning the pursuit by the police of a criminal master known as the frog because of the frog how to stand up (bulging eyes etc.) is wearing. <br /> <br /> One of Wallace's good films of the 1960s is a small and fun entertainment. Clearly influenced by (or made this influence) the restart of Dr Mabuse's films, the frog seems to be more of a super villain than a professional thief. Although not the best of Wallace's films, it's worth a look. It would be an interesting double film with the excellent previous film. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 out of 10.
