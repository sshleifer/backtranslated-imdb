I just returned from Hong Kong during my summer vacation and saw the legend of ZU. I thought he had kicked an * s! He was so creative and unique. It is the hidden dragon of the tiger squatting with much less drama. Although some thought that there was too much special FX (yes right!), You can't complain about the cast. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are so good !!! The Legend of ZU ..... kicks * s !!!!!!!!
