Watch On The Rhine started as a Broadway play by Lillian Hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still linked to Nazi Germany by the notorious covenant of non aggression signed in August 1939. Due to the fact that Hellman was simply echoing the Communist Party line, the line did not change until a couple of months later. Lillian was actually months before her time with this job. <br /> <br /> Watch On The Rhine game aired from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 shows and five players came from Broadway to repeat their roles as Frank Wilson the butler, Eric Roberts as their son younger, Lucile Watson as a family matriarch and, above all, George Coulouris and Paul Lukas. <br /> <br /> Lukas won a hat-trick in 1943 by winning an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and the New York Film Critics for Best Actor. Probably if the Tony Awards had existed, he would have won that too. The Oscar is even more remarkable if we consider who he met, Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper in For those who ring the bell, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Each of his competitors was a movie name at the biggest box office of his. The appointment of Lukas is usually the type the Academy gives to complete a field. <br /> <br /> Jack Warner knew that this is why Mady Christians did not repeat his part on Broadway and the role of Lukas's wife was given to Bette Davis. Davis took the part not because this was a particularly flashy role for her, but because she believed in the photo and just wanted to be associated with it. It's the same reason he made the man who came to dinner, a game much lighter than this. <br /> <br /> Davis is the daughter of a late US Supreme Court judge who married a German citizen in Weimar times. After many years of wandering around the European continent, Davis Lukas and their three children come to America, which has not yet entered the European war. They were greeted by Lucile Watson who is thrilled to finally meet her grandchildren. <br /> <br /> In this ointment there are other guests of the house, a friend of Davis of days gone by Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who is also from Europe, a Romanian diplomat and aristocratic George Coulouris. Coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for a double game when he suspects Lukas's anti-fascist past. <br /> <br /> His suspicions are right, that's why they became the vagabonds of the family. Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there. His health has not been the same since. His family loyally supports him in any decision he makes. These decisions affect all other cast members. <br /> <br /> Adding a little more to the Broadway comedy, including some lovely fascist creatures, was Dashiell Hammett who was Lillian Hellman's significant other. The Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy were Hammett's creation with such disgusting types as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders. <br /> <br /> Coulouris is indeed one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as no Runmanian account counts. It was a metaphor for his own country that embraced the Nazis with enthusiasm and then repudiated them equally without losing a step after Stalingrad. <br /> <br /> Lucile Watson was the best supporting actress in 1943, but lost to Katina Paxinou in For Whom the Bell Tolls. Dashiell Hammett was nominated for the best adapted script and the film itself was lost to the best film in that other anti-fascist classic, Casablanca. <br /> <br /> Although it is an object firmly planted in those specific times, Watch On The Rhine still contains a severe anti-fascist message that repeatedly repeats endlessly.
