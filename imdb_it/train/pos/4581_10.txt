A French novelist, disgusted by friends of his wife's society, goes to North Africa for a truce. There he meets a lively and talented Bedouin girl who lives in poverty. To despise his wife, who is mocking a Maharajah, decides to train and educate the girl, and present her to the Parisian society as PRINCESSE TAM TAM ... <br /> <br /> The wonderful Josephine Baker is perfectly engaged the role main in this very nice French film. With his enormous eyes and his contagious smile, he immediately comes into contact with the strings of the spectator's heart. Her oversized personality and her obvious joy of exhibiting make her a pure pleasure to look at. Baker makes us worry about what is happening to poor Alwina during her transformation and introduction to European customs. <br /> <br /> Albert Préjean does very well as the Pygmalion of Baker's Galatea; also effective Georges Peclet as a half-caste servant, and Jean Galland in the role of the mysterious Maharaja. <br /> <br /> The film is very beautiful and well made, it seems a bit reminiscent of the Busby Berkeley films in production at the same time in America - although unlike the American films of this period, PRINCESSE TAM TAM does not has no racism. It should be emphasized that the offices or production code of Hays did not exist in France. Some of the dialogues and actions are rather provocative, but it must be admitted that Baker who sings and dances in "Under The African Sky", as well as his performance culminating in the Parisian disco, are two of the most memorable moments of cinema. /> <br /> Filming of real locations in Tunisia greatly improves the film. Josephine Baker was born in St. Louis in 1906, in a very poor family. Her talent and driving ambition, however, soon prompted her to move east and she was a short-lived member of the Ziegfeld Follies cast. Realizing that America in the mid-1920s had great limitations for a gifted black woman, she managed to move to Paris, where she eventually joined Foliés-Bergeres & Le Negre Revue. The French adored her and she became a great celebrity. A brief return to America in 1935 showed Baker that things had not changed for African Americans. He returned to France, became a French citizen and worked for the Resistance in the early days of the war. Baker moved to Morocco for the duration and entertained the allied troops stationed there. <br /> <br /> After the war, Baker's fortunes began to slip and he faced many financial and personal difficulties. For a while, she was even forbidden to return to the United States. In the end, Baker accepted an offer from Princess Grace of Monaco to reside in the Principality. Josephine Baker was on the verge of return when she died of a stroke in 1975, at the age of 68. <br /> <br /> After appearing in only two decent films - ZOUZOU & PRINCESSE TAM TAM - Baker is in danger of becoming obscure. But she deserves her place next to Chevalier, Dietrich and Robeson, as one of the truly legendary artists of her generation.
