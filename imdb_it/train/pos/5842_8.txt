Can I be so simple and primitive in my evaluations to simply say "I liked it"? It's reasonably fun by the bit, it has big stars and it's great to watch. The songs (there are about two that are then repeated) are forgettable, but receive a healthy ironic treatment (like the terribly beautiful Mr. Fairbanks who explodes in the frantic Wagnerian version of the tender ballad Miss Grable has just returned); there isn't much to dance with all the crinolines of 1861 wrapped around Miss Grable, and the comedy could be a bit heavy, but the result is still very uplifting. The photography (including the real outdoor shots that are a thrill) is incredible, playing with different shades of heavy and lush gold. Miss Grable is a little crazy and chubby, but still fresh and comfortable in this "olde worlde" continental comedy. It is practically along the lines of "Down to Earth" with Rita Hayworth, and this tends to be rather unpleasant for many. So I suppose many people consider "That Lady in Ermine" obsolete and suffocating. But it's a fairy tale, and these tend to move on a certain pasta anyway. My suggestion is: enjoy the works of art, the costumes, the witty script and all that this film has to offer, and stop complaining. The film was released on DVD in Germany, with soundtracks in both German and English.
