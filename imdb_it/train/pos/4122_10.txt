I'd like to see a resurrection of a Seahunt series dated with the technology they have today, it would bring back the excitement of the kids in me. I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my heroes every week. my vote for a return of a new sea hunt. We need a change of pace on TV and this could work for a world of underwater adventures. Oh, by the way, thanks for a store like this to see many views on TV and many movies. Anyway, I think he has what I mean. It would be nice to read more about sea hunting. If my rhymes were 10 lines, you would let me introduce myself or leave me in doubt and ask me to stop, if it is so then I have to go so let it do.
