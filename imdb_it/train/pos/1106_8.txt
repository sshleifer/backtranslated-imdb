If you are a fan of the great Altman casts, as evidenced in such major films as M.A.S.H., Nashville, Gosford Park, and films less seen as A Wedding, then you will surely be entertained by HealtH. Focusing around a health convention in which two women run for the president, HealtH contains many of Altman's regulars in the 1970s such as Paul Dooley (who helped write the film), Carol Burnett and Henry Gibson, including the new ones Altman arrived like Lauren Bacall, James Garner and Glenda Jackson. Like many of Altman's ensemble films, there are numerous subplots in this film, but it's not as overwhelming as films like Nashville or A Wedding, rather it looks more centered, perhaps like M.A.S.H. or Gosford Park. The whole is an obvious satire on the Health movement, full of extravagant, extravagant and contradictory characters, with guest stars such as Dick Cavett giving an ironic commentary on the whole thing. Emphasizing the entire electoral process is Altman's characteristic pessimism about politics and the public appeal, but what attracts most of this film is the sheer fun that most people seem to have. This would be one of Altman's latest films like this for a while!
