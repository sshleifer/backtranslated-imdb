Get ready for this: this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I am relatively unaware of the other works of David Mamet (writer and director) but after seeing this film half a dozen times (it's always a joy to see), I can say without hesitation that he is a genius. This film is extremely well written and quickly draws you into its environment of deception, confusion and the hustle and bustle of the back room. The feel of the film is very similar to The Sting (1973) and pays tribute to the film noir. <br /> <br /> It is a fairly psychologically complex film and will surely make you think of the various twists and the motives of the shady characters. It's a bit predictable at times, but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> In general, the acting is superb, especially Joe Mantegna, but someone who saw the film pointed out to me that it is not a good idea to have a heroine (Lindsay Crouse) who is not just a gambler, a smoker and a thief but also sports a nasty 80s hairstyle. I agree, but I think it's still great in the role. <br /> <br /> The less we know the plot of this film, the better, just like Mamet's most recent film, The Spanish Prisoner, because the ending will be even more impressive. Just sit down and get ready to be guided by a film that comes dangerously close to brilliance.
