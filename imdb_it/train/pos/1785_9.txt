If you can't enjoy a movie, stop right away. If, however, you like films that illustrate complex characters and provide extraordinary acting, read on. <br /> <br /> Ann Grant Lord is dying. His two daughters arrive at his bedside. Ann starts talking about people from her past that her daughters are not aware of and are wondering if this lost knowledge is real or imagined. They come to realize that these people from their mother's past are, in fact, real. <br /> <br /> The story basically changes between about 1953 and 2000 with some glimpses of Ann's life in those years. It was in 1953 that Ann met the love of his life and experienced the greatest tragedy of his life. <br /> <br /> One of Ann's two best friends at the university, Lila, is married. Ann's other best friend is Lila's brother, Buddy. Lila and Buddy are the children of a wealthy Newport family, while Ann is a cabaret singer who lives in Greenwich Village, who wants to be a free spirit but is still tied to many of those 50s conventions. <br /> <br /> Immediately after Ann comes to be the bridesmaid at Lila's wedding, she meets the person who will become the key character in the lives of the three - Harris. He is the adult son of a former family servant who grew up with Lila and Buddy and who became a doctor in a small New England town. Ann immediately falls in love with Harris who adds a complication to the fact that Lila has always been in love with Harris and continues to be. Buddy is also in love with Harris, but being in 1953, he redirected that homosexual desire of Harris to his good friend, Ann because he can't admit to himself that he has a sexual desire for another man. Buddy shows his inner frustration outwardly being the bad alcoholic and wise boy of the family - much to the regret of his very correct and tense parents. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, all these are expressed and repressed emotions lead to tragedy - after all it is a chick film. <br /> <br /> In the present time, Ann's daughters have moved away from their mother and are suffering from their accomplishments and doubts. Constance is working on emotional exhaustion trying to keep her role as perfect mother and wife. Nina, having always felt inferior, cannot maintain a relationship. <br /> <br /> Mix all these relationships over a span of fifty years, and you get an intriguing look at the company, its values ​​and its effects on the personalities and actions of the complex people involved. <br /> <br /> All the acting in Evening is excellent, but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes - along with two unique family relationships - that make this film really, really special. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes plays Ann from the 1950s, and does so in a style that clearly shows an intelligent woman of those times who is in conflict with what she should do in contrast to what she wants to do. His performance is not easily forgotten. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave plays Ann, who dies, whose mind moves from the present, to the past, to the flights of imagination and, of course, Redgrave does everything in style. <br /> <br /> Natasha Richardson - Redgrave's real daughter - plays Ann's daughter, Constance, in the film. The scenes between mother and daughter of a real life playing with an imaginary mother and daughter are an intuitive surprise to watch. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette plays the other daughter of Ann, Nina. Nina spends a good part of her time being depressed and sorry for herself as she closes a good man who loves her as well as her mother and sister. Collette is perfect for a part like this, but I've never seen it give a bad or incredible performance, no matter which part you play. <br /> <br /> Mamie Gummer plays the Lila of the 50s and shows us an even more conflicted woman of her expected role in life than her good friend, Ann. She is very good. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep - Gummer's mother - plays the current Lila. What is there to say about Meryl Streep apart from her always gives a discerning and rewarding performance. <br /> <br /> Director Lajos Koltai states in the extra DVDs that he tried Glenn Close to play the relatively small part of Lila's mother because he felt he was the only actress he could think of to play a scene from the movie. He was certainly right, and Close's performance in that scene affects his mind. All the other scenes in which Close is the very suitable mother of Lila, and you get another show to treasure. <br /> <br /> There are three other scenes in the film, combined with Close's described above, which make the film the whole movie worth watching. On Lila's wedding day, Ann enters her room and goes to bed with her friend to discuss Lila's defeats about her upcoming marriage to a man who clearly does not love. This scene is repeated fifty years later when Lila arrives and crawls into bed with her dying friend Ann to talk about the lives they have lived. In this last scene, Streep and Redgrave are compelling. <br /> <br /> The other memorable scene - at least for me - is when Buddy declares his love for Ann. Hugh Dancy as Buddy gives us a harrowing performance of a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings. His performance is superior. <br /> <br /> Chick flick? Yes. A very special film with an incredible acting, directing and set design? Definitely. I can't recommend the evening too much.
