This movie is hilarious! I watched it with my friend and we had to see it again. This film is not for you watching movies and watching only Academy Award nominated films (you know who you are.) I won't summarize it because you've seen it from all the other reviews. <br /> <br /> "Whipped" is a carefree comedy that made me laugh all the time. He doesn't take himself too seriously and should be watched with your friends, not your girlfriend. He will not win any prizes, but must be watched to be appreciated. True, some of the jokes are toilet humor, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone can use some of them sometimes. Some people need to clear themselves and see "fitted" for what it is, not for what is not. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 on *****.
