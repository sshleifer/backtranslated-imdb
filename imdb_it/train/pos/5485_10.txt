One of the most current and compelling documentaries you have ever seen. While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it provides an intimate look at the political dynamics that prevail throughout the Western hemisphere. While essentially another chapter in the history of the "United States supported, the Latin American coup", this film tells in real time, what can happen when the poorest are armed with unity, political knowledge and courage! <br /> <br /> The political insights offered by this film are priceless. Clear examples of private media are obtained, as a formidable force for deception and mass propaganda. We see the poor people of Caracas struggling with the brutal realities of "American politics". There is a clear sense of impending ruin, if people fail to confront the blatant tyranny, which has been abruptly and illegally pushed upon them by the conspirators. We also see the arrogance and fascism, the sustained CIA, the private media, the plutocrats and the generals, who have conspired to bring Venezuela back under Washington's rule. Although led by President Hugo Chavez, the people of Caracas are forced to act without him, after Chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals. Their answer is the highest point in the film. If you look for an excellent portrait of what the United States government, Hugo Chavez and the revolutionary Venezuela, are all around, this film is everything!
