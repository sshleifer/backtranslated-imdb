"Chinese Ghost Story" is one of the most spectacular Hong Kong movies I've ever seen. It's a brilliant mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror and martial arts. The film has wonderful images and amazing fights. I especially love the fight scene between Wu Ma and the language of the tree demons. An original and refreshing film and a good recommendation from an embalmer.
