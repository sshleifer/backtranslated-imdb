When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV, I must say that of all the shows I've seen, this is the culmination of it all. I had to see this show, and that's what I really did. When I had the first volume of this show, it was the best. I really liked the animation and all the fighting scenes were fantastic. I have to say that my favorite characters on the show were Saber, and Archer and of course I also like Illya. And of course, all the episodes of the volumes were interesting and very interesting. Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohie (famous for Transformers and others) who plays Berserker's voice. He has a nice character. And I even looked at the whole series again before looking at the final volume. So if you want to see something good, then you see this show, it's the best.
