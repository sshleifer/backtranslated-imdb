Sogo Ishii took the old myth of Musashibo Benkei and got it into his head to produce a dark, bloody, fascinating and terrifying-looking film. Those who are not familiar with the legend will not need to be; the story is well explained as it goes on. It is worth looking for even if there are no home video versions in English.
