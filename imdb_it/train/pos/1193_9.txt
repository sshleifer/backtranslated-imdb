The memory of "The Last Hunt" has remained with me since I saw it in 1956 when I was 13 years old. It is a film that was far ahead of the others at that time as it concerned the treatment of natives, the environment, and the ever-present contrast between the short and long term effects of greed. It is relevant today as in 1956, a cinemagraphic discussion of maximum depth and relevance. To complete the setting is beautiful and excellent cinematography. The memory of this film will be with me until the end of my days.
