Don't let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this Romy Schneider classic. This film was shot with a lower budget, probably against the will of Ernest Marishka, so he had to make it due. For example, England is portrayed as on the border with Germany. A wisp will Victoria and her mother are having a vacation in Germany by buggy ride alone. They arrived too fast. This probably could not be helped, but the castle they rented for the film was Austrian. When she is told that she is queen, she goes to the royal room where the court members bow to her, where are the British citizens outside the castle cheering for their new queen? Why doesn't the ISBN show up to the balcony to greet its subjects? Low budget! Where did the public then know about these imperfections? I wonder how the critics felt? During the inn scene he meets Prince Albert but the ISBN is not enthusiastic. During the meeting in the culinary part of the inn you hear the music of the famous old American Civil War songs like "My old Kentucky house" and "Old black Joe". What? civil war songs in the 1930s? Is Romy Schneider interpreted as Scarlet? Where is Mammina? Does Magna Shnieder play her role too? Adrian Hoven Rhett or Ashley? What was in Marishka's mind? Well, this adds to the field. It is the involuntary satire of the story of Queen Victoria. This is the only reason why you should pick it up or see it. 03 11 09 correction Germany and England are connected
