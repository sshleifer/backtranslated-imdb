A tragically wonderful film ... takes us to a Japan that no longer exists. Despite the technical experience of Hollywood, I still have to see a movie (hollywood) able to match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small city near the river near the sea ... Tom Cruise's last Samurai seemed the last episode of The Lord of The Rings in an attempt to capture the old rural Japan. <br /> <br /> If you like serene but intense stories, this is a film not to be missed. It will be a respite from empty and flashy films like the last 1000 blockbusters you've seen. I think this is one of Kurosawa's best stories. <br /> <br /> Even if it is a film about geishas and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life in such contexts, it has not turned into a leather film. The characters are full of depth and act with great intensity.
