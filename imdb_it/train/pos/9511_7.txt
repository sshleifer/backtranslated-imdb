A bloody gangster story that takes place in the years of the Great Depression. He tells us about another notorious hit man, Michael (Mike) Salliwan. Somehow, this time the story turns the other way: Mike fights to save his life and his only remaining son, because the rest of his family was killed because of his boss's dirty game. It happens in his revenge and assures his son an honorable future, but is eventually killed. These stories never had a happy ending. <br /> <br /> The role of Mike Salliwan senior was wonderfully played by Tom Hanks, and the role of Mr. Rooney (the mafia boss) was played by Paul Newman. The film has a great impression and we hear the famous phrase "we steal the banks". This film still deserves to be seen, although something bigger could have been expected from Sam Mendes after his American Beauty.
