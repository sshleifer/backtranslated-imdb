My favorite movie "Imperialism" is one of the best action and adventure films of all time. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks dominate the screen with bold and wise cracks to satisfy everyone except the "PC" of movie-goers. The memorable scenes abound - the 3 sergeants and their 20 sepoys fighting hundreds of Thugs; MacChesney & Cutter giving Bobby Coote the pin punch ("save some for the elephant"); Cutter to MacChesney - "I'm a expedition"; Cutter's double hit in prison, with a fork ("what do you think I'm trying to get out of? A bloody pudding?!) And the incredible temple scene with Cutter singing and then getting bored, bold as a brass -" Okay , you're all under arrest! "<br /> <br /> I could go on, but suffice it to say that I try to capture this movie whenever it's active. For adventurers and chair generals, it's hard to imagine a better 2 hours.
