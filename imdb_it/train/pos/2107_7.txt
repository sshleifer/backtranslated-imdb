I recently bought this movie with a lot of other eBay LaserDiscs. Usually, I deal with war and action films, but occasionally I like romantic comedies. <br /> <br /> If you're bored with special FX movies and high-gloss romantic comedies, check out Shop Around the Corner on a quiet evening. What I like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency. There is nothing fake or pretentious about them. Take Mr. Matuschek for example: when he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his employees, he tries to shoot himself. Not just because of humiliation, but because he was unfair to Stewart's character. (OK, weired example.) <br /> <br /> Yes, the film's attention is narrow and the plot is predictable. Still, I loved it. If you like Notting Hill, you'll like to go around the corner. in fact, Hugh Grant reminds me of Jimmy Stewart.
