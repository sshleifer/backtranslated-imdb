The flicker of butterfly wings in the Atlantic can trigger a hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (somehow related to the chaos theory, I'm not sure how), any action, no matter how small or insignificant, will start a chain reaction that can lead to major events. This little gem of a film shows us a series of seemingly unrelated characters, many of them in Paris, whose actions affect the lives of others. (The theory of six degrees of separation can also be applied.) Each story is an aspect of the jewel that is this film. The acting is finely tuned and nuanced (Audrey Tautou is bright), the stories are explained plausibly, humor is right, and the viewer leaves the theater nodding in agreement.
