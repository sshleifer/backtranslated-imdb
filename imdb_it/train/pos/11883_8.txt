I saw this movie about a week ago and I keep thinking about it. I was very moved by this movie. I found the characters very believable and nice almost to their fault. As in real life, even if sometimes people disappoint, as in the case of Leo, that even though I liked his character I could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex despite being fully aware of his HIV . I was also disappointed by Leo for refusing the medicine at his disposal and for the terrible way he treated Marcel when he decided to send him home on the train. I think this film showed very real reason why HIV numbers are present in young gays. This does not in any way mean loving gays (I am gay) and the film could have been done very well on a straight young man who makes bad choices and seems unaware of the consequences for himself and others. The only part of the film I could not understand was why the family (gay friendly) did not want to include Marcel in Leo's illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral. <br /> <br /> I think the most important message of this film is that you are gay or straight YOU HAVE NO SEX NOT PROTECTED!
