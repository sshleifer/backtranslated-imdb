LOL !!! delirious was so funny .. I was in tears. The impressions of Eddie Murphys are absolutely right. The best impression was of James Brown and Mr T> SO FUNNY !! It is strange how Eddie Murphy was then and how it is now DELIRIOSO is a must see but if you do not like vulgar language do not look BUT AMAZING AND SO FUNNY .. I saw him 6/7 times and still pisses me every time. This is Eddie Murphy at his peak and you can see where he got humor and movie ideas like the mad professor. He also makes impressions about his family, which is a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> if only you were there ...
