This is one of those films that is difficult to review without giving away the plot. Suffice it to say that there are strange things and unexpected twists going on, beyond the initial superficial plot of "Tom Cruise screwing with more women". <br /> <br /> The quality cast elevates this film above the norm and all the cast adapt well to their parts: Cruise is the irritated and pleased playboy who has it all - and then loses everything, Diaz as the attractive lover, slightly unbalanced, Cruz as the new exotic girl on the scene and Russell as the paternal psychologist. The story includes elements of romance, morality, murder-mystery, suspense and science fiction and is generally a fun journey. <br /> <br /> I would add that photography is also uniformly excellent and the inclusion of various visual metaphors is nice once you realize what is happening. <br /> <br /> If you like well acted movies with plot twists and suspense, and you're ready to accept a slightly fantastic Philip K Dick resolution, then it's a must see. <br /> <br /> 9/10
