On one level, this film can bring out the child in us who just wants to build sand castles and throw things in the air just for the sake of seeing it fall again. At a deeper level, however, he explores a deep desire to reconnect with the earth. I completely empathized with the artist when he said "when I'm not out here (alone) for a while, I feel rootless". <br /> <br /> I considered Andy Goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists. I know his works mainly through his coffee books and the installations of a couple of art galleries. But seeing his work in motion, captured perfectly through Riedelsheimer's lens, was a revelation. Unlocked over time, Goldsworthy's creations come to life, swirl, fly, dissolve, crumble, crash. And this is exactly what it deals with: time. The process of creation and destruction. Emergency and disappearing. To get out of the Void and become the Universe, and back again. There is a shamanic quality about him that borders on madness. You have the feeling, looking at it at work, that his art is a vital force for him, that if he did not, he would end up and perish. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for us, Goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the medium of photography. Otherwise, with the exception of some little men and walls, they would have existed only for one person.
