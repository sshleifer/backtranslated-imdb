Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy play in this "modern" musical that highlights MacDonald's comic abilities. The surreal musicals of the 40s seem to make fun of the fashions of the 40s even if they were in vogue. Extravagant costumes and set designs (yes in black and white) add to the surreal and dreamlike quality of the entire film. Several beautiful songs enliven the film, with the number "Twinkle in Your Eye" which is a highlight, including an amusing issue of jitterbug between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. In the cast of HUGE also Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys. In addition, they have been seen in Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafaela Ottiano, Odette Myrtile, Cecil Cunningham and many others. <br /> <br /> Great fun and nice to see the wonderful MacDonald in his jitterbug / vamp routine. You could do everything.
