In this film, you might think that this film is only for children. Well, it's mainly aimed at them, but it's also quite round with jokes aimed at adults too. This time, the Muppet band tries to enter Broadway, with the terrible difficulties that prevent them from producing them, leading them to split up. But Kermit will not stop, and his determination keeps things moving until, after getting the deal together, he is hit by a car and sent to amnesia! <br /> <br /> It is an overwhelming, in part, of those old vehicles protagonists of the '40s with musicals in reality as the subject of a musical, only here is the usual lot of crazy and moments wonderful thrown into a plate of hysterically amusing moments (Lou Zealand's boomerang fish, display of Gonzo's water prowess, whispers campaign, among many others), but also with a lot of heart. The writers of the Muppets do not let themselves be intimidated by conventions, on the contrary, they embrace them to the point where it is almost refreshing to see a story like "let's put on a show" where thick and think that the characters will meet their dream. <br /> <br /> Although not quite as original as the film Muppet, it has many catchy and memorable songs, excellent locations throughout Manhattan, and even some intonation of species (and marriage) encounters! The cameos include Liza Minneli ("a frog?"), Elliot Gould (like the policeman), Brooke Shields (proposed by a mouse), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So get ready to sing together, or just have a lot of great laughs and romantic moments (yes romantic) with one of the best Muppet movies.
