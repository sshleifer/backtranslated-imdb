This is a well written and well acted psychological drama. It's not really a horror movie, so those looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. What really surprised me about this film was the intelligence and delicate attention to detail in the plot and the effort made to be consistent internally. I also appreciated the absence of dr. Phil Psychobabble or New Age revisionism. Rather than advancing an agenda, the filmmakers have just told the story, told it well and let the viewer think about it. Scattered dreamlike landscapes recalled Wyeth's paintings and incredibly effective. <br /> <br /> A great example of how to make a good movie with a limited budget, without big studios, famous actors, famous directors (it was much better than many Hitchcock films), special effects or "" shots of smart scene ".
