this film is a moving and extraordinary work. I saw it at the theater when it came out, but I was only 13 years old and I didn't really "understand" ... I saw it again when I was 20 (obviously on video and now I own it) just wiped out. Steven Spielberg has created a wonderful film that keeps you glued from start to finish. I also read the book, but there is something about the film that really brings it to life. casting, acting, music, costumes, landscapes, everything is simply wonderful. laugh, cry, rejoice ... brings out every conceivable emotion. it is one of his best works and should not be lost!
