In 1994, I had a really long vacation around the 4th of July - something like 17 free days in a row what with two weeks of paid vacation, the weekends and the holidays themselves. I stayed in the city during that time, attending my parents' house a lot. <br /> <br /> I didn't have a TV in my apartment, so I was looking at my parents tube. I had just finished watching a segment of the X Files when a program called Personal FX arrived. I was hooked instantly. I had always been fascinated by the objects in our home that came from my parents' homes and from the inheritance of the property of relatives, and I often wondered about their history, value, etc. <br /> <br /> After my long vacation, I used to go to my parents' home for my lunch hours just to catch personal FX. <br /> <br /> I can recall an episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed has been renovated and, once the renovations have been completed , the Personl FX would be back on the air. <br /> <br /> It never happened! Personal FX was the first and best of the collectible shows. And it vanished from the air! Almost fifteen years later, I am still in pain. <br /> <br /> The way to go, FX.
