This comedy with a lot of pain and sadness in the background succeeds where most others fail. There have been many films of this genre with more notable actors trying to reach this elusive mix that has not come anywhere near the depth and skill of it. This is certainly due to the fact that the exceptional cast with the exceptional performances of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters quickly grips your interest and your emotions and holds them for the whole film. At the beginning, the action seems rather off-the-wall and harebrained, but one gradually learns that these two people, rather pathetic and damaged, try desperately and involuntarily to heal themselves, even if reluctantly, one with 'else. The harrowing facial expressions of Rogers' numb pain and Sheedy's raging explosions are so eloquent that they are perceived as being observed. You will worry about these two nice but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it is in doubt and everything hangs on a tenuous emotional thread. We hope the public can see more of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy as this film demonstrates their merit as highly experienced actors beyond doubt.
