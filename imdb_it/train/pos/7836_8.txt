Song 1: How Kriemhild wept over Siegfried and how King Attila blames her through his ambassador Rüdiger von Bechlarn: Kriemhild (Margarete Schön) insists on having the head of the murderer of her beloved husband, Hagen Tronje (Hans Adalbert Schlettow), but his brother, King Gunther (Theodor Loos), refuses his request. When King Attila of the Huns throws Kriemilde through his ambassador Rüdiger von Bechlar, he makes him promise by swearing in the name of his king that no one would ever offend her. Hagen Tronje hides the Nibelungs treasure at the bottom of a lake. <br /> <br /> Song 2: How Kriemhild moves away from his homeland and how it was received by King Attila: Kriemhild brings some land from where Siegfried died, and travels to the Huns court, where she is received by Attila himself, who also promises through the oath to defend it. <br /> <br /> Song 3: How King Attila besieged Rome and how Kriemhild summoned his brothers: When Kriemhild delivers a child, Attila returns to his kingdom and asks Kriemhild what she would like most to please her. She asks him to invite his brothers to come to his kingdom. <br /> <br /> Song 4: How Kriemhild receives his brothers: Kriemhild insists on having the head of Hagen Tronje, but his brothers maintain loyalty to their friend and again do not accept his request. <br /> <br /> Canto 5: How the Huns celebrated the summer solstice With the Nibelungs: Kriemhild asks Attila to kill Hagen Tronje, but refuses because in accordance with the laws of the desert, the host is considered sacred . Kriemhild offers gold to the Hums for the head of Hagen Tronje. There is a struggle, and Hagen Tronje kills Attila's son. <br /> <br /> Canto 6: The anguish of the Nibelungs: The Huns lose the battle against the Nibelungs, but keep them under siege in the castle of Attila. Kriemhild promises to save his life provided he delivers Hagen Tronje, but his brother Gunther says that the Germans are loyal to their friends. <br /> <br /> Canto 7: The Nibelungen's End: After the deaths of Rüdiger von Bechlarn, Giselher and Gernot, Hagen Tronje and Guhther are finally captured. Kriemhild kills Hagen Tronje, ending his revenge with the destruction of the Nibelungs. <br /> <br /> The conclusion of Siegfried's poetic saga through "Kriemhild's Revenge" is also told through seven dramatic cantos. The nature of the first part is a magnificent tale of fantasy, adventure, romance and betrayal; the second part is a dramatic story of hatred, revenge and loyalty. The solid script with a perfect development of the characters, the excellent cast performances and the fantastic direction of Fritz Lang have produced another epic in advance. Margarete Schön is impressive with a totally different woman, obsessed and inflexible in her desire for revenge. Even the costumes Kriemhild wears are very impressive and her acting is based on her face and appearance. I was a little disappointed with Attila's reaction after the death of his only son, as I found him too passive. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Nibelungos ?? Part II: A Vingança de Kriemshild" ("The Nibelungen Part II: Kriemhild's Revenge")
