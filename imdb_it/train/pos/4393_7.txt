Ang Lee clearly likes to adapt to a movie, capture the action, the characters and the setting on the hoof when they emerge. Covering the casual end of the American civil war through random actions by a young militia, without mental form or virility, this is an ideal approach. The film is based on the formation of personality, adulthood and relationships. Lee also shows the beautiful landscapes of the central south as a silent character, enduring the struggle as a robust parent. <br /> <br /> The script by James Schamus is probably the standard bearer of this film; behind it there are a series of well-kept shows that take him admirably. Only the name of Jeffrey Wright could bring this film to me. He is brilliant here, but in a role that burns slowly: instead we are treated with very good (if not revealing) performances by a large, often recognizable ensemble. <br /> <br /> A noble and optimistic film. One to watch if you don't like Cold Mountain or The Claim more difficult, sweeter, for example. 7/10
