I thought this film was much better than most movie critics are giving credit. Even if it has its confusing parts of the plot, it doesn't interfere much with your understanding of the film. That being said, if you are not open to more liberal political ideas, then this is probably not the movie for you. I thought all the actors in the film were exceptional. Each character has his own funny moments and the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival laughed for the duration of the film. I thought satire was a bit exaggerated in a particular area, but it is intentionally done. John Cusack is right, even if it is set in the future, it really makes you see the present.
