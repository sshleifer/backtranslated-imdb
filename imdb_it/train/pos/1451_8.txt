I've seen this movie about 6 times now. And every time I look at it, I'm more impressed by the story and the acting. It's like watching a wreck set in motion. He is subtle in his approach, but very effective in achieving his goal. <br /> <br /> Spoiler-> At the center of the story is a very beautiful dichotomy. On the one hand we have the deputy major, Eddy Calhoun (Cusack) who unknowingly rips off the network of old boys that forms the heart of the major in the New York administration and on the other hand we have the mafia boss Zappati who is deliberately trying to keep the status quo through all the necessary means. This situation culminates positively at the end when Zappati orders Alselmo to make it easy by killing himself and Calhoun by ordering Pappas to do the same, politically speaking. <br /> <br /> The film also contains some excellent one-liners such as (my personal weakness): - Do not summarize the life of a man in a moment - The only new thing in this world is the story that does not do you know <br /> <br /> All in all, a great film that deserves a much higher rating.
