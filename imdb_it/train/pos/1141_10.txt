Anyone who hasn't laughed about this movie has been embalmed. I've seen it at least twenty times and I still have tears in my eyes in many scenes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert, a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in the hope that their star will rise. Fields, at 45, still has that wonderful and beautiful quality of pixie and a perfect figure that prevents her from having three children. I'm biased, I'm in love with her. <br /> <br /> The cast of "Soapdish" is full of stars that play their roles to perfection. Kevin Kline is impeccable, as are Robert Downey Jr., an innate Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in one of his first roles, Carrie Fisher in the role of excessive casting director who audits an actor for a small part like shirtless waiter over. Kathy Najimy is as wonderful as the costume designer and, above all, Cathy Moriarty as Nurse Nan who leads the plot to make Fields' character removed from the show hilarious. <br /> <br /> This film was supposed to win Oscars for Best Comedy, Best Actor in a Comedy, Best Actor in a Comedy and a host of other top stars, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actresses. Take the DVD so you can watch it over and over again for the next twenty-five years. I laugh again when the disc wears out.
