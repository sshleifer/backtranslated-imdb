10 out of 10, this brilliant and super documentary is a must see, with the footage of the war that people had not seen for years, until it was shown in 1974. The footage of this war documentary does not lack anything, some some clips have left me amazed. The entire series lasts over 20 episodes and Sir Lawrence Olivier is the narrator and tells a fabulous war story. Simply this is still probably the best war documentary yet, and now over 25 years is still able to put together a tremendous punch. You have to watch it for some time, even if it is a few episodes, even if you will still be shocked by the impact that this documentary means for those who have suffered and died there in the name of WAR, in a WORLD IN WAR ..
