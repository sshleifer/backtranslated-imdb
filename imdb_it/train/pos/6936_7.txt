Winchester 73 gets credit from many critics for reporting the western after the Second World War. Director Anthony Mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent direction. Jimmy Stewart does an excellent job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the film with their portrait of two villains involved in a high stakes poker game with the precious Winchester 73 going to the winner. This is a good script with several stories going on at the same time. Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Young Bull. Thank God, in a few years we would start to play Indians in western movies. The film is in black and white and was shot in Tucson, Arizona. I wouldn't put Winchester 73 in the Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane category, but I receive an above-average recommendation from me. <br /> <br />.
