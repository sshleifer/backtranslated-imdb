Well, let me say something about these actors, they were really a good decision and, from experience, having actors really brought dialogue to life. If you enter the scene with a delay of at least fifteen minutes, you will be traumatized, the film will have already begun. You don't want to miss the first few bars, assuming you've come to not miss a beat. <br /> <br /> Wow! I've never seen a film that ended with such a strong ending. Not to be hard, I mean, I loved it, but it surprised me that it really continued until it stopped! But I'm overcoming myself, let's start from the beginning, when it started. The plot of the plot goes like this, there's this man, and don't give away any spoilers, (* Spoiler Alert !! *) (he never had any sex (!) They use this device to plot the plot in motion, and there are (intentionally or not, it could go either way) some funny situations had by the main characters, some containing irony, and jokes, and embarrassing situations, you know. <br /> <br /> The director uses progress in technology combining the film shot on the set and the programmed dialogue, a bit of music and jokes to make a funny film, conceived as a comedy, where it takes us on a journey from the opening credits to the end with a film entirely shot In the meantime I went to this movie waiting to see a funny comedy because of what I already knew, and I had the feeling that I had just left a theater that played in a funny comedy.
