De Palma's technique had reached its great maturity at the time of this film, which is a wonderful demonstration of his classic techniques, although unfortunately, as with many of the films written by De Palma himself, the story serves the goal more than interests by putting forward an exciting story. <br /> <br /> The story opens with a CRAZY scene where Angie Dickinson masturbates under a shower while watching her husband. She is then grabbed and raped while her husband is unaware near - and the whole thing turns out to be Angie's fantasy while her husband is pumping her in bed. He has a short scene with his son, a dead bell for Harry Potter, which concludes with a joke that "she will tell her grandmother she is playing with her peter". Then he goes to his therapy session, where he complains about his dead marriage, before trying to seduce his therapist, Michael Caine. He refuses, and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> Then begin a nearly wordless 22-minute sequence which is perhaps the highlight of the film. Among the many things that De Palma has taken from Hitchcock is the understanding of the film as a purely visual means of telling stories ?? and in the typical De Palma style, he transforms it into a way to show off his formidable ability. The problem, for me, is that in this case we start to feel that the scenes are unnecessarily protracted simply to further show the director's abilities. <br /> <br /> The sequence begins with Angie in an art museum. Watch strangers, all involved in sexual or family activities, then begin to turn to a man sitting next to her. De Palma deftly recounts an extremely complicated narrative without a single word about attraction, embarrassment, withdrawal and finally the discovery and submission of Angie to the stranger on the back of a taxi, all set on a wonderfully lush soundtrack by Pino Donaggio, who he also scored Carrie. <br /> <br /> In the second part of the sequence Angie slept with the boy, and gets up to go back to her husband. Again De Palma draws up a ton of fiction without uttering a word of dialogue, as Angie realizes she doesn't have her panties, that her husband is already at home and no doubt wonders where he is, who has probably contracted a venereal disease and that he lost his engagement ring somewhere in the fray. It's all very admirable, but one begins to feel a little nervous while we are forced to do things like taking a long ride in the elevator from the seventh floor, then back up, almost in real time. <br /> <br /> ... Spoilers from here on out! When Angie reaches the seventh floor again, she is killed by a large woman with blonde hair. The woman pulls her away until she reaches the ground floor, when the door opens and Nancy Allen sees her there. There is a slow motion sequence when Nancy reaches the elevator, Angie joins her and the murderer's blade is ready to cut Nancy's hands. Then follow some electrifying strokes as Nancy looks up and sees the killer in the convex mirror of the elevators. It's all right, and when we have dialogues again, you think; "Woah, it was only 22 minutes of pure visual storytelling!" Or maybe you don't, but I do it. <br /> <br /> A young Dennis Franz has a big part as a New York detective, dreary and hard, who would prefer everyone else to do his job for him. Interview with Michael Caine, outrageously interpreting (albeit as a commonplace) that Angie WANTED was killed. Angie's son is also there, and he connects with Nancy, and they decided to spy on Caine's therapist and find out who the murderer is. <br /> <br /> Once again there is a strong connection with a Hitchcock film, in this case Psycho (just like Obsession is a reworking of Vertigo). You have a woman we should understand is secretly a whore, who is killed in the first 30 minutes in an enclosed space, in this case an elevator rather than a shower. Then the relatives of the deceased conduct an investigation, which reveals that the murderer is a man who dresses as a woman to kill. In the end, De Palma even launches a doctor who explains the psychology of the whole affair. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting, but at the same time a spectator can start to feel a little startled, and this is my main reservation about this film. The vision is absolutely essential and shows some of De Palma's greatest pieces, but the feeling that history is handling a third part behind De Palma's need to show off and his somewhat improper sexual fantasies make it difficult to look back to this with sincere affection. <br /> <br /> --- See other reviews on my website about bad and bad movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
