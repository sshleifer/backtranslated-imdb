The Running Man is one of those films that, if overfished, would become boring and depressing. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch it maybe once or twice a year with a couple of friends and a few drinks. <br /> <br /> In today's climate of television media domination and the capitalist mode in society it really works as a revisionist social commentary after the boom of the 1980s. Forget that though! There are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger is in top form as Richard Ben's "The Butcher of Bakersfield", and the inclusion of Bond-belting one liners has been completely inspired by truly leg-end-dary (with his outburst to Killian on a camera the main highlight). <br /> <br /> The design of the stalkers is authentically American, and reflects the features seen in the TV program of PC Gladiators and also the WWE. The horrible end of Buzz-saw will make any spectator freeze to the core (like a foot note, why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is apparently an optimistic actor with a keen sense of humor?) /> <br /> Jesse Venturer and Sven Ole Thorssen are great as muscle reinforcements (and are Arnies buds in real life), and even Mick Fleetwood put us in! What more could you ask for? <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the man who runs, if you're looking for a great piece of fun action, with a glossy finish and some great characters. Just don't expect an education (at least on the surface value). <br /> <br /> Quality, I really like it. You will do it even unless you are a thesp. 7/10
