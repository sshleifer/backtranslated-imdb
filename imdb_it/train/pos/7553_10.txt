When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed to the screen. His greatness has caught my attention so much that I have focused all my attention on it for its entire duration. I would recommend seeing it not only to anime fans, but to anyone who loves the period of great movies (or who really like strange things). The style of art is beautiful, the sound is perfect and the symbolism in it is breathtaking. I have heard complaints about the strange inclusion of the English text in the film, but I think the way it is done complements the strange style of the film. The self-attributed description of "Hello Kitty on acid" does not do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportions. I would like to find more works of those who did this and see them.
