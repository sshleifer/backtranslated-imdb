This show started with great episodes of mystery. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. Subsequently, the show began playing short episodes with Shaggy, Scooby doo and Scrappy doo. <br /> <br /> I think Hanna Barbera Productions had to change 20-minute episodes in short episodes. Some of the voice actors were not available. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) is no longer available. I think Velma's voice changes after the first 12 episodes, because the first vocal actress who played Velma was not available. <br /> <br /> And the network ordered Hanna Barbera's studio to make shorter films with Shaggy, Scooby doo and Scrappy doo, because the ratings were high. So they had to make shorter ones. I wish they were mysteries like 15 episodes. However it is a good show.
