This film was released last week and although at that time of the day (around 6:00 pm) the quality of the films is almost never good (at least here on Mexican TV), I couldn't turn off the TV. The story of Madelene Moore really touches you. At first he doesn't look like a very sympathetic character, but seeing the whole movie, you only want so much success. This movie really lets you think. And I think basically because of the great acting of Brooke Johnson. I had never heard of her before or consciously seen her in another film, but this was a great big acting. Congratulations to Brooke. I hope to see you soon in another movie.
