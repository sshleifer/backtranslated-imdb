As one of the previous commentators said, this had the basis of a great film, but something happened on the road to delivery. Such a waste because Collette's performance was disturbing and Williams was credible. I just kept waiting for it to improve. I don't think it was bad editing or needed another director, it may have been just the movie. It appeared as a Canadian film, something like the first seasons of the X-Files. It's not cheap, just hokey. Besides, he needed a little more suspense. Something that makes you jump out of your seat. The film has reached that moment and then vanishes; a bit like a false climax. I see that being too suspicious would take away the "reality" of the story, but I thought that part was achieved when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy. This film must have a directorial style that tries to solve these problems.
