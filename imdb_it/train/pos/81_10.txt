I saw the McCoys meeting and was happy to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez !!! To see them now it was wonderful, because I always saw the show grow so when the TV said there would be a meeting it was so excited !!!! The only thing I couldn't understand was why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke) weren't there. I know that Walter Brennan was dead. So I took my computer and tried to find out and found this site, so if anyone out there can tell me what happened to Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke, I'd be grateful !!!) I searched every thing and no luck. The only thing I could find out about Michael Winkelman is that it was supposed to be born in 1946. This show was valuable and moral every show gave a lesson to learn.The shows don't have it today. 'the whole cast was incredibly the only thing better to find out about them would be to meet them So since it's impossible if there is someone who can help please !!! Thanks Glenda
