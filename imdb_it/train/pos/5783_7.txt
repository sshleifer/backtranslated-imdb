I read Kerching reviews on IMDb, and frankly, I haven't seen a positive review so far. I actually like Kerching. Kerching talks about a teenager named Taj Lewis, to make 1,000,000 pounds for his mother, he created a website called rudeboy. The site offers many interesting things, if only Taj and his 2 friends: Danny and Seymour can prevent Taj from being discovered. I find this show quite amusing and I enjoy watching it. The acting is O.K., but it can certainly be better, the characters are fun, especially Danny Spooner, Taj's friend, his stupidity is what makes it fun. and the other friend of Taj, Seymour. Carlton, the owner of the caf√©, also called "The Chill". We never see it, we feel it alone. Taj's younger brother, Omar, and his older sister, Missy, are also funny. And Missy's best friend, Kareesha. So many times Taj's has almost been exposed, almost. In addition to comedy, Kerching's drama, like love life and the loss of loved ones, makes this program fantastic.
