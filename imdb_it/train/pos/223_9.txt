in one of Neil Simon's best shows. Vaudeville's crackling and eccentric stars starring Walter Matthau and George Burns are collaborating on a special television comedy. The problem is that they haven't even looked at each other for over a decade. Filled with zippy one-liner and showbiz jokes, this story flies along with a constant stream of humor. Great work also by Richard Benjamin as his nephew, Rosetta LeNoire as a nurse, and Howard Hesseman as TV commercial director. Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller look like themselves. Note: the opening montage contains footage of 1929 Hollywood Revue and shows Marie Dressler, Bessie Love, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Charles King, Gus Edwards and the Brox sisters who sing.
