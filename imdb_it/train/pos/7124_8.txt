A beautiful moving film and not just for children. John Thaw is as brilliant as ever (with no reference to Inspector Morse about him). The guy who plays William did a good job even though I didn't find it convincing in every scene. I loved the whole atmosphere of the small village and the slower pace of life in those times. I also heard the scenes in London where historically accurate, as far as I could tell. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of a Scandinavian film I saw a couple of years ago called Mother of Mine. That film contained a boy evacuated from Finland to Sweden during World War II. The wife of the host family asked for a girl because (apparently) she lost her daughter. By getting a boyfriend instead she completely ignores him. The fact that the boy speaks Finnish complicates things further. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has enjoyed Goodnight Mr. Tom, he has the same feeling.
