Ever wanted to know how much Hollywood managed to get away with before the Hayes Code was officially implemented? Well, unfortunately "Convention City" is lost, so just look at "Tarzan and his companion" to find out. By 1934, there is a considerable amount of sexual allusions and even exposed flesh. Look at Jane's naked swim. While Tarzan is often thought of as a b-adventure movie made for kids and no one else, this picture shows that the series was originally very adult. Over seventy years later, it's still as sexy as it was when it came out. <br /> <br /> In addition to the envelope that drives the taboo nature, it is a superb and exciting adventure story. I have always enjoyed the jungle films that Hollywood produced in the 1930s and 1940s, but there are few of the genre that I would call great films. "Tarzan and His Mate" is by far the best film of this subgenre now far away. Sequences of safari attacks by monkeys or natives continue to create tensions today. Furthermore, the animals are all too cold (especially the monkeys that throw boulders). The acting will not soon win big prizes, but it is certainly more than adequate for this type of photo. The film was again stolen by Cheetah, the most intelligent monkey in the jungle. One of the most enjoyable examples of Hollywood pre-code out there.
