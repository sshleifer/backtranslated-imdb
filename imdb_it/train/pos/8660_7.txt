This is a racist film, but worthy of study and fun. The first time through it the natural inclination is to focus on Herbs and Dads. They have a relaxed, peaceful thing, with her still at home about to graduate, and he has retired and retired waiting for inspiration to do something. The second time through you you realize how horrible the fact that her sister's husband is fooled by her friends in the backwoods blues bar. He takes it, it's the thing to do these days, and the critical moment passes as if they were talking about the weather. In that same scene the blues song of the sister is a real tear-jerk if you are the least sensitive and like that kind of music. His performance seems to be the culminating point of the story; a story of blues with good guys who are "people of color" in their element of backwoods, SC. Meanwhile, all the whites in the film lead what seem superficial and meaningless lives, suitable only for children. It's beautiful, as long as you recognize it as fiction.
