As with a group of kids at school, we have to give a thumbs up. Even the Grim Ripper made us smile. Those two alien things made me laugh, Bill and Ted were the most stupid and funniest in the whole movie. This is much better than the first. And yet, for some reason, I feel that something is missing. Something big Something important. Create a home and the best girlfriends. No, I would say better bad guys. Use clones instead of robots. I gave a 7 out of 10 because of those two robotic troublemakers. <br /> <br /> The Grim Ripper, not being afraid of being not the mortal type, is fun. When it fell from the sky, I divided a gut. Splat, I'm not sure about those aliens. What where? Scientists? There's no way.
