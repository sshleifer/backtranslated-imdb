One of the best movies I've ever seen was an Irish film called Philadelphia, Here I Come. I read the script before seeing the movie and loved them both. It is the story of a young man who is preparing to leave Ireland to go to America because he cannot earn a living in Ireland. It is said both from the point of view of the young (which the other characters in the film can see) and from another young man who represents his uncensored thoughts and feelings, but who cannot be seen by the other characters in the film. It is a very sad but deeply moving film, and I would recommend this film to anyone who wants something to think about. I love every Irish film, or almost any film about Ireland, and any film that has the late Irish actor Donal McCann in my vote. I would have seen that man chewing gum for 2 hours on the screen and, unfortunately, I have. A terrible pity to have lost him so young.
