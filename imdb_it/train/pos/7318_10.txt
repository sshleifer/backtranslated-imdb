Halloween by John Carpenter <br /> <br /> Is it the greatest horror film of all time? no .. maybe not at all, but for me it is and always will be. The film is a pure genius and will always have a very special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that he did not see this film until twenty years after its release, but even twenty years later, after so many little cats arrived and left, the film had the same impact must have done then. My father suggested before going to see Halloween H20 that I pull out and entrust Halloween 1 and 2 to get the full story, and after seeing Halloween it was pretty clear that he defined and set up the Slasher genre. <br /> <br /> The film's plot is simple, in 1963 Michael Audrey Myers killed her sister Judith in cold blood with a large butcher knife. Imprisoned for fifteen years where he was treated by dr. Sam Loomis escapes and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield where he begins to persecute three young girls: Laurie Strode, an innocent bookworm, Annie Brackett, a tough sarcastic talking and Lynda Van Der Klok, a beautiful and sexually vigorous girl. Dr. Loomis keeps track of Michael here, where he enlisted the help of Sheriff Leigh Brackett, who remains skeptical of his story about the psychotic killer. Michael watches the girls mercilessly and starts killing them one by one, until only the sweet innocent Laurie is left, which is the main focus of Michael's list. <br /> <br /> The casting of this film was brilliant and all the actors and actresses gave top notch performances, Jamie Lee Curtis was extraordinary in her first film role as Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance he gave an electrifying performance with his small role as Loomis. Nick Castle, who plays Michael, did an exceptional job as the soulless and bad killer, and his walking and body movements were perfect. <br /> <br /> One of the great highlights of this film is the chilling score made by John Carpenter himself who created one of the most recognizable horror themes known today. Blue Lighting was disturbing and effective and one of the great moments of this film is when young Laurie is curled up against a wall after seeing her dead friends, and in the shadow behind her materializes Michael's face before it hits. Michael's mask was one of the things that gave me the chills longer, the face without white emotions worked perfectly. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so exceptional is that it is not a bloody movie unlike the 13 film cheese, in fact there is little blood in this film and instead works on suspense and tension. <br /> <br /> It became so clear that Halloween generated movies like Friday The 13th and characters like Jason Voorhees, which is a simple rip-off of Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I suggest you see this movie at least once in your life as it is a landmark in creating movies and is without doubt, if not the greatest of one of the greatest films horror of all time.
