This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. It's terrible. But it's so beautiful! It's probably better if you don't watch it expect a compelling storyline and something incredibly smart and fun, because you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million jars and the fantastic Goro hair / bad English, you are ready for a real party. The more you think about the movie, the worse it gets, unless you have a competition to find the greatest number of holes / failures in the plot, in which case you'll have hours of fun in advance. I really recommend this movie for Smap fans bored or die-hard. And even then, the latter should be a little cautious, because Goro's Japanese fans were a little upset, they thought they were selling. (It really wasn't, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do it for him).
