I love buying those bad and bad DVDs from Alpha Video. One day, I happened to buy this. It's the perfect science fiction movie of the 50s, all staged. To reappear with all that is not scientific, poorly dressed girls and a lot of melodrama, is a funny film, for those who appreciate this kind of thing. And if you can "suspend disbelief" enough, you can really come out of your mind - not just from the psychotic head or the beating of the thing in the closet, but towards the end, with the character of "the perfect body". It is so. . . . what is another word for mindf *** ing?
