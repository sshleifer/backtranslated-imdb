I didn't expect much from this movie, but it wasn't bad; actually it was pretty good. This film contained a couple of the funniest writing pieces I've ever seen in a movie. Now I'm not saying that this is one of the funniest movies of all time, but I laughed pretty hard in some parts. "The police decreed a suicide due to the death of my father, they said he fell into an elevator shaft, on some bullets." Now this film is not for everyone, its mostly stupid humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball; so if you hated these films, I would probably advise you to be careful. Overall it was a funny film about a group of aspiring superheroes, who eventually become true heroes. It's a much overrated comedy that many people probably haven't seen yet, because like me, before seeing it, he expected it to be a real garbage. After watching this movie, I finally understood why this film was able to assemble such a superstar cast that includes Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria and even that guy from Good Burger. It's because Mystery Man is full of excellent comic scripts 7 times out of 10. A very big surprise.
