While watching this movie I was frustrated and distracted and in the end, I wanted to give the film a solid 4 or 5. I thought the animation was random and everywhere and there was too much to do. Even my A.D.D could not keep up. It looked like a slight acid trip. Everything seemed flat, there was no size for anything. There were so many shapes, lines and patterns. I really wanted to stop the film halfway and destroy my burnt copy of this movie. But after I finished watching it, I went online to read the movie and I had to do a little research on this film before watching. <br /> <br /> The Secret of Kells is freely inspired by the true story of Kells' original book. A small child, Brendan, has the task of writing new pages in what will be the greatest book ever written. This book will contain information that will help "turn darkness into light". Brendan lives in the village of Kells behind huge stone walls. In the eighth century, Brendan's uncle, the abbot of Kells, is trying to build the wall to keep the Vikings out. Brendan's uncle insists that he help complete the wall, but a traveler and custodian of the "book" secretly instructs Brendan to perfect his illustrative skills, and convinces him to complete "the book" and execute his word. <br /> <br /> For as long as I watched the movie I thought I was missing something because I didn't really understand what was happening. I thought I was missing a piece of Irish history. A simple Google search taught me everything I needed to know about the original Book of Kells. After reading many articles, my opinion on the film has changed a lot. <br /> <br /> The Book of Kells is a copied version of the first books of the New Testament transcribed into Latin by Gaelic monks in Ireland in the 8th century. Along with its palaeographic and insular writing, the book is also beautifully illustrated in insular art, a type of first art form known for its complexity, complexity and miniature illustrations. Much of the art in the Book of Kells is depicted as a lot of art at the time, flat and challenged dimensionality without perspective. But what distinguishes the Book of Kells from other ancient works of art is the use of many colors. <br /> <br /> The secret of Kells is very colorful. Initially I thought the animation was flat and boring. It reminded me a lot of the Samurai Jack comic that also had a flat and "amine" look. Once they become aware of the artistic styles of the Book of Kells, it is obvious that many of the book's styles are imitated in the film. There are lines and swirls and various shapes that inhabit Brendan's mind. Every time he enters his imagination, circular shapes reminiscent of the sun, gears, clocks and wheels begin to fill the screen. The edges of the screen become framed in triangles or decorated moving circles. The transitions are full of colors and Celtic knots. From trees to floors, many things in this world are covered with shapes or patterns. <br /> <br /> Clocking in 70 minutes less credits, The Secret of Kells is a fun history lesson with a little adventure and stupidity thrown in to keep people (maybe just children) interested. I think we should generally be open to The Secret of Kells as a half piece of art, half a film about history. Although it seems to have been animated with Adobe Illustrator, it is a very beautiful film. But based on the 20 films presented for the Oscar, I don't think it's worth being nominated to Mary and Max. <br /> <br /> ThatWasJunk.Blogspot.com
