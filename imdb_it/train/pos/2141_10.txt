Masayuki Suo, who directed this beautiful film, has a role. After the discreet "Fancy Dance" and the classic (in Japan, anyway) college-sumo comedy "Shiko Funjatta", Suo has followed his enormous footsteps with a resounding success. <br /> <br /> The story is compelling. We both laugh often (Naoto Takenaka is hilarious, as in his two previous films) and is actually the root of the characters. But for me the big advantage is the look that this film gives the viewer in Japanese society - real life in Japan. His has a talent for showing real-life activities with a fun touch. The result is a film that will involve you, make you laugh, make you think, and both will entertain you and make you discover today's Japan. <br /> <br /> Search also for the main actors of Shiko Funjatta, as they all appear again in various roles, from supporting characters (Takenaka) to short cameos (many).
