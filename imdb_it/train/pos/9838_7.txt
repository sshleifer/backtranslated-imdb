Born Again is an okay episode of season 1. The bit of reincarnation, in my opinion, is cool. The more I look at it, the more I like it, yet it will never rise above "Very good" for me. Although it is not very memorable, I will always remember it as the episode of reincarnation. Anyway, now I'll say what's good in this episode, <br /> <br /> The Good: Oragami. Oh yes! <br /> <br /> That fish tank was beautiful. =] <br /> <br /> Get out of a window. Very classy. x] <br /> <br /> The Bad: marries your best friend's wife! O_O <br /> <br /> What a random choice to reincarnate. <br /> <br /> Why didn't the guy who died with his tangled scarf try to take off his scarf? <Br /> <br /> Conclusion: Okay episode, not very memorable. 7/10
