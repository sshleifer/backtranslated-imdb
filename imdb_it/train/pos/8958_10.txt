After seeing Vertigo, look at Bell, Book and Candle, made a few months apart. <br /> <br /> My second favorite film by Kim Novak, with Picnic, comes in third. <br /> <br /> All three performances are great, Vertigo, being the best of all. <br /> <br /> They came to my town of Kansas Prairie, nearby, in Salina, Kansas in the 1950s, to film, Picnic. <br /> <br /> The musical score of Bell, Book and Candle, I believe is one of Alex North. Perfect for this bit of comedy. <br /> <br /> After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak, he made this comedy, how much fun it is to notice the dramatic contrast. <br /> <br /> It's worth your time, if you like Kim Novak. The Greta Garbo of my youth.
