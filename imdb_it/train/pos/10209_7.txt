"Happenstance" is the most New Yorker Parisian film I saw from "When the Cat's Away (Chacun cherche son chat)." <br /> <br /> A film from last year published to capitalize on the attention Audrey Tatou is getting "Amelie", her French title is more suitable: "Papillon's words of love" as summarizing the chaos theory as an element of control in our lives. <br /> <br /> The game of Tatou is less annoying here because it only occasionally shows that dazzling smile in the midst of his unfortunate adventures, and because it is part of a large multi-ethnic group, so big that it took me a long time to adjusting the characters, especially since some of the cute kids and older women seemed similar to me, and some characters fantasize about what they should do in a way that is not sure if they were doing it or not. <br /> <br /> But I loved how urban the coincidences were, from immigrants to love nests to crowded subway cars to cafes. <br /> <br /> The subtitles were bothersome to both sides of a dialogue once. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 12/8/2001)
