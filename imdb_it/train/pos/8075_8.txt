I decided not to believe what the famous film critics say. Even though this film didn't get the best comments, this film made my day. It made me think. What a false world this is. <br /> <br /> What do you do when your loved ones deceive you. It is said that no matter how often milk is fed with a snake, it can never be fair and bites when given a chance. Similarly, some people are never grateful. This film is about how selfish people can be and how ultimately everyone is just thinking about themselves and working for themselves. <br /> <br /> A brother inadvertently dies at the hands of a gangster. The surviving brother decides to take revenge. Through this process, we learn the futility of this world. Nothing is real and nobody is loyal to anyone. <br /> <br /> Amitabh gave the performance of his life. The new actor Aryan gave a good performance. The actress who played Amitabh's wife stole the show. His role was small, but he played his role so diligently that one is touched by his performance. Chawla had very beautiful expressions, but her role was very limited and she had not been given the opportunity to express herself fully. <br /> <br /> A great film by Raj Kumar Santoshi. His films always give a message to the public. His films are like novels by Nanak Singh (a Punjabi novelist who has always had a purpose and has targeted a social evil) because they have a real message for the public. They are entertaining and giving lessons.
