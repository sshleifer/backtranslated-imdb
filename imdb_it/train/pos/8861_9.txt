Andy says, "Nobody gets hurt, everyone wins." Before I say it, we know the opposite is true: everyone gets hurt, nobody wins. This is a new trend in American films, or perhaps an old vein reported at the end. Think of "Oriental Promises", "There will be blood", "No country for old people". These films are obscure, serious, extremely well made and don't care about the happy endings. I love them. "Before the devil knows you are dead" fits the general description, but creates an atmosphere of his own. Kelly Masterson's debut screenplay is so close as a Hollywood movie will ever come to a Greek tragedy. Paying homage to fellow veteran Stanley Donen, Sidney Lumet skillfully and soberly transforms the sad story into an exceptional old-school character drama. The opening strokes, even of an obese doggy-styling style accountant of his trophy wife, have the look and feel of a Dutch master's painting. On the contrary, the pharmacist's apartment looks more like a Mondrian chain. Great shows all around. Only the character of Albert Finney, Charles, feels a bit exaggerated, his eyes wide open and his mouth open almost all the time. But then he is in deep trouble, deeper than all the problems that most of us will know. In return, Marisa Tomei is super sexy. But obviously you don't need me to tell you. Because his character Gina would like to be with a guy like Andy, we're never told, but that's okay. Action is character, after all. The unique and magical touch of Carter Burwell's music makes this beautiful film a masterpiece. Not to be missed.
