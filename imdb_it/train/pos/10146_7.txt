As we all know, a romantic comedy is the genre with the already known ending. The two protagonists must always come together. Towards the end of the third act I was trying to understand how this will end and how they will end up together. A clue was given from the beginning, but you will never notice until the end. It's a simple hook, but it works. It had to be cover much of the usual ground, but it makes a cool ride when ever possible. I liked all the characters in New York and loved the locations. It's a NY postcard. Also it was nice to watch a movie and not find anything offensive in it. So if you like a good old fashioned romantic movie ... then this is for you.
