For me, the final scene, in which Harris responds to the press, is worthy of seeing this smart and timeless slice of politics (especially the campaign phase). If only the "real life" pols responded as cleverly and articulated as Mr. Harris did, then the arrogant, self-serving members of the press might have thought twice about emitting irrelevant and conflicting "garbage" that has absolutely nothing to do with the candidates' abilities to effectively manage the challenges of the office for which they are pursuing.
