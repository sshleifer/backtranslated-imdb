I have watched this show since I was 14 and have always loved it since. I love this show because it's just fun! You'll love this show because it shows something new and more fun every day and my favorite part is when Benny always has his last comments about George after every joke about his big giant head. * Laughs * I would laugh and watch it with my friends at home it would be like we were watching a funny but short movie. Love George Lopez. Fun, talented, fun, spectacular. This series of fun family comedies is enjoyable for everyone and you will surely enjoy it! And if you haven't looked at it yet I suggest you start looking because you wouldn't want to stop watching it. Although there are no more new episodes, I still like the repetitions. Still fun It never runs out. <br /> <br /> 9/10
