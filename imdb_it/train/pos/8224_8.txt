"Toi le Venin" is the masterpiece of Robert Hossein and one of the great thrillers of the fifties. Based on a novel by Frederic Dard, a screenwriter with whom the director often worked (see also "le Monte-Charge" which Hossein did not direct but in which he was also the protagonist), the script captures you from the first images on a deserted street at night where a beautiful blonde could be the fiercest of criminals in the mysterious house where she finds her femme fatale ... and her sister. Then a game of cat and mouse begins. One of the sisters is in a wheelchair. But is he really disabled? What is the criminal who tried to kill the hero that night? <br /> <br /> The two actresses, Marina Vlady and the late Odile Versois were sisters. <br /> <br /> Turn off all the lights before watching. High suspense.
