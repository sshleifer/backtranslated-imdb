This is a free adaptation of Clarence Mulford's novels; fans of Willaim Boyd's films will probably feel a bit at sea here (and the reviews here so far reflect this). But I knew about Hopalong from novels first, and I didn't care much about Boyd's movies, once I got close to them. <br /> <br /> Christopher Coppola made a wise choice - he didn't make a nostalgic "western"; instead, he approached Cassidy's story as a slice of what we called "American"; or what the older critics once called "homespun". As the film unfolded, I was increasingly reminded of the great version of the "Hallmark Theater" by Mark Twain "Roughing It", with James Garner narrating. <br /> <br /> Both of these films remind us that, although the "old west" films are probably always mythical for Americans, they must not be "Western"; they may very well just be films about what it meant to be American at that time, in that place. <br /> <br /> I never feel assaulted by watching this movie; there is no effort to push Boyd-Cassidy's legacy down his throat, without irony, without a field. As a result, I have the feeling that these characters have walked - or ridden on horseback - through a real Western America. I too could have walked a hundred years ago. <br /> <br /> Having said this, the simplicity of the film - it positively avoids all that we have come to call "style" - is all in its favor; and the simple acting of the artists is perfectly suited to this; Perbacco, it really looks like a story told around a campfire on a cattle driveway - no visual care, only the oddities and the good humor - and sudden violence - that we expect from the good narrative of an adventure yarn. I was very pleasantly surprised by this film, and if the viewer reserves inculcated expectations, he or she will find considerable pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> I would have given this film 9 stars, but I'll give it a ten just because most reviewers here completely missed the point; and I urge them to put aside their memories of Boyd and give this film another chance. <br /> <br /> Note 1: A reviewer complained that Hopalong shoots dead people in this film, rather than shooting guns from their hands (wing Boyd's Cassidy); first, Cassidy kills people in novels; second, if Cassidy were a real cowboy he would have shot dead people - the problem with guns shooting from people's hands is that they can always have another gun - which seems to be part of the subtext of this same movie. <br /> <br /> Note 2: I admit that I am jealous of the Coppola family, who have the director of "The Godfather" among them who can get all the opportunities to make films that I can't; but a good movie is a good movie; and this is a good movie. If it's from someone with the name "Coppola", well, it's just the way it is. America is the land of opportunity (or it was, until Bush took office) - this is what the great American novels are all about.
