Picture Bride has an excellent look into the Hawaiian past and the people who lived there at the time. The time, the money earned and the hours that these people put into their lives to survive and live, takes on a whole new meaning for blood, sweat and tears. <br /> <br /> The concept of dating / matchmaking is something like what we do today on the net today.

Very slow snail. <br /> <br /> The song of the plantation songs by the workers reminds me of the songs of southern plantation workers of their end and their future goals. <br /> <br /> The film shows the discomfort and romantic and soft scenes that Hawaii can bring. Like the immobility of a storm that arrives and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the tranquility.
