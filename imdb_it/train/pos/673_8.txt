Through the great division we call understanding, there is still much that we do not know about what was explained by the early tribal elders. In any case, there is a lot about the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us not to prepare for what they warn about is the "End Time". In this film called "The Last Wave" an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When the perpetrators are arrested, they remain silent, less disturbing the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the defense lawyer in charge of defending the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images of his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by a friendly aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infringement as a tribal law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The film is full of baffling and obscure images of apocalyptic global catastrophes and warns against a future tsunami and an island fate. The black drama and the deep rituals are what give this film a terrific fascination and therefore it is not for the faint of heart, in fact the simplest haunting appearances can last for years in the nightmares of innocent spectators. Good silent drama. ****
