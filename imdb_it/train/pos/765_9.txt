I imagine that when "Beat Street" made a national appearance, "Flashdance" arrived at the same time. The problem with "Flashdance" is that there was only one break dance scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet. This was one of the reasons "Beat Street" was better. The only film that could compete with "Beat Street" seems to be "Footloose", because both films focused on how dance was used by people to express their best feelings. <br /> <br /> The break-dance scenes in "Beat Street" arrive just before the middle and the end of the blow. And I loved them all. Almost all the tricks of the breaks were present in the jam session scenes: the jackhammer, the flares, the turns of the head, the suicide sit, the crazy legs, the mortal, the throwing forward, the figure four --- almost all. /> <br /> Like "The Warriors", "Beat Street" has gang-related violence in the world of hip hop ... but in a much less violent way than the first. The only important fight scene in "Beat Street" was when the graffiti artist Ramon (who was abbreviated as "Branch" in the film) is chased by a member of the rival gang on the New York subway tracks .. ... fighting each other the third rail and both dying from electrocution on that rail. Well, even if that chase scene ended tragically, it was better to die like that than to have blood exploding from a gang shot. <br /> <br /> Most of the gang stuff in the film was graffiti related to hip-hop culture and rap music. A lot of rap music appeared in the film because hip-hop members used rap music as a diversion for the negative aspects of group life. Even the soundtrack of the film, which closed the curtain on the film, was not only a tribute to hip-hop culture, it was also a tribute to Ramon's death. <br /> <br /> By the way, during the dance scene called "Tango, Tango", I imagine that the female drummer in the well orchestra directed by actress Rae Dawn Chong was Sheila E. to make a cameo.
