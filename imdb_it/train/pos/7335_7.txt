With Ralph Bakshi most of his films seem to be a double-edged sword. You will get something exceptional, but only if you will tolerate the stupid and the unnecessary cheezy. The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the story that perhaps has not always shone in the animation department. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice is a big hit from Bakshi in terms of animation. Rotoscoping is much more detailed and the animation looks lively. You still have some of the boring static cells and slightly blurred background paintings, but overall the appearance has definitely improved since Bakshi's last fantasy epic. The animation has a realistic, almost naturalistic style, and unlike LOTR, where this style was often at odds with the real content, the unique atmosphere of the film is enhanced here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the film fails to create a meaningful story from its simple layout and in fact most of the characters' motivations are rather confusing. Lorn and Tigra are easy cases, but even the main villain Necron was difficult to follow, not to mention that boy with Furry Face Mask (also known as "That Guy"). Although most of the voice actors were appropriate, there are some strange whims in the audio department and Tigra sounds particularly terrible every time he is screaming. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that the intrinsic value of the film's entertainment outweighs its needlessly stupid execution of the plot. The poor style of the characters is something that will never happen to you, but it helps you to remind yourself that perhaps this film is not even meant to be taken too seriously. It's still a cool and really fun hella.
