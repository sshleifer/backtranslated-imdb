Arthur Bach needs to grow, but unfortunately it's not the only thing he has to do. According to his extremely wealthy father, Arthur must marry a certain wealthy Susan Johnson or be cut off from family money ($ 750 million dollars). The problem is that Arthur does not love Susan (although I have heard that she makes good chicken) and has just fallen in love with the maid and Linda Marolla, a part-time user. Arthur is an interesting guy. He really is a big boy, born into wealth with at least one person who takes care of him every second of every day. Working simply fools Arthur in the wrong way - he likes to have fun, become a woman and, of course, drink. Bere gives Arthur a sort of Jekyll-and-Hyde complex; and while this leads to all sorts of problems, it's absolutely fun to watch on the screen. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is fantastic here in this film like Arthur, earning an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe victory for his performance. Moore is fantastic with the comic aspects of the film, transforming the already amusing jokes into unforgettable golden comedies, but he is also very good at bringing Arthur to an unstoppable level and making the character likeable. Moore has some help in the co-star department - Liza Minnelli is as big as Lina, the lively person Arthur can't get enough of, and John Gielgud is as exceptional as Arthur Hobson's butler. Gielgud won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in this film, and there's no doubt about why. Hobson has a dry, stone-like intelligence, but he always takes care of Arthur - and Gielgud is perfect in the role. Steve Gordon's 1981 film, Arthur, is short and simple, but offers a lot of laughs.
