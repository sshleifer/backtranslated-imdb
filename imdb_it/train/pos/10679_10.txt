The man of the house is a real comedy situation in every sense. The comedy is about a character named Robin Tripp (played by the great Richard O 'Sullivan) who finds himself after a wild party, ending up at the home of two women called Jo and Chrissy. Ironically, the party was held to greet their old roommate. The obvious ends up happening as he enters. <br /> <br /> The man of the house was a precursor to the spin-off of Cooke and Mortimer, George and Mildred, who showed the 2 characters that were owners of Jo, Chrissy and Robin. These two characters actually turn out to be the lineart for the man of the house with Mildred (the late and very missed Yootha Joyce), in particular getting some of the best lines in the series. A semi-regular character was Larry (Doug Fisher), a useless person who was always lurking and who always presented himself only when he wanted to borrow something (and never to return it). <br /> <br /> Americans have made a version called company of three, but it has no chance compared to this much more enjoyable original. Thames risked producing a comedy about a man who shared an apartment with two women at a very conservative time, but they should worry because the assessments at the moment suggest that about 20 million people just wanted to watch a lot of old-fashioned comedy inspired casting and a sharp script. Too bad that modern comedy cannot reach such a high standard. <br /> <br /> This program is available on the network DVD
