This is an extremely powerful film based on a true story that can be maddening to watch. I say this because how brutal a press can be for people, in this case an innocent Australian couple accused of killing their child. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep received many awards for his performance when this film was released but I thought Sam Neill was just as good. Let's just say they were both excellent, but the role was a little more difficult for Streep because he had to learn an Australian accent. (He learned it so well that I had trouble understanding it in some parts.) <br /> <br /> Without giving anything, all I can say is that this film will wear you down emotionally.
