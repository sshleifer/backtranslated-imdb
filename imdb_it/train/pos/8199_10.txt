After what was considered the official trilogy of Dirty Harry with The Enforcer (1976) to be the final chapter of the series. Dirty Harry is back, older, dirtier and gritty than ever since the 1971 classic. <br /> <br /> Dirty Harry has in the past killed a psychopathic killer, vigilant cops and veteran Vietnam terrorists. But now he is looking for a new killer, a killer who wants revenge by bringing down his attackers. <br /> <br /> A sudden impact brings new meaning and a darker tone to Dirty Harry. Callahan is in a new murder case that is going around a woman (played by Sondra Locke), who was brutally raped, along with her sister, who was traumatized. Ten years later, he is seeking revenge by shooting his attackers. Likewise, Callahan is in trouble from his superiors after provoking a mafia boss with a heart attack, which is also being hunted by the crowd. So, to kill the heat inside the city, Harry is about to take a vacation in a seaside town, but at the same time the victim of rape is in the city, chasing his attackers one by one. Harry is under investigation and finds the killings very similar, since he lives in the killer traces. <br /> <br /> The impact of Sudden in my opinion, must be one of my 10 best revenge films, besides being the second best Dirty Harry film yet, much better than both The Enforcer and The Dead Pool put together. Suddenly Impact has what the original Dirty Harry had, a dark tone with a funny value. <br /> <br /> So do you feel lucky, punk?
