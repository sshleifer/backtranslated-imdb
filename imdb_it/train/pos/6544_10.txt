I really enjoyed this movie! Although it was nothing like any of the books, it's still that classic Nancy Drew style. I saw a lot of commercials for this film and since I was really in the Nancy Drew books I really had high expectations for this film and they certainly met those expectations. Virtually all the characters were exactly as I imagined them when reading books. I'm really happy to have seen this movie. All the actors and actresses behaved as if they behaved as in the book series. Since I saw this movie I wanted to read every single Nancy Drew book out there. All the actors and actresses have really played their characters and this certainly proved when this film was shown on the big screen. It seemed that all the actors and actresses were really in the positions where the characters were, I definitely gave this film 10 out of 10.
