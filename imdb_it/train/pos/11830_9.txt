This is a striking looking film with everything done in just six or seven colors. When it came out more than 15 years ago, it amazed the audience with its color combination, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. Those colors, at least for me, make this film absolutely fascinating to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes that I would like to freeze and somehow convert them into a painting to study their works. <br /> <br /> The characters and the story do not match the size of the photograph, but they are all over-the-top, especially the bad guys. The famous actors who played them here must have had a lot of fun on the set playing "Flatop", "Pruneface", "Lips", "Mumbles", etc. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are as good as Dick Tracey and girl Tess Truehart, and she is as sweet and sweet as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo while the young thug Dick and Tess take it under their wing. The other colorful characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but they are too numerous to list here. Check the complete credits on the main page and you'll be amazed. <br /> <br /> The only negatives I found were the voice of Pacino shouting after a while, the voice sung off by Madonna and the fact that the film would have been cut better about 10 minutes. Those "faults" are all secondary because, in general, this is a funny film ... a strip of cartoons that comes to life in an incredibly colorful way ... like nothing you've ever seen.
