I believe that many people have voted for the film, NOT because of the lack of quality. But it didn't follow the standard Hollywood formula. Some of the conflicts are not resolved. The ending is just a little too real for others, but the journey that the rich characters and the long list of supporters provide is both challenging and a lot of fun. Even the cinematography is excellent given the urban setting, the direction is also excellent and innovative. <br /> <br /> This is a 10 in my book, this film will take you to places where the normal and planned Hollywood script won't do it. They took some risks and did some different things. I think it worked well, I'm deliberately trying to avoid any direct reference to the film because seeing it for you is the best answer, not accepting someone else's interpretation.
