Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve several murders among the rich after a dog show. <br /> <br /> I usually hate mysteries that are too convoluted (like this) but I LOVE this movie. It moves very fast (only 72 minutes), is beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz (he uses tons of tricks that speed up the narration together), has a very ingenious plot (including a solution for a murder in a locked room that was simply amazing ) and has a very good cast. <br /> <br /> Powell is very suave and fantastic like Vance - he doesn't seem to be acting - it's IS Vance! Mary Astor is not given much to do, but adds class and beauty to the production. Everyone else is very good too, but the best thing is Eugene Pallette in the role of detective Heath. He is a very good actor with a VERY distinctive voice and some of his jokes were hilarious. <br /> <br /> Basically, an excellent mystery of a 1930s Hollywood murder. Worth seeing. <br /> <br />
