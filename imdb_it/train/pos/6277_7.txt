Good action and interesting plot. After seeing the original I have to say that it was an interesting improvement and showed more than the film. Good cast .. significant acting .. although it would be nice to see a little more expansion in the action scenes than in the background story. Fun movie to watch and always keep you awake 7/10 is a fair grade, I think!
