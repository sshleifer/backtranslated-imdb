In reflecting on this film, I can think of two others to help put it into perspective. A relatively forgettable one, but covering the same geography, is Coup de Torchon, the other thousands of kilometers away and much larger in size is unforgettable Indochina. Claire Denis has produced a film that has some of the great bases of Indochine, the complex and unspoken relationship between France and its colonial subjects. <br /> <br /> I was struck by the dignity of Potee, with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white garments. I was also struck by the love / hate relationship between him and Aimee. It is the latter that gives the film its driving force, it is the latter that links this film to Indochina. <br /> <br /> You are never sure of what motivates everyone, even if some of the characters are required for a memory of colonialism. It is this cynical side of history that binds him to Coup de Torchon. Theirs is the most scandalous story, perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way, but Denis reminds us of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships. <br /> <br /> The black American who grows up France at the beginning and end of the film offers another interesting aspect of the confusion we have in the western world when we look at Africa. He says he wanted to call all the brothers when he came. He was coming home, but they just thought he was a little stupid. France, the character and the girl, grew up in Cameroon, but neither of them fully understands what it is, even if they can remember how it was. <br /> <br />
