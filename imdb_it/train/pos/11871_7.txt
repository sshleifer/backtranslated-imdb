Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE paints a picture not easily forgotten. Al Pacino turns into a spectacular performance when Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee, becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his crime realm in Florida. This gangster movie is hard, violent, loud, vulgar, unpleasant and must keep the record for uttering the word "f - k" the most number of times. Almost three hours in length, and yes, it can become repulsive. A brave constitution keeps you in your place rejoicing over the collapse of a ruthless crime lord. <br /> <br /> Also the interesting characters are Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino turns out to be one of the greatest of his generation. He manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression. This is not going to be a movie for everyone, because you start thinking you have left a disaster. Is it powerful enough for you? Crime does not pay long!
