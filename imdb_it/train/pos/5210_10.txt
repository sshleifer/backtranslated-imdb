It's a pity he didn't get the screen credit, he did the best job in the film by far, he has the girl on the cross, the best part of the movie. It had a much greater impact than Avril, or almost anyone else in the film. He almost made S / M look funny! It was really believable that the S / M model was afraid of its situation. Although they seem to have messed up that kind of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad guy, those sets were very well built, but they simply touched the surface of what was shot. This is a film in which both cuts should be made available. They seem to have omitted much of what was shot, and almost all of the really obscure things that would have made the film much more insane. It is as if they stopped before the sign they were making during the shoot. What was shot would not have obtained an R rating probably an NC-17 or X, but this is what would have been necessary to make the film as it should have been.
