This impossible story is of a female witch chasing a mortal man, in a mortal world. His "community" is open among its members, but hides its witchcraft from mortals. Hmmmm ... this is starting to look familiar. LOL. It's not your typical movie. Very campy shows by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs prevent things from getting boring. Kim Novak is always a pleasure on the screen, but I found his combination with James Stewart unusual (but not fatal to the plot). <br /> <br /> With renewed interest in all things witches and darkness, this film deserves to be discovered and rediscovered by an old and new audience ...... IT'S STILL A HAPPINESS!
