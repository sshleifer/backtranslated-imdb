Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a film about a young prince (Simon) who is banished from his kingdom due to the fact that his father (the king) is killed by the clich√© "evil adviser". This film is about the adventures of Simon. The special effects, the plot, the acting and in general all that concerns this film is MALE. However, it's so ugly that it's fun. You will continue to watch this movie simply because it is so ugly that it is funny, and, as the other reviewer of the film said, it is so bad that it is fine.
