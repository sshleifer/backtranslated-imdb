Prince plays "the Kid" in this semi-autobiographical film by a talented, but narcissistic young musician who has a less bright home life. It is true that acting leaves something to be desired (apart from Morris Day and especially Clarence Williams, both of which are perfect), but the film is still exceptional and one of the best released in the 1980s. It has the best soundtrack of ANY film of the last 50 years at least, highly quotable lines, and the waste scene is HILARIOUS !! Moreover Apollonia is simply STUNNING. On an unrelated not, when I saw Prince in concert in 2004 he blew up the stadium. He is an experienced showman and was one of the best concerts I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary with director Albert Magnoli, Producer Robert Cavallo, and director of photography Donald Thorin; Theatrical trailer; "Under the Cherry Moon" and "Graffiti Bridge" Disco Trailers 2) A 12-minute featurette on the First Avenue Club; "Purple Rain: Bachstage Pass (a half-hour featurette of the film I will see later on in its page);" Riffs, Raffs and Revolution: the impact and influence of the Purple Rain "10 minutes featurette; 30 minutes of MTV's Premiere Movies (when MTV hasn't sucked donkey balls); 5 Prince music videos (Let's go crazy, take me with you, when he goes to cry, I would Die 4 U / Baby I'm a Star and Purple Rain); 2 Videos of The Time (Jungle Love and The Bird) and a music video for "Sex Shooter" by Apollonia 6 < br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Apollonia shows off her nice ass tits
