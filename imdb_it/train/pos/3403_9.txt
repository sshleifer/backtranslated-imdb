A splendid Techicolor production that tells the unusual story of the love story between a woman of strong faith and a Trappist monk who left his monastery, breaking his vows. The film opens in a convent in Europe, where a former student prays: a solitary beauty in black called Domini (Marlene Dietrich). She is recommended by the Mother Superior to go to the desert and "find herself", and lose her sorrow for the father who died recently. In the train car on the way to the Sahara he sits in front of a very, very worried man (Charles Boyer) - our former monk. Soon he finds himself in a hotel near a palm oasis where he sees again our mysterious tormented man as he is content with what to do in front of a very seductive dancer. Domini becomes a friend of him, even if he knows nothing of his past - a love story that will soon follow. <br /> <br /> This film is sentimental, melodramatic and different (in a sense, almost surreal and even a bit campy) - I found it fun and funny. Photography in this is really interesting - it is full of extreme close-ups of the face and beautiful strokes of color of caravans of horses crossing the desert, figures silhouetted against a sunset sky. Marlene Dietrich gives a well done performance, even if contained, and looks beautiful. Charles Boyer - usually not one of my favorites - he's actually pretty good at it, I think the part he deserves is right for him and he looks pretty young too. Basil Rathbone is fine here, apart from having given very little to do. Another great Max Steiner orchestral soundtrack helps keep the drama moving - all in all, a very funny movie.
