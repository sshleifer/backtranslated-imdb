Overall, the film is OK. I think it's better than Sepet and much better than Gubra in the sense of its history, its sentimental value. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that make me touch. Yes, I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) played very well. Brilliant. I can say that his acting is almost natural. <br /> <br /> However, the song 'Ne Me Quitte Pas' by Nina Simone is really "'menaikkan' my 'bulu' 'roma'". <br /> <br /> I love the song. Both the song. "Ne Me Quitte Pas" and "Hujan". I just downloaded the song. Gorgeous. <br /> <br /> And greetings to Yasmin. The final credit of the film makes me touch again. We can see how Yasmin really appreciated his parents in a unique way. <br /> <br /> I think the film deserves the Grand Prize of the international jury at the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I give 8.5 out of 1 stars.
