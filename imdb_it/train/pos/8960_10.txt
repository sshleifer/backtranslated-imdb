this may not be War & Peace, but the two Academies wouldn't have been available if it wasn't for the genius of James Wong Howe ... <br /> <br /> this is one of the few films I have I fell in love with child and I returned without dissatisfaction. Whether you are interested in what you offer fictitiously or not, BB&C is a feast for the eyes. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's his best job, I'm certainly not an expert there. but the appearance of this film is surprising. I like everything about it; Elsa Lanchester, the cat, the crazy hoo-doo, the retro-downtown-ness; but the way it was filmed is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> I also like the inconsistencies highlighted on this page and the "special effects" that now seem backward. all of this creates a truly coherent world.
