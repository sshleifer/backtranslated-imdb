This film is a true reflection of the Australian ingenuity that was required to make this country what it has been for the past 200 years. Not as pompous as the British, not Gung-Ho as the Americans. If one of these countries had attempted what this crew did, it would have failed appallingly. Or because of ignorance in the British side, or too much confidence in a superior American firepower. The "real" Australians (ie non-imports) are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise most of their adult lives. Just look at examples like Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
