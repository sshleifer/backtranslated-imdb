This film surprised me. Some things were "clicheish" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie "Enemy of the State" with Will Smith. But for the most part a lot of fun - a nice mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the two wannabe thugs Julio and Ramundo (who provide some comic relief). This is a film you can review - let's say ... some Wednesday night when there's nothing else. I gave a 9 for entertainment value.
