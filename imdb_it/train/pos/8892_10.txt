Great, beautiful, fantastic! This is all I can say about that movie, but imdb wants at least four lines of text, so I'll process them. The cast was great (Jerry O'connel is really cute!), The music was fantastic (the 60s had the best music ever, imho), the historical material was interesting, as was the way in which they made the actors of the 90s seem to have actually been there in the 60s. And above all - the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes, and this is the greatness of every drama. BUT IN A WORD: GREAT!
