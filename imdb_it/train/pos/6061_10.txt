I liked the film so much that I watched it twice and this is something to say about a documentary. The musical score, the cinematography and the sound are absolutely amazing, as one might expect from an Imax production. Even though it's shot for those huge Imax cinemas, it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system. In fact this would make a DVD perfect for your system demo. <br /> <br /> Even the subject is so fascinating. It's about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I was already a fan of Mario because he is the best race car driver in history since he is the only one to win the CART championship, the F1 championship, the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. The script follows the path of two cars very important for the father and the son. The first car is in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster Mario has ever driven and we follow the restoration to sparkling perfection. The other car is Michael's new racing car and we follow it from cutting the molds during the racing season. Imax lends the right magic to make the construction of the machine fun and fascinating. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, who was the owner of Michael Amoretti's team at the time of making the film, tells the movie. His anecdotes and his wit, drawn from many years as owner and driver, lend a lot to production. <br /> <br /> The main feature is the race scenes. Turn up the volume here! There is something around at over 200 mph and the soundtrack that pulls you completely into the screen for an experience you won't forget. Wow! <br /> <br /> The last magical element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This god of the racing world, Mario Andretti, is a loving father who proudly watches over his son's career. They work together so well that every father and son should see it. You can say I'm a tight family. I wish I could all have that experience.
