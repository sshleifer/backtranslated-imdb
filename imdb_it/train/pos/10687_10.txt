I must confess that I was completely shocked by this film. For example, I went to see him on a whim waiting for something mediocre, but given this, the most shocking thing was that he was in a populist American cinema. This is British comedy at its best: dark, bizarre and funny in a way that American films have never been. I must stop, however, to recommend all this to everyone with all my heart; I went to see him with several people, a little English, a little European and a little American and while some of us loved him (mainly from the first two groups), some hated him and found him worthless. If you think you're involved in this kind of thing, then go. If not, don't do it. 10/10.
