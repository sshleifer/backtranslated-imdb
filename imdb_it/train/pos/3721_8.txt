This was one of the best war movies I've seen because it focuses on the characters rather than on the war itself. All the cast members do an excellent job and because most of them are relative unknowns makes everything more believable. The camera footage is exceptional, as is the rhythm and editing. This film will come to you and will make the audience take care of the charcters.
