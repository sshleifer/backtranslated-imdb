Sitting, typing ?? Nothing is the last "and if?" fest offered by Vincenzio Natali, and starring David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller as two losers. One is having relationship problems, he was fired from his job (due to relationship problems) and the police are out to get him (because of his job and his relationship problems). The other guy is an agoraphobic who refuses to go out, he is greeted by an annoying girls guide who calls his mother to declare that she was harassed when he didn't buy cookies from him. Oh yes, the police also chases him, after the scout girl's mom called them to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Friend, what a day. <br /> <br /> And if you could make all this disappear? This is the whole premise behind "Nothing". The two fools understand, the police, the scout girl, the cars, the lawn, the street, everything ?? disappear. There is nothing but a white space! This is an interesting concept that I thought. I also looked at the moment when 30 minutes had passed in the film and I still had an hour left in the film. Could the 2 actors do this job and let us have fun for 60 minutes? Although the actors try, 60 minutes is a long time and there is clearly dead air in the places of this film. But the two actors, who are friends of a lifetime with each other and the director, have a repertoire so big with one another, that it was fun to watch the dialogues and improve the joke of the two. There are many supernatural elements, but it is more their response to these elements that ultimately make this film worth seeing.
