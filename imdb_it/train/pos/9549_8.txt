A young director (only 21) with a great talent, a powerful scenario, a young and ambitious cast with a theatrical background ... <br /> <br /> One of the first attempts of a thriller in Turkish cinema, which seems in future we will have even more based on the success ... <br /> <br /> Shot on high definition video, the film is perhaps made on world thrillers, particularly American thrillers. The technical and cinematographic character is quite well done, the scenes are all well worked. Not too much blood but enough to make you think that you are also in the bloodbath ... <br /> <br /> The scenario is wise enough but with some clues, an intelligent audience can easily predict what is happening and in the end, when everything settles down, you are becoming somewhat strange to finish the result. <br /> <br /> Well done Tiglon, one of the biggest DVD distributors in Turkey, it is not easy to decide for a film like this their first attempt as a production company ...
