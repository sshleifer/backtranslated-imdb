When I saw the dentist, I thought it was very beautiful. But this film is not for everyone, especially for people who don't like gory scenes as the Dentist has many bloody scenes. That's why it has the R18 rating. This is a Dr. Alan Feinstone, a dentist from Beverly Hills, who finds his wife Brooke cheated on him by the poolman. It is best to go to your dentist "before" you look at this. But if you don't like going to the dentist already, then it's better not to look at it because you could be passed off for life. the dentist has the best bloody revenge I've ever seen. Who has ever seen a film that has a dentist (Spoiler), pulls out all of his wife's teeth and cuts off his tongue without anesthesia? Great shot, but not for everyone.
