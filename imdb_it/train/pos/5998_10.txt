The Cure is a fantastic movie ... So full of suspense and so REAL! I was lucky enough to attend a screening of "The Cure" at his New York premiere and it completely upset me! I also heard that he won an award from that particular festival, and he certainly deserved it. The first thing that struck me was photography. Eric Giovon did a great job. The shooting style of the mid-movie love scene was fantastic. In this film a love scene was needed, and Jafri understood the point, but he also kept the scene elegant. Giovon and Jafri are an excellent creative team and should definitely collaborate on future projects. The narration of Judy Maier was so surreal but at the same time heartbreaking, made me feel what the main character felt. I am a very severe critic, but I have to say that The Cure is one of my favorite films ... A LOVE! If you haven't seen it yet, take a look!
