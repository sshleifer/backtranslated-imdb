I found this film like the usual French slap on the face of America. The camera, too often, focuses on fat people, sloppy houses and rural areas. While the narrative seems to sympathize and admire the people of the small city that is presented to the viewer, cinematography exploits them and degrades them. There were undoubtedly thin people to see in Glencoe and neat and tidy houses, but Malle chose to show us the worst of what there was to see. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that some American filmmakers will go to France to reveal its worst elements to the American public. I can assure you, as a frequent visitor to France, that all is not well there. Foreign immigrants are not readily assimilated, thus creating serious social injustices. But Americans are not willing to expose the French for their prejudice against their compatriots and their envy of the United States, so it's not likely that we'll see films on the subject.
