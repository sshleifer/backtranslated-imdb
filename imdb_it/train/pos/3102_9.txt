I saw The Bourne Ultimatum last summer with a friend, and, wow! I had already seen the first two films and I liked them, but Ultimatum, I loved it. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, a suffering amnesia that acts on the CIA, trying to find out who he is. <br /> <br /> As I said, I loved this movie from beginning to end, with no holes in the plot, slow scenes, everything was rhythmically right and suited the other films well, but in every sense it was much better. <br /> <br /> Best stunts, car chases, actors and effects I've seen in an action movie all summer, (surprisingly due to Spider-Man 3, Pirates, etc.) But I wasn't Solo action in this movie, Jason not only kills and runs away. He has a soul and the audience tries for him, so the drama is included. But this does not slow him down. <br /> <br /> Of all the "threequels" that came out last summer, this was the best.
