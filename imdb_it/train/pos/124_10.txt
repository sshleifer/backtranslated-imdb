* Contains spoilers because I should describe some movie techniques, so read at your own risk! * <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. The use of tint in some scenes makes an old photograph seem to come to life. I also liked the projection of people on a rear screen. For example, in one scene, Leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen. His face is huge in the back and Leo is in the foreground. <br /> <br /> One of the best uses for this is when the youngsters kill the Ravensteins on the train, a scene shot in an almost political poster style, with facial close-ups. It reminded me of the battleship Potemkin, that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to transmit tons of horror without much blood. The same goes for the scene where Katharina finds her dead father in the bathtub ... you can only see the red water on the side. It's one of the things I love about Von Trier, his understatement of horror, which ends up making it even more disturbing. <br /> <br /> The use of the text in the film was unique, as when the character of Leo is driven by the word "werewolf". I've never seen anything like it in a movie. <br /> <br /> The use of black comedy in this film was well done. Ernst-Hugo Järegård is as big as Leo's uncle. It brings out the giggles I received from his role in the Kingdom (Riget). This humor makes the plot of the absurd anal retentivity of train conductors against the terrible background of World War II and all the chaos, easier to take. It reminds me of Riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain normalcy at the end of the first part when everything is going crazy. It shows that some people are truly unaware of the terrible things happening around them. Yet some people, like Leo, are tuned in, but they don't do anything positive about it. <br /> <br /> The finished voice, expertly performed by Max von Sydow, is also fun. It involves you in history and makes you jump into Leo's head, which is sometimes a scary place. <br /> <br /> The film emphasizes that one is a coward if he does not choose a side. I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark, where the character of Bjork does not speak for himself and ends up being his own destruction. Actually, Von Trier used to look like an anti-woman to me, doing Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know that his male characters aren't good either! I found myself in the same place during the end of Dancer, when you really want the main character to rethink their actions, but obviously they never do it!
