I'm not tired of saying that this is one of the best political thrillers ever made. The story takes place in an imaginary state, but obviously it is the murder of Kennedy. A sincere and honest district attorney (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single Daslow (= Oswald) and although all other officials want to close the case, he continues to investigate with his team. br /> <br /> The script is written tight and fast and keeps the tension until the end. Only the part concerning Milgram's experiment on the authorities is (although not uninteresting) a little out of place. The final sequence - explaining who Icarus really is - partly shot in slow motion and intensified by a Morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence I've ever seen in a movie.
