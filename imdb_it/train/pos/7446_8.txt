I cannot agree with any of the comments. The first time I saw the film on a UK television channel, it was presented as an independent film and if you take the film below this angle I think it's another story. I couldn't believe what I was seeing and I was hooked instantly. The plot can be as ugly as the spectacle of a JS (ie there is no plot), but the acting is evil, it's exhilarating and all in all an incredible trash film. <br /> <br /> It is said so much about America that about a Bully or a Ken Park without the prospect of drama, but takes a look at American society, and more precisely at what the afternoon TV spectators in America and I believe there are plenty of them!). They are interested. After all, it's the neighbors we're talking about, aren't they? <br /> <br /> 100% fun!
