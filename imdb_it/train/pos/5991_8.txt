A sequel to Angels With Dirty Faces in name only, The Angels Wash Their Faces somehow suffers from the usual Dead End Kids pranks. In fact, with the presence of Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan this should have been treated as a sequel to Angels With Dirty Faces, at least for continuity. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Ann Sheridan, she is the only true shining light of this film. To paraphrase a clich√©, Ann Sheridan could read from a telephone directory for two hours and I would like to buy the DVD! <br /> <br /> Another virtue of this film is the chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background. For a better example of the duo Sheridan-Reagan, I would recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row.
