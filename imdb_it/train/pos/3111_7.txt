Now he has a name, an identity, memories and a lost girlfriend. All he wanted was to disappear, but still, they tracked him down and destroyed the world he just built. Now he wants some explanation, and to ride people like he did what he is. Yes, Jason Bourne is back, and this time he's here with a vengeance. <br /> <br /> OK, this film does not have the most elaborate script in the world, but its themes are very intelligent and ask some serious questions about our society. Obviously, like every Hollywood movie from the late 1990s, "The Bourne Suprematy" is a superhero story. Jason Bourne is a project similar to Captain America, which completely failed. In the first film, the hero discovered his abilities and accepted them in the second. Now he fights against what he considers evil, after a person close to him was killed (his girlfriend in "Supremacy") by them. This is all part of the superhero story, including a character with (realistic but impressive superpowers: it's almost invincible). <br /> <br /> And the interesting point is that evil fights all over the world (there are no borders in Bourne's films, the characters pass from one continent to another in the blink of an eye), is, as in the best seasons of "24", an American enemy who believes he is fighting for the good of his country completely blinds him. Strange how "crazy patriots" are now the No. 1 enemies of Hollywood's paranoid stories. <br /> <br /> In addition to all those interesting themes, the film is not flawless: the female character of Nickie Parson is completely useless for now and the direction is quite original when it comes to dialogue scenes. But that doesn't matter, because "The Bourne Ultimatum" is an action movie. And the action scenes are pretty awesome. <br /> <br /> Everyone here talks about the "Waterloo scene" and the "Tanger search" and everyone is right. I particularly liked the fight in Tangier, which recalls my exaggeration and folly of Tsui Hark's works. Visually inventive scenes, lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on contemporary American themes: "The Bourne Ultimatum" is certainly the best film in the series and a very interesting and original action film.
