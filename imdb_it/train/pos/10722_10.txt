Spacecamp is one of the movies that kids love, and mom and dad can have fun looking at them too. Growing up in the 80s I liked this movie, it's the plot and all the actors. I recently bought this movie on DVD, so when I have my kids, they can have so much fun watching this movie like I did. The plot is fun, a group of kids, embarking on a journey they never expected when they were launched into space by a superb robot. At first they were in auh but when they realized they didn't have enough oxygen to make the panic come back inside. Once they had recovered enough oxygen from the space station they returned to earth as even better friends and a new respect for life.
