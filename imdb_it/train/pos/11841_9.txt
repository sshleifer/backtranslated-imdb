This was a great movie with a nice story. My children (10, 7, 5 and 4) loved this film, including myself. The music was fantastic too. No, horses don't talk, but instead, the story is told by the Spirit. And listen to a story told from a horse's point of view if the view is fun. <br /> <br /> I think the title says it all, "spirit". This movie really gives you a sense of family, home and friends. I should say that my 4-year-old boy and the 5-year-old girl were really touched by this film, and even though they succeeded, they laughed so hard and eventually rooted for the spirit. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the "Spirit" with your family and abandon your spirit with this moving story. Your children will love it. I think you will too.
