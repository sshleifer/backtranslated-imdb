Only a 9/10 from me, a perfect ten would have been if there was more than one storyline for the film, but still Moonwalker remains a fun music, dance and entertainment festival to date. Starting with the editing of video clips from Jackson's long career, he reminds the viewer of why he is often referred to as "The King of Pop". From its success "I want you back" to "We are the World", the award-winning charity record for Africa. Following this, a short film of some sort, although not brilliant in an Oscar winning screenplay, still offers a fantastic and entertaining drama for the public. Finish with a perfect (sexy!) Rendition of 'Come Together'. Something that the whole family can watch and enjoy.
