While I was watching this movie on video last night, I kept receiving these prickles that told me this would last. I have a feeling that I will look at it again and again for years to come. <br /> <br /> It has all the timeless qualities you could want in a story / film. And although some cultural references are obscure to me, a Western spectator, at the center this is a universal story.
