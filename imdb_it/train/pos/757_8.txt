I must be honest. I watched and enjoyed this show because it was disgusting, offensive, hilarious and vulgar. Yes, there is a lot of humor for everyone. If you like the kind of humor that makes fun of people falling off skateboards, for example, then you'll have a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Or, if you like people in extreme acrobatic actions, bad, you'll have fun too. And if you like scatological moods and extreme situations oh, you'll enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> I like all three types of humor offered by "Dirty SÃ nchez". I like having a difficult laugh with show situations. "Jackass" is like a walk in the park compared to this. So, if you're tired of Jackass's typical American stupidity, give proof of extreme English stupidity on this show. With all due respect. <br /> <br /> This is a show that has little taste or class. It is not recommended for those who are easily offended or disgusted. <br /> <br /> Now, these guys have to see a psychologist. Especially the character of Paco.
