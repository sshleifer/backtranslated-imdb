An American woman, her husband and European children return to her mother's house on "Watch on the Rhine", a 1943 film based on the Lillian Hellman comedy, and starring Paul Lukas (which I believe is repeating her scenic role here) , Bette Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Woods. An anti-fascist, a worker in the underground movement, many times wounded and wanted by the Nazis, Kurt Muller (Lukas) needs a long vacation on the estate of his rich mother-in-law. But he finds that there is really no way out as one of the guests (Coulouris) is suspicious of his true identity and more than willing to sell it. <br /> <br /> Great shows abound in this film, written extensively to express the liberal point of view of Lillian Hellman. It was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released, while the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries came to safe American homes. The big controversy in today's movie is that Paul Lukas won an Oscar for Humphrey Bogart in "Casablanca". Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful stage presence and fabulous Rick, but Lukas is as transcendent as Kurt. The monologue he has on the need to kill is tormenting, just to mention a scene. <br /> <br /> Although this is not what one thinks of as a Bette Davis film, it gives a masterful performance here as Kurt's loyal and loving wife, Sara. His acting draws the heart, and the love scenes between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and tender. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film made me cry with honesty of emotions. Lillian Hellman is not everyone's cup of tea, but unlike "The Little Foxes", she wrote some really nice and wonderful characters and a nice story given to Cast and Warner Brothers. Highly recommended.
