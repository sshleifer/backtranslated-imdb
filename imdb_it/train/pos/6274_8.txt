I went to see this movie with a group of friends one night. I haven't heard much about it. So I didn't expect anything. But after seeing it, I really liked it. Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast were very good. But I must say that Giovanni Ribisi's acting performance needed some resonance. But such a small defect could be canceled. <br /> <br /> Gone In 60 Seconds is about a retired car thief who needs to upgrade 60 rare and exotic cars overnight to save his brother's life. The film is in no way foreseeable. So the ending should be a surprise. Do you think it's just another fast driving movie? Well, you're partially right. There is much more. Everyone should take a look at this movie.
