First of all, talking like no fan of the genre, "The Bourne Ultimatum" is a breathtaking, virtuoso, superb action movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it's a stupid evil of cartoon superhero stuff. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film brings a complex, important point about crime fighters turning into criminals themselves. No reference is made to Abu Ghraib or to the outrageous domestic assaults on the constitutional rights of the executive branch, none is necessary. <br /> <br /> So, the last of the "Bourne" series, in the hands of Paul Greengrass (of the 2004 "Bourne Supremacy" and last year "United 93"), is a significant result, perhaps held back but not actually diminished by the inevitable excesses of the genre. <br /> <br /> "Breathtaking" above is intended both as a complementary adjective and a description of physical sensation: for more than an hour from the first frame, the observer seems holding his breath, pushed back against the chair by strength of a relentless, all-round action on the globe and absolutely suspicious. There is neither compliance nor variation in the rhythm and strength of the film, yet it never becomes monotonous and boring like some similar music videos after only a couple of minutes. <br /> <br /> Oliver Wood's cinematography of your face is making the best of Tony Gilroy's script from Robert Ludlum's 1990 novel (which does not overlap with the "Bourne Identity", written a decade earlier). <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is once again the inevitable, irreplaceable Bourne, the deadliest of fantastic CIA agents, this time taking over the entire agency in search of his identity, his past and of the mysterious agency program that turned him into a killing machine. Nothing like his silent and heroic Edward R. Murrow, the ever-marvelous David Strathairn is the worst senior agency official, launched against Bourne in an attempt to hide some illegal "take-no-prisoner" policies and brutal procedures. <br /> <br /> Joan Allen plays what appears to be the good cop against Strathairn's villain. And, there's Julia Stiles while the agent once again comes to Bourne's aid; a combination of the direction of Greengrass and the acting of Stiles results in a surprising impact on the part of a predominantly silent character, his lack of communication and empty expression more intriguing than kilometers of dialogue. <br /> <br /> So good is "The Bourne Ultimatum" that moves away with the old one-man-against-the-world bite, this time extended to ridiculous excesses, since Bourne defies the constraints of geography, time, gravity ... and physics in general. (Can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building? Why not? It looks great.) <br /> <br /> All this magic of the "real world", jumping from one country to another in seconds , to arrive in some unknown place exactly as, when and how much necessary - overcomes the improbabilities of the comics of special effects and superheroes. Yet only a pedant without a track would allow the "facts" to interfere with the ecstasy based on the fun of Bourne's fantasy.
