Ok, first I hate to comment on this, but I felt like I had to support this movie. There were a lot of people who hit us and I felt that the people who wanted to see it should get a second opinion. <br /> <br /> First of all, Bend It Like Beckham doesn't want to be the deepest film of the century. If that's what you're looking for, go somewhere else. Just because it's an independent film doesn't mean it has to be artistic. You should make yourself feel good and you should enjoy watching it and those two things are easily accomplished. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the acting although not "Halle Berry in Monster's Ball" is still good. The film does not need to act so honestly, so don't look for it. It's a film for families. If that's what you wanted, you shouldn't or shouldn't even watch this movie honestly. <br /> <br /> Finally, it has a really nice story. I think it's well thought out and it's fun to watch. It's also very true for life largely for that culture, so if you want to sit and watch a movie you can have fun on and feel good about when you're done. If you're looking for something with deep story lines and big dramatic scenes, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> -Lyndsay
