Who said horror is not a kind of educational film, eh? Thanks to this wonderful Hammer short film, now at least I don't know EVER to offer a strange visitor a wine and a slice of bread with salt in my own house, because it could only be a hypnotist and this combination will give him the power to control my thoughts and mind forever! Thanks Hammer! The tenth episode of the House of Horror series is another one I couldn't wait to see, especially since the boy in the director's chair was Don Sharp; one of Britain's best directors, but still sadly undervalued. Sharp was responsible for some very interesting Hammer films, such as "Kiss of the Vampire" and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk", as well as some neglected independent productions such as "Dark Places" and "Psychomania". His contribution to House of Horror is easily one of the best in the series, with a complex but fascinating plot and turning to delightful occult themes. The plot focuses on two antique dealers who come across a strange mirror-like object, but in reality it is an ancient device that can be used to evoke Choronzhon; the demonic guardian of the abyss. The mirror is strongly desired by a satanic cult as they need it for their ceremonies, but Michael is reluctant to sell it before knowing the true value of the device. When he picks up a clearly petrified girl who is running away from the cult to avoid being sacrificed, Michael is even deeper in a covert conspiracy. Satanic cults and carnal sacrifice of young women are typical subjects of British horror, but David Fischer's script is never boring and offers many good plots, including a highly inventive climax. There is also so much tension to be admired, the dialogues are witty and the performances are splendid (especially John Carson as a cult leader is truly disturbing). Recommended!
