"Hitler: The Rise of Evil" was wrapped in controversy before it was broadcast, and that controversy could overshadow the making of the film. <br /> <br /> Those who have criticized the film, who had not seen it, have therefore made good intentions, based on the wrong thought that would be too nice for Hitler. However, they have misunderstood the point: humanizing evil Hitler is not sympathetic to him. It is much more disturbing to realize that the unspeakable acts committed by one of the greatest villains in history have been committed by a human being. A sick maniac, sick, of course, but still a human being. You need to know the story of how Hitler was able to reach power to prevent it from happening again. <br /> <br /> "Rise of Evil" is highlighted by a brilliant, best career performance by Robert Carlyle, which makes Hitler a human being without ever redeeming him in any way. Carlyle impeccably captures the appearance and mannerism of the Nazi leader, without ever letting the personification become cartoonist or distance us (something that Anthony Hopkins was unable to achieve when he portrayed Hitler in "The Bunker", a another great product for film television). While they have been repulsed by Hitler's depravity and virulent anti-Semitism, Carlyle gives him a certain magnetism and power that the real Adolf Hitler must possess. After all, while otherwise a nation would have followed him? <br /> <br /> Of the various subplots, by far the most convincing interpretations of Matthew Modine as reporter Fritz Gehrlich, who makes the work of his life draw attention to the reality of Hitler and Nazism. While Modine's performance is a little bit made up in Part 1, in Part 2 it seems to have settled in, the character gives us a real-life hero in a movie full of bad guys. Peter Stormare and Liev Schrieber also give strong support. <br /> <br /> The first part of this two-part mini-series suffered a bit from being overly discontinuous, including a glimpse of Hitler's childhood that lasts only the duration of the opening credits. And in the second part, the sections describing Hitler's relationship with his niece and her friend Eva Braun are less successful than the central plot, but serve to give us a further understanding of her mental and emotional state. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, no Hitler movie can make us understand. The average person is, fortunately, incapable of always understanding a man who would try to exterminate an entire race of people. "Hitler: The Rise of Evil" tries less to make us understand Hitler, and more to make us understand how power has become. It is an important story that must be told, and it is impossible to believe that anyone who has seen the film would accuse him of having nothing but the best intentions and the ability to do anything that is not good. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10. *** 1/2
