This film is about this absurd boy who decides to become a spy for a fascinating high-tech company called Digicorp. This absurd boy, Morgan (Jeremy Northam) is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his demanding wife, so he decides to become a spy. Suppose you go to the conventions of other high tech companies and discover all the plans of the companies. Instead, Morgan finds himself drawn to a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and practically dubbed by these two companies that force him to become a double agent. How will Morgan get out of this? Can you trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And more importantly, will Morgan survive? Wow! What an elegant movie! I was completely sucked in after 15 minutes of watching this movie. It's very suspenseful and you can feel Morgan's fear and confusion as he does his best to stay alive. The scene in which they put this horrible contraption on Morgan's head to brainwash is incredibly scary and terrifying. Morgan slowly goes through a transformation of the personality that is not so obvious until you think about it after the film is finished. From a lousy type with bad hair and glasses, he turns into a man who actively fights for his life. <br /> <br /> The ending, wow, the ending is incredible! The blow is so funny! It left me breathless and cheering like crazy! Good performances from everything, especially from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie!
