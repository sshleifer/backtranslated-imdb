I always have a bit of a distrust before watching the films of the British period because I usually find on them insipid and boring scripts (like those of, for example, Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl), but with a magnificent production design , European landscapes and those thick British accents that make cinema a suggestion of artistic value that they really don't have. Fortunately, the excellent film The Young Victoria does not fall into that situation, and deserves an enthusiastic recommendation for its fascinating story, the excellent performances of Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent, and the costumes and locations that make the film unexpectedly rich for the view. And I say "unexpectedly" because he usually doesn't pay too much attention to those details. <br /> <br /> "Victorian era" was (in my humble opinion) one of the key points of contemporary civilization, and not only on the social aspect, but also on the scientific, artistic and cultural ones. I didn't know much about the origins of that era, and perhaps for this reason I liked this simplification of the political and economic events that have prepared so much for the landing of the modern era. I also liked the way Queen Victoria is portrayed, which is like a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions have not always been good, but have at least been inspired by good intentions. I also found the representation of the love story between Victoria and Prince Albert very interesting because it is equally interested in the combination of intellects and emotions it evokes. The only flaw found in this film is that screenwriter Julian Fellowes used some romantic movie clichÃ©s about romance, something that seems a little out of place in his script. /> <br /> I really liked the Young Victoria, and it really surprised me a lot. I hope other period films follow the example of this film: the costumes and landscapes should work as support for an interesting story, and not as its replacement.
