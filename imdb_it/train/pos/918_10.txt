The image shows an act of courage performed by Noah's firefighter brother, Hank (William Russ), who mysteriously left the city 25 years ago and hasn't been seen since. Hank would happily return to the city without explanation or fanfare, but this turns out to be impossible when Noah's newspaper publishes a $ 50,000 reward to identify Hank, known only to the public as "John Christmas". And there is something, very, very curious about that photo: it also shows a Santa costume that seems to float in midair without an occupant. That elusive "Santa Claus" is obviously the angelic Max, who appears from time to time throughout history in a variety of aspects to solve problems, dispense advice, tie loose threads and even share a musical duet with Kathleen's talented daughter .
