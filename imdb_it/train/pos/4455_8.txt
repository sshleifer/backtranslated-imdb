Although I liked On the Town, I really liked it. I'm a newcomer when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Although I had heard of it, I had never seen anything with them until recently. The first one I saw was Singin in the Rain which made me a fan of Gene. I think it's even better. But I thought this movie was good and like all movies there are some parts that are better than others but in my book it's a fantastic movie and I love it. Frank and Gene make a good team. I still have to see them together Take me out for the Ballgame. But I'm sticking to my guns saying that I loved it, and I love it!
