Paul Reiser turns away from the comedy spotlight to write a humorous and gently tender story about the family: what we see and what we don't see, what we expect and what surprises us. THE THING OF MY FOLKS does not set new standards for the film, but it is a beautiful story well told that reminds us of the significant bonds that the family represents. <br /> <br /> Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been a workaholic, sometimes pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan), and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) in the background. One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving! His daughters, along with Ben Rachel's wife (Elizabeth Perkins), immediately start searching for his position, leaving Sam's confused and wounded and displeased to fix things during a car trip with his son Ben. The road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they mean by their status as father and son and as family members. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now Ben workaholic to the pleasures and enjoyment of life. The journey ends with a phone call about the fate of Muriel and the reason why she left and the grouping of the wisest family draws the final warmth of the story. Everything is not what it seemed: it is better and, well, different. <br /> <br /> Falk and Reiser play each other like the pros are, but in many respects the film belongs to the brief moments in which Olympia Dukakis is on screen, reminding us that it is one of our strongest marriages on cinema. Worth seeing. Grady Harp
