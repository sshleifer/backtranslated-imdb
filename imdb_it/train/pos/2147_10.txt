I lived in Tokyo for 7 months. Knowing the reality of long train journeys, bike rides from the train station, soup stands, and other typical scenes painted so well, certainly added to my appreciation for this film that I really enjoyed a lot. There are aspects of Japanese life in this film painted in vivid colors, but you don't have to speak Japanese to enjoy this movie. His director's tricks were subtle for the most part; I found his staging of the character called Tamako Tamura with a soft filter, which made it sublime, a little forced but most of the director's tricks were so kind that I was completely pulled in and danced only with his characters. Or crying. Or laughed out loud. Wonderful. A +.
