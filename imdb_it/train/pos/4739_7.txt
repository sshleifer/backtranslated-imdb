Excellent martial arts film and Jet Li is the best from master Bruce Lee. He is excellent as a low profile librarian / cop who saves more and more. He has a compelling and credible presence and gaze as the king of kung fu with whom one does not mess around. Fratelloise Yip is simply beautiful in that original mixed-race way that is unique because of its mixed heritage, it has an innocence and charm all at the same time that I found unforgettable. The bad guy, the man with the sunglasses and the long hair was very good, but I can't find his name in the credits, can anyone help me with that? Thank you ! Enjoy Hak hap or Black Mask, in any language it is good entertainment!
