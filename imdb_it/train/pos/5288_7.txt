This fun Bugs Bunny cartoon sees the return of Marvin the Martian still unnamed and his companion K-9 the green dog. <br /> <br /> This time, instead of trying to destroy the Earth, Marvin is on a mission to land, capture a terrestrial creature and bring it back to Mars. Obviously the creature he chooses is Bugs Bunny. At first Bugs thinks that Marvin and K-9 are tricks or treats, but he realizes that it can't be right when Marvin drastically enlarges Bug's rabbit hole with a ray gun. Bugs tries to make his way into the situation in two ways, including persuading Marvin that K-9 is planning a mutiny. He is finally captured using an Acme straitjacket ejection bazooka. Surprisingly, for an Acme product, it works as advertised and Bug's is forced to use its wits to get K-9 to release it, the tables are soon transformed and the two disgruntled Martians are tied and Bugs is trying to fly their flying saucer to Land. <br /> <br /> I liked it a lot, even if the ending is a bit weak compared to the rest of the story. Marvin's voice changed slightly here and becomes emotional when he's angry, but that didn't make me love him or the cartoon.
