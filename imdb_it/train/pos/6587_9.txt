The Master Blackmailer, based on the short story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton", is the first feature film on the story of Sherlock Holmes with Jeremy Brett that I saw. The story is interesting and obscure. The film looks a bit depressing and sad, but it's pretty funny (with some particularly funny scenes). <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson try to discover the identity of an illusory blackmailer who has ruined some of England's most important families by publishing private letters that, one way or the other other, they will destroy their lives. Eventually they discover that it is Charles Augustus Milverton, an "art dealer", after the few tragic consequences for victims who could not pay. Our heroes must then help Lady Eva Blackwell, who must pay a sum that is above her possibilities, otherwise her next marriage will surely be canceled. The scene where Holmes and Watson wrecked Milverton's house are intense. Although the film has a substantially happy ending, the tone is sad and sorry. <br /> <br /> The exceptional performance of Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual), and Robert Hardy as the infamous villain (most of the public probably recognizes him today as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter), Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson as Agatha (the scenes involving her and Holmes are a riot). I give him a *** 1/2 out *****. My only complaint is that there was not enough Lestrade inspector. (I wish they had added to the scene at the end of the story in which he gives the description of the two thieves, one of which corresponds to Watson.)
