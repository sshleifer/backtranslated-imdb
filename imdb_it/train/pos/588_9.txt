I saw all the films directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his love for the American people and the land. In A River Runs Through It, Redford shows the lyrical romanticism and visual splendor of the high Montana Rockies as if it were a 19th century landscape painter by Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love with the visual and the word with the text of the author Norman Maclean, and the extraordinary photographic works of Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot). <br /> <br /> The cast of Redford is perfect. Tom Skerritt is the reverend MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing and the Bible, Brenda Blythen, mother and her children, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems that everyone faces growing up teenage children, and later, complex young people. Both Schaffer and Pitt are absolutely credible as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will bind them forever. It is the relationships between men, father and children, the brothers and their women towards the outside world that establishes A River Runs Through It in a vein of narration that is missing in so many Hollywood films produced in recent years. <br /> <br /> What makes these relationships special, however, is the attention that Redford addresses to the language as spoken in the dialogue. This is a literal script, beautiful to listen to and unforgettable when combined with the wonderful rivers and mountains of Montana. The words and settings are the same as the performance of a cast that rises to their material. While the idea of ​​fly fishing may seem a strange tool to center a story, it is not so implausible in the hands of the Redford director. Given the material, Redford's ode is simpler and life is worth revisiting again and again.
