From the excellent acting of an extremely impressive cast, to the intelligently (and very quotable) script, from the sumptuous cinematography to the splendid Carter Burwell soundtrack, Rob Roy offers a rarity in film experiences: one that is almost impossible to find fault in any area. <br /> <br /> There have been several comparisons made with Braveheart, which came out the same year. With all the due merit of Mel Gibson, Braveheart struck me as an epic of self-awareness and preaching to rival Rob Roy as the kind of film I'd like to see more than once. While Braveheart works hard to be a serious epic, Rob Roy grabs you and absorbs you into his tightly written story. No single scene is wasted. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy contains the perfect balance between dramatic tension, action and even occasional humor. The characters are well-cut, perfectly conveying vernaculars and mannerisms that anchor them in their authentic setting. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, they are not caricatures of good and evil as we often too observe in modern films. <br /> <br /> For example, while we hope that the heroic Rob Roy prevails, we realize that his difficulties are the product of his pride and his sense of honor. Tim Roth plays one of the most heinous villains in the history of cinema, yet there are times when we can understand how the events of his life have turned him into what he is. Rob Roy employs a level of character development that makes his story even more believable and compelling. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy is a delightful treasure, with one of the greatest sword fights ever choreographed and a climatic final worthy of all waiting tense.
