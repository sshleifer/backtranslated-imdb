Despite the wonderful and breathtaking animation, this is probably one of the most exciting Disney movies I've ever seen, and I don't slam Disney movies very often. Spirit is a wild stallion that is repeatedly captured, both by the cavalry and by the Indians, who try to "break it". The spirit ends up forming a bond with the Indian and this, in a nutshell, is history. With the exception of the beautiful horse animation, neither I nor my five years have been very inspired or excited by this film. It is ironic that it is titled "Spirit", since spirit is what this film could have used a little more. An extra point was given for the soundtrack, which was pleasant, with the songs of Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And even if this movie is classified G, you will probably have to finish by explaining what it means to "break a horse" for your five-year-old. I did it. <br /> <br />
