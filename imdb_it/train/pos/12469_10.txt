It's a great movie. it seems that some people think that this may not be based on a true story. No matter this, the film is fantastic, and all you can think of is not because a balloon with a siren ends up flying into the city of mermaids and so on, thinking instead that "a girl's wish has come true" , and this means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in ourselves and do everything in this world to make them true. The girl (Desi - in the film) and her mother were the best actors I had seen in a long time. Good for them, for all the actors, all for the director. If anyone can tell you, please tell them: "A 25-year-old boy from Romania says thank you for making this film."
