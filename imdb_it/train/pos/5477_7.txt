An uncensored original print of this fantastic film was discovered in the Library of Congress in 2004 and was exhibited in some specialized theaters around the world in 2005. According to the current reviews I found online, the original has all the dialogue and intact worst intact; later they were removed or completely taken back by the study before the initial release, in order to pass the censorship of the state of New York. I also read that a DVD is "expected in 2006" and one can only hope! If we are really lucky, it will include comparisons between the 2 versions. Note that the censored version released was originally available on Laserdisc, which I saw. Stanwyck rules!
