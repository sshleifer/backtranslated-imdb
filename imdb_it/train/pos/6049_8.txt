Freebird is the perfect combination of traveling comedy, gang caper, "stoner" film and good English cinema. <br /> <br /> They are the brilliant protagonists who distinguish this film from other films of this genre. Stars Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have great chemistry and make their characters extremely funny and realistic. The main story revolves around their journey from London to Wales, and the adventures and mishaps that occur along the way. Even this little film has a big heart - it's not just for bicycle lovers, because it is based on the relationships of the character between them, including dreams and regrets, like Gary Stretch's Fred who wants the family he left. Cinematography is also exceptional - a love letter to the Welsh campaign, as well as capturing the grit of London streets and typical pub life in Welsh towns. <br /> <br /> Elegant, elegant, fantastic soundtrack, cute characters and fun storyline - I would recommend Freebird in the blink of an eye!
