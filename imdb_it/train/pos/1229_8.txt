I waited years before seeing this as all the reviews I read of this said it was horrible! I rented it expecting the worst, and although it's not the best sandler movie out there, it's worse! Sandler often talks to the camera and the film doesn't take itself seriously, but it's all part of the fun! A great way to waste an afternoon, and you might even find yourself laughing once twice! A good movie, worth renting!
