After the success of the second episode, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder would have a third appearance. This time instead of the Tudor or Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson) lives at the time of the French revolution. Accompanied by the stupid but amiable Baldrick (Tony Robinson), Blackadder is the "faithful" butler of George, the ruling prince of Wales (Hugh Laurie). In this third series, the wonderfully written sitcom, Blackadder, looks for everything it can to become rich and powerful. Try to elect a gentleman for a rotten village, try to sell a book, try to win a bet on The Scarlet Pimpernel, try to be a man on the motorway and finally propose himself as a Prince. This is a very good bet for the popular comedy. Includes appearances by Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. He won the BAFTA for best comedy series and was nominated for best design and best makeup. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 of the 50 Greatest British Actors, was number 24 of the Comedian comedian, and was number 8 of Britain's favorite comedian, Edmund Blackadder was number 3 of the 100 Greatest TV Characters, and was number 3 in The most comic characters in the world and Blackadder (all four series) was number 2 of the best British sitcom. Awesome!
