If you like comic comics for adults, like South Park, then this is almost a similar format on the little adventures of three teenage girls at Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina gave explosive sweets and behaved like bitches, I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also small stories going on with school teachers. There is the idiot headmaster, Mr. Bip, the nervous math teacher and many others. The cast is also fantastic, Gina Yashere of Lenny Henry, Chrissie Watts of EastEnders, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Doon Mackichan of Smack The Pony, Mark Perry of Dead Ringers and Nina Conti of Blunder. I didn't know it came from Canada, but it's very good. Very good!
