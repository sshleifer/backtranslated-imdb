I have seen almost all the Gundam / Mech anime that have shown in the United States and this by far has the best story. The way his twists turned out. Gundam Wing is a series that focuses primarily on politics and war. The series follows a group of five 15-year-olds who have been trained to pilot state-of-the-art mobile suits known as Gundams. Gundam pilots were trained to fight a powerful insurgency known as Oz. As things start to warm up among the pilots of OZ and Gundam, new political groups will be formed and the old ones will dissipate. Old conflicts will end and new ones will arise. To achieve peace the Gundam pilots have to deal with the events taking place in their world and put an end to all the fighting. But how far people are willing to go to get their goal. I recommend this anime to anyone looking for a show that has a deep storyline.
