I just saw Murder in the vanities in the newly released Universal Pre-Code set, and I was amazed at how much I liked the end-to-end vehicle. Most other commentators covered the story, a mysterious murder in a musical, but I wanted to add some additional notes. Brisson and Carlisle are relatively insignificant, compared to most minor players, and no one seems to have the right voice for what they are singing (Carlisle is a well-trained opera singer, Brisson a bit shaky on some of his highs and notes low). The great Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie play well with each other, with an excellent sense of time that keeps the ball between the musical numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are Vanities girls, but let's not forget the beautiful jazz singer Ernestine Anderson in the "Ebony Rhapsody" issue. Gail Patrick makes one of his first appearances, playing a bit like Eve Arden; Patrick would become the executive producer of Perry Mason's TV series. Then there's Jessie Ralph as a wardrobe lover - you'll also see her in David COPPERFIELD (as Aunt Peggoty) and THE BANK DICK. The music is very good - Brisson introduces the standard "Cocktails for Two" in two different scenes; "Sweet Marihuana" with the girls with peyote buttons just paraded in the background (the blood dripping on the white skin of a chorister was wonderfully chilling); the "Ebony Rhapsody", with the Orchestra of Duke Ellington and a swarm of beautiful dancers, both in black and white, that mix it. And I think this is one of the first musicals to present such a mix - and the costumes leave nothing to the imagination.
