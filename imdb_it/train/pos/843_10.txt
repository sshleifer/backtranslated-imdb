Not to mention Pierce Brosnon's best performance. Of course Greg Kinnear is always magnificent. Really, when was it really bad? I think this film is incredibly undervalued! The use of colors in this film is something very different in today's world of cinema where every other film has a blue Payback filter. I also like the way they used the song from Asia. Proving that even what was once considered a type of cheese can be really beautifully positioned correctly. <br /> <br /> I was making my first feature film when it came out. Since my film was a hit movie, I had to take a look at the whole genre that was released. After seeing it, I'm sure it had some effect on me through the process. It was great when my film came out with the IMDb that would recommend this movie if you liked mine. As everyone else relates I have no idea, making it a more interesting coincidence. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
