I meant in a good way, believe me. True to life, it is not. The whole Oirish thing gets pretty thick, but you enjoy the cast here: Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, etc. Everything good. I also enjoyed seeing Mike Mazurki, of course he played a boxer, what else? A typical 1940s film that is teeming with familiar faces and frenetic scenes, one after the other. <br /> <br /> Flynn is perfect as a Gentleman Jim, you can never get past a three-dimensional look at him or the rest here, I suppose, but that's okay, it's a cartoon and it's meant to satisfy, that's all. The boxing scenes were pretty good, the recording of Ward Bond's vaudeville was in revolt, and you wanted to see all those billy club pastimes enter the scene a couple of times. <br /> <br /> Really fun, Flynn was on a roll at the time and it's clear to see why the public loved him. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
