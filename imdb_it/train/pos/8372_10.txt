What a masterpiece. Take the Cold War conflict and transport it to the future. This film is satire of the highest level. In my humble opinion, he surpasses Dr. Strangelove. <br /> <br /> The intelligent name of the two superpowers, such as the Confederation and the Market. Against being committed and market, the west! awesome. The intelligent use of gen Joxs was ahead of its time. we are only really seeing the dangers of genetic engineering. The jox robots have addressed the issue in 1989. <br /> <br /> The message of this film is about the camaraderie of the humble man and how to overcome the desires of the government. This movie shouts DO NOT MAKE YOU WISH YOU YOU BURN EVERYONE. <br /> <br /> EXCELLENT 10/10
