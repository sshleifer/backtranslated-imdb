Keep in mind, any film (not to mention documentaries) that asserts any kind of truth, will generate an adverse and proportional amount of cynicism, from those to whom any suggestion and / or search for truth is already meaningless, those of you who are already Masters of psychology, movies and captains of the soul, no doubt they will find this film redundant, after all, you already know everything there is to know. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> For those of us in the minority like me, I found "The Perverts Guide To Cinmea" .... mostly brilliant, and worth watching for those interested in film, psychology and philosophy modern. <br /> <br /> A bit like "Understanding Comics" by Scott Mclouds, director Sophie Fiennes, plays the Slovenian philosopher, psychologist and social critic Slavoj Zizek in many of the films and specific scenes that he discusses. The cover is an image of "The Birds" (Zizek takes a boat to recreate the shot). <br /> <br /> Lacanian psychoanalysis, not necessarily screams, an evening of great fun ... but it is! If you like movies that are .... Having some knowledge of Lacanian psychoanalytic analysis helps (Symbolic, Real and Imaginary) are terms that are thrown a little roughly at the beginning, but the scenes that Zizek selects and analyzes make extraordinarily clear what was always for me, a very abstract subject. In fact, it's probably better to be familiar with the films he talks about than with the terminology he uses, which becomes clearer as the film goes on. <br /> <br /> Because I love, this film is not because it collects great films to be analyzed or reveals great truths about Lacan, but shows in a very practical and intelligent way, where film and psychology (and predefined philosophy) meet. <br /> <br /> Because "The Sound Of Music" is a bit fascist, because "Short Cuts" talks about something more than just class and alienation, because birds attack in "The Birds", what's there to learn on the mind from "Alien Resurrection", what does the planet of "Solaris" do? I want, what does "Psycho" and "The Marx Brothers" have to do with it, and what the hell is David Lynch filming in film after movie ... well, Zizek has some ideas. <br /> <br /> The role of the voice in "The Excorcist" and "Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith", is perhaps the film's strongest and most lucid moment, when subjectivity comes into the feminine I start to wonder. .. at one point Zizek admits his feeling that flowers are a kind of decorative vaginal dentin, which are disgusting and should be hidden from children (joking, it seems but ...). <br /> <br /> However, it is a fascinating documentary, that anyone who has ever seen a film, and thought it meant something more than what has been said, should make an attempt to see. <br /> <br /> And anyone interested in Slavoj Zizek, this is a must, much less dry than "Reality Of The Virtual", and more direct than "Zizek!", Two more pseudo-documents, on "l 'Elvis of contemporary cultural criticism', as he is nicknamed, in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> "The Perverts Guide To Cinema" does NOT talk about the role of sex in cinema. Zizek claims that cinema is the perverted art par excellence, because it teaches "how to desire, not what to desire", and that it is the only form of contemporary art that can allow these desires to be articulated. This is not a film about the search for reality in cinema, it is about finding cinema in reality, and how important and exciting it can be. Hard to find, and a little long, but it's worth it, one of the most "inspiring" movies I've ever seen.
