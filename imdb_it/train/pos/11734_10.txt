This must be one of my favorite movies, unlike the weak "Elvira's Haunted Hills" ... anyway I like the way the film is a goth / com story of "Wizard of Oz" ... <br / > <br /> Elvira is a goth Dorothy who is stuck in an unknown city after the death of a good witch (elviras Zia Morgana) ... inherits a "Ruby" ring that is extremely powerful and sought after by the Bad Warlock (her uncle ). .. He befriends four characters who inadvertently help grow during the film all the time with a dog in tow. There is a show with his uncle (the wicked witch of the West) in which Elvira realizes she has the strength inside herself and ends up defeating him. Eventually she is expelled by the people of the city after conquering their hearts and finally arrives at their destination in Las Vegas (Dorothy's home in Kansas). <br /> <br /> There are many references made to the wizard of oz throughout the film ... she and her uncle both mention the relevant lines for their parallel characters. Elvira: "You must be Aunt Em, and you must be Uncle Remus ... There's no place like home, there's no place like home!" Bad uncle Vinny: "I'll get you my beauty, and your little dog too!" <br /> <br /> There is a sign that Elvira passes for the first time during her journey that mentions the state of Kansas. <Br /> <br /> But apart from that, the fact that one of the sequences that "ripped off, um ... I mean was inspired by FlashDance" is pure genius ... and if you don't turn around to laugh at her chick who twirls at the end of her show "Las Vegas of the 80s", then you don't have a field bone in your body ... This movie is a Cult / Camp Classic
