I saw this film as if it were the second function of a disc containing the previously banned Video Nasty 'Blood Rites'. Since Blood Rites was totally horrible, I didn't expect much from this movie; but in reality, it would seem that the garbage director Andy Milligan has surpassed himself this time as Seeds of Sin on top of the Blood Rites with style and stands as a more than adequate slice of sick sixties sex plow. The plot is actually quite similar to Blood Rites, since we focus on a dysfunctional family unit and, of course; there is a legacy at stake. The film is shot in black and white and the graphic aspect of this film reminded me a lot of the classic garbage "The Curious Dr Humpp". There is little blood on display, and the director seems more careful to focus on sex, with the themes of incest and hatred filtering. The acting is typically trash, but most women come to appear naked at some point and despite a bad reputation, director Andy Milligan really does seem to have an eye for this kind of thing, since many of the sequences in this movie are actually quite beautiful. The plot is very thin and most of the film is full; but the music is captivating, and the director also does a surprisingly good job with sex scenes, since most are a bit erotic. Overall, this is not a great film; but it is likely that the cult fan likes it and gets a much higher recommendation than the better known and lower quality "Blood Rites".
