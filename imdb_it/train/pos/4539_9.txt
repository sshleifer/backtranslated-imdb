Acting is pretty fun, but for people in this area in the 1980s and now they are automotive engineers in the Detroit area, this is a great movie. I even worked with a Japanese supplier to make this movie even more fun. <br /> <br /> Jay Leno was showing his age last night at The Tonight Show! He looks very young here ... 17 years ago. The opening scene, with the endurance race on what appears to be Woodward Ave, was great. <br /> <br /> Even Leno has some bad cars **, it would be nice to see a remake of this with his modern collection. I'm sure the Vette jumped into the opening scene was his car. <br /> <br /> The typical movie of the 80s. Watch it and have fun. No computer-generated crap!
