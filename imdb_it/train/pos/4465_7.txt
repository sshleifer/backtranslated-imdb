ANCHORS AWEIGH is a fun MGM musical that fans of the genre will appreciate but wouldn't rate with classics like SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON. This was the first of three musicals that Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared together. Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two sailors on leave in Hollywood who make friends with a young boy (Dean Stockwell) who introduces them to his attractive aunt (Kathryn Grayson) an actress who is struggling and who works as a clerk MGM. Although both types are initially attracted to Grayson, he eventually expresses a preference for Joe but Clarence later locks himself with a waitress (Pamela Britton) who, he learns, comes from his hometown of Brooklyn. The very thin plot leaves room for several large musical numbers including "Odiamo lascia", the lament of Joe and Clarence to their fellow sailors while they are leaving the ship; The torrid version of Grayson of "Jalousie"; Sinatra's dreamy interpretation of "I Fall in Love Too Easily" (a number that is sadly erased from some prints of this film) and "The Worry Song", a fantasy dance that Kelly does with Tom's animated Jerry the Mouse and Jerry. . Kelly also does some sort of fantasy ballet Kissing Bandit that rivals his Pirate's Ballet in the next THE PIRATE. Kelly is in great shape here, in a robust and energetic performance that earned him his only Oscar nomination for best actor and Sinatra's catchy character here is undeniably sexy. A fun diversion for fans of the MGM music factory.
