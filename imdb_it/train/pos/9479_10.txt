Tian's remake is not good at all. I only click on his remake documentary to see Wei Wei, the original actress in the classic 1948 movie says a few words to the crew. This Sunday we will meet Wei Wei (28/3/2010) after the screening of Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun in the Hong Kong Film Archiev. Wei Wei is almost 90 years old in silver hair, his cameo appearance in Hong Kong movies is always a surprise for his fans. In this year's Hong Kong Film Festival, a special program is dedicated to Fei Mu, the director of this epic film and the Wei Wei photos taken from the film were shot in Hong Kong. My son, who turns 21 this year, is surprised that Wei Wei was so beautiful then.
