BSG is one of my favorite TV series of all time. I was lucky enough to start watching it while the series was in its last season. It was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible race! <br /> <br /> As soon as I noticed the pilot on Hulu, I knew exactly what awaited me with the title: Caprica! Although some things do not add up when comparing both series, it is still beautifully executed. There were no mentions on the holobands in Battlestar Galactica or on the mention of virtual worlds, but perhaps I didn't get enough in the series to explain why. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe, technology and alternative fantasies of our world. This show is very interesting and you would like to see more!
