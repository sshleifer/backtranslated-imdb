This documentary was very thorough and informative, and at the same time funny, which I considered quite impressive. I felt like they did a great job covering the sport from its origin to the present day, but nevertheless, there is a reason why I didn't give such a high score to this film ... <br /> <br / > I felt like sometimes the story focused too much on the "proper names" of the sport, so to speak: too much on the single places to navigate, and above all too much on the individual navigators. I had the feeling that the documentary had more to do with the nature of sport, the ideology of sport, etc. It would have been better (although it was obviously covered, I don't think he had the time he needed). <br /> <br /> And for many people who are not absolutely keen on surfing, sometimes hearing them go on and on specific places and specific surfers could get boring. Although the video clips and in-depth research are well respected, it could have been presented in a way that would have been better for those who are not avid surfers. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, my biggest disappointment has been times they have talked about how incredibly and miraculously certain events in the history of surfing still didn't have the actual footage of these events taking place, and all the while you are waiting to see on the silver screen this incredible breathtaking event that these men are talking about life-changing moments, and in the end all you get is that many men talk about it, and not the real movie. It was too tempting for me to hear these stories and then not be able to see them. I understand the difficulty of getting footage of everything, but please: don't brag about an event so much, and then don't show it. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very cool documentary that I enjoyed watching; it is not the best documentary because of the reasons explained above, but being very cool and with an extremely exciting movie and a good soundtrack, it is a documentary that I would advise everyone to take a look at.
