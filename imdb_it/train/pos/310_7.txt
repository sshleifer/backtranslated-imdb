Dramatic license - some hate it, even if it is necessary to tell any life story. In the case of "Lucy", the main points of Lucille Ball's teenage years, early career and 20-year marriage with Desi Arnaz are all included, albeit in a truncated and reworked way. <br /> <br /> The main emotional points of Lucy's life are clarified: Lucille's struggle to find her niche as an actress, finally blossomed into the brilliant comedian who made the character Lucy Ricardo a legend; his turbulent, romantic and ultimately impossible marriage with Desi Arnaz; Lucy & Desi create the first television empire and ensure their place in history forever as the most memorable pair of TV sitcoms. <br /> <br /> Like Lucille Ball, Rachel York does a commendable job. Don't expect to see the same miraculous transformation of what Judy Davis did as Judy Garland, but York makes Ball very strong, but nice, and it's very funny in itself. Even if his comic timing is different from Lucy's, it's still credible. The film never goes into the details of his perfectionist behavior on the set and his abuse of Vivian Vance during the early years of "I Love Lucy", but watching York portray Lucy while rehearsing in private is a nice inclusion. <br /> <br /> Daniel Pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real Desi, but he has his charm and does a mostly decent job with the Desi accent, especially in the opening scene. Madeline Zima was decent, if not overly memorable, like Lucy. <br /> <br /> Vivian Vance and William Frawley were not present very much, fortunately, since Rebecca Hobbs and Russell Newman were not very convincing in the roles. Not that they are not good actors in their own right, they simply weren't suited to the people they were playing. Most of the actors were from Austrailia and New Zealand, and the repressed accents are sometimes detectable. <br /> <br /> Although the main structure of the film follows the historical fact, there are many deviations, some for apparently inexplicable reasons. Jess Oppenheimer, chief screenwriter of Lucy's radio program "My Favorite Husband" started in 1948, is depicted in this film as coming to the scene to help with "I Love Lucy" in 1951, completely ignoring the fact that he was the main Creator! This film also portrays Marc Daniels as the main director of "I Love Lucy" throughout his run, completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by William Asher after the first season! Moreover, even if I imagine that this is due to budget constraints, the Ricardo have shown that they live in the same apartment throughout their stay in New York, when in fact they changed apartments in 1953. The kitchen set is slightly larger and out of scale from the original as well. The Connecticut home looks very close to the original, except that the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured. <br /> <br /> There is also Desi talking about buying RKO in 1953, during Lucy's accident, even though RKO did not reach the market until 1957. These changes may have been for dramatic license, and Does the film work to convey the main facts, but would it hurt them to show a little more respect to Oppenheimer and Asher, two vital figures in the story of "I Love Lucy"? The biggest gaff arrives in the recreation scenes "I Love Lucy", at least some of them. It is always risky to recreate something that is captured in the film and has been seen by billions of people, but even more when OBVARY CHANGES are made. The scene with the gigantic loaf of bread was truncated and anyone who was ever familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences immediately! The "We're Having Baby" number has also been shortened, but apart from that, it's pretty much dead. By far the best was the "trampling of grapes" scene, with Rachel York who really nailed Lucy's mannerisms. The producers have made the wise decision not to try to directly recreate the "Vitametavegamin" and candy pieces, showing instead the actors who try them. These scenes proved to be effective due to this approach. <br /> <br /> The main flaw of the film is that it makes the viewers believe that they already know a lot about Lucy's life, since most of it is browsed or omitted altogether. Overall, however, it offers a decent portrayal of Lucy & Desi's marriage, and factual errors can be overlooked when character development works effectively.
