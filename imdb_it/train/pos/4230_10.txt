For Columbo fans like me, this is the episode of the episodes that motivated why Columbo was so popular and how beautiful it really was. Ruth Gordon has a field day (as always) that plays the astute mystery writer Abigail Mitchell. It seems that Abigail asks her nephew to sign some documents that make him his heir. She never passed the death of her niece, and is convinced that the husband of her dead niece (Charles Frank) did the dirty deed. To say another would be unthinkable. Mariette Hartley has a sly role as Abigail's personal assistant. This episode of Columbo is in a class by itself. It's a really well done TV movie. I highly recommend it.
