From a modern sensibility, it is sometimes difficult to watch older films. It's annoying to have to see the stereotypical wallflower librarian who has to take off his glasses and become cute and stupid to win a man. Above all a man so superficial and inconstant. He is obviously a player (I wouldn't trust him to stay true to her) who doesn't want to settle down, who looks only at stupid and attractive women and always calls them "baby" (ick!). Even after totally changing his appearance and his life for him, he goes to her only after he is (apparently) rejected by another woman and discovers that Connie spent all his money to renovate a boat for him. I wanted her to support him, not chasing him pathetically! His sudden conversion in a few minutes was totally unrealistic and didn't work for me. Apart from that subplot, I liked the movie. How can you not love sailors who dance to one another ?! (It can be said that they came from San Francisco ....; D) The "rehearsal" dance was great, watching Ginger Rogers fall and fall voluntarily from the "correct steps" was great. The last dance scene "Face the Music" with beautiful costumes and art deco set was beautiful. And I really liked "We Saw the Sea" (although they used it a little too many times, as if they realized it was their best song). <br /> <br /> However, the plot was a bit weak, like most musicals (IMO) - and the songs were OK, but the film was worth watching for the movie. I wish they could have shown some shots of San Francisco as that was the film was supposedly set. <br /> <br /> It is also strange to see such a carefree naval film with the awareness of what Hitler was already doing at that time. I must try to suspend all knowledge to immerse myself in a fictional fantasy land.
