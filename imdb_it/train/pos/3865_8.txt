"Stories of the Century" was a half-hour series and appeared in first-run syndication during the '54 -'55 television season. It was also the first Western TV series to win an Emmy award. Played by veteran western actor Jim Davis as train detective Matt Clark, the series gave its name to Clark and his fellow rail detective (Mary Castle as Frankie Adams for the first half of the season and Kristine Miller as Jonesy in the second half). outlaws of various periods ranging from the mid-1860s to the early 1900s. The series was very satisfying, easy to look at and quite realistic, especially thanks to Jim Davis's casual charm in the lead role. He looked like a real Western character. Another note When Matt Clark arrived in the city after a long ride, it actually looked like he had been on a long horseback ride because he would have been covered in dust. <br /> <br /> A great adult western.
