when i started watching them it became one of my favorite shows. Melissa Joan Hart is very funny and talented, as well as the aunts and other characters and the star of the show Salem the cat, it was immensely fun. the first seasons in my opinion were the best in which Sabrina was a teenager in high school adapting herself to the life of witches. they were the funniest, the funniest and most um ... good. I'm not a fan of when they started introducing Brad and Dreamer because I really liked Valerie, but they agreed that the problem was that they were only for a season. if you have new people at least keep them. I didn't like that Josh was a tw * t, I preferred Harvey but then he disappeared. and got rid of Libby! it would have been great if you had fought over these seven years. and even Mr. craft, if he and Zelda got married it would have been gold! then Sabrina leaves her aunts' house and Roxie / Miles / Morgan. they didn't like people either, they didn't seem to like Sabrina. Sabrina seemed to lose her charm and things and aunts seem to have been avoided by her life and inside are her own stupid plots. in a sense I stopped watching it for a while and the old reps were back and I was like a whoo-hoo! LOL. I must say that the last few seasons have been absolutely terrible. They got rid of the aunts they sucked because they were an important part of the show. then suddenly let those two freeloaders move into the beautiful house when they treated him like dirt. and now he is working in some magazine shops, so they are putting on the show many celebrity guests, if they are in every episode they ruin it. the program simply went downhill and lost its luster. I saw the last episode. he had aunts (Zelda was reduced to a candle) and is about to marry but runs off with Harvey at the end. I would have liked to know what happened next. This is my review and the only thing I can say is that the only thing that has remained its charm in the seven years has been Salem the cat.
