There was an elegant approach to this film by director Vincenzo Natali with interesting shots and effective close-ups. It was also a pleasure to see Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu take on leading roles and expand their range of performers. This film also included one of the most imaginative "escape" scenes in recent years. The efforts of the director and the actors have come together in an effective thriller. <br /> <br /> Although the plot of the film was twisted, the story progressed very clearly when the layers of greed and corporate stratagem were revealed. <Br /> <br /> In 1949, George Orwell suggested in his famous novel "1984" that the future would be governed by the totalitarian state, which would control the minds and diminish human freedom. It was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film it was not the state, but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker.
