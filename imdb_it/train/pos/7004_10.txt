Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time. I don't know how he does it. I read the books constantly but if there is a movie with Will Smith I will watch it. He has a rare gift of pulling you into the movie and keeping you there. This film is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I watched it on Saturday and I still can't get it out of my head. INCREDIBLE and sad at the same time. Thanks again, Will. You have to watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the film. You can't lose anything. Make sure you have plenty of Kleenex and your man / woman sitting next to you so you can cuddle. GOOD It deserves the money you will pay to watch it .. don't wait for it to come on TV.
