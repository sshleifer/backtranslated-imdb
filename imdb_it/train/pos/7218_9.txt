Deathtrap works like a comedy in a movie about who did what to whom, since it takes place mainly on a set. The premise is that a skilled playwright, whose star is falling, receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student and then plans to abandon his protege and appropriate his game, to his wife's (strong) protests. Or so you think, for the first half of the film. After passing the sign in half, Deathtrap begins to throw twists and surprises that turn his premise on his head, then to the right, and then into a crazy turn, all the while keeping the appropriate title. It is an excellent mystery film full of wit. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine, as a senior playwright, plays himself in this film - a rather crazy and very dramatic Englishman. No surprise here - does his usual good job. Gets the best Deathtrap line, which performs perfectly: "What is your definition of success, being hit by a gangster in a state penitentiary?" <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve, on the other hand, juggles comic and dramatic in a surprisingly strong performance playing the ambitious young (and psychopathic) playwright. He also has the chance to show his very toned body, which he must have held back from the Superman movies. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve have collaborated on another film that is one of my favorite comedies: Noises Off. Likewise, it revolves around a play, even though this time Caine is the director and Reeve is an actor. They are joined by veteran comics Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together they show the calamities that happen to the cast and crew of a comedy. On the surface, the film seems to be mostly slapstick, but by observing you realize that there are many subtle jokes that require more than a vision to capture. I wish this underrated film was available on DVD.
