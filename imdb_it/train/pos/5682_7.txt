No, this is not a fairy tale of Alice, my friends! This "Wonderland" fable is based on the true story of the gruesome Wonderland murders that occurred in California in the 1980s. At the heart of this bloodbath is none other than "Johnny Wad" himself. Yes, John Holmes! Daddy ding-dong used other shotguns in addition to his infamous 13-inch milk machine. In addition to being a legendary adult actor, Holmes was also a hardcore addict who made friends with various Hollywood addicts. Val Kilmer was sometimes as majestic as Holmes, but for once this character of Holmes did not chew him completely. The film has a "who's who" of supportive players: Josh Lucas and Dylan Mcdermott as Hollywood, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow as women in Holmes' life, and Eric Bogosian as a threatening Tinsletown entrepreneur. These characters interpret integral parts, directly or indirectly, in the murders of "Wonderland". Outside this support group, it was Josh Lucas who was as fierce and impressive as the ardent Ron Launius. Lucas is progressively turning into a great Hollywood actor with such charismatic transformations in "A Beautiful Mind" and "Sweet Home Alabama". Director James Cox has shown himself to be a bit of a coxsucker by showing a lot of overexposed scenes, just like the famous Holmes organ. Holmes was finally acquitted of the murders of "Wonderland". He died of complications from the AIDS virus. "Wonderland" will make you think about what really happened on that damn night, and if Holmes really laid his weapon down. Oops! Wrong movie Holmes! Ok! This is enough before I become "penalized" I mean penalized. Hi Holmies! *** Average
