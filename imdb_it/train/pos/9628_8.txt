Some of my favorite Laurel and Hardy films have a very, very small plot. Instead, they give them a rather trivial situation and let them be hilarious! Films like HELP MATES and BUSY BODIES are among the most enjoyable as you see the kids working or cleaning the house. Here in DIRTY WORK, most of the film is similar to these other two films: Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps and spend most of the film trying (unsuccessfully) to clean the chimney of a mad professor. See Ollie fall through the chimney, the boys who make the house a total disaster and Stanley's crazy behaviors all work together to make a very pleasant film. <br /> <br /> However, in a strange turn, there is also a really weird subplot that starts and ends the film. It seems that the professor is really a mad scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger. Towards the end of the film, you see him making a duck in a duckling and even a duckling in an egg! Since he leaves the boys alone in the room, it is not surprising what will happen next? Although this subplot was not necessary, it worked quite well. What worked exceptionally well was the central part. Give the kids nothing exciting to do and you will be amazed by the hilarious results. One of the best films of the team and earns almost a 9.
