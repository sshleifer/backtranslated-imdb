A really sweet film that has some similarities to the 2001 movie "My Sassy Girl", but it can enchant most of the time. The biggest applause should go to the two leads. Ha-Neul Kim is sweet and extravagant, Sang-woo Kwon is both attractive and rebellious. The chemistry between the two is very good. <br /> <br /> Director Kyeong-hyeong Kim uses some CG inserts to enhance the graphics and also offers impressive fighting scenes in which the Sang-woo Kwon can shine. I loved it more here than in "Volcano High". And that boy has a future - those looks, those fighting techniques and a romantic guide. Not bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I can do it: nice movie. My vote: 7/10
