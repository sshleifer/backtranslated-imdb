This is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best films - I'm ready to admit it. However, while some consider his film as pure propaganda, I wonder what's wrong with that? Yes, of course, like the TV show THE FBI, this is an obvious case that the Bureau is doing some public relations work to try to increase support. But as entertainment goes, it does a good job. Furthermore, surprisingly for the moment it was made, the film focuses more on crime than on espionage and "Commies". Instead, it is a fiction of one of the first agents and the career he has chosen. Now considering that the agent is played by Jimmy Stewart, then it is fairly certain that acting and writing were good - given that it was a film with a real budget and a studio that did not want to waste the star in a third-rate film . So overall, it's worth seeing but not particularly nice.
