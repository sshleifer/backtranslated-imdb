To my surprise I really liked "Spacecamp", I remember seeing it about 13 years ago, and I recently hired it again. I was very impressed. Obviously the special effects in today's space films like Armageddon and Deep Impact are far superior to those of SpaceCamp. However, this film has a story - a very stereotypical eighties story in which one could almost play the next line of dialogue before hearing it. But that's what I liked - they don't make films like this anymore, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in the first roles, with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw to add substance to the light and soft texture. Absolutely loved the robot called Jinx, it was very nice, but unfortunately it had more emotions than some of the main characters. The film was almost inspiring in its own way, and it was interesting to note that it was shot at NASA's Spacecamp in Alabama (I think).
