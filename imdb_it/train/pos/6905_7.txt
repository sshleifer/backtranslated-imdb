I thought Mr. Dreyfuss was perfect for his role as an actor and dictator. His co-star, Julia, played his equally perfect role. It was interesting to see how reluctant Richard Dreyfuss was to replace the dictator with his will. But he became more confident and comfortable with the role over time. Since everything happens for a reason in life, I believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he was destined to stay there for over a year. I imagine he stayed because he should have seen how beautiful his life was compared to the poverty he had seen in Parador. I think he took too many things for granted in life and he needed to get serious control of reality by staying in that country for as long as he had. <br /> <br /> But ......... .. anyway ........... that's why I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.
