We could still use Black Adder today. Imagine Rowan Atkinson resuming the role of assistant prime minister played by the wonderful Hugh Laurie. Hugh is as striking as his brilliant friend Prince George and Edmund as his brilliant assistant. I love the episode where Kenneth Connor is a guest star as a British actor. Every time, Edmund says Macbeth. The two actors make a foolish act to ward off evil spirits. These are the funniest things you'll see. Of course, none of this brilliant and ingenious genius could be without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis who are also behind movies like Love Actually, The Thin Blue Line, Four Weddings and A Funeral. Black Adder is fun and almost too good for television. Humor can be smart, sexy and fun all in one. I was hoping last night on Saturday Night Live that Hugh Laurie paid tribute to his background in British humor. If the SNL gang had done any research, they would have known what the treasure was to have Hugh Laurie on stage.
