Here is an oddity: a film of our day about a serial killer who has no fight scenes, no one has seen him die, no car chase and no loud noise ..... and takes place in Russia. There are only two short action scenes but they are horrible. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is a detective's job, and how much red tape the poor detective had to deal with to solve the murders. This is a very dark film, and "dark" best describes the personality of the hero (Stephen Rea). Still, the story is not depressing and is very interesting to the end. <br /> <br /> Rea is exceptional as a determined detective with an irritated appearance. Jeffrey DeMunn is definitely scary as the killer. Donald Sutherland's Russian accent is suspect but plays the only character in this film that has a certain warmth. <br /> <br /> Once again, the plot is dotted with liberal programs, here and there, with not one, but two references to prejudices against gays, the total validity of secular psychology, the police and government officials which are coarse / rough / bigots, yadda, yadda, yadda. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it is an intelligent and pleasantly low criminal film. This is a rather unique film that is probably not famous but is appreciated by the people who have seen it. Since it's based on a real-life account of this killer, it's even more chilling. Don't pass this just because you have nothing about it.
