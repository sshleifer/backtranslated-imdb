The young Mr. Lincoln marks the first film of John Ford and Henry Fonda's director / star collaboration. I remember years ago that Fonda said that as a young actor he was understandably nervous playing Abraham Lincoln and feared he was not up to the challenge. <br /> <br /> John Ford put him at ease before he started shooting, saying he wouldn't play the Great Emancipator, but just a long-legged prairie lawyer. The one that was resolved, Fonda directed a cast that John Ford directed in a classic film. <br /> <br /> This is not a biographical film by Lincoln. That had happened in the era of sound with Walter Huston and a year after Young Lincoln, Raymond Massey won the Pulitzer prize won by Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Massey still remains the definitive Lincoln. <br /> <br /> But as Ford said, Fonda wasn't playing the Great Emancipator just a small town lawyer in Illinois. The film includes about 10 years of Lincoln's life. We see him talking to a clerk in a department store, procuring some law books from a family of immigrant pioneers whose path would have been crossed again later in history. And his love affair with Ann Rutledge with his untimely death leaves Lincoln a very melancholy being. <br /> <br /> Forward for about 10 years and Lincoln is now a lawyer who practices and begins to get noticed. He served a couple of terms in the legislature, but he returned to private practice, he is not sure that politics is for him. <br /> <br /> This is where most of the action takes place. The two children of that family had obtained the law books from afar when they are accused of murder. He offers to defend them. And not an ordinary murder, but one of a deputy sheriff. <br /> <br /> The process itself is fiction, but the move used in the defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan who played the two sons is based on a real case that Lincoln defended. I won't say anything else. <br /> <br /> In addition to performances, the great strength of Young Mr. Lincoln is the way John Ford captures the atmosphere, atmosphere and setting of a small Illinois prairie in a quarter of July Celebration It almost seems like you're watching a newsreel. And it was the mood of the country itself, young, lively and growing. <br /> <br /> Fans of John Ford's films will recognize here two musical themes that have been repeated in subsequent films. During the romantic interlude at the beginning with Fonda and Pauline Moore who played Ann Rutledge, the music in the background is the same theme used in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for Vera Miles. And at a dance, the melody Lovely Susan Brown that Fonda and Marjorie Weaver play Mary Todd is the same one that Fonda danced with Cathy Downs, in My Darling Clementine at a church ballroom in Tombstone. <br /> <br /> Lincoln will forever be a favorite subject of biographers and playwrights for two reasons, I believe. The first is that it is the living embodiment of our own American mythology about the people who rise from the bottom to the height of power through their own efforts. In fact, the young Mr. Lincoln shows very clearly the background of Lincoln. And secondly the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in American history and that he made a singularly good and moral decision to free the slaves during the civil war, albeit for some necessary political reasons. His assassination has secured his place in history. <br /> <br /> In addition to Fonda and others I have mentioned, special praises should also go to Fred Kohler, Jr. and Ward Bond, the two slums of the city, Kohler as the murder victim and Bond the boss accuser. Even Donald Meek as a lawyer and Alice Brady in what turned out to be his last film as a pioneer mother of Cromwell and Quillan. And a very nice performance by Spencer Charters who specialized in rustic characters like the judge. <br /> <br /> For a film that captures the drama and romance of the time in which it is set, you can't do better than Young Mr. Lincoln.
