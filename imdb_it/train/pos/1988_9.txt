First of all, I would like to make a correction on another review of this film that said that the last musical to win the award for best film was "Gigi" in 1958. This is disinformation as "West Side Story" won in 1962 , "My Fair Lady" won in 1965 and "Sound of Music" won the following year. That being said, this film is absolutely fantastic! The story of the novel has been somewhat altered, but this is more due to the limitations they had on a stage that they did not change for a filmed version. However, I don't mind. Actually, I rather think that the whole production flows better than the novel. I like Nancy taking Oliver to the bridge with her and she is killed there instead of later in the apartment. The subtle things in this film are the ones that make me laugh. I love the moment Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble start going out at the beginning of the governors office. The emphasis for that moment is brilliant. My three favorite actors for this film were Jack Wild, who plays the best Dodger in any film version of the story, Ron Moody, a playful and witty Fagin (this character was worked out much better than it is in the book) and Shani Wallis, which is Nancy's strongest and most distressed version. The only reason I'm giving this film at 9 instead of 10 is because of the two big production numbers that are "Concider Yourself" and "Who Will Buy". I always hate when musical choreography wants to look like people doing chores and everyday jobs. It looks horrible and cheap, especially when they dance at the London Meat Co. They should have just done regular choreographies for these scenes. However, this film is a rare treasure that will remain with us, hopefully, forever.
