Not a day goes by without a new computerized animated movie, so now we really have the chance to see more than a few good effects. After seeing the ice age, I felt that it wasn't a big impact for me compared to other films of this genre. <br /> <br /> But it's because I'm a big boy now, and I'm pretty sure this is a very fun movie for kids (maybe up to 14). The plot is quite simple, and the "actors" are fun in a nice way, without crude or complex humor. Even the "evil" is an adorable, big fluffy cat with those funny teeth. And the story has a happy ending, which was a little disappointment for me (knowing that most of the main characters are destined for extinction in a sad way) but a great thing for children. And apart from a few fights no one dies (not even when he is trampled by a mammoth, several times), who made a comic sentiment. <br /> <br /> The computer animation part is nice but nothing special, apart from some really nice cartoony scenes, when you feel like walking in a beautiful painting or comic book pages. [Which means a lot of work anyway!] <br /> <br /> There were some gags that made me smile - I accept, the creators tried to satisfy those big - but they are difficult to identify and (in my opinion) better left unnoticed, since it does not seem to fit the plot. <br /> <br /> Overall it's a nice film, but it's rather in the clich√© of the ideal-and-fluffy-animal-for-children world. If you don't hate cute animals doing funny things, watch them at least once.
