You know, when you watch this Brian DePalma movie today, I'm sure there has been criticism of how old it is. Moreover, on violence. When I watched this movie on VHS when I was 20, I thought it was ultra-violent and gritty. But I didn't understand it. <br /> <br /> A few decades go by and man, how do I know how much I didn't get into this movie !! This is a remake of an excellent film that was made in the 30s / 40s. How can you improve a classic? Do not do it. But tell a story that is updated through the eyes of the "new immigrants" during the most avid decade, the indulgent 80s. DePalma, Stone and the band present an ambitious, disturbing and damn good film. <br /> <br /> Yes .... The disco was dying and New Wave / Punk were taking over but these immigrants from Cuba who had to make a new home in Florida couldn't tell the difference. It was exciting, it was what they wanted but how to get it ???? For these immigrants, there was only one way to do it in Florida, where they were ... with a lot of money and to get money, you had to take over a drug empire. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was fantastic for me as Tony Montana, the "train that could". What an extraordinary way to see your protagonist in America: fight, kill, steal. lie, cheat everything to get - "money, women and power". <br /> <br /> Here is what Tony saw as the American dream. <br /> <br /> He wanted it, he wanted to live it and in his circle he didn't see anything wrong with the way he went to get it. Tony Montana's command of the English language was strongly saturated by the word "f", but what did you expect, the Emily Post finishing school for him and his co-horts? See how they got to America, what they knew, what they were exposed to. This is how Tony and his crew chose to "be all they can be in America". It was all about power. Tony Montana would have done and done ANYTHING to get it. All his glory violent, lying, furtive, tortuous, thief. <br /> <br /> The part of the film that personified the 80s for me is money laundering. Tony's crew brings sacks of drug money to the bank. Do they care about those around Tony and his crew? In the clubs where you spent and drank? No. Money was money and with money, you have power. Tony lived high out of the pig. He and his beautiful blond American trophy he married played well with Michelle Pfieffer. <br /> <br /> After the rise to power of Tony Montana, he finds that it is really bad. He is full of doubts, he is a drug addict, he is paranoid, he is surrounded by those who want to take him to a damn take-over, his spunky blonde American wife of the 80s discovers that he is bored, he needs to stay on top of the his empire because ... he's going down. And down in a horrible violent way, but again I ask, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> This is the film par excellence of 1980 that tells you a distorted story of how some misunderstand the American dream ... obsession. It is violent, bloodthirsty, excessively so ... but it pushes the point to disturb the house. Not all Cubans launched from Cuba who landed in Florida in the 1980s were like Tony Montana. Give me a break. But the demonstration of how miserable the 80s were with its emphasis on greed and money as the only measures in the United States to "be someone" and have the power took its instrument on these poor characters and their lives in America. <br /> <br /> Does it make you wonder - has it since then - been learned today?
