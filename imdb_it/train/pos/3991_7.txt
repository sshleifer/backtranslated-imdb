"If I sit down I will never get up again", this is what the mother (the one in the title) tells her son when he tells her to rest (he's just a widow). It means that rest is what a woman of her age and in her situation must do: rest in peace, neglect herself. But she is not in the mood to "rest", not yet. She also has a daughter who scolds her for all the disasters of her life ... Suddenly the revelation arrives: sex and passion in the figure of a muscular carpenter 30 years younger than her (Daniel Craig, the new James Bond) when "he thought no one would ever touch her again". It's a story that makes you think about many things, especially about what a woman should do with her life when her husband dies. It does not seem that we have advanced it in these aspects. I mean, nobody's surprised when Sean Connery has a love story in a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what would you think if it were otherwise? An old woman, a young boy ... nah, you're not ready for this, are you? <br /> <br /> The film has intimate tones throughout its length, except for 2 or 3 sequences in which the tones break and outside come out explicit and vulgar dialogues. Those vulgar touches and the way the son and daughter discover the mother's love story (rather absurd - you know what I mean when you look at it) are the only conflicting elements in "The Mother". <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
