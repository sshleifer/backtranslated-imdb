This is one of the top five Disney animated films, in my opinion. Cinderella was a perfect return to the animated feature film (as opposed to the compilation films of the 1940s), and the costly depth through the multi-plane camera returns to the film in no other way. Even if Disney adapts the story in a somewhat liberal way, gather the idea of ​​the age through the dress and the sets - a clear time period in which the story takes place. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is more mature than Snow White, and a multidimensional character. In fact, all the characters are somehow well developed, except for the prince - left flat - we know he has a sense of humor and a big smile, but that's all. Like Snow White, Disney has a permanent impact on the history of popular culture --- in most versions of Cinderella, the stepsisters are attractive, not quite as beautiful as Cinderella, and their character takes away their otherwise pleasant appearance. > <br /> Add Disney favorites: mice! Also, he appreciated the continuity - Cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film. The addition of the dress made at home and the following assault by the stepsisters was always horrible as a child - I remember that View Master showed it with a black background and a big red light on it! The broken slipper shows the reluctance of the evil Lady Tremaine to abandon her grip on Cinderella and admit defeat --- Audley would have continued to characterize the most evil of all the villains of Disney, the satanic witch Maleficent, in Sleeping Beauty.
