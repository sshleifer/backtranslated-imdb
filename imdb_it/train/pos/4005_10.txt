Although at one point I thought that this would become the graduate, I must say that the mother does a great job explaining the sexual desires of an old woman. <br /> <br /> I am so happy that this is a British film because Hollywood would never have done it, and even if they did, they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the characters. <br /> <br /> The story is revealed slowly and realistically. The acting is superb, the characters are credibly spoiled and the dialogue is sensitive. I have tried many times to predict what was going to happen, and I have always been wrong, so I was very intrigued by the story. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. And I must confess, I will always look at my mother in a different light!
