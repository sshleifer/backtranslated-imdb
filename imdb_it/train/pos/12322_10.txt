This film is one of my favorites. It is a genre blend with the ingredients of Action / Horror / Romanticism / Comedy. Some of the special effects may seem obsolete compared to modern standards. This small flaw is easily ignored. There is so much to discover in this story. The romantic relationship between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts. Even the images are beautiful. The action is exceptional and not surprising, it comes from Honkong, the birthplace of the best action movies in the world. Humor sometimes seems a bit silly but in a good way. In some ways this film is able to balance the different moods and continues to be good. Absolutely recommended
