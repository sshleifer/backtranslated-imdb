The battle between darkness and light is characterized by the constant motif of the scorching sun and is superbly demonstrated by a three-way fight between "demons", bandits and soldiers in a forest during an eclipse. <br /> <br /> Get ready: after a splendid sword fight under a sky full of lightning, the end of this photo will make you scratch your head in a puzzled way.
