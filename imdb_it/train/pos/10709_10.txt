This film really woke me up, as if waking up the main male character of this film bravely different from his sleep. <br /> <br /> This boy John (Ben Chaplin) leads his mediocre and safe life as a bank teller in a small provincial English town, until Nadia (Nicole Kidman), an extraordinarily beautiful, wild and as a girl to die, ordered by e-mail from Russia, she enters her life to become his beloved wife, according to Johns plan. However, there is a technical problem: Nadia does not say a word about Johns' tongue. Although calm and emotionless on the outside, John becomes so interested in the beautiful Nadia that instead of using the full reimbursement policy of the pairing service, he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process. <br /> <br /> What happens from now on in the plot really shakes poor John out of his falling asleep in a decent security employee, in an action figure that thinks decently, giving the viewer a subliminal message "you probably would have done the same thing". <br /> <br /> Kidman, Cassel and Kassovitz form a great team that acts in Russian and are almost indistinguishable from the truth, "almost" only for the slight accent present in their Russian dialogues, even if light enough to surprise a Russian native from the hard work done to make the words sound right. Nicole Kidman once again demonstrates her talent by playing a character very different from the previous roles, at least from a cultural background. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is fast and engaging, and you're certainly not ready to stop watching when the final titles appear, rather you feel you're in the middle of the plot, and you still want to see the sequel as soon as it comes out. <br /> <br /> My advice is to go out and get this movie immediately and watch it and have fun. To sum up, it has an unusual texture, great acting and ideas below the surface. Like the idea of ​​the "rude awakening" from the routine artificial life of a wheel in a company's car, the life that Fight Club members were so eager to quit and the car that Pink Floyd sings about ("Welcome to the car! "). I bet that in the end, John was rather out with Sophia on the way to the unknown than not having met her at all. <br /> <br /> Thanks, writers, for the great story, and all the others for this great movie! Please make a sequel! And you can stage it anywhere and name the location, because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant for 99.999% of potential viewers, I'm sure.
