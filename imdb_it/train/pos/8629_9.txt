I read a small advertisement in some horror magazine in the early nineties on Liebe des Totes (love of the dead) or something similar. This obviously aroused my curiosity, so I ordered Nekromantik 1 & 2 and Der Todesking (The king of death). Nekromantik's films are Ok, even a little interesting and unique in their approach to Necrophilia (although they are obviously horror-opera voices rather than intended to invoke fear in the minds of viewers, they are actually quite funny.) <Br /> <br /> TODESKING, on the other hand is, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. It consists of a series of scenes that describe the many facets of death. Death as an enemy; Death as a reliever, death as the very physical decomposition of the body. The film is a metaphor for life. It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. It reduces its viewers to the children that they (we) actually are. The fact that we are unable to really understand the nature of Death, and therefore neither the process of dying, is the central message of the film. This is a more realistic film. Buttgereit never tries to hide death behind white or other roses. No matter what the established moral standards are, death is impossible and sooner or later it will not be a fiction but YOUR reality. This applies to YOU, dear reader, as it applies to film viewers. Some child auditors seem not to grasp this, which is completely excused, since obviously they will live forever ... <br /> <br /> This is not an exploitative film. Why? Because death does not exploit us humans. He picks us up We grow for seven days, then we are returned to the slave state of pre-birth, that is, to Death. Buttgereit offers us his version of the oldest of the stories. Whether you choose to consider it "optimistic" or "pessimistic" depends on you. At first glance it may seem very dark. However, consider that to make something live, something else must die. "Who wants to live forever?" <br /> <br /> I believe that when Buttgereit shows a body, which is consumed by worms, it shows not only decomposition, but the GENERATION of a new life. Is it not better to die and give life to the worms and therefore to the birds and in the end to become ground, rather than remain the dead living zombie which is one of the favorite animals of the genus? <br /> <br /> When you realize this, see Der Todesking in its proper context. <br /> <br /> Sieben Tage hat die Woche, siebenmal letzte Stunden. Seven are the days of the week (weak, deadly!), Seven times the last hour. <br /> <br /> Don't fear the Reaper, says Buttgereit, because the Reaper only takes what is ripe. And the apples that are not plucked for food will rot! <br /> <br /> I wish you a good life, IMDB companions! <br /> <br /> (And watch this film, which only compares Ingemar Bergmans with "The Seventh Seal" in terms of depth and universality)
