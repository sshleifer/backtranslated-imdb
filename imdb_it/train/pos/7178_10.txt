PUT THE CAMERA ON ME is a deceptively cute film. In reality it is a complex look at children's psychology and offers interesting insights into the development of adults and an artist. Apparently, this is a nostalgic aspect of some films made at home in the 1980s by a group of boys from the upper class neighborhood. One of the film's directors, Darren Stein, had access to a video camera and quickly assumed the role of artistic leader for all films. Of course, these are just nice kids who enjoy themselves. But this is also much more. This is a look at some moments in time while the children face a series of confused problems that we all face in life --- fear, sexual awakening, unrequited love, loneliness and just trying to make sense of the adult world that seems to explode all around us. As we age, we tend to forget how unbearable the reality of life was when we were little. <br /> <br /> What makes this film even better is seeing a young Darren Stein turn into a small director general. It is clear that Darren is conducting this show and these little films are his vision but they are all informed by his friends, their problems, interpersonal dynamics and general confusion about the horrors of adult life. Many children make films at home, but I have never heard or seen children make "small" films about the Holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war and the inability to adapt and make friends. These children confront and deal with heavy things! <br /> <br /> The power of this film is the way in which Stein and Shell drag various scenes together so closely with running interviews with children --- all now adults and all still friends. This adds a new perspective to the film. How many of us have stayed in touch with our childhood friends? These guys have. And many of the problems they were dealing with are still going on between them two decades later. <br /> <br /> Among the conflicts - a confession of a crush reveals a heart still broken, a very normal childhood sexual experience continues to be a "sticky" subject between two men, some continuous resentments on the dynamics of relationships and there is still a member of this team who remains in the lead and in the center of the scene! Which makes perfect sense in watching these domestic movies progressing over a couple of years. Darren Stein is a director. No doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Stein and Shell alternate from time to time to chat and you can't help but imagine the embarrassment of allowing us to peek into the young lives of these people. This is especially true for Stein, who has had tremendous success in the entertainment industry as a producer, writer and director. From the first moment of PUT THE CAMERA ON ME we can see the emergence of a gay boy trying to understand everything. We also see the sides of the artistic mind and personality that are not always "beautiful" or "caring" --- and this is a courageous move that every artist can share with an audience. <br /> <br /> There are many revealing moments, but the most disturbing and complex moments concern a film in which we see a victim of a Jewish concentration camp tortured and killed by a Nazi. We find through interviews and narrations that the Nazi is played by a Jewish child and the victim's part is played by a kind child. It is a painfully disturbing moment that sees the dark side of fear and the way children work through the horrors of the adult world that are beyond the comprehension of adults and much less that of a child. <br /> <br /> This is more than just a domestic movie. This documentary captures the pain, the beauty, the joy and the sadness of growing up. Powerful stuff --- and worth seeing! <br /> <br />:
