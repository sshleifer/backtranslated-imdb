THE 40 YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Funny high-level comedy about the titanic Andy Stitzer (wonderfully played by the perennial second Carell banana in a truly extraordinarily comic and innovative performance that will surely stratify him to list A), a technology services representative for an electronics store in southern California that is he discovered his secret identity from a trio of well-intentioned but totally oblivious feminine workmates (Rudd, Malco and Rogen, each more amusing than the other) determined to scorn his friend, regardless of the cost. What follows is an unlikely but very warm novel with a lively mother (the wonderful Keener having a great time here) which leads to adding more fuel to the fires inside Andy. A surprisingly cheerful and brazenly intriguing romantic comedy; the funniest since "There's Something About Mary" with an acute and observant script by director Judd Apatow and Carell presenting some amazing gut sequences, including an incredibly accurate David Caruso joke, repeating homophobic debunking, send out " date-a-paloozas "'and demystifying the war of the sexes with blatant ease. A real winner and an instant classic; the funniest movie of the year.
