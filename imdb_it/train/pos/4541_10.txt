I saw this movie on cable, it was really fun, from the stereotype of the police chief to the stereotype of the big villains, jay leno and mr mayagi of karate kid star in this good comedy about a car prototype. I compare this film to "RUSH HOUR" in which a local policeman must work with an Asian police officer to solve a case. The pursuit through the farmers market in the center of detroit brings back memories. Nice soundtrack, good script, do 10/10.
