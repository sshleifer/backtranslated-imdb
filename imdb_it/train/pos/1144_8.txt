Back in 1955, the British made a comedy called Simon and Laura, with Peter Finch and the brilliant Kay Kendall. Today it is one of the best examples of British comedy and, in particular, of how TV sitcoms have become so popular. It was, and is, an excellent example even of self-referential cinema. <br /> <br /> So also Soapdish, a film I had never heard of until a few nights ago, when I got it on TV late. At first I was a bit dubious simply because comedy is so hard to do well, as you know. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised and happy to watch a very smart satire on American TV by day. In fact, it's been a while since I laughed so heartily. So, if you like satire, I suggest you see it. <br /> <br /> The main actors ?? Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty ?? I simply do an excellent job, revealing how unpleasant and superficial the acting business is. As I looked at him, I kept thinking of myself: how much of this wickedness affects real life? I mean, if the actors ever have a real life? As you probably know, Peter Sellers, for example, was famous for hiding his true character behind a multitude of characters, so that nobody really knew the real person. So, as I watched Sally Field playing Celeste Talbot while playing Maggie, I thought back to that previous British movie with Kay Kendall playing Laura playing a character on a television sitcom alongside Peter Finch ... <br /> <br /> C Is there any question that some actors have nervous breakdowns? And that feeling crystallized when Celeste finally confronts her daughter (Lori, played by Elizabeth Shue) and, in an emotional moment, repeats the imaginary lines she used, in a previous episode of her daytime soap, when she confronted her imaginary daughter in Here's how! Are you confused? Well, that's not all, but the dialogue is surprising for originality, comedy, malice, anger, depravity, duplicity and even ... love. <br /> <br /> History? Well, there are many stories in this film, all intertwined, and they all come together in the end (of course ?? but not like a film by Robert Altman, ok!), And not all are finally resolved. Life is not like that, right? The pace is almost frantic, and you really have to watch and listen carefully to capture all the gags and subtle jokes. Spend 97 minutes from your life and watch it; you will not regret the usage time. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast all perform well, although I have never brought much to Whoopi Goldberg. Perhaps the most amusing exchanges are between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty and, for my money, the latter steals so many scenes from others, she gets my vote as an exceptional player. I'm not kidding, she gives the term bitch a completely new face ...
