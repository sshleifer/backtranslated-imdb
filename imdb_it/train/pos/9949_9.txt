This is a nice surprise. Nice little story of heroin research, a surprisingly surprising metamorphosis of the type with four wealthy eyes and a spinster in a ramshackle DD-cup sex queen. <br /> <br /> Visually a show for sluggish eyes, not only for two rather surprising actresses, but also for (most) the costumes and the makeup of the actors. An unnecessary bit of convenience came in some ridiculous imitation of the castle. <br /> <br /> Back to the positives: The film is spiced with some unusually explicit shots that you wouldn't expect in a soft core. I love that scene with icicles, the absolute classic potential. A slight minus only for (very) a few strange scenes in which bad acting by minor actors has suspended suspension of disbelief in a short time. <br /> <br /> 9/10 including an extra credit for the serious deburring effect.
