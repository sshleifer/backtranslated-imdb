THE GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all the box office records at Radio City Music Hall in a year when most of the "movergoers" stayed at home watching their new 7 "Motorola TVs the figures are false --- because they can't adjust inflation Obviously, today's $ 10 films will be dominant: in 1951 it cost 90 cents to $ 1.60 in Radio City, 44c to 75c before the first race at Loew's Palace in Washington DC, or 35c to 50c in neighborhood races What matters is the number of people who respond to the picture, not the "unmediated" box office The genius of THE GREAT CARUSO is that the filmmakers took most of the real life of Enrico Caruso (however it is not a good story) and thrown in the garbage, instead 90% of the film was focused on music, so MGM gave us the best living opera singer MARIO LANZA, making music of the most great historical opera singer ENRICO CARUSO The result was a wonderful film. Too bad LANZA gave him life and career to eat too much. Too fat to play THE STUDENT PRINCE, Edmund Purdom took his place --- with the voice of Lanza nicknamed, and with the former Lanza, beautiful and non-fat, depicted in the ad. If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO, it's almost always on eBay for $ 2.00 or less. Don't be discouraged by the low price, as it only reflects the easy availability of copies, not the quality of the film.
