A woman, Mujar (Marta Belengur) enters a restaurant one morning at &: 35 unaware that a terrorist has kidnapped people in that restaurant and is having them perform in a musical number in this strange but fascinating short film, which I saw only by finding it on the DVD of the equally fascinating "Timecrimes" by the director / writer. He had a catchy song and somehow brought a smile to my face despite the general plot to the short. I'm glad I came across it (I wasn't aware it would be an extra when I rented the DVD) and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to all my friends. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A-
