Ok, this show is nothing but FANTASTIC! It has a fantastic plot and plot and great actors and actresses. Jeremy Sumpter is so strong and he is perfect for the role! He is a great being in Hollywood. He has a bright future ahead of him! This show will last a long time because I love this show and I hope it is very successful! It's so interesting. I waited for it to come out for about 6 or 7 months and it's finally here, and it's great! I read it too. I can watch it when I want it now! Too bad, it's only about once a week. I wish it was turned on at least twice a week because now I wish it was Tuesday every day! I hope you enjoy this show! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashley ~
