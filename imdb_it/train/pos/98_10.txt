For me too, this Christmas special is one I remember fondly. In 1989, I took the 2 CDs I found in the soundtrack recording, giving one to my sister and holding the other for me. It's part of my family's Christmas tradition now, and I'd like to be able to see the show again rather than just remember it while listening. <br /> <br /> It has been noted elsewhere that John Denver has made a number of appearances on the Muppet Show, and have done more than one special together. The good relationship between Denver and its fuzzy comrades clearly comes here, in a fascinating and entertaining show that is good for all ages.
