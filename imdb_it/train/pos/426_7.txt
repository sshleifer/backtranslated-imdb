Having come across this film on the Fox movie channel on a lazy Friday afternoon, I can't think of a better way to spend a lazy Friday night and put my value to two cents. Especially considering the lack of user comments on it. Not all films, good or bad, deserve more than four comments? And this film is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> The first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like April Love is to remember the era from which it comes, in this case the end of the fifties. The films were rather a happy medium then. The cinemas were tragedy-free while the screens were full of wide-screen Technicolor films to distract people from the gray glow of the evil medium in a box called television. I don't know how many people were taken out of the breast tube to see this, but he managed to catch my attention for 97 minutes. <br /> Teen Idol Pat Boone plays Nick Conover, a young teenager sent to live with her aunt Henrietta (Jeanette Nolan) and uncle Jed (Arthur O'Connell) in the country after being put on probation for to have stolen a car. It seems that his uncle and his uncle have lost their own son (Jed Jr.) so it seems that Uncle Jed has lost the taste for living. Aunt Henrietta hopes that Nick, being on the farm, can somehow take Jed out of his doldrums. Stories like these are what they are, but Jed and Nick don't care much about each other, of course. Jed then proceeds to meet the neighbors, Fran (Dolores Michaels) and Liz (Shirley Jones) Templeton. Jed immediately develops a crush on Fran, and of course I don't have to tell you that Liz develops a crush on Jed. Then there is the question of Uncle Jed's horse, a trotter that has been unleashed and will not allow anyone to handle it from the death of Jed Jr. You could probably fill in everything that happens from that point alone, seeing as there are no real ones surprise. It doesn't matter though, you'll have fun anyway. <br /> <br /> Once you have passed the image of Pulitissimo Boone, as an alleged bad boy, you will have no problems with the rest of the film. Considering this, Boone turns into a surprisingly good performance like Nick. Certainly the role does not require much depth, but it is still a job well done when you least expect it. Like Jed, Arthur O'Connell is the perfect choice for the role. At first, it is unreachable and cold, but as he slowly approaches Nick, we see that he is a really good boy. Jeannette Nolan is very funny as Henrietta, who constantly plays the part of the mediator between Jed and Nick. Shirley Jones takes a break from Rodgers and Hammerstein and gets some opportunities to embellish us with her singing talents. Like Liz, it's wonderful to watch, great to listen to and, at times, quite funny. Dolores Michaels like Fran, who is a little more wild, is just as fun. <br /> <br /> The best thing about April Love is that there is no real conniving character of any kind on the screen. Not a real villain in the whole thing. Everyone is so nice that you can't help but enjoy the movie. Actually I find it quite refreshing, a bit like putting the troubles behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends. Think of it as the old Andy Griffith show with musical numbers, a little more plot and Technicolor wide screen. The songs are a mixed bag, with the title song April Love being the best of them. Another thing that I really liked is that they didn't come back to use the blue backgrounds on the screen during horse racing sequences, and that's why they're a little more fun and exciting. In fact, you will find the whole film beautifully photographed and it was nice to see that they didn't skimp in that department. The chemistry between Jones and Boone is good. The best thing is that the dislike between Nick and Jed is interpreted while everyone tries in some way to earn the respect of others. <br /> <br /> This film will never be confused with the great cinema. Yet, sometimes instead of going to Disneyland, there's only need for a nice trip to the park, and that's what April Love is. <br /> <br /> My Grade: B + <br /> <br />
