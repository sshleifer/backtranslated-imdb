I was lucky enough to have seen him on a whim during a film festival and was so impressed by what I saw that I returned the next night for his second of three screenings. A funny, fierce and acute attack on every aspect of traditional entertainment passively swallowed without tasting it by the lower target audience of the common denominator of a solitary and greedy journalist who slowly takes members for his war guerilla on predictability is what the film talks about everything, and it is performed in such an unpredictable and refreshing way that it remains to you after the credits have returned with renewed hope and enthusiastic that the original films can still be made. Anyone who is frustrated by the unfulfilled expectations of something to illuminate their imagination would do well to hunt (and I mean to hunt) this object poorly seen below. For fans of Fight Club and any Charlie Kaufman film, the vision of anyone who avoids multiplexes like a mad dog is needed.
