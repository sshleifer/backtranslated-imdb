"The Groove Tube" was initially shown on video, in the first "cinemas" here in Boston. In one room there were TV monitors on high stands, with old cinema seats, in small groups in front of the monitors. There were old fridges stocked with Pepsi and baskets of York mint balls. In a second smaller room, there were no seats, only large pillows. That was the 'smoke' room, that is, people rose up there. That act only added to the hilarity of the video. <br /> <br /> I was a "frequent viewer"; the scenes that I liked best and that I remember so far are: Koko The Clown, The Kramp Family Kitchen (Kramp Easy-Lube Shortening), Safety Sam / VD PSA, the Chevy Chase w / nude hitchhiker runs through the woods , the Finger Ballet on what eventually turned out to be a woman's naked body. The last element is very reminiscent of the deceased, incredible Ernie Kovacs. Now, I've lost many readers who are under 48 ("who is Ernie Kovacs ??"), but believe me, it's a funny thing. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons I was a "frequent viewer" was that my friends and I would bring other virgins from "Groove Tube" to see it. We sat and looked astutely at the faces of the "virgins" as the PS "Safety Sam" would sound. As the camera slowly approaches "Sam", we would wait for that "OH!" of recognition on the face of the "virgin". Each time it was more fun than the last one. And then the "virgin" would then bring a friend to see the show, repeating what we had done. To get this joke, you have to watch the video. <br /> <br /> Yes, some are dated, but most games, movies, television and now videos are. Just watch all the videos made in the 80s. I saw "The Groove Tube" in a theater like a movie, a transfer that was grainy from the original video. It had been cut, and some of the original high-level scenes were missing. <br /> <br /> The first show of "Saturday Night Live", with Chevy Chase, sparked immediate comments about "this is the guy from" The Groove Tube "", so he was a precursor to Chevy. <br /> <br /> I can't look at a shortening jar without having heard the voiceover, "cover your hands with a generous amount of Kramp Easy- Lubricant reduction ..." and thinking about the recipe "Kramp Holiday Loaf ". It always makes me laugh in the Baking Needs ward in the grocery store. <br /> <br /> The early 1970s were times of parlous; "The Groove Tube" was fresh, new and really "has" the humor of the times. It offered a "hip generation", a humor that was not available in any other format / medium. MJH
