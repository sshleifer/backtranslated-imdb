<br /> <br /> "Burning Paradise" is a combination of neo-Shaw Brothers action and the urban cynicism of Ringo Lam. When you watch the movie, they may feel that the fighting scenes are only of a mediocre nature, but it doesn't matter, it's the attitude and atmosphere that matters. This great movie has both !! Always trying to be different from his contemporaries, Lam gives us the traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan) and puts them in a "Raiders of the Lost Ark" setting. However, these are not the easy-going comic incarnations that you could see in a Jet Li movie. Instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results. What makes the film even better is that anyone could die at any time, you can't stop. Too bad, they don't make films like this more often.
