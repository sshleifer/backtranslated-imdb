This movie is a lot of fun. What makes it particularly great are two things: one is the simple way in which the characters embrace stereotypes, with discussions about their customs and superpowers. There is an affectionate sincerity for the parody that is very attractive; the second is the fundamental sweetness of the characters and the quality of chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves special attention as the object of Mr. Furious's desires. There's a load of talent here. I realize that some with high expectations may have been disappointed, but this film is very funny and very sweet.
