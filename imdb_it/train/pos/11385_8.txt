This is the typical cheerful and colorful musical of MGM of the early 1950s and is certainly one of the best to keep an eye on. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by the expert of the genre Vincente Minnelli and interpreted by Gene Kelly in the main protagonist. Both have made quite a few films together in those days, of which this is probably their best known. <br /> <br /> The film itself managed to win the best Oscar during the year, which meant beating films like "A Place in the Sun", "A Tram Calling Desire", "The African Queen" "," Quo Vadis "," The Blue Veil "," Death of a Salesman "that year. A real success, but at the same time also a little too much credit for this delightful, bright and fun movie. <Br / > <br /> When you watch this movie, surely you will be amused by all of this, which is also thanks to the film, its beautiful color and the many beautiful characters in this film, even the musical numbers are all well done, which is not surprising at all when you have people like Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly at work. <br /> <br /> But really, he couldn't have everything that was said in this movie was done in half an hour or less? I mean, we already know where the film is heading, but it manages to extend it all as long as possible, not to make the film drag in any part, but it makes it a little too long. The film could also have been made with fewer musical numbers. <br /> <br /> One of the best musicals of MGM, which however is not without flaws. <br /> <br /> 8/10
