This compelling story of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to watch on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a sharper image and a sharper sound. My only reservations are that the plot has some unlikely moments and that some of Manchester's strongest accents are sometimes difficult. Fortunately, a word is missing here and there and will not spoil the fun: the main actors are ideally expressed. Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile, an indispensable temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for his boss's wife in the hospital where he has just started working. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking fifty-year-old women imaginable; his acting rivals his beauty. (The love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference is for them!) Each of the supporting characters is clearly drawn and also portrayed in an excellent way. The mix of concise dialogues and passionate excesses makes this a delightful miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be improved morally by looking at "Reckless" - but you'll have a great time. (The sequel, a part of the DVD box set, provides a wild but satisfying two-hour epilogue. You won't want to miss it if you enjoyed what happened before.)
