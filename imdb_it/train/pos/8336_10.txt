This film tells the story of a love story between granddaughter Albert Einstien and a gas station attendant. In order to get the two together, Einstien agrees to help Ed (Tim Hobbsucker Proxy Tim Robbins) learn to act smarter. This impresses Catherine (Meg Ryan). Unfortunately Einstien goes too far and Ed is considered a genius. Hilarity follows. Not to be missed. Shot in Mercer County, New Jersey, at Princeton University, Lawrenceville Prep School (doubling for Princeton University) and a beautiful vintage service station at Hopewell.
