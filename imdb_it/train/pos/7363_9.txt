This Is not A Love Song. <br /> <br /> My summary of a single word of this film would be "Excellent". <br /> <br /> You probably won't like the mass movie that looks public? is a <br /> <br /> movie that forces you to participate. Look, think and ask. <br /> <br /> Comparisons could be made with Deliverance (Topic / Theme) and <br /> <br /> perhaps with The Blair Witch Project for the overall shooting style. <Br /> <br /> However, this film is unique against both. <br /> <br /> Cinematic effects (solarization, freeze, blur, etc.) <br /> <br /> have been seen before, but are used more effectively in this film <br /> <br / > to support the natural tension of history. <br /> <br /> Acting is raw, threatening and absolutely credible. <br /> <br /> The real theme of the film is about friendship; the title really gives <br /> <br /> via the game. Probably not the kind of friendship that most of us have experienced or even would like. <br /> <br /> It's a love song.
