The Haunting is a film that boasts a truly gruesome home, a good effect and a sound job, a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that home. There are scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what happened at Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are some really gruesome moments in the film and I liked the way the ghosts manifested in the sheets, in the curtains and in the house itself. The soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design raised voices around you. What I wish could happen is something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think he held back a little too much. Poltergeist frightened me stupidly when I saw him many years ago, and he continues to resist. The Haunting could have used some other scene of pure terror. The finish was a bit anticlimatic for me. Overall, I liked it. The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump. I just hope it scared me more.
