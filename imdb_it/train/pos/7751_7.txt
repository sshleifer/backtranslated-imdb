I really enjoyed Tom Barman's AWTWB. You just have to let yourself go and enjoy while it lasts, and don't expect anything. It's like sitting on a coffee terrace with a beer, in the summer sun, and watching the world go by. I certainly won't let you meditate later, it's true, but it's not a prerequisite for a good movie. It's just the experience during the movie that is fantastic. <br /> <br /> I heard that there were some aspects that could have been solved a little more, but being a Lynch fan I don't care much anymore :) <br /> <br /> And I have * loved * the style, or the talent of this film. It's smooth, but fresh, and the soundtrack is a beauty. Any music lover will pull out of AWTWB, I assure you. <br /> <br /> I'll give it to you 8 out of 10. <br /> <br /> (music 10 out of 10)
