This show is a great story. It has everything from slavery, the way they were treated, religion, the way Jews were sent underground, the inquisition, the belief in Orisha the gods, the way women were treated , including the daughters. Even up to homosexuality. The way the characters are intertwined and that Violante, that character saddens me. She is so desperate that she is loved by destroying all those around her. I'm so glad they decided to republish it to t.v. yet. Although I would like to see the new version. Xica has become my heroine. I raise the way he uses his power to help all those who seek him. I love all the characters and have discovered that they can relate to many people now in this century. I look forward to my Xica every night. It would be nice to write it in English, so even Americans can love it.
