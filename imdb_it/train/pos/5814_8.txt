With all this stuff coming down at the moment with MJ, I started listening to his music, watching the strange documentaries here and there, I watched The Wiz and looked at Moonwalker again. Maybe I just want to have a certain vision of this guy that I thought was very cool in the eighties just to decide if he's guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is partly a biography, partly a film that I remember seeing in the cinema when it was published. Some of these have subtle messages about MJ's sentiment towards the press and even the obvious drug message is bad. <br /> <br /> Visually impressive, but of course this is about Michael Jackson, unless you like MJ in the least anyway then he will hate it and find it boring. Some might call MJ an egotist for having consented to the making of this BUT MJ movie and most of his fans would say he did it for the fans that if it were true it's really nice of him. <br /> <br /> The current function The bit movie when it finally starts is only for about 20 minutes excluding the Smooth Criminal sequence and Joe Pesci is convincing as a powerful psychopathic drug lord. Because he wants MJ to die so badly is beyond me. Why did MJ hear his plans? Nah, the character of Joe Pesci made sure that he wanted people to know that he is the one who supplies drugs, etc. So I don't know, maybe he just hates MJ's music. <br /> <br /> A lot of interesting things in this like MJ that turns into a car and a robot and the entire Speed ​​Demon sequence. Furthermore, the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the Kiddy Bad sequence, since usually the directors hate working with a child, not to mention a group of them performing in a scene of complex dance. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film is for people who like MJ on one level or another (which I think is most people). If not, then stay away. Try to give a healthy message and ironically MJ's best friend in this film is a girl! Michael Jackson is really one of the most talented people who has ever paired this planet, but is he the culprit? Well, with all the attention I gave to this topic .... hmmm well I don't know because people can be different behind closed doors, I know for sure. He's an extremely kind but stupid boy or one of the sickest liars. I hope it's not the second.
