I was so happy to have found this short film. I'm always so disappointed that the shorts are hard to find, so when I saw it and saw that he was nominated for the Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards, I was so glad I had a movie that I was rooting for. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, the director, screenwriter and star Nacho Vigalondo have tried to invent a reason why people suddenly throw themselves into a song and dance like in musicals. The result is extremely fun and the song is really catchy. <br /> <br /> It is a well-made, well-made short film and all the actors do a great job. And the last shot of the film is perfect. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
