I gave this film such a high score because it was really nice, really fun, despite being unpretentious. I went to see this movie when he was playing in the Philly area, and it was the centerpiece of a great night out with friends. The film is well written and well acted, and although it looks a bit like a sitcom rather than a film, this does not detract from the film. You no longer see comedies like this, where you don't have to shock people to be funny. The film revolves around a Ukrainian governess who finds herself working for a young couple in need of help. Although it helps in the beginning, it soon adds more madness to their lives, then the couple has contracted. Things get more and more out of control until ... you have to see! The quarrel made me laugh, even after leaving the theater. This film put me in a good mood. I can't wait for it to be released on DVD because I want this movie in my collection.
