Hidden Frontier stands out as being the longest Internet based Star Trek fan series. While the quality of production is not on par with the productions of fans like Starship Exeter, or New Voyages, Hidden Frontier focuses mainly on history, and in this sense it does it very well. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier has no physical set up; instead the actors are filmed against a greenscreen and the backgrounds digitally inserted. One of the greatest successes of Hidden Frontier is the volume of work they have produced. One of the ways in which this is achieved is by entering the virtual sets at the time of recovery, rather than in the post-production phase. While this saves a lot of time, it is also worth noting that the quality of the resulting movie is not as high as if it had been produced in post-production, although it still serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> Although it may not be everyone's cup of tea, Hidden Frontier deserves a good dose, although it might be better to start watching season three, as this is where the producers really start to hit pace .
