This film is one of my favorites of all time. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr ... who cast. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. The drama, the action, the adventure and the comedy united in one. The final scene of the battle still gives me the chills and the ending always leaves me in tears. If you haven't seen it, I would highly recommend it.
