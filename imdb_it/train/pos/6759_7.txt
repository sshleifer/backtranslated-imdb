WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS deserves to be a best-known film directed by Otto Preminger, the man who gave the world LAURA. And this time he has the same co-stars: DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY. It must be said that Tierney here is underutilized in what is more of a supporting role while the spotlight is on Andrews. <br /> <br /> Play a tough, tough cop who is used to dealing with a bunch of thugs too vigorously until he accidentally kills a man in the process of arresting him one night. When the suspect falls on a taxi driver (TOM TULLY), he accompanies the investigation into the murder but begins to feel guilty because he is in love with the taxi driver's daughter (GENE TIERNEY). Tierney, by the way, seems a bit too elegant for the girl who is playing here and doesn't seem to fit in with the squalid elements of the story. <br /> <br /> History takes a bad turn as the investigation goes deeper and it turns out that the murdered man had a silver platter on his head from his service as a war hero. Eventually, it turns into a moral tale with Andrews developing a conscience about his crime. <br /> <br /> It is fascinating as a noir film with performances capable of a supporting cast. A good voice in the noir field, with strength directed by Preminger and pleasantly played by Andrews and Tierney, despite the slight alteration of his character.
