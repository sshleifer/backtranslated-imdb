I saw this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and there was no dry eye at home. It is incredible to see not only what a fantastic person Darius is, but also how much the rest of the team is admirable and at such a young age. <br /> <br /> It also made me think of how disgusting MTV was, and rejected the opportunity to positively engage and inspire. It shows you if they are really interested in young people and their viewers. <br /> <br /> It is a true and wonderful story that warms your heart ... take your fabrics but it's nice to see how attentive and stimulating young people today can be.
