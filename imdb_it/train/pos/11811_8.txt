Dick Tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by Chester Gould. He is a plainclothes detective who tracks down a group of criminals, ranging from all kinds of visually original characters like Flattop to The Blank to Big Boy Caprice. (These criminals became so popular in the 1940s that Warner Bros. created their own version of Tracy-style villains in cartoons like those of Daffy Duck). Tracy's comics were known for their liberal use of firearms and up-to-date technological advances (especially the wristwatch communicator), which got a good deal of time on the screen in this excellent film. The music was wonderfully performed by Danny Elfman, and Madonna's original songs were interesting, but they weren't the high point of his career. It's strange because while watching the film and seeing the suspenseful moments, the film looks very similar to Batman because of Elfman's memorable sound for his pieces. <br /> <br /> I love the boy who speaks hard, Pacino acts like a great Boy Caprice (and that chin!), Madonna's version of nastiness, and cinematography and direction were impeccable. This film was made very professionally and contains a lot of great actors who have been known as great actors for a while before this film was made (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Van Dyke). The film was directed by Beatty himself, which was interesting. It's almost as if Beatty saw himself as Tracy in a past life or something like that because he really fit the part. <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie an 8/10 for everything that led to the cinema that was overlooked (for whatever reason). There have been tons of misunderstandings about the evaluation of this movie on IMDb, and I still don't understand why. The characters were completely original and vibrant, as were the style of the sets, the wardrobe, the lighting and everything in this film. Go buy it today. You will not regret.
