Three teenage girls in an incomplete triangular relationship. The base of the triangle is just there. At the top there is Marie, a serious, low and thin tomboy with a Belmondo type facial structure. His best friend is the physical and psychological opposite: coquettish, chubby - dare I say fat - and eager for his first kiss with a boy, but not quite ready for his first sexual encounter. Because of its beauty, the boys don't seem interested and they hurt it. <br /> <br /> The other leg of the apex is a beautiful blonde vamp "fille fatale". She is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming, performing at a competitive level. Marie sees her during a competition at the local public pool. Marie sneaks into the vampire's life using the desire to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument. The vampire has the reputation of being a whore, killing off with any young male orbiting her. Marie is not phased out of that reputation. Highlight reputation. <br /> <br /> The first semester is set. We will see a lot of synchronized swimming as we get to know the three girls. At the end the story leaves the synchronized swimming behind and focuses on the relationships upside down between the three. That's when unexpected things start happening. <br /> <br /> It is a trademark of French films that let the viewer lose his eyes of wisdom. This is no exception. Here it is on the ceilings and on the dying. Watch the movie to learn more. <br /> <br /> The director says that the use of synchronized swimming is decided. That sport for women only is a metaphor for a girl's life: beautiful and feminine on the surface while working hard and competitive below. A number of scenes guide this point: elegant moves and smiles for the audience, the legs clashing awkwardly under water. Even the title in French is suggestive: "prieuve", or octopus, suggests an individual having to juggle many pressures simultaneously.
