I wouldn't have known about this movie if it wasn't for his "surprise" Oscar nomination for best animated film. Fortunately, I managed to see this little animated treasure. <br /> <br /> The story is about child Brendan who was the nephew of the impotent and overprotective Abbot of the Kells township. The Abbot's main pre-occupation is to build a wall to protect Kells from attacks by the Vikings. One day, Aiden, Iona's famous illustrator, sought refuge with them. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes to the art of illustration and the lure of the outside world. Along the way, Brendan befriended the sprite of the Aisling White Forest, while trying to recover an ancient priceless crystal for the meticulous art of book illustration. <br /> <br /> "The secret of Kells" is different from most of the animation released these days. It is a return to the past as the illustrations are executed in rigorous geometric lines and designs without much care of realism, as much as symbolism. The movements of these lines recall the simplistic but fluid animation style used in the initial sequence of "Kung Fu Panda". However, it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of wonder for the public. The reds used in the Viking invasion sequence are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try to capture this silent gem of a movie. It is a welcome respite from all the absurd bombs of the current animated rates like "Monsters vs. Aliens" and the like. The sparse Celtic soundtrack is effective in evoking the sense of fantasy that it infuses in the film. OK, the story could be a bit superficial and the ending a little lacking. I would have liked to know more about the book Brendan and Aiden were working on. But the clear star of this film is clearly its amazing stylized work of art, which is said to be based on the artwork of the true book of Kells.
