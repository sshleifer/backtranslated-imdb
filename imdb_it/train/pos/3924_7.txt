This 1939 film by director John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti tells a fiction by young lawyer Abraham Lincoln, his (literally) proofs and his tribulations. It is a sentimental film, reasonably well done but hardly breathtaking. The casting of Henry Fonda in the role of Lincoln seems a mistake, because while the actor had the right aching qualities for the part, even with several inches of makeup and a fake nose it is too good for honest Abe, who was notoriously a householder . It's a good attempt by Fonda, who is nothing if not sincere, but his miscasting throws the whole film away. The supporting cast is excellent, though, and includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is too reverential in his way of treating Lincoln, which looks like a simple slave of a saint, and in the final scene the film goes much further.
