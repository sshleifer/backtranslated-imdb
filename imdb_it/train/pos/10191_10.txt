What is contained on this record is a first-rate performance of a frequency band. This record is NOT for the faint of heart ... the music is incredibly intense and VERY interesting. What you will learn when you watch this movie is just why Who has been so great for so long. It is true that their records were fantastic, but their shows were the best. In 1969, when this concert was shot, the screaming musicians who threw gelatinous beans to the Beatles were gone and the bands (and the audience) had adapted to performances of long and often surprising musical virtuosity - something that few viewers have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the era of Britney and Christina's canned music. What you learn especially here are the extraordinary things that can happen when talented musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try the concert, it's really great.
