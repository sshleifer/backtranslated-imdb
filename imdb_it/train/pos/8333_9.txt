IQ is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that puts the greatest and most profound scientific minds of the 20th century as Cupid's helpers. The juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this carefree but thoughtful film. You are not sure how to react because part of the time when you are seeing great scientists doing stupid things to cultivate budding love, but other times, you hear them discuss some of the deepest space / time puzzles of our age. The end result is a funny movie with surprises in everything. Walter Matthau is a perfect Einstein, Meg Ryan creates an eccentric and extravagant mathematician, and Tim Robbins revives the contradictions of a poorly educated workman who is fascinated by science. All together, they create a farcical journey through love and science, the mind and the heart.
