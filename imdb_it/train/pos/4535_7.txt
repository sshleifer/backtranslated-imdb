The first 50 minutes of this movie were pretty boring. He focused on the personal problems that Doyle had, including his sick wife, the death threats of his fans, an intrusive editor and feelings of guilt towards his mentally ill father. Although these subjects had a major impact on Doyle's life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes have been excellent. Finally we looked at Doyle's head, how he created Holmes and why he had to "kill" Holmes. The actors are excellent. Including the intriguing Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a compelling role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as Sherlock Holmes' "model", Dr. Bell. The locations are good, especially for a TV movie and the camera work is nice. If the first 50 minutes were good the last 40 minutes, this would have been a small masterpiece.
