"Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow" is a lot of fun. Like at least one other reviewer, I was, on numerous occasions, laughing out loud. Yellow is energetic, playful, self-aware, exploratory. Don't expect Bergman here. This film is about a young man in the first half of the 1960s in Sweden and the problems, laws * contradictions * that the nation and the world were facing. Sometimes Yellow seems to be a serious political-social documentary, with Lena, the main character, and others interviewing both ordinary people and politicians (for example Olaf Palme at home). Other times, Yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary. All the while, Yellow acts like a personal documentary exploring Lena's life - her family life, her loves, her political opinions, her vision of herself. Are you a complete person ?? complex, imperfect, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. And above all this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director, Sjöman, and his crew documenting themselves by documenting Lena. This is what really gives me yellow wings. Not only do they suddenly appear in some very funny moments and in some funny ways, reminding the spectator that it is fiction and artifice, but their presence is in itself another layer of the film; they are filming themselves filming themselves. Can I think of a music video of Bjork with the same quality ?? a music video on the creation of a music video, ad infinitum, with each iteration ever more strange and more comic. I think Sjöman had something similar in mind. While "Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow" may not be everyone's cup of tea, it's certainly smart, witty, refreshing, exuberant and authentic.
