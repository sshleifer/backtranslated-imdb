Erroll works for The Department of Public Safety and his job is to control sexual crimes. He sometimes pushes the line to his work and beats sexual offenders. I don't blame him but his boss is ready for him to retire so long Allison arrives. Erroll is now training her to do her job and it's like observing work. Allison is a little naive about work at first, but doesn't realize how much danger it really is and it's all Erroll's fault. He starts to go far with his obsession with finding a missing girl when his job is not to be a police officer. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty decent film about a fool who pushes the boundaries and works out his "field of practice". Erroll did a good job, but for Allison's safety. There is also a good mystery and just when I understood it, there was something else.
