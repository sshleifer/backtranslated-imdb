As someone has already said here, every scene in this film is a gem. Most movies are lucky to have a perfect scene, but director Jewison has hit a home run every time. The cast took the right script and also the musical settings of Dick Hyman and the other music made for a perfect match. It's hard to imagine how they kept their mood throughout the long production of a film. The comedy is subtle (above all), and the work with the camera reflects every little emotional bending of the narrative. Cher is such a natural comedy, Vincent Gardenia (whom I know mainly through the role of Frank Lorenzo in Tutti in famiglia until I saw him on this and then off Broadway in the 80s) deserved a much bigger celebrity than I never had, and Aiello the unlucky loser are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to complimenting this extraordinary cast. Has Jewison ever written about this movie? <br /> <br /> I'd like to read it. Hard to see why the average rating here on IMDb is so low ...
