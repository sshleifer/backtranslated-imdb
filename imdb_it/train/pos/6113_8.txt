After seeing "Marry the Mafia", I had almost lost faith in Korean film affairs. But this brought me back to my faith. <br /> <br /> A prominent female character who is a university student forced to teach the spoiled, rich but charismatic high school student boy. In reality it is the age of the female character. Through some hilarious quarrels, these two end up being great friends. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised that the newcomer Kwan sang had done his job with excellence. It was such a revelation !! Actress Kim ha nul was also fascinating as usual. <br /> <br /> This film has tried to avoid any clich√©s that can be seen in typical romantic comedies. And he didn't show us nude and useless sex scenes. It was brilliant, beautiful, fresh, it made me want to see it again. <br /> <br />
