Survived by "Braveheart" published the same year, the two dramas in costume make the comparison. I admit my prejudice against Mel Gibson, but I maintain a rational preference for "Rob Roy". Both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" irresistibly represent the history of the Scots in a bloody and romantic way. "Braveheart" is an epic prize for honor and individual courage and a refined fantasy of revenge. He is also melodramatic, anachronistic and maudlin. Notice his use of cornball in slow motion footage. His violence is both ugly and glorious. It is this last quality that makes it more attractive for the adolescent mentality. While "Braveheart" exceeds "Rob Roy" to maximum levels of carnage (not to mention his indulgent execution time), this latest film is ultimately more mature and satisfying. His action is more discreet, but more surprising and intelligent. His sex is less flashy, yet more erotic. "Rob Roy" also has a better romantic interest. His dialogue attempts to approximate the poetry of the period. His rotten teeth in the mouths of the actors try to approximate the dentistry of the time. And Tim Roth is a superlative villain. Also recommended: "The Last of the Mohicans" and "The Patriot". You can find the latter more like "Braveheart" with its emphasis on blood lust, with the former more like "Rob Roy" in tone. All the films above deserve their R ratings for violence.
