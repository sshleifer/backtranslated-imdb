I just saw "Of Human Bondage" for the first time a few days ago and WOW! What a mysterious and almost ghostly film. I liked how the music went with the rhythm of every step of Philip's feet. It gave me the creeps for some reason ... <br /> <br /> One of the greatest aspects of this film is that you see Bette Davis appearing in itself right in front of your eyes. She's fantastic, not necessarily because this is her best work, but because she was so out of the ordinary to be so cruel, gritty and resolute as an actress in 1934 ... Bette was a person who took risks, always wanted to be different and this is right when he started to realize that he could be as bad and daring as he wanted and people would have loved her for it. If you are a true lover of cinema, it is incredible to see ... <br /> <br /> He had only one way to offer a line that made the part, and the film of the rest, belonged to it. Like "A mass of music and fire ... it's me ... an old kazoo and some streamers" or "But you're Blanche, you're in that chair!" or "WITH ALL MY HEART, STILL I LOVE THE MAN I KILLED !!" ... These are taken from some of his films, but you have my direction. She was simply so brave, impertinent and exotic with those beautiful big eyes. After seeing this, I can't believe it was redone twice ... <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard was beautiful ... so calm and persistent, that she needs to be loved. I thought he was adorable and couldn't understand how everyone wasn't falling for him, but then again, everyone was ... except Mildred. He did a great job ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't like was something that was common with writing in the first few movies. They would make a character so hateful that it's almost unbelievable that someone actually falls in love with them. The performances were great, but in real life, Philip would never have been interested in Mildred. This is just the simple truth ... Look at it !!
