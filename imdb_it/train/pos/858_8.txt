This film has a core of rotten morality, and yet a bizarre sense of justice. So many of the regular Joes among us would love to "stick him to the man". The "MAN" in this case is represented by several different characters. Mr. Keller, whom Carla refers to his office. Later, Paul owes 70 years to Mr. Marchand, the club owner. And then there is Paolo's word officer. There seems to be so much question on the side story of this last character. Reviewers point to it as a weakness in an otherwise well-made underground table tennis game between our two protagonists, which increases in intensity until their lives change dramatically. They are grateful to each "MAN" agent. One or both could be fired, killed or imprisoned if they do not do as they are told. <br /> <br /> The film has a sense of relief at the end. Carla is finally fucked. His boss is forced to be a jerk. The owner of the club is a messy mess in his bathroom. They get $ cash. And ... they don't have to worry about reporting to the Word Warden, because HIS moral weakness leads him to set his errant wife in the basement (or whatever the police found to arrest him). It is a critical subconscious trigger on the bolt that hurts us so closely. It doesn't matter that someone else can get Paul's file later to supervise his release; for the moment they are free! They could even get away with it! <br /> <br /> Woohoo ... <br /> <br /> COMBINE IT WITH MEN!
