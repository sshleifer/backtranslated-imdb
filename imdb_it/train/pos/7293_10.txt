What do I say about a movie so beautiful? I saw it at Atlanta, Georgia Dragoncon, considering this is my main city. I am very fond of science fiction and I like action movies. I happened to be up all night and was almost ready to call it a day when I noticed this movie playing in the morning. This is not a science fiction or action movie of any kind. Let me start by saying that I'm not a fan of Witchblade or Eric Etebari, after seeing some episodes (his performance at that time seemed stale and robotic). But he really managed to win me over in this performance. I really want to conquer. Having seen Cellular, I didn't think there was much to do for this guy. But his interpretation of Kasadya was simply incredible. He was extremely convincing as an evil demon. But there were so many details in depth in this character that I was absolutely amazed. Later I searched for it online and found out that Eric won the Best Actor Award, which he deserved considering his best career and earned my respect. Now I keep reading the story of this and the production of this project and I would just like to say that I didn't pay attention to them (I'm sorry Brian). They were very well done but I was even more impressed by the story - which I think was even more its goal (seeing movies like Godzilla with huge effects really drove me crazy). I could not sleep after this movie thinking back over and over in my head. The situation of an abusive family is never easy. I showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because she hit her for living with the abuse. This is a film I constantly think about and I would highly recommend it.
