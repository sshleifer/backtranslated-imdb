It was hard for me to believe all the negative comments about this all-star movie. I laughed at the whole picture, like all my family. The film was clearly an old gangster comedy - the players were hysterical - I bet they had a good old time while they did it. Of course Goldblum and Dreyfuss were fantastic - and what about those Everly sisters, each of the two Falcons and the divine music in everything. Rob Reiner made a great limousine driver laughing, and Gabriel Byrne a ridiculous neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, the character of Sleepy Joe and all the mortuary and burrowing references. Paul Anka was his usual amusement, with the added attraction of running scared after Byrne decided to do a duet on his "My Way", welcome home for Vick's performance. <br /> <br /> I am of the opinion that this film was a comic tribute to Frank Sinatra and friends; Dreyfuss did the same good. I am also of the opinion that no one, of any age, can even think of imitating the actions that took place in this film - it's a joke - not a terrifying "gangsta" movie. The cars and clothes were impressive, as was the decorative "Vic's Place". Really, I think of "Mad Dog Time" as a musical comedy, less harmful than many cartoons, crime dramas, and talk shows. I would recommend the video for an evening of family entertainment.
