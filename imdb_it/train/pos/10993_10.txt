This film is a jewel because it moves with a soft but firm resolution. <br /> <br /> I warn viewers that although it is advertised as a corporate Spy thriller and Ms. Liu is there, she moves with a resolute but calm rhythm dexterity. It is NOT about explosions, car chases or flying bullets. You must be patient and instead, note the details here. He is calm because he is the main character. The viewer must watch it and think as this story unfolds. <br /> <br /> I will not give spoilers - because this destroys the point of view. The plot is what you read from other posts: a white collar type, looking for changes and adventures, signing for a corporate espionage job. Just go somewhere and record and secretly transmit the data inside. <br /> <br /> Take it from there. <br /> <br /> This film starts from a surreal walk - with a background of corporate disillusionment that is intertwined with fundamental and fundamental suburban paranoia. <br /> <br /> Then start accelerating. <br /> <br /> Acting on all sides is superb ... and yes, some of the acts are caricatured characters. But they all fit and have fun. And the slight rhyme of the piano in the background is simply perfect as the soft, tender and sinister theme: everything is not right at the beginning. <br /> <br /> And in the end: not everything is what it seems. <Br /> <br /> Make yourself comfortable and turn off the lights to see this - and turn up the volume: this movie wants LISTEN.
