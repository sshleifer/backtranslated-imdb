Come on people. This movie is better than 4. I can see this happening ... wealthy people have done crazier things than this. And it was fun. <br /> <br /> I watch a comedy to entertain, escape for a while from the pressures of the world and not have to take something too seriously. This film is perfectly suited for this purpose. I judge a film for its merits and I'm not going to compare Surviving Christmas to Blazing Saddles. I saw totally dysfunctional people growing up in caring and nice people who could easily live on the street from my home. Will remain on my list of "favorites ..... must watch for the holiday season". If you just want to have 90 minutes of fun, watch this.
