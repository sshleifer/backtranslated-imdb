I'm disappointed by the lack of post on this amazing and effective little movie. Jordi Mollà, probably best known for his role as Diego in "Blow" Writes, directed and stars by Ted Demme. <br /> <br /> I will not be giving away any plot points, as the film (at least for me) was very exciting not to have heard about it .. If you have a netflix account, or you have access to a video store would take it ... I highly recommend it. It's a crazy, fun and sometimes very stimulating creation. <br /> <br /> The direction of Mollà is * quite impressive and shows many promises. <br /> <br /> Unpredictable, with fantastic images and a great performance of lead pronounced in the splendid Spanish "No somos nadie" (God is on Air) is a fantastic film that you can show to your friends. <br /> <br /> SEE IT.
