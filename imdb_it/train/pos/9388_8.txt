Most likely your likely happiness readers, Cage and Hopper have met and fortunately not in a Lynch movie because RED ROCK WEST is much better than any Lynch movie ??. Nicolas Cage is a third actor, the porcelain is a femme fatale surrogate, only father Hopper is worse than ever. RED ROCK WEST is, despite its trivial cast, one of my favorite American thrillers; in a word, a thriller with some twists. <br /> <br /> We mainly notice the taste, the impressive rhythm, the chills, the beautiful suspense, the narrow and tight little ass of Lara Flynn Boyle, the enviable physical form of Cage (although undeniably ugly, with sharp bird features, thick eyebrows and thin and rare hair, Cage showed a nice overall shape ??), the consummate routine of Hopper, some moderately but really amusing moments, Cage's game with his desired character, stiff charm, Hopper's psychopath, Lara's nastiness, Cage looks like a vagabond, the clumsy archetype of noir cinema, hungry, hard if necessary, naive, dirty, tired. Lara Flynn Boyle plays the seductive and cold seductress, Walsh as her ruthless husband, and Hopper as the killer Lynchian he has already done before. <br /> <br /> Cage really looks rather dazed or dazed or very confused and having a severe hangover. But this could be his normal appearance.
