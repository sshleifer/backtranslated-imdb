I would say it's time, this film was fantastic ... and yes, if you don't feel like becoming a Christian, then why bother looking at it. I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it very moving. Now I see that they have taken these films to another level and created the Left Behind series ... they have a close comparison and certainly are more modern to reach people. I think that to really judge this film, you should see it ,,, there are 3 or 4 in the series if I'm not mistaken ... don't use our comments to judge, watch the movie alone! ! God will bless you if that's why you're looking at them.
