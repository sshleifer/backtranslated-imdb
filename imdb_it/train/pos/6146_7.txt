Maybe Disney was hoping for another Mary Poppins but this is a very different story and while Angela is delightful she was a very different performer from the great Julie Andrews. That being said, Lansbury is perfectly launched and offers a magical performance. There is something delicious about her character and she is given wonderful support by David Tomlinson. Tomilinson can carry a melody but it is certainly not a singing chop. It doesn't matter that he was such a gifted actor that he barely notices. There are some great cameos of beloved stars of other times like Roddy McDowel who offers a winning performance and the much loved Tessie OShea who does very little, but it's nice to see the old girl again. It's also nice to see Sam Jaffe and the British television king Bruce Forsythe in small roles. The soundtrack contains a couple of beautiful songs, especially The briny sea and The age of Not Believing. The large number of Portabello Road is stretched to the limit but has a lot of theatricality. The effects seem a little clich√© today, but the scene with the German invaders attacked by the wildest army in the film is quite impressive. Children are not as annoying as other films, but one struggles to understand what the younger boy is saying. I loved the marching song of the home army. The house guard was very important to Britain and this is a warm tribute. The entertainment is delicious, much better than the Pixar I find grotesque. A warm and happy film and it is a wonder that it has not been done on stage.
