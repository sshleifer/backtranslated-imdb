A truly unique Sci-Fi animated film, and I truly love uniqueness, no matter how it tends, better or worse. This French film is quite interesting to watch, the technical part is innovative, like "Waking Life" that I saw recently. <br /> <br /> It took me a while to get used to the Black-White style, but in the end I like it, the sketch-shaped images are really imaginative! The future contracted world is a symbol of the final destination of the human race which I adore very much. <br /> <br /> The whole plot is good for a Sci-Fi, it's not so intriguing but it's fine, like some Hollywood products, a gigantic conspiracy about human eternity, a little clich√© and the twisted ending it is not so convincing, some developments are simply too clear and insipid, and the whole film is too long. <br /> <br /> So I think I am I fell in love with the style that this film shows, others are not so good. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the eternity of life, I think most people have come unanimously that we don't want eternity because it demolishes the meaning of life, we treasure our lives because they are limited and significant, if everyone can live forever, so the world will become a disaster and a chaos. Leaving someone you love is harsh and heartbreaking, but it is also a way to show that our lives are genuine and all emotions satisfy your life and make the world colorful and vibrant.
