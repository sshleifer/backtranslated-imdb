This is a smart drama about living in a honky tonk of Texas in the early 1980s. John Travolta and Debra Winger make two very believable shows like Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really opens up the country music scene and helped introduce America into the mechanical bull. If you love a good romantic movie, you will love this movie.
