This film, as cheap as it is, is one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. If you accept it as a low budget right from the start, you can appreciate how beautiful a story is, how well written the script is and how fantastic the director was to produce something so wonderful with so little money. > <br /> All the elements of a great film are here. The images, even if taken digitally, were wonderful in some places. The bizarre and dreamy atmosphere of the film is captured particularly well in the scene with the talking dog, that scene was simply fantastic. It's such an exciting job, but not pretentiously done, and that's why I have a lot of respect for this film. It comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and appealing, and unlike many of the repetitive movies that are out there.
