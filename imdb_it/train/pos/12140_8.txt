** SPOILER ALERT ** W. Somerset Maugham classic at the cinema about a young man obsessed with love who is abused hurt and humiliated by the object of his obsession to the point of losing everything he has only to find true love in the end under the more unusual circumstances. <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard plays the role of Philip Carey, a sensitive young woman who tries to make a living by selling her paintings. Told by a local art expert that his work is not good enough to be sold to public art, Philip decides to return to his native England and study medicine and become a doctor to help others. <br /> <br /> Philip was born with a baseball bat and is very hypersensitive to his uncomfortable condition and compensates for this by being a very pleasant and friendly person. One afternoon Philip is in a local bar with a fellow medical student and sees the pretty maid Mildred Rogers, Bette Davis, and immediately falls in love with her. Mildred at first rejects Philip who loves love, but later realizes how uncomfortable he is about his feelings for her. Mildred plunges him into poverty by buying his gifts and bringing her to the theater every time he leaves work. Phlip also falls on his studies, paying so much attention to Mildred, at the medical university, and fails the final exams. <br /> <br /> Coming to life, buying an engagement ring for Mildred in an attempt to claim his hand in marriage, Mildred's cold heart tells the bewildered Philip that she is already engaged to Emil Miller, Alan Hale. It turns out that he is one of the customers at the bar he always hangs out with. <br /> <br /> Philip broke and fell ill of heart slowly regaining his life and later resumed his medical examination and passed and at the same time found a new love in Nora, Fay Johnson, a writer for a local love magazine. Later in the shock and surprise of Philip, Mildred returns to his life. <br /> <br /> Mildred tells Philip that her husband Emil, who is the child he is transporting, threw her out of the house has the kindness and understanding that Philip brings her back at Nora's expense which was very much in love with him. Later it turns out that Mildred was not married to Emil but had a child out of wedlock having an illicit affair with him! Emil turns out he was already married. <br /> <br /> As before, Mildred takes advantage of Philip's kind heart for her and her baby girl, where she supports them with care and medical care for food, to the point where she is still ruined and cannot continue his studies ending with her leaving Philip; after having a very warm and emotional encounter with him. On the streets with nowhere to go Philip is greeted by Mr. Athanly, Reginald Owens, who once took care of the hospital and falls in love with his daughter Sally, Frances Dee. <br /> <br /> Subsequently Philip corrected the club foot in the medical center and with the help of Mr. Athenly returns to be a doctor. It is then that he meets Mildred again who is really at the end of his rope. Dying of tuberculosis and losing her daughter is all alone with anyone to take care of her. Philip is now doing well and respected in medical circles. He does everything possible to help the poor and sick Mildred but eventually succumbs to his illness and dies. <br /> <br /> Mildred had the love and devotion in Philip all those years in which he was in love with her, but chose to abuse him and have relations with a man who was just like her, cold, insensitive and selfish. In the end, Mildred is back just what she gave to the kind and sensitive Philip: she became unloved and alone. Philip found in the sweet and caring Sally all that Mildred was not and eventually found the true love he was looking for all his life.
