I liked the film, first of all because it told an interesting story, but the story told in the film seemed to have been condensed from a much longer story. Since the book is over 400 pages, this makes sense. It extends over a period of time from the 20s to the 70s, in an imaginary South American country, even a lot to adapt to the time available. I think it would have been much better as a six-hour mini series than it was a 140-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Even if it is rushed, the story does not jump so much that it becomes confusing. What is said is said quite well. One flaw is that Clara's supernatural powers appear inconsistently; or they should have appeared more evenly throughout the film, or they should have been left out. Two other flaws (which could be spoilers): the eventual return to Esteban's goodness happens a little too suddenly, and Ferula's curse seems to vanish, even if the tone of the story suggests that it should last forever. <br /> <br /> Acting is excellent. Glenn Close, like the tormented spinster Ferula, is exceptional. Jeremy Irons, like the brutal man rich in cars, is also excellent. Meryl Streep, like Clara's main character, is fantastic, even though she is often even better than her in this film. There were also many well-executed minor roles. The biggest flaw is that the film seemed to lack a dialectal coach; every actor seemed to speak in a different kind of accent.
