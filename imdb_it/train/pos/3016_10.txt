For those who like their mysterious murders, this is definitely the one to see, as it is chock full of interesting and suspicious characters, many of them rich types of Long Island socialites. As a star detective, William Powell is alternately starchy and inspired, sometimes acting as if he and his suit were going to the cleaners and press together. Mary Astor is adorable here. <br /> <br /> Powell made his career in the lead role, Philo Vance, in a series of films made in a couple of studios for several years. In the midst of these films he developed a somewhat unusual romantic role, sometimes even testing roles as a gentleman gangster. Already middle-aged, he got stuck in a kind of career roadway when it arrived. As with so many stars of the first talkies, it seemed that the time had come, that he was fine for the first films of the era of the Prohibition Depression, but that with the changing times he was perhaps too mature and dandyish to bear. <br /> <br /> The Kennel Murder Case, directed by the neglected criminal Michael Curtiz, is one of the last "old Powells", while the following year heralds the first of the new ones, The Thin Man, whose success would catapult his protagonists in the Hollywood stratosphere. In Kennel we can still see films in a somewhat rigid, ritualized pattern, because the camera doesn't move much, with acting, like presentation, tending to theatrical. There is nothing wrong with this approach, though, that has its appeal. It gives the film a baroque quality.
