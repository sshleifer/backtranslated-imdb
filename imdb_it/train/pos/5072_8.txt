Pierce Brosnan will probably be the only familiar thing in Richard Attenborough's new biopic. The rest is new to the international public: Canadian history and the culture of the first nations. <br /> <br /> "Gray Owl" is a thorough examination of how a man was adopted in northern Ontario's Ojibway, learning and preaching environmentalism decades before it became politically correct to do so. The film contains a love story, a moral message and a man tortured by his past. That torture, however, is not always brought back to life with the dramatic impact it could have. <br /> <br /> However, it is a film that holds its audience without any violence. He deeply respects the First Nations of Canada and presents them in a dignified and non-stereotyped way. Brosnan's performance is rather harsh, but I suspect that it is precisely the way Lord Attenborough wanted it. <br /> <br /> Thanks to a proud Canadian.
