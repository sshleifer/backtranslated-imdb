Dumland focuses on the lives of a (American?) Family ... The father; a violent and obscene person who loves farting and using vulgarity and who has no redeeming qualities. The mother; whoever seems to be a paranoid psychotic never says much. Son; a dark and boring little repetitive. The animation is simple and raw, but it brings together the stories and characters. The episodes were originally available only from the davidlynch.com website, but have now been released on DVD. On the DVD there are 8 episodes and follows a brief synopsis: <br /> <br /> 1- The neighbor: we meet the neighbor and discover three things about him ... he has a nice shed, he has only one arm and he likes doing bad things with ducks. <br /> <br /> 2- The treadmill: we find out that the wife has an affinity for the exercise, but the husband doesn't really think it's a good idea. In the end, the exercise treadmill is victorious. <br /> <br /> 3- The doctor: The father has an unfortunate accident with an exposed wire exposed ... the doctor's examination is quite thorough (if not unconventional) but the diagnosis is "you're perfectly normal "(but we knew it). <br /> <br /> 4- A friend visits: after an altercation with the new hoist, a friend comes to visit him (believe it or not, he has one! but after meeting him we can understand why), without surprises when tells us what his hobbies are. <br /> <br /> 5- Get The Stick: we meet another neighbor, he has a stick stuck to his mouth (although we never find out how he got there). Unfortunately, removing the stick from the mouth of his neighbor ends up being harder (and more violent) than expected ... but in the end he is victorious ... Jesus some people can be ungrateful !!! <br /> <br /> 6- My Teeth Are Bleeding: this was my favorite episode ... and it was also the most incredibly repetitive and annoying (hmm, what does it say about me ??). I'm not sure why his son's teeth started to bleed, but believe me when I say it was minimal for the plot of the story. Which is an oxymoron, since the plot had no plot. But he had a funny ending (involving a fly) !! <br /> <br /> 7- Uncle Bob: After meeting Uncle Bob and Uncle Bob's wife, we have the distinct feeling that Dumbland's gene pool is very superficial. Uncle Bob is a sickly man (I won't, so as not to ruin everything for you). Uncle Bob's wife definitely wears her family's trousers ... and the father surely ends up on the wrong side of his large fist (and spends the rest of their visit curled up in a tree in the back yard). <br /> 8- Ants: After the house has infiltrated with ants, and a failed attempt to disinfect the insects goes wrong ... it ends up spraying itself in the face with the spray and starts to hallucinate. The ants put on a fabulous song and a dance show ... it goes crazy trying to kill them, it ends up in a plaster full of body ... and lets just say that the ants take their revenge in the end. <br /> <br /> As bad as these stories are, there is something that forced me to look at them. They give another insight into the mind of one of my favorite directors. David Lynch. Perhaps they were an outlet for him, to get rid of some of his violent thoughts ?? I actually laughed out loud at many points in the episodes. Many aspects are ridiculously funny !!
