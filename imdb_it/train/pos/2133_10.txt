I lost count of how many times I saw this movie - I probably know the whole dialogue back - yet I am repeatedly attracted to it. <br /> <br /> Set in Hungary, a young Jimmy Stewart plays the appropriate bachelor "Kralik" who becomes the secret admirer of Margaret Sullavan's innocent "Klara". Kralik becomes Klara's pen friend secretly, and at work together Klara trusts Kralik with the contents of his letters (Kralik). Clearly Kralik is annoyed with Klara - but he is unable to express his feelings while competing with the "pen-friend". Confused? Well, you won't be - this story has a sweet, almost sugary ending - but we all know it's the ending we all want. <br /> <br /> Other noteworthy characters are Frank Morgan who plays his usual role, this time as the shop owner "Hugo Matuschek", Felix Bressart as "Pirovitch", Kralik's confidant. Joseph Schildkraut as the arrogant "Vadas", so well interpreted, that you can't help but hate him from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Finally William Tracy who manages to become attached to all of us with his confident upstart of a "Pepi Katona" junior store. <br /> <br /> Recently reworked as "You've Got Mail" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan for me is not as good as the original - although I suspect a younger audience would disagree. <br /> <br /> If this movie is in your area during the Christmas season, I suggest you pour yourself a nice glass of wine, put a log on the fire and have a box of Kleenex at hand.
