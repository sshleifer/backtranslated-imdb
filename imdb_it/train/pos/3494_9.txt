For what it is, "Raising Victor Vargas" is closer to the perfection that a film can achieve. O pure genius of a beginner or one of those lucky mixes in which everything has clicked (probably some of each), this simple little ethnic love film of urban life is enriched with young characters with such a depth that you can almost read the their minds. The film begins with a strong "street" flavor, but makes its way into a Latin family affair and then focuses on a story that talks about the volumes on the uncertainty of youth and the deeply natural desire to love another. In my experience, it has never been done so much with so little (cast of tyros, novice director, etc.). Praised by critics but not for everyone, "Raising Victor Vargas" is recommended for indie and realist lovers in simple tales rich in humanity. (A)
