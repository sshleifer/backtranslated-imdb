Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style. Gena Rowland gives a splendid interpretation of a declining actress, who deals with success, aging, loneliness ... and alcoholism. Try to escape his subconscious ghosts, embodied by the specter of a girl's death. The acceptance of oneself, of the human condition, despite its general difficulties, is the real purpose of the film. The parallel between the theater sequences and the film itself is disconcerting: it is as if the stage becomes a way out for the heroine. If all American films could be of the highest quality, deal with human relationships at an adult level, don't try to infantilize and standardize feelings ... One of the best dramas of all time. 10/10.
