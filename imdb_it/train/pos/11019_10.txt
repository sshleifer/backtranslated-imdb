Cliffhanger is what appears to be the last action movie of Slyvester Stallone before becoming such an undervalued actor. He is a mountaineer who has to help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries who want them to find three suitcases carrying over 100 million dollars. It has a fantastic action sequence, a fun at the edge of the place and a great time at the cinema.
