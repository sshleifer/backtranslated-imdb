This is a great story of family loyalty which, fortunately, does not resort to the usual tricks (or at least those that I am used to seeing in American and European films) of supersentimentality or high dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> It is very watchable and very lovable. It has a beautiful photograph, but it is not based only on the one to entertain.
