This film works because it is so genuine. The plot is simple and realistic, perfectly captures the joys and anxieties of adolescent love and sexuality that many of us have experienced during our adolescence. <br /> <br /> Actors are as natural as the figures in a documentary but are as convincing and charismatic as seasoned performers. The dialogue is fresh and honest ... and fortunately it has not been filled to the brim with cults references to pop culture. Furthermore, cinematography is both gritty and beautiful, giving life to the Lower East Side in a very tangible way. <br /> <br /> Artistically, I love this film because it reminds me of the great Italian neo - realism films like The Bicycle Thief and La Strada. Movies rarely feel "real" like this ... or like Bicycle Thief. And the only other film I've seen that deals with adolescent sexuality with the same level of seriousness is Elia Kazan's Splendor in the Grass. Writer / director Peter Sollett deserves enormous praise. This film is a nice achievement. On a personal level, I am always happy to see a film that treats members of ethnic America with love and respect. As an Italian American, I hate the way my people go to the movies (like a racist genius, a womanizer, a criminal in an irritatingly popular epic), and my aggravation of this count makes me acutely sensitive to other groups and their terrible screen. 'silver representations. Hispanics and Asians in particular seem cursed to play villains in westerns and action movies. (Good thing Gong Li did not try to become famous in America!) <br /> <br /> Of course, thanks mainly to the increase in indie images and the influence of Miramax, we are seeing some other images on ethnic characters here and there ... but Raising Victor Vargas is easily one of the best. While I really like my Big Fat Greek wedding, it is a refreshing change that Raising Victor Vargas is interpreted directly (with less exaggerated and generously drawn characters) while being very funny in itself. Long last! Noteworthy Latin characters. I have the feeling that this is a film that will be remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course, now that you have made this wonderful photo of a family from the Dominican Republic, I hope that Peter Sollett will organize a film about Italians soon! :) - Marc DiPaolo
