Sarah Silverman is a dangerous bitch! She is beautiful, sexy, funny and talented, dark and demonic. I read the other "comment" on this show, as well as the material on the bulletin board and people just don't understand. Nothing that appears on T.V. it's an accident. Too much money, time and work are put into the production of a T.V. because there are errors. This show is stupid because Sarah wanted him to be stupid. This show is youthful because Sarah wanted him to be young. I thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre. It looks a lot like the Pee-Wee's Playhouse for the maladjusted, sniffing windy idler, Future Pornstars of America from the Valley. The cast is fantastic. Scenarios and actions are well tailored. I hope this show has been successful since Comedy Central didn't allow David Spade to hold his show. Who plays Sarah's sister? It's not on the cast list on the show's home page. I'd like to see you standing. Does anyone know of his upcoming appointments or DVDs that could be around?
