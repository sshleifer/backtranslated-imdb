This time, Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Gonzo and Camilla have finished college and starred in a musical that they are trying to get on Broadway. After failing miserably in causing it to be produced, they separated and separated. I love characters and cameos. The songs in the film are "Together Again", "Look at Me, Here I Am", "Saying Goodbye", "And I'm Going to Always Love You", "Rat Jazz" and "He Make Make Me Happy" " Frank Oz directs this film in an excellent way and all the actors do a great job behaving like the Muppets are real. Watch it! 91 minutes. G rating. My rating: A.
