Ronald Coleman is extraordinarily in the city and is presented here as in his other films. It is literally in every scene and this comic film remains fresh because of it, not in spite of him. He is handsome, witty and very intelligent here, while he remains one step ahead of his lovely wife, played to perfection by Anna Lee. The film is based on a French game and brings all the best qualities of that farce. Most of the support cast is well known, at least for the face if not for the name ... and they are absolutely perfect for this very funny movie. The fantastic Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable while always one step ahead of the other characters. His multi-talents can be further appreciated in the classic "Lost Horizon" that every movie fan should see.
