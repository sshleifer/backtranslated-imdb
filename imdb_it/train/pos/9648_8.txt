I really enjoyed this movie. The story jumps back and forth a little and is not easy to follow. There is no solution to the story, and you are left to wonder what really happened. Since I like that kind of movie I really enjoyed it. I particularly like the "dating" scenes between the boys and I was drawn to their lives. And of course any film with a bare Staphane Rideau will receive a couple of extra points. ;-)
