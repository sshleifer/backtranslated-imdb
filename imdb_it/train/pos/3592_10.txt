Another powerful chicken shot. This time, it revolves around Diana Gusman who is always fighting at school. Instead of being expelled, he takes his anger somewhere else in the ring. He trains to be a boxer and meets Adrian feather there and starts falling in love with him. This film has a powerful message to take your dreams and go with them even if someone doesn't believe in you (in this case, his father doesn't believe in her). This alone makes the film worthy of the price. To enjoy
