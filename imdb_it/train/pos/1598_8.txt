O o, I love the suspension of any terrific storyline in this movie. I have visited it many times and it always holds. A bit too stylized for some, but I imagine any opera lover will love it. Norman Jewison, a Canadian colleague, has enormous possibilities with his films and casting and almost always pays off in movies that are off-center and somehow delicious, like this one. I have often wondered about the scarcity of Cher's acting roles, whether she has chosen to play down this part of her life or not have enough chewing roles. I found her a superb actress who can retire in a role, as in this particular or be strong, bold and fierce as in "Mask". I found ample comic traits sometimes (a hairdresser called "Cinderella") but this was the intent of both the writer and the director. Nicolas Page recites the anguished tenor of the opera, all extravagant gestures, at a certain point he asks for a knife to cut his throat. Brooklyn scenes are magical, this is a Brooklyn under the moon, romantic and dramatic, just like the opera. All in all a very satisfying film, not for everyone's taste, for a long shot, I loved the finale, all gathered together like a Greek choir, every part subtly blurred and blurred with the others, the camera moving away down the hall , leaving the players talking. 8 out of 10.
