In the hands of minor actors of Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan this film may have become silly and trivial. But, with these two experienced actors who led the way, I found "Silent Fury" a small, exciting and pleasant mystery. When their marriage is interrupted by a stranger who claims that Colbert is already married and that he is the best man in that marriage, one can sense that there is a sort of plot against her at work. Colbert, Ryan and his lawyer have tried to refute the request of strangers from a previous marriage, they are satisfied at every step with further evidence that seems to reinforce the claim that she is really already married. Although it is not very difficult to understand who is the main "bad guy", it is still a lot of fun with the intensity and the rhythm of the story. All in all, a good, solid and mysterious film with excellent performances by the two main actors and an excellent supporting cast including Paul Kelly, often underestimated.
