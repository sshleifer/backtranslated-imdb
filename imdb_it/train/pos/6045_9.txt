I was in the film too, but I don't know if they actually added this scene. On the way back from a school trip (in 2005) we stopped at a service station at the same time as they were making the film, and we were asked (all of us) to come in and shout Go! Free bird! We were about 10 years old, anyone who could see the film would tell me if that part was actually contained in the film, it would be nice to know! I remember thinking that the film had never come out, because another 2 and a half years had passed before it was published. All your comments seem to be good so I guess it was a hit movie, I could buy it, but first I'd like to know if I'm in it! : D Thanks
