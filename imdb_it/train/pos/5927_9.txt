Stephen King's movies are fun with me. I really love them or hate them. I didn't like some of the more elaborate productions (like Desperation and Storm of the Century). Some of the smaller ones, I really loved. Sleepwalkers is one I really like and I watch it regularly. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are sleepwalkers, creatures that change shape and, although apparently human, turn into feline creatures. They are immune to the scratching of cats and every time they move to a new city, you set traps to capture and kill animals. When they move to their last city, they need to look for a virgin and when Charles finds one, he falls in love with her, but her mother needs to feed on her to keep her strength. The story revolves around what will happen with the girl. Will save her or use her to save her mother. <br /> <br /> Although this story has nuances of incest that some may find unattractive, it actually has a role in the story and therefore is not only plonked in the film for the scandal. Like most Stephen King stories, it is based on a small city with many interesting characters. The acting is not the best, nor the special effects, however, somehow, everything tends to "freeze" and is a very watchable and pleasant adaptation. <br /> <br /> For UK readers: this production has most recently been shown on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller / Horror.
