We always watch American films with their particular accents from each region (south, west, etc.). We have the same here. All foreigners have to watch this film and need to have an open mind to accept another culture, besides the American and European one that almost dominate the film industry. <br /> <br /> This film tells us about a parallel world that is not even meant for those who live in a big city like Sao Paulo. All the actors are improvising and they are very realistic. The camera gives us an idea of ​​their confused world, the loneliness of each character and invites us to share their world. <br /> <br /> It's a real great movie and the worst of a rental has it at home too.
