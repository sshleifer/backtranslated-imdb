While many have unfortunately passed, the ballroom scene is still very much alive and continues to carry on their legacy. Some are still very much alive and well enough, Octavia is more radiant and beautiful than ever, Willi Ninja is very skilled and gives great support to the gay community as a whole, Pepper Labeija just gone through natural causes last year peace. After Anji's death, Carmen became the mother of the Xtravaganza house (it was in the beach scene) and she too is more and more adorable. Some balls have categories dedicated to those who have passed, they can all rest in peace. There is currently another ongoing project known as "How Do I Look?", You can check the website at www.howdoilooknyc.org.
