Okay, I have to admit that I've never seen "Rhoda" and only one or two episodes of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show". Although I don't know anything about this duo of comedic talents, I have always loved this movie. <br /> <br /> Mary returns to work. Rose tries his luck to become a comedian. Rhoda struggles with a photographic career. And Meredith ... what are you doing again? These three stories that we follow for more than two hours are fun and entertaining in their own way. When the two old friends get together, it just makes the movie better. <br /> <br /> I was surprised how nice it was to write. The little jokes Mary and Rhoda threw were fun. The script was very well done. <br /> <br /> I have seen Moore and Harper in other films in recent years and I thought they were very good. But I had no idea that they worked well as a team. While both actresses do their part to satisfy the title of this film, they never seem to disappoint me. (During the run of this movie.) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan play their roles well but nothing exceptional. The rest of the cast like Jonah, Cecile and ... everyone else works well together. <br /> <br /> As this is a meeting, you would expect a fan of both shows to enjoy this. I still liked this little meeting from a non-fan. A good storyline for each character and the two main characters is what makes this movie very good. (Even the most recent version of the acronym MTM doesn't hurt).
