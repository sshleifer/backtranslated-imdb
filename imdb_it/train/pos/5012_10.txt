In April 1965, CBS broadcast the first of Barbra Streisand's special television specials. The show was not just a hit, but also got 5 Emmy awards. This is one of the most memorable moments of television in the 60s and (unfortunately) the kind of television special that they no longer produce. Filled with wonderful songs and a spectacular Barbra performance, this special is a must see for all Streisand fans and anyone interested in the first television.
