Even though I've loved ghost movies like Amityville and Poltergeist, this adaptation for the television adaptation of Susan Hills' packs of books is a huge punch on Hollywood's horrors. <br /> <br /> With a brilliant cast (many of whom are Heartbeat and other TV dramas), great acting and a fantastic setting (which convincingly portrays life in 1920), it has all the right ingredients to entice the viewer in what is a powerful ghost story. <br /> <br /> Herbert Wise did not need blood, violence or blood to send chills up the thorns of an audience. Using your imagination, the woman in black is a figure of fear and terror and whose presence is never absent when it appears for the first time. <br /> <br /> The main character Arthur Kidd, a lawyer, learns of his invisible specter in his mission to fix the estate. The widow dies and Arthur spends a few nights in his squalid house where he notices many oddities, which could torment him for a few days. Some scenes are very disturbing and claustrophobic, in particular the closed room that opens, which turns off the generator and closes Arthur in the darkness. The film becomes more heartbreaking the more you put yourself in Arthurs' shoes, and your efforts to drive out this ghost. The writer puts many chilling additions into the story, an example is the re-appearance of the tin soldier. One is eager to learn the meaning of all this. The fact that we never learn much about the widow leaves more to the imagination and makes everything even more disturbing. <br /> <br /> The widow for the most part seems vicious and intimidating. The scene after wrapping the generator made me shudder, a woman who appears out of nowhere on an isolated marshy land with a howling wind ?? having been on these properties, I can appreciate how insulating it is. And the scene in the inn was perhaps the most horrible thing I saw, one I didn't want to see in a hurry or show to elderly relatives. I often woke up at night thinking I was behind me in my sleep. <br /> <br /> The Woman In Black is a great TV movie and a lost gem. I agree to some extent that the Internet's hype for this film was totally exaggerated and I can understand why people were disappointed after spending the best of Â£ 50 on it, but I think the network defeated the gems hidden because it makes films like these overexposed. I think it's still brilliant and fantastically performed and I consider it the greatest ghost story of the last century.
