Not many things happen in this film, but many meanings. The woman thought she had everything she could in life, but it wasn't true, and she discovered herself when she met this person who was conducting research for her next job. There should be more types of movies like this, I'm not even that old as considered "mature" (im 13 by the way) and I still got the idea and the point of the movie. The main point is in my opinion: DO NOT THINK OF NOT HAVING A BETTER LIFE, ONLY BECAUSE YOU ARE AT THIS TIME. <br /> <br /> Although I must admit that I was thinking of watching another movie but after reading all the reviews and seeing the trailer, I decided on this, even though I knew it wouldn't do much in the film. I recommend anyone to watch this movie because it has some very good points in the film, and it's really a good ending.
