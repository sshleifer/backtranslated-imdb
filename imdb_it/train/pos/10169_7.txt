Over Her Dead Body was a good movie. It was unobtrusive and fun, despite being quite funny. There were a few clich√©s, but I found most of the cool stuff. At first I didn't think it would be good at all when it started. If you can get over the first 20 minutes, the film starts to get more interesting. This movie was not burst into a hilarious laugh, and it wasn't OH MY GOSH wonderful. It was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy as much as it was fun. I don't see how bad this film was. The assessment is just a little too low. Could I have faced a 5.5 but a 4.8? Furthermore, giving this film a 1 is shameful. It was pretty good, and there was nothing horrible enough to give it a 1, which is what most people gave.
