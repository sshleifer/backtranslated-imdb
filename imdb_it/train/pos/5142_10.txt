It's easy to make really generic comments about a movie like this. The fact that he is one of the only remaining Japanese films of this era makes people say that "he started Japanese cinema" and is "unlike anything the West has ever done".

But the style had to be imitated and does not detract from the importance of this film. What we have here is of experimental and composition themes built on already established visual styles, opening the door to a truly brilliant stratification of narrative and reality.
