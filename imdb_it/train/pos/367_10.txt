"The Color Purple" is truly amazing. There is no one like this, and I don't think there will ever be. It is a roll of emotions and pain that the viewer takes. The actors are impeccable and the direction is superb. I absolutely loved it. A film never made me so happy. It's beautiful, this is the best way to explain it.
