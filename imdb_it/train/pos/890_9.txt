This is an excellent Sammo Hung movie. In fact, this is a great piece of Hong Kong action cinema. The story tells the story of pedicab pilots in Macau in search of love and confusion with a vicious pimp. The performances are excellent and the characters are all nice and well defined. The story is engaging and has enough romance, drama, comedy and suspense to keep one watching between fight scenes. Sammo Hung demonstrates here that he is probably the best fighting choreographer in the business world. The action is simply incredible, esp. the fight with Lau Kar Leung and the finale. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are fantastic. A must see for any action fan.
