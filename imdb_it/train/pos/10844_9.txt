This reminded me of Spinal Tap, to a more serious level. It's the story of a band that does a reunion tour, but things aren't in harmony with each other. I was particularly struck by Bill Nighy's performance as Ray. You felt sorry for him, yet he had a certain anxiety towards him. It's a great movie to watch if you've ever seen your favorite band get wrinkled, old and pathetic. Softened, highly recommended ..
