I just don't understand why this movie is fighting here. Jeez. It's unreasonable, it's not lucid and it's (as I'm reading) wasted on some. The cast of this film plays their characters on the "T" (If you looked at Midnight permanently and became a fan of Ben Stiller, then yes, you will be disappointed). These are misunderstood misunderstandings and well-intentioned people who try to save the city / the world with nothing but grit and determination. The problem is that they don't realize their limits until the big showdown and that's the point! This is the triple of the movie in which The Spy Who Shagged Me was filmed by the same demographic, probably the same people who hear the first AP movie turn pale compared to the sequel. I just don't understand. The beats work on more than one level; if you haven't understood it, I know what level you are.
