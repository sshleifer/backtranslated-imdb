The Running Man is often dismissed as another Arnie action thriller full of explosions, bad word games and gunshots, and to be honest, there's a lot of that. People used to watch it and compare it to the Terminator series, saying it was one of the poorest Schwarzenegger movies. <br /> <br /> But give us 18 years and you feel able to appreciate it in a different light. Rather than just another mindless action movie, it works very well as a parody of TV reality. It is very different from Stephen King's book, it is true, but I doubt that Hollywood, with its love for optimistic tweaks and the so-called 'ordinary boys' who have proved capable of a trained command, would have accepted it in its current form. <br /> <br /> But, with the review. <br /> <br /> Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cop who works in the dystopian United States where democracy is a thing of the past, and the whole country is governed by a government / aggregation of media conglomerates. The economy is in tatters, food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameplay to watch, like Jumping for Dollars, where people throw themselves for money on a pit of rabid dogs, and the most popular is The Running Man , a gameshow hosted by the slimy Damian Killian (played by the entertaining Richard Dawson) in which the alleged "criminals" are hunted down by theatrical stalkers and slaves of slaves. <br /> <br /> Some, however, try and speak against the government. When a group of hungry people held a protest in the city of Bakersfield, California, a helicopter piloted by Richards was sent to "calm" (ie kill) the protest. When Richards refuses to fire innocent people, he is arrested and framed for murdering people in the crowd. He is sentenced to a slave labor camp, but escapes with the help of a resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and goes on the run. <br /> <br /> However, his freedom does not last long, and after having kidnapped the network the employee Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso) in an attempt to escape those who persecute him, finds himself again a prisoner, but this time is forced to appear in The Running Man. <br /> <br /> And there, of course, the whole movie kicks off with the standard Arnie mode. Richards is thrown into the post-apocalyptic desolate land of Los Angeles (why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) And forced to run away from the "stalkers", along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labor camp with him. Amber also becomes curious about Richards' protests of innocence and discovers that he has been framed. Guess what happens to her then? So while Amber, Richards and the other two go around trying to avoid the stalkers, we soon realize that Richards is not an ordinary cop. It is the Super Arnie, the elusive army of a single man who can bring down the corporate evil dictatorships and fight the obese men covered with Christmas lights despite being just your average American boy with an Austrian accent. <br /> <br /> Yes, the rest of the film becomes stupid, loud, classic of the 80s, Arnie's fun. There are a lot of exciting fight sequences, the fearsome punks of trademark ("He had to split" being my favorite), and the general final formidable clash and happy ending. It's very fun to watch Killian react in the typical "host" way of the game, and some of the show's funniest moments revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd like the seemingly benevolent guest (watch out for the damn old lady!) And the cold, sincere man who is actually going to do everything to increase the ratings. <br /> <br /> If you expect an intelligent and high-level film, you will be disappointed. But if you want a fantastic 80s movie, well, this is it. But the great thing about this film is that it was quite prophetic. <br /> <br /> If you look at the fun we have today, you will have noticed the way today's TV is going, shows with people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame, and the producers too much willing to let them humble on TV. It is not too far to imagine that some vile TV out there tried to get the right to show people that they were executed live on TV. We have already had this, however, with the gruesome beheading videos of al-Qaida hostages published on the Internet. It seems that in the current climate, at least some people are perfectly well looking at the real death on their television sets. <br /> <br /> Keeping this in mind, and in addition to the fact that everything that these days seems to be a revival of the 80s, you must be struck by the foresight of this film. Of course, we haven't arrived there yet, because they are terrorists, rather than the mainstream media, who have bought us programs that are easily available with the real human death, but you just have to ask me how long it will take before some execs decide to see if they can find a way to launch a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and the desire to satisfy their morbid curiosity ...
