Fabulous actors, wonderful landscapes, raw reality. I will not process all comments from other reviewers because you get the picture! However, the film is not for the picky. The reality is slaughtering pigs and other animals to survive. I also have the home book of Elinore Randall Stewart. I read it several years ago, I have to read it again, since I have just seen the new remastered DVD of the film. <br /> <br /> I tried to buy the video for several years, I finally bought it from a video store that has gone out of business. But Yippee! The DVD is now for sale, I bought it on amazon.com. It's not cheap, but it's worth it. This is a film I will watch until the end of my days!
