A hilarious comedy Neil Simon that evokes laughter from beginning to end. The late Walter Matthau is the former grumpy comedian who is persuaded to join his former partner (the late Oscar winner George Burns) for a last reunion show on stage. <br /> <br /> Benjamin Martin is Matthau's agent and nephew, and the two have the same chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I love Matthau's grumpy character - he is just the same as ever, and also very different. <br /> <br /> Burns, like the distracted old man, is just as fun as Matthau. <Br /> <br /> Matthau: Do you want crackers? I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: How about a simple cracker? <br /> <br /> Matthau: I didn't understand. I took coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: Okay <br /> <br /> Matthau: I'm in the kitchen cupboard. <br /> <br /> Burns: Maybe later. <br /> <br /> Or what about this: <br /> <br /> Matthau: When I made the black, the whites knew what I was saying! <br /> <br /> You have to see it in the movie to understand it! <br /> <br /> All in all, a fresh, exhilarating, sweet, heartfelt, warm, believable comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time. <br /> <br /> They simply don't make them any more! In an age when all the most recent comedies are crude, youthful and stupid, this leans towards the tender core of what comedy really is: funny characters, intelligent and funny dialogues and great entertainment. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedies of all time, right there with "Planes, Trains and Cars", "Lethal Weapon" and "The Hard Way". <br /> <br /> You may find it difficult to find this for rent or on TV, but believe me, it will be worth it! <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5 stars. <br /> <br /> - John Ulmer
