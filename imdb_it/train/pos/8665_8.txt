I took this title by mistake with the Grindhouse Vol. 1 collection of pure Euro-trash films. But this film has a nice stamp of approval and should deserve a better transfer than it is out there. Stupedno is not ... satisfying! Watching this movie I couldn't help but wonder ... why did Sergio Martino not make this film? This one has his signature on everything and punctuated by Edwedge Fenech (alas it's not known as it should be, but he got a nice cameo in Hostel II). Double crosses and triple cross below and cement this film from beginning to end with Lee Van Cleef exuding freshness under pressure from the first second. Did this guy have to go to Italy to finally reach his potential or did the studio system get this guy through? In addition to Lee's more recognizable films, film-goers should try this size-tailored and see as if Sergio Leone would have lowered his epic scale on Once Upon a Time in America at half the running time (and 1/4 of the budget) this is how it would have been. So refreshing, it should be taken during the day at home and do it for a matinee sofa
