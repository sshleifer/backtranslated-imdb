According to the motion to do this in a movie, it would be great !! I was also amazed by the plot and the construction of the character in this game. I've played it again and again (over 20 times) just to try something different and it gets more and more interesting every time. Final Fantasy eats your heart !! THIS MUST BE MADE IN A FILM !!!!! If someone out there wants help to start a petition for turning it into a movie, please contact me. I'd like to help with that project every day. The graphics are great for PS1 and it also makes you forget that it is the PS1 most of the time. The multitude of side quests makes it different every time you play.
