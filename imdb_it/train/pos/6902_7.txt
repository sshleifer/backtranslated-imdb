This is a modest comedy inspired by the characters, filmed in Brazil with a small budget. The premise is familiar, the same as in the 1950s movie Danny Kaye ** On the Double **: someone who, like a joke, makes an impression of a famous person, is pushed to impersonate the Person for real. <br /> <br /> The contrast between the two leads is very effective. Raul Julia, the German-Paradorian secret policeman, is tall, cold, threatening and Latin. It sports a deliberately obvious blond dyeing job. Richard Dreyfus, animated, short, Jewish from New York, is likeable and likeable. There are many references and jokes about the entertainment world. <br /> <br /> The setting is clearly modeled in Paraguay. Paraguay was in fact ruled from the early fifties until the end of the eighties by General Alfredo Stroessner, an unelected military dictator whose father had emigrated from Germany. But writer / director Mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he paints Parador / Paraguay as a typical Latin American tyranny, with enormous disparities in wealth and an active guerrilla uprising. Later on this line, Mazursky stages comedian Jonathan Winters as an American pensioner who is actually C.I.A. head of the Parador station and a figure so powerful that he can give the president of the country a clumsy bite. <br /> <br /> In fact, the United States has little influence in Paraguay, which is largely without the social and racial tensions seen elsewhere in the region. This is due to the fact that the country has fought long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The male population was almost wiped out both times, but the emerged society was patriotic, racially homogeneous and strongly united. <br /> <br /> On another level, there is a bow to feminism in the form of the Madonna character. Interpreted by Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, Madonna is a former nightclub dancer who is the body's presidential pleasure girl at the beginning of the film but is seen on television as the president herself at the end - now politically and aesthetically correct, without make-up rude hair pulled back, dragged into the office by a velvet revolution. <br /> <br /> The only time that such an event happened in Latin America, the administration of Isabel Peron, in Argentina (not her beloved Evita, who was never in office) lasted two years after the death of her husband, the legendary ** supreme ** Juan Peron.
