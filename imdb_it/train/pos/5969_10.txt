This film is a kind of Carrie meets Heavy Metal. This is a high school boy who is chosen by many and avenges himself totally with the help of a Heavy Metal ghost. it is such a classic. The soundtrack is A ++++. You have living legends on Metal. And Marc Price was great in this movie. This is a must for metal fans.
