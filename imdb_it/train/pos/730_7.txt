I liked this movie I remember there was a very well done scene in this movie where Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) lies in his smoking bed and then starts to see that the Ramones are in the room with her singing the song "I Want You Around" ... very interesting things. <br /> <br /> It was fun, energetic, eccentric and cool. Yes, I will admit that the ending is a very exaggerated and exaggerated way ... but it doesn't matter because it's fun this is a very funny movie. It's Sex, Pot and Rock n Rocll forever <br /> <br /> I read that Cheap Trick was the band that was originally the star of this .. But I don't know if this is true or not
