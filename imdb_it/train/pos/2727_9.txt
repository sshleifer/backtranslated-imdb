One of the best honest films ever made and very faithful to the book by Truman Capote who invented the genre of the real crime novel. He attended the soundtrack of Quincy Jones and terrifying acting by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry, the murderers. Because Wilson didn't become a big star after this movie was a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> The film and the black and white editing of this film are top notch. The re-creation of the murders is terrifying and since it leaves the real murders to your imagination, even more frightening than if they had shown that the gun was firing. The film was shot in the current Clutter house that had been sold to another person after the murders. The film has a very documentary feel - in addition to the Clutter royal house scenes, other scenes were shot in petrol stations and shops where the killers went. Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is also in the film. Will Geer has a great turning point as a prosecutor in the short trial scene, which is not only filmed in the royal court, but has many of the real Clutter murder jurors who consider themselves the film's jury. <br /> <br /> This is a solid, scary movie whenever you see it.
