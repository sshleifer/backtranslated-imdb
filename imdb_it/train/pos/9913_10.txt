Besides being an extremely fun film, I can add that the costumes and the scenery were wonderful. This kind and fun-loving woman had a great deal of money. Unfortunately, he also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on his money. This woman was alone since the death of her husband. He had proposed them to a theater that would have been torn down. To prevent it, he bought it. His daughters were afraid to throw away "their" money and decided to act. Even the protagonists of this film were a great advantage. I would give almost anything to get a copy of this film in my video library, but at the moment it has never been released. Sad.
