I am and was very amused by the film. It was my favorite movie of all time of 1976. Having grown up in the 70s, I was so in love with the look and attitude of Kris Kristoffersons, obviously I'm not a film critic, but for the time, I think it was very good. I really like the Streisand and Kristofferson combo. I thought they worked very well together. I've seen the movie many times and I still love the two of them like Esther and John Norman. I'm a huge Kris fan and I see him in concert when I can. What a talented singer, writer, not to mention the actor. I've seen it in many movies, but I still think about A star was born.
