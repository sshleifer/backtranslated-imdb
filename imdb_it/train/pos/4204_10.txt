and anyone watching this film will agree. This film was directed in the days when the plot, the credibility of the character and the theme really mattered. <br /> <br /> Jean Peters, Widmark and Thelma Ritter steal the spotlight. Ritter is in excellent shape as a "Moe" informant survives in the Bowery section of New York, acting as a stool for the New York police. <br /> <br /> The only other film in which I saw Peters is "Niagara" and certainly demonstrates his acting ability here, complete with the Brooklyn accent. Widmark is appropriately threatening, like the anti-hero who must discern what is the right thing, despite his need for money. <br /> <br /> The photography is brilliant. The neon, the subway station (although it looks cleaner than the real thing!) The harbor hut where Widmark lives as a transient. The excellent use of the city, with "Lightning Louie" in Chinatown; the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here; the political climate of the time is a disturbing background. 10/10.
