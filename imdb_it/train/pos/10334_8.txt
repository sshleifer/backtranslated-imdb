He never saw this film on TCM until recently and he found this story about Poland and a small city that had to suffer with the Nazi occupation of local cities, just like many other European cities, for example: Norway . The First World War was over and the people in this city still suffered from their lost soldiers and the wounded that the war always creates. Alexander Knox, (Wilhelm Gimm) "Gorky Park" returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in the city. He was raised in a German and was not very happy with the Polish people and they too did not fully accept him. As Hitler's party grew to power, Wilhelm Grimm wanted to become a Nazi to return and punish this small Polish city for their treatment of him that was really all in his mind. Marsha Hunt, (Marja Pacierkowski), "Chloe's Prayer", played an exceptional role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with Whilhelm Gimm. There are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the Nazis destroyed people's families and their entire lives. The cattle cars are shown in this image with Jewish people making their way to the Nazi gas chambers. If you haven't seen this movie and you like this topic, dedicate some of your time; this film is very realistic for a 1944 film and a story that you won't forget too quickly.
