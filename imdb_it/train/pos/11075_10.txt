After reading the reviews for this film, I understandably started looking at it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be good. However, this is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Most of the reviews I've read, said the complicated plot made it too difficult to follow. And while some parts leave you confused, the ending squeezes so many pending parts that you want to kick yourself because you've lost so much. It's not like "Lock, Stock ..." or "Snatch" in the sense that it's not so funny (in fact, it's rather dark), and it's much smarter, in the way you see parts of scenes from different points of view (and, in one of the best scenes in the film, Jason Statham spends five minutes in the elevator with a discussion with himself). The way it is similar to the two films I just mentioned is that it is full of memorable characters, particularly Statham, who offers a fantastic starring role, and Ray Liotta, who spends most of the film on Speedos, but offers however a great performance. If you have time and time to think about the film, and even watch it again, you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are on display in the film. I think it's great, and that Guy Ritchie is a director on top of his game.
