I saw this movie for the first time about 4 years ago and I was expecting something fun, similar to CB4. I was amazed. I was on the floor laughing my ass this movie is so beautiful. Much better than CB4, the characters, the songs, the plot, everything. High-level independent film that was given "Two Thumbs UP" by Siskel and Egbert (and if two old white people understand humor in this film, you know it's good).
