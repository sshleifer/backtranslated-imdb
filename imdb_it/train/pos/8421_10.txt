Josef Von Sternberg directs this magnificent silent film on silent Hollywood and the former imperial general to the Russian tsar who found himself there. Emil Jannings won a well-deserved Oscar, in part, for his role as general, which ironically was chosen for a silent film as a Russian general. The film returns to its days in Russia leading to the fall of the country towards the revolutionaries. William Powell makes his big screen debut as a Hollywood director who projects Jannings in his film. The film serves as an interesting look at the fall of Russia and an imitation of Tinseltown behind the scenes in the early days. Von Sternberg still offers another classic, and one that is full of great elements of romance, intrigue and tragedy.
