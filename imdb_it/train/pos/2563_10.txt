I saw several comments here on Brando using a Southern accent, some of which they thought was a mistake. When this film was made, racism and discrimination were very strong in the south. Jim Crow's laws were still in effect. Civil rights were in its infancy. Could this have been perhaps a subtle social comment, a man from the South in love with a woman of another race? Similarly, was MASH a subtle criticism of the Vietnam War? Some idea? <br /> <br /> Another comment was made on Myoshi Umeki which appears "cold". Anyone in Japan would have understood. The Japanese people, at least in my experience, did not tend to show emotions in front of strangers. There were strict social rules, especially for men who met single women. Americans in Japan were totally unrelated to this culture, and the outspoken attempts to meet women were shocking to women. A characteristic of the Japanese was to smile when embarrassed or uncomfortable, which many US military took as a sign that their progress was welcomed. He also recalls that at the time represented in the film, Japan had just been defeated and the occupation forces had been treated with reluctant acceptance. I think Myoshi Umeki gave a very credible performance on what his situation would be. Watching his interaction with American actors brought back several memories of my experiences in the country. I was able to meet a couple of adorable young ladies who, after convincing me that I was not a typical American male, taught me their language and culture during my time in their country.
