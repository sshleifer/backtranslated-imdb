THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is proof that the great genius Orson Welles could direct a "mainstream" film if he wanted to. Compared to his other more artistic works, this film has only a fair amount of cunning, and almost no esoteric elements. <br /> <br /> The exception is, of course, the final scene in the hall of mirrors, widely accepted to be one of the greatest scenes in the film's history. The cost of a rent alone is worth it. <br /> <br /> The sweet surprise was the splendid acting of the beautiful Rita Hayworth. His acting at the beginning and the middle of the film is so excellent that he made the other actors look like caricatures instead of characters. Even the great Mr. Welles.
