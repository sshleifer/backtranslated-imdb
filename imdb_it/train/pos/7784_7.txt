It was fabulous! Combined photography, editing, cinematography, music take us to the dangerous side of a tourist destination. It was the enjoyment of "slumming", without going through danger. We were there! The dream sequences and the flashback sequence ending were cool. He spoke to me. Keep up the good job! Another of that kind is City of God. Also - don't laugh! - the comedy, Desperately Seeking Susan. Nice types of ensembles, with great performances by everyone. Sorry, I think Training Day is also suitable for this genre, with fantastic performances by an ensemble cast. I had to change channels in some of the gritty sequences, but overall, a great movie!
