A formidable adventure trainer, the director George Stevens (before devoting himself to more serious subjects such as I REMEMBER MAMA of 1948 and GIANT of 1956) which established the standard for all future yarns to be followed. Freely inspired by Rudyard Kipling's poem, GUNGA DIN follows the journey of three military officers in 19th-century India. The noble trio must challenge a series of battles and other various dangers including a cult of the thuggee and a temple full of gold. Their adventures on screen remain electrifying even after more than six decades and have lent inspiration to almost everything, from the space space inspired by Cliffhanger STAR WARS (1977) to the same RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC (1981). <br /> <br /> The main reason for the success of the image, however, is the perfect performance of the trio of extremely charismatic actors in the film. Victor McLaglen was rarely better than Cary Grant, the latest comedy film, and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr is a reckless hero as imaginable, perhaps even more than rival Errol Flynn. The chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved, and this warm and believable camaraderie is exactly what most modern action images lack - and they receive enormous support from the wonderful Sam Jaffe, who overcomes the obvious physical mixture and makes the title character a beacon of human sweetness and silent strength. A huge success in his time (the film would have been the second biggest money maker of 1939 behind the scandalous success GONE WITH THE WIND), and undoubtedly remains the best film of its kind.
