Perfect cast for a drama in a few people. Simon is dead but somehow resurrected from the outside. What he saw there is displayed in the form of empty spaces orchestrated by a magnificent score by the German avant-garde composer Werner Henze. Simon is haunted by his death, comforted by the support of the dead people he had seen on the other side. His girlfriend tries to keep him alive but, unable to do so, he decides to follow him after his final death. Very touchy and moving, profoundly psychological, but a little slow and somewhere even boring.
