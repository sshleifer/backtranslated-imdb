If it had been done before in the Zatoichi series, it could have been one of the best. It's pretty good, like most of them, but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the series at this point. The situation is strangely intriguing: the peasants of the province have two champions, a benevolent leader (for once) and a philosopher-samurai who begins a kind of Grange; both clash with the usual local gangsters, who want to fail the crops because they increase their gaming revenue and their chances of doing some land; their chief or powerful ally is an apparent Puritan who died for drinking and gambling, but secretly indulges his own perverted appetites. (It also looks like Dracula, as the villains in Zatoichi's later films tend to do more and more). These characters have enough meaning to deserve to be placed against Zatoichi as it was originally designed, but by now it has lost many of its nuances, and changes in some of the characters, such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man Zatoichi killed, they need more time than the film has to give, so that the story seems mute, as if some scenes were missing. In addition to this, the film shows the virtues of most of the others in the series: good acting, sometimes lyrical photography, creating a vivid, credible and uniquely recognizable landscape (whose absence is evident in the occasional episode in which the director it is lacking) and a technical quality that by its very nature masquerades: the imaginatively varied use of limited sets, so their limits do not seem to exist. And of course there is the main actor, whose presence, as far as his performance is concerned, makes everything work. This must be one of the most sustained series in the history of cinema.
