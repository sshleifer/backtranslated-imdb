This film is rather poor, but I attribute it at least trying to provide a description of its principles. There are some great moments in the film and the dialogue also has some good moments. <br /> <br /> The aerial assault sequence is perhaps the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> I believe I am I like the idea of ​​how long a veteran will last for a veteran. Of course, it's not all very well done, but the premise is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> Tom
