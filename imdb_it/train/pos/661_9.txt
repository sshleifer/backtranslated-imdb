I have, I have, a homicidal maniac! This lively tour-de-force adaptation of a great EC Comics horror story is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable TV series ever made. Director Robert ("Back to the Future") Zemeckis takes the best from a witty screenplay by Fred ("Night of the Snakes", "The Monster Team") Dekker focused on a ruthless two-stroke housewife (played by Mary Ellen Trainor , who was married to Zemeckis when she starred in this episode) who kills her husband's jilted jerk (a nice cameo by Marshall Bell) on Christmas Eve, hitting her head with fire-poker. Complications occur when a mad crazy murderer disguises himself as a young man Kris Kringle escapes from a nearby mental hospital and decides to pay Trainor a decidedly hostile visit. The ghostly soundtrack by Alan Silvestri and the typical and refined cinematography of Dean Cundey further improve the macabre fun. And Larry Drake (the sweet and sweet giant Benny on "L.A. Law"!), With his haunting sobbing sob, a demented twinkle in his luminous green eyes, and a mischievous and genuinely evil grin, makes a sensational bloody Saint Nick.
