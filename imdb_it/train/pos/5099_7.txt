The only reason I came across this film is that it is on the DVD LITTLE MISS MARKER and I recommend watching it even if you don't like it as well as the best-known movie. <br /> <br /> We have Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard as a scam and his partner. The film starts off fairly light, but becomes more dramatic when Coop plans to use his daughter to extort a considerable sum of money from his brother-in-law, but meeting the girl and seeing the discipline she would be subjected to with her brother -in-law to keep it. However, he has difficulty staying on the straight path and therefore the drama develops. <br /> <br /> Cooper and Lombard are good and Shirley still manages to steal the scenes she is in. There is little music in this, and Shirley has only one song. However this is fun and worth looking at together with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
