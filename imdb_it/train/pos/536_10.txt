Few films can be seen almost 60 years later, but they remain as compelling as this. Technological advances have not overcome this classic love story. The special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 film. The acting is superb. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey do an exceptional job. The use of Black and White / Color adds to the creative nature of the film. He has not been seen on television for 20 years, so few people are aware of his existence. It's my favorite movie of all time. Waiting and hoping for the DVD release of this film for so many years is, in itself, "a matter of life and death".
