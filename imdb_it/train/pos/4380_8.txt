This is an undervalued action film / drama and slightly historical. <br /> <br /> The basic story is about Rob Roy's 1000 pound loan, theft and the problems he causes his family and indirectly his clan members. <br /> <br /> Cunningham (Tim Roth) is a villain and incredible character in this story. Brutally cold and if you look at his face he seems to be able to look away and look completely wicked. <br /> <br /> Even Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is excellent, but I think the writers used the word "honor" 1 too many times. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strong, and the whole film is very well acted and filmed. <br /> <br /> The Action is exciting and the sword plays very realistic, but not too bloody. The story is good and you really want Rob to win. <br /> <br /> All in all, just a classic.
