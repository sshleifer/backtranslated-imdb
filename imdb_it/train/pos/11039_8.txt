This is what I would call a good horror. With occult / supernatural subtitles, this beautiful low budget French film caught my attention from the first scene. This shows that you don't need wild FX or a lot of blood to make an effective horror movie. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around 4 cell mates in a prison, and each of these characters (and their motivations) gradually become more interesting, as the film increases the tension until the finale. Most of the action we see through the eyes of Carrere, who has just entered the prison and must get used to living with these other 3 inmates. <br /> <br /> I won't say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen. There are some flaws though: FX are not so good, but they are used effectively; the plot leaves some mysteries open; and things get very confused towards the end, but Malefique is redeemed from the moment it is finished. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very nice film, 8/10
