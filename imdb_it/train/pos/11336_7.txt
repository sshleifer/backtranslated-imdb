Answer: despite the fact that this film was written and directed by a woman, your ex is more disturbing, meaner and more irrational than any other zombie that ever threw the earth. <br /> <br /> The acting in this independent film is actually quite good, despite the far from wonderful script. It takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten line, clich√© and make it vaguely believable. The young Anthony de Marco, in the role of Jake, offers a particularly good performance. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the plot of this film is much better than dialogue. Try it, especially if you are not a huge fan. This is NOT a horror movie. Although all adult females are rather monstrous, and although all adult males behave as if their brains were eaten in some previous zombie movies, "Jake's Closet" is suitable for mature adults. <br /> <br /> This time, everything is much better than the sum of its parts.
