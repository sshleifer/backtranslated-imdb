I'm not entirely sure if the term "serious comedy" applies to this film, I'm not even sure if this can be applied. In recent years, cinemas have become full of comic films that are too stupid to make us smile. Therefore, I considered films that do not meet these requirements as "series comedies". <br /> <br /> Does the 40-year-old virgin fit into this guild? This is up to you, but I think it's a very funny movie. You can laugh a lot, plus it offers you a social commentary through really fantastic characters and situations. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty, there's more than a 40-year-old virgin out there, and even people who don't fit exactly with these specifications might feel identified by one of the characters in the movie, especially the men . <br /> <br /> The story, as the title says, talks about Andy, a shy and silent guy who gathers action figures, looks at Survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band is Asia. <br /> <br /> Kal is Andy's collaborator at SmartTech. He believes that Andy is a psychopath until Andy's secret is revealed. Kal is clearly a sexual pervert, yet he seems to get what he wants with the opposite genre. <br /> <br /> David is the passionate guy who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, who ran away with another boy. And Jay, a man in a relationship that seems to be influenced by his constant cheating and acts of capture. <br /> <br /> I am pretty sure that most young people from 13 to 21 have already seen this film, but in reality it has no age limit to be able to appreciate it. So, in case you haven't seen it and you'll enjoy a little laugh, with social commentary, then go to your video store and rest from those deep and depressing independent films. <br /> <br /> Also includes bonus DVDs that you will really see from top to bottom.
