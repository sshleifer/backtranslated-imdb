To prevent his homosexual friend Albert (Perry King) from being deported to Belgium, Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry him. The only other problem with this is that Stella herself is a lesbian. The two have their lives separated when one night after Albert's birthday party, they fall into bed and then into love. Later in the film, after falling in love, Stella suspects Albert of cheating and shows up for work late one night after closing. What you find will leave the viewer stunned. This is a great film, very original. Perry King and Meg Foster are so good in their roles that it's incredible that they weren't better recognized for their work here. Very controversial on its release in 1978, the film with the "R" is now "PG" in this much more liberal period. <br /> <br /> Recently released on DVD, the disc contains a "Making Of" segment on special features and it states that the film was based on a real story, so viewers say the movie is not "real" they are wrong. Everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons - these are the questions explored in this wonderful film for all those who have ever loved!
