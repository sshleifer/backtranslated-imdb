I don't know why people think this is such a bad movie. He has a pretty good storyline, some good deeds, and the change of position for Harry doesn't hurt either of them either. Certainly some of his offensive and free but this is not the only film of the genre. Eastwood is in good shape as Dirty Harry, and in this film I liked Pat Hingle as the town cop. If you liked DIRTY HARRY, you should see this, it's much better than THE DEAD POOL. 4/5
