If you are the type of person who is looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and credible story, then this movie is NOT for you. No - you will hate him. However, for those who like sweet and slightly fucking comedies, then you'll have fun watching this light movie. <br /> <br /> Tony Randall works for the IRS and investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file a tax return. As much as you try to convince them of the seriousness of your visit, everyone in the family is excited to have company. They are part of him and treat him like one of the family ... and they plan to have him tied to their daughter, Debbie Reynolds. This is really all the plot there is. But the film gets a high score for a funny script and decent acting. A really cute little curiosity from the late 1950s.
