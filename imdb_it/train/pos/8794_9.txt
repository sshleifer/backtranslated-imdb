Chang Cheh's "Shaolin Temple" could very well be the high-water brand of the Shaw Brothers martial arts film series. This compelling kung fu epic boasts an incredible cast - a true who's who of the Shaw team. Although the plot is fairly standard and the choreography of the fight is superb as usual, it's the way Cheh treats the topic that makes this film remarkable and fun. The sense of reverence shown for the history and traditions of the Shaolin Temple is palpable in every frame. Not unlike William Keighley's paean for the legendary Fighting 69th in that same eponymous film or John Ford's greeting at West Point on "The Long Gray Line", Cheh's Shaolin Temple is a lovingly crafted ode to the same style. <br /> <br /> The cultural correlation I am tempted to do is to compare the Shaolin Temple to the Alamo. Watching this film will give you the same admired and nostalgic feelings that you lived many years ago in the history of elementary school when you heard about the courage and sacrifice of those condemned heroes of the Alamo. At the end of the film, you too could be tempted to call, Remember the Shaolin Temple!
