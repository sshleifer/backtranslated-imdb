A sophisticated contemporary fable about the stresses that work to dissolve and ultimately dispel marriage vows. The main thrust of the story stems from a "homily" pronounced by a country priest who follows the wedding vows of a young Milanese cosmopolitan couple. In it, the future course of marriage is stated, which little by little touches the stress of modern life. The "moral" of this story within a story is that, for a marriage to resolve itself, both now and in the past, it was necessary that this relationship be supported by family and friends. This film was a relative blockbuster for Italian national standards. It is a pity that this film is not available on DVD or VHS.
