This documentary (now available for free on Video.Google.Com) is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everyone has to see this. <br /> <br /> Chavez was elected by an overwhelming vote in 1998. His platform was to divert the fantastic oil wealth from 20% of the middle class to 80% of the poor. It has prohibited fishing with driftnets in Venezuelan waters. He sent 10,000 Cuban doctors to the slums to treat the sick for free. It has wiped out illiteracy and created new free universities. <br /> <br /> But it was his 30% tax on oil company profits that got him in trouble with the Bush administration. In 2002, while Irish directors Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were interviewing Chavez inside the presidential palace about his social programs, a CIA-backed coup was launched. With the cameras running, Chavez was captured and taken out of the country. It was announced on national TV that he had "resigned". <br /> <br /> But the poor of Venezuela did not believe in the media. They went to the palace to millions and asked that Chavez be returned. Faced with such overwhelming numbers, the military turned on the coup leaders and the conspirators fled to the United States. Chavez was rescued from the military helicopter and returned in triumph.
