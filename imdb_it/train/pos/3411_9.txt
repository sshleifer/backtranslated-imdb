This is easily a 9. Michel Serrault, known more for comic roles in the early part of his acting career, does a stunning, even worrying, job of impersonating Dr Petiot, a legendary French serial killer. <br /> <br /> It is so believable in every moment of the film, that the actor completely disappears behind the character - only the best that has ever succeeded in achieving this feat, and when they do it is only in a handful of parts to the best. <Br /> <br /> The whole story (a true story that happened in the 20th century in France) is so powerful, so sinister - it's a very strong film that has been remembered for a long, long time.
