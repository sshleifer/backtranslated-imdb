Although this series has only run one season, it has been with me for 20 years. It was by far my favorite cartoon ever. I would give almost anything to have it on DVD or any format I can get. If you find any way to see this series, I suggest you take full advantage of it. This series was the first (in my opinion) that had a really consistent plot that extended over several episodes. It really made me interested in the characters and what happened to them. Hell, the Goose character really scared me sometimes. It was just so weird at the time. The group leader also reminds me a lot of a combination of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If anyone has any way of contacting the creator / rights holder of the series and can get them out on DVD, please, absolutely!
