"Cut" is a full-tilt parody of the slasher genre and as a whole achieves what it aims to do. Most of the standard slasher clich√©s are there; the creepy old house, the woods, the anonymous indestructible serial killer, the blood buckets and, of course, the couple interrupted by the killer while having sex (which is certainly not a spoiler). <br /> <br /> The set-up is simplicity itself: the film school nerds propose to complete an incomplete "slasher masterpiece", unfinished due to the murders of a couple of casts. Even this neatly - ok, so messy - has Kylie Minogue in the first roller. To them is added one of the survivors of the original film, played by Molly Ringwald who steals the film absolutely because it gets all the best lines. The rest of the cast adapts well to their roles, especially the beautiful Jessica Napier, who plays her directly while chaos and blood burst around her. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of false memories and fake suspense moments, and there is very little time to try to figure out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace. It also has an appropriate low-budget appearance, including a somewhat awkward change that is probably intentional. Good soundtrack, too. If there is a difficulty with this film, it is to decide whether it is a posting or a tribute to the slasher genre. Probably a bit of both.
