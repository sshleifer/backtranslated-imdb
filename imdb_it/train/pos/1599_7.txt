"Moonstruck" is a delightful little film directed by the superb storyteller, Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, The Violinist on the Roof, The Hurricane). The film is fantastic on many levels. It shows a good slice of Italian culture, has a moving love story and (best of all) is a hilarious comedy. <br /> <br /> One thing I liked most about the film was the relative unconventional appearance of the actors. Nicolas Cage looks decidedly odd for most of the film, and Cher ... well, Cher always seems a little weird. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a fun and easy-to-recommend movie. <br /> 7.4 br /> 10
