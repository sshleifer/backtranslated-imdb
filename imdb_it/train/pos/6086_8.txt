I saw this movie about a year ago and found that it was completely ridiculous. A real winner, in my mind. He had the underline of a stupid comedy, but in fact he also had a real plot. Just like the hit comedy, Elf, actually. He had some important moments, stuck between hilarity. When Stiller shot Black's horse, an ordinary sober moment, you found yourself laughing at his bizarre antics. In fact, you can find common ground, as I'm sure many people have done something they don't want a friend to discover, for fear that your friendship will end. <br /> <br /> When I found out how much people didn't like this movie, I was completely stunned. That absolutely terrible film like Napoleon Dynamite had higher scores than those that make me think of people's sanity on IMDb. Take my advice and rent it. If you don't find yourself laughing at least once, I will compensate you for the rent. = D
