This is simply the epitome of what a TV movie should be. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon when my wife and I were in high school and we came across this. Bad acting. Wrong script. Good old boys. The ridiculous premise, yet somewhat obvious, clich√© and banal. Riding in pickup trucks with your body leaning on your wife. It has everything. <br /> <br /> You will meet familiar characters: golden monkey, stupid rich boy who wants to make it on his own, friends-who-know-better, father who knows better but guides son far away. And the corpse of his wife. Propped up. In a pick-up. <br /> <br /> Wow: and the title. Many things in our lives have been "Texas tragedies" since I looked at this beauty. All those involved in its creation deserve a medal.
