Ok, so it might not be the award-winning film of the "film of the year" type (apart from the brilliant soundtrack that I think has won some awards), but it is a truly exceptional film on "The Kid" (Prince your choice) and the events surrounding him live in Minneapolis, he plays his music. The music is absolutely superb, in my opinion you MUST own this soundtrack, it is really a classic and summarizes the sounds and the 80s in a fashion is wonderful, and the film itself makes a nice plot, it's worth seeing it over and over again, especially if you like the Prince / O (which I do) of course.
