Starfucker (who reads Starstruck on my box) was the most incredible film I've ever seen. I thought it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. So why not a 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy shows why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting aspect in a dark side of Hollywood. I forced some others to watch the movie and everyone agreed that it was an exceptional film.
