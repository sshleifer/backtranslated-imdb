THE RUNNING MAN, along with TOTAL RECALL, is my favorite Schwarzenegger movie. No, this is not 2001, but it is not meant to be. And the acting and the script here are not even up to par with other Arnie films like PREDATOR or THE TERMINATOR. But I argue that the IDEA behind this film is one of the most beautiful that has ever hit the big screen. A state-sponsored game show in which criminals convicted of serious crimes compete against "heroic" stalkers armed with all kinds of weapons (runners are endowed with nobody) to satisfy the public's desire for sport and blood. The final prize for a winning runner: freedom. Or so the rules state. <br /> <br /> For a film with sad death scenes and jokes that are too exaggerated, it really has a lot to say. Someone else has pointed out all the comments on the culture / government presented in this film, so I won't go here. Suffice it to say that if you can look beyond the seemingly silly feeling of the film, you'll love it (especially if you're a big fan of science fiction with a lot of imagination). As I said, it's not trying to be a serious art film, but it's surprisingly layered for a shot-up movie from the 1980s. The premise is borrowed from a short novel by Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King), but diverges quite strongly from its original material, especially towards the end. (The book ends in a rather nihilistic way, needless to say, this film is not.) I liked both, but I like the film better. <br /> <br /> My favorite phrase: "I suppose it's caused by steroids".
