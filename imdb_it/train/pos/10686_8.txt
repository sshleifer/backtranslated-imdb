And I'm a Nicole Kidman fanatic. I would pay to see her and hear her read the Moscow telephone book, which, as far as I know, could have done when she spoke Russian in this film. <br /> <br /> All four principals are excellent, but the film itself is a number of good images and better scenes held together by nothing. <br /> <br /> While one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie, this asks the viewer too much. <br /> <br /> It could have been a lot of fun (which is in some parts) or rather terrifying (which is in a scene) but the director didn't seem to know which way to go.
