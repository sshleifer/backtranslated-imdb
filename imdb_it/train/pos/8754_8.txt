I saw this movie 11 years ago in the company of my best friend. I pulled out my wisdom teeth, so I didn't feel very well. <br /> <br /> I ended up enjoying it. It is a harsh observation if one takes into account that it is about friendship, unwanted betrayal, power, money, drug trafficking and the extremely difficult situation of living in a foreign prison. <br /> <br /> Acting is at its main level. Two of the women who crave more stars and that's a good thing. Claire Danes is as pretty and charming as ever, while Kate Beckinsale is extremely sexy and offers excellent performance. Bill Pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualities. <br /> <br /> There are many twists to get ideas and make it an interesting visual experience. It also shows the difficult moments in Thailand. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated film. Not many films like this have come out in recent history. It should make you think about many things ...
