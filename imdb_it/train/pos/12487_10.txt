Dark Remains is a simple and simple race. The film is full of gruesome images and scares that will bring out the most experienced horror veteran. The stairs scene in particular, these guys are good. Although they weren't working on a huge budget, everything looks fine and the actors come. Dark Remains has one of those interpretative endings that can be negative for some, but I imagine it makes you think. Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are clear while the mourning couple tries to rebuild their lives there ", but some secondary characters like the sheriff don't convince me. They aren't that important anyway. I consider the Dark Remains a perfect score ten times to be ten times scarier than any recent studio ghost / Japanese remake.
