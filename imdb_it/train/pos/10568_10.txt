I loved this movie, seen tonight on a big movie screen! The audience laughed out loud on some very interesting things, and the fast pace was the most enjoyable. <br /> <br /> As a singer and musical director, I ask a question about the voice of Roby Keeler in "By a Waterfall". "The key was modulated, and suddenly he started singing a lot lower, with a very sweet voice that had no resemblance to the twitter-like voice that he used in all his other voices. < br /> <br /> Does anyone know if this was overdubbed by another singer? It seems to me. I'd like to know. <br /> <br /> Thanks a lot.
