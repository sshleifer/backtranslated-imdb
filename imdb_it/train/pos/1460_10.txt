An excellent film that reveals how people are linked to the foreground, ordinary beads exchanged during Mardi Gras. The film is much more than a comment on globalization. In fact, it humanizes the workers in China, the owner of the factory, the New Orleans bead dispenser and even the New Orleans party goers. What stands out most is the director's ability to tell a complicated story with complicated details in such a simple and seductive way. His incredible access to the factory is another intriguing aspect and I just want to know how he got into it. It's a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it, and the conclusion provides hope without letting people feel alienated.
