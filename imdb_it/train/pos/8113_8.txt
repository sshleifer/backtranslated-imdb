This science fiction masterpiece has too many flaws after the publishers slaughtered it after it opened in 1936. Visually it is a wonder to behold, but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and progress. This becomes very trivial when actors are given to play a lot of high-minded messages at all times. Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke, both great actors, come out like a couple of fanatics. Ralph Richardson is very good as "The Boss", a megalomaniac warlord. The prediction of the Second World War was very disturbing considering that the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in the history of humanity at that time. I'm certainly glad the war didn't end up like in the movie. There are some visually stunning editing sequences that bridge the different episodes of the film. Although it's not as fun as I had hoped, this film impresses you for a long time after seeing it.
