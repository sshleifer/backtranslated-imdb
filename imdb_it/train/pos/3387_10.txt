A truly amazing film, the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is scary. An enormously overpopulated world, unbearable heat due to the damaged ozone layer and all our natural resources spent. In this nightmare degenerate society we have the great Charlton Heston as a nice noir style investigator who tries to understand the truth behind a murder, in front of the legend of the film noir Edward G Robinson that turns into a beautiful performance. <br /> <br /> One of the images that will always remain with me from this film are the masses of people that populate the stairwells and the way Thorne (Heston) has to jump through them every time he uses them. <br /> <br /> Even the use of music by the film is noteworthy, although it does not contain scores in the usual sense, The opening theme is good, and the subsequent fragments of music we have here in the apartment by Simonson, and in particular Beethoven's pieces in the euthanasia clinic are extraordinarily atmospheric.
