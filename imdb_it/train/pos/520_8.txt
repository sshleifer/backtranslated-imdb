My only minor quibble with the movie I grew up in, knowing that STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY has been relegated to the process scene for the last twenty minutes or so. And the proof itself, IMO, is the least interesting part of this fascinating fantasy. <br /> <br /> David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are wonderfully engaged as young lovers, but it is ROGER LIVESEY that offers the liveliest and most credible performances. The French accent MARIUS GORING is a delight (he also makes a comment on Technicolor) as the heavenly messenger sent to claim Niven when his death in wartime is not reported due to an oversight. Goring has some of the most spirited lines and offers them with taste. <br /> <br /> Seeing this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty years, I think it is a supreme example of what was a wonderful 1946 film year. Technicolor photography, a bit subdued and inconspicuous, is excellent and the way it transforms into B & W for celestial sequences is done with great imagination and effectiveness. <br /> <br /> The opening scene is one that really attracts an observer of the fantasy aspects of the story - and Niven's tense talk with radio operator Hunter as his plane crashes into the Earth, unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter. Truly a wonderful film from beginning to end, another triumph for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
