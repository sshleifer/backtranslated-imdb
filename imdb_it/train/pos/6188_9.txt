An investigation into the murders takes place on the stage while The Vanities, on its opening night, plays on an unconscious audience. A strange combination of musical mystery and murder deserves a look at the cast, the production numbers and the pure novelty of the film. <br /> <br /> Gertrude Michael has the striking role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show's stars, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, as well as starring in the infamous "Sweet Marijuana" number (which was on a Bette Midler album from the 70s). So while the chorus girls move backstage, detective bumbling Victor McLaglen watches the girls as he tries to solve the murder of an unknown woman backstage. <br /> <br /> We soon learn that the waitress (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson from afar, that the wardrobe lady (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother, and that the stage manager (Jack Oakie) jumps up all. A lot of intertwining musical numbers. The most famous song of the show is "Cocktails for Two". Kitty Carlisle also sings the disturbing "Where do they come from?" And there's a strange rhapsody that breaks into a number of Harlem specialties with Duke Ellington! Rather the cast. <br /> <br /> Some fantastic actors here, particularly Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is pretty good. Brisson is a total zero. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays the doctor and also sees if you can spot Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the show girls.
