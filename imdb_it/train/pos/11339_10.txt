Anyone who has experienced the terror of divorce will empathize with this protagonist of the independent film, a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet. Does Jake (a mesmerizing Anthony DeMarco) simply "transfer" the trauma of two quarrelsome parents to an understandable picture? Or could the creature be real? Screenwriter / director Shelli Ryan sharply balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing. His choice to use an environment - a suburban home - adds to the feeling of despair and claustrophobia. <br /> <br /> Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are very convincing as angry, but loving parents. However they are the gruesome minor characters, Mrs. Bender (Barbara Gruen), an inconvenient babysitter and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a squalid real estate agent who lingers in the mind. Jake's Closet is a portrait of childhood of dark inspiration as a special kind of hell.
