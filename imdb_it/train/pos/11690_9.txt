This film I am dying to see. Well, it took until now to decide to rent it. It was worth it. This film made me laugh from beginning to end. Chris Rock is fun, no matter what movie you're in. However, this should be very close to being his biggest. If you are looking for a family movie, ie pre-teen and up to that point, this is one you can't pass.
