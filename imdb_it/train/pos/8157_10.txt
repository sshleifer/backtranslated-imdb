R nominal for strong language, violent content and some nude scenes. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> Fear Of A Black Hat is one of the most fun and original comedies I've ever seen. It's basically a gangsta rap version of the movie This Is Spinal Tocca. It is a pity that not many people have heard of this gem of a movie. If you can find this movie anywhere, don't hesitate to buy it even if you don't like rap music. There are not too many comedy films that I give only a perfect 10/10. The only ones I can think of at the moment are this movie, Clerks, The World According to Garp, The 40 Year Old Virgin and Chasing Amy. This film is a hilarious stereotype of rap gangsta culture. The film is about a woman named Nina Blackburn who is making a documentary about the imaginary rap group NWH (N **** z with a hat). I'm basically the stereotype of a rap group that makes many controversial rap songs about killing and being a gangsta.Fear Of A Black Hat is an excellent comedy film and I recommend it even if you're not a fan of the gangsta rap scene. It is a pity that this film is not in the Top 250. <br /> <br /> Runtime: 88min <br /> <br /> 10/10
