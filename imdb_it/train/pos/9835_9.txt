Outside the blocks let me tell you that I'm a big fan of zombies so I don't make statements like those above. Secondly, let me tell you that this is an Italian zombie movie and Fulci directed only 15 minutes before delivering to Bruno (Rats, Night Of Terror) Mattei. This is not a Dawn of the Dead. <br /> <br /> That being said, this is easily one of the funniest zombie movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderfully horrible. Just take a look at the two scientists trying to find an antidote ("Let's try to put these two molecules together"). <br /> <br /> Zombies are available in all varieties. From groans, mannequins armed with machetes, to birds! <br /> <br /> Blood is abundant. The legs are bitten, the arms amputated, the stomachs open. <br /> <br /> The pace is fast, flying from one zombie attack to another. <br /> <br /> Then there's the head in the fridge. Oh the head in the fridge! One of the greatest moments of horror since Ash had his hand in Evil Dead 2. <br /> <br /> You should already know if you're the kind of person who will like this kind of movie. Get friends and beer and have fun for a night of fun. <br /> <br /> Did I mention the head in the fridge?!?!?
