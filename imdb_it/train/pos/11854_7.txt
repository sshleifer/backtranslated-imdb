I agree with "Jerry". It is a very underestimated space film (obviously, how many low-budget good ARE NOT underestimated?) If I remember correctly, the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation (but not "rip-off") of 2001, because the computer that controlled the spaceship was actually a man who had somehow been turned into a computer. And like HAL, they tried to disconnect his "mind", but not the mechanical parts of him, and as with HAL, it led to disaster. There is at least one fun moment. When the character of Christopher Cary, who does not find food, finds the abandoned domestic bird, there is a kind of disturbing moment, but then the obvious thing does not happen after all.
