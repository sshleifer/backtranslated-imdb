I really love this show! I've always liked the Space Ghost shows of the 90s! This show was hilarious and I can't believe that Cartoon Network's Adult Swim took such a fun show as the one on the air. I hope they put this show on DVD or something. The show is about Brak (from the comics of Space Ghost, SGCC and Cartoon Planet) who lives his everyday life with his mom and dad and his best friend who really likes Zorak! My favorite episodes were those in which Zorak gets this really good singing voice and then his voice didn't give him the money that Zorak did to sing. Another episode that I like is one in which Brak and Zorak have not finished their homework and then return from Sunday to Friday and simply run away and then return to the day the tasks were invented and then when they return to the present tasks they didn't exist! Another episode that I like is one in which Brak's father and their neighbor, the Thundercleese robot, continue to enter this citrus fruit and then they are eaten by a giant worm. Another episode that I liked was the one in which Zorak is bullying and then another guy took his place. I also like many of the other episodes! One thing that never fails to make me laugh is when Zorak is beaten, blown up and torn to pieces!
