"Kolchak" was a TV series that did not fit into any category. A part of the horror, a part of the comedy, a certain social awareness, and what we have is something that I think people were not ready for. It's really a shame, since I started watching these shows on the Chiller network, (I never saw the originals), I realized how different and interesting it was. <br /> <br /> Starring Darren Mcgavin as Kolchak, an International News Service reporter, and Simon Oakland as his ever-angry boss, Tony Vincenzo, the show followed the exploits of a Chicago reporter who most of the time it has become a part of the story itself, while it scoured the windy city for the modern gruesome twirling in the night. The basic charm of Macgavin really marks the show. A kind of stupid guy, always wearing the same suit, you can't help but love him. His jokes are great, and the relationship between him and the skeptical editor, Oakland, is definitely hilarious. <br /> <br /> The stories are mostly pretty good, and the acting is very good. The 70s were not a fantastic time for special effects, and the show suffers, but if you suspend disbelief, what you have is a funny series that was ahead of its time.
