I'm tired of people who judge films about their "historical accuracy". IT'S A FILM PEOPLE !! The writers and directors should give their story a spin! There are a number of films out there that are not entirely accurate with the story .... Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, Gangs of New York, Geronimo: An American legend, The last of the Mohicans .... all the movies fantastic that are historically inaccurate. If you want to see some great actors doing what they do best, then I suggest you watch this movie and not worry about the accuracy of the facts. Simply enjoy the quality of the film, the plot and one of the greatest actors of our time.
