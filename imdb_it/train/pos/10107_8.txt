"Ardh Satya" is one of the best films ever made in Indian cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, this is the most successful Parallel Cinema Hard Hitting which has also proved to be a commercial success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all the main directors of India. <br /> <br /> The film tells the scenario of the real life of the Mumbai police of the 70s. Unlike any police in other cities in India, the Mumbai police have a completely different system. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with the real-life approach of the Mumbai Police Environment. <br /> <br /> Among various police officers and colleagues, the film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a hot-blooded young policeman from a poor family. His father is a tough cop. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies and the incidence of his father's atrocities on his mother. Anand's approach to immediate action against crime is an inert longing for his personal satisfaction. The film is here rotated in a plot in which Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his elders. This leads to frustration, as it cannot achieve the desired job satisfaction. Because of the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the rooms and bars awaiting trial, turning him into an alcoholic too. <br /> <br /> The Spirit in him is still alive, because he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the underground system, where the police and politicians are associated inertially in the end. His compromise towards unethical practice is negative. Eventually it is suspended. <br /> <br /> The Direction is a masterpiece and completely hard core. One of the most memorable scenes is the one in which Anand breaks into the house of the underground gangster Rama Shetty to arrest him, followed by a brief conversation that is fantastic. In many scenes, the film has moments of awareness. <br /> <br /> The Practical Script approach is an important Punch. Alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage, deception are all part and parcel of the Mumbai police even today. These aspects are dealt with brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Finally, the films belong to the One man show, Om Puri who plays Anand Velankar through all his emotions in an absolutely brilliant way.
