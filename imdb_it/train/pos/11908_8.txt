This movie plays very well with an audience. Especially after the chase. Furthermore, Trevor Howard with his sensible and intelligent charm and Jean Simmons with his innocent behavior and piercing eyes are terrifying together. <br /> <br /> The film begins as a psychological drama but after the murder it turns into a chase thriller as the two conductors make their way to the border. Some may think that the pursuit is superfluous, but in reality the hunt is essential because it helps to free the mind from the character of Jean Simmons by making it come out of the oppressive house, in addition to bringing out the real murderer - who is suddenly put in such a position who have to finish the job. The killer rightly believed that once the character of Simmons was arrested, she would be put away. And it is true that her lack of control at home - as well as the evidence pointing her way - there is no way she would have come out of the murder charge. The resulting pursuit helps bring out the truth. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie. Look for it if you can find it.
