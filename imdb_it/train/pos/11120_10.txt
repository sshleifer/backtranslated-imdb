Wow. I loved the whole series and I'm shocked by the comments of people who thought it was bad. Perhaps he was a little disconcerted in seasons 4 and 5, while remaining better than anything else on television. But 6 and in particular 6b ​​were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the first three most muscular seasons. <br /> <br /> 6B started with such a gloomy mood and Janice's ever-attentive vision of family anguish - that crazy phrase about Tony's inclination to sit and watch. Anyone who has lost the implications of this for the rest of the series does not know Tony. Melfi's discomfort about psychiatric study and his references to sociopathic self-illusory sentimentality for pets and animals dates back to the first episodes of the series, let's say, with Tony's panic attack on the ducks that leave his pool and resounds with the wave of Phil hi "line to his grandchildren before the final blow of the episode (not to enter Chase's dark humor). <br /> <br /> I could go on forever, but I'll add which I thought the final show - starting from the initial notes of Vanilla Fudge to provide the ironic foreshadowing ("You Keep Me Hangin 'On") to the terminal moments in which Tony finds himself complacent with his family in tow or bursts pieces like AJ SUV or Phil's head were absolutely PERFECT, the best TV ever. <br /> <br /> Fairly good in a dying medium that pathologically provides the "jack-off fantasies" AJ derides (and then in which is readily lowered) tip of the pork pie to Mr. Chase.
