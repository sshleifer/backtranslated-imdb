I saw IPHIGENIA only once, almost 30 years ago, but since then it has tormented me. <br /> <br /> One particular sequence comes to mind and may have been created by a great director, as undoubtedly Michael Cacoyanis. <br /> <br /> The context: the weight of history and a powerful army and fleet all lie on the shoulders of King Agamemnon. An act of sacrilege made the seas in danger, endangering his great expedition to Troy. He is told that he must sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to Apollo to gain the wind for the sails of the Thousand Ships. Initially he resists, but he comes around, and he deceives his wife Clytemenstra to take their daughter to the Greek camp to marry the greatest of all warriors, Achilles. <br /> <br /> Clitennestra and Iphigenia arrive, discover the sacrifice and anger to the gods for protection and revenge. Meanwhile, the proud Achilles discovers that his name has been used in this fraudulent and dishonorable way. He climbs a hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect her. <br /> <br /> Shooting: The camera surrounds the two young people, without looking directly at each other. They complain about their fate and the weakness of the men who deceive their loved ones and want war. Suddenly, they look at each other and, for a moment, we feel both their power and beauty, both the unreported - except from the camera - the irony that at another time, another place, maybe you could love and get married. It is an acute and sad epiphany that lasts only for an instant. <br /> <br /> What direction! What a camera! What a story!
