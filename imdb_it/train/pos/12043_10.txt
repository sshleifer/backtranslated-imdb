... On stage, on TV or in a book, "The Woman in Black" is an extraordinary story of ghosts. Other reviewers have already said everything there is to say about this film, but I thought I'd add my belated little review. The TV movie has a deliberately slow first act, which tells the main character Arthur while he is working as a lawyer in 1920s London. I can understand why this might not appeal to all palates. Nevertheless, for me, I love this style of British narrative similar to one of the adaptations of the "Ghost Story for Christmas" by the BBC of the great work of M.R. James. In the second act, the ghost story comes into play as Arthur is sent to the provinces by his boss, to tidy up the business of a deceased client. The third act rises inexorably to a thrilling conclusion ... As a Londoner, I saw the play. I own the book, DVD-R and I also have the integral audio book on my iPod. What is safe for me, "The Women in Black" on any medium is a ghost story with few equals. The time has come to publish a version of DVD authorized by region 2.
