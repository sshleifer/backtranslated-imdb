I don't understand the low rating of 5.7 on this film. It is a delight for people who love a plot of strong suspense and dark atmospheres. The tone is reminiscent of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, up to the local (Savannah). The acting is strong, and I was stunned by the verisimilitude of Kenneth Branagh's southern accent. Famke Jansen is exceptional, Robert Duval is effective in a small part and Embeth Davitz is the BOMB. Even the scene of her is completely naked. <br /> <br /> The plot is fairly standard but effectively executed.
