The Perfect Son is the story of two brothers in their thirties, one who apparently seems "perfect" and the other who is basically a vice, which is often found in drug rehabilitation centers. After the death of their father, the two are reunited after a long absence and the usual rivalry re-emerges. It is not until the "perfect" brother makes the surprising revelation that AIDS has the irresponsible younger brother finally moves to get his life in order, and take some responsibility. <br /> <br /> The film does a nice job reporting the "return" of the younger brother, although it can sometimes seem a bit far-fetched (beating the drug addiction is never that easy). What makes the film more tender is the treatment of AIDS, a topic that has become a bit passed on in the cinema over the past 5-10 years. And the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two brothers who were previously at war is also very credible and well done. The two main actors were both very competent, if not terribly charismatic. <br /> <br /> A solid first feature film by director and writer Leonard Farlinger, whose brother died of AIDS. The finish is also well done. <br /> <br />
