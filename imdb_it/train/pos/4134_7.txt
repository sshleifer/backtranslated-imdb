Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson and Binnie Barnes perform in "The Divorce of Lady X", a 1938 comedy based on a play. Olivier plays a young lawyer, Everard Logan, who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room, when the London mist is too dense to allow guests of a costume ball to go home. The next day, a friend of his, Lord Mere (Richardson), announced that his wife (Barnes) spent the night with another man in the same hotel, and wants to divorce her. Believing that the woman was Oberon, Olivier panics. Oberon, who is single and the niece of a judge, pretends to be the woman in question, Lady Mere, when she is really Leslie Steele. We have seen this plot or variations of dozens of times. With this cast, it's delicious. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, that great Wuthering Heights team? Quite special. Olivier is extraordinarily beautiful and does a great job with comedy while playing the nervous and nervous lawyer. Oberon gives his role the right touch of light. She looks extremely young here, fuller in the face, with Jean Harlow's eyebrows and a very different hairstyle for her. She wears some nice street clothes, even if her first dress looks like a birthday cake, and in a dress she tries, with that hairstyle, she is ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes is as delicious as the real Lady Mere. <br /> <br /> The color in this is a disaster, and as others have already said, it could really use a restoration. Definitely worth seeing.
