Some have compared this film to Deliverance. I think Topi and Uomo is more appropriate. Our protagonist, Heaton, definitely loves Spike. It is irrelevant and irrelevant if it is a sexual love. That's why Heaton doesn't leave Spike. He needs him. They need each other. As brothers, as a family, as their only connection with humanity. The setting, the scenery, the minimal cast add up to a good film. Frankly, I didn't care what happened to the characters. But I cared about what the director did with them. He did well with them. I spent some time wondering how the ending would look like Mice and Men. The soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and intriguing.
