Insisting that the inspiring spirit of Martin Luther King lies not only in American civil liberties, but in the hearts and minds of people around the world, the Danish helmsman Niels Arden Oplev transfers this belief into a Danish middle school of 1969. More specifically, it is making headway in the crusade of a young boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his arrogant and energetically furious principal Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Adapted from a true story, the performances are performed with a certain ease and a refreshing command on its various characters continues to involve him. A battle of ideologies between a thirteen year old and a demented disciple gives way to intrinsic humor, but changes the disorienting moods in an embarrassing way, while cleverly keeping in the same vein as a "Society of dead poets" more than a "Matilda ". He follows a familiar path but a continuous and precise service to his young protagonist, including a personal subplot that completes Frits since he is a young boy who becomes a young man, manages to make the film grow in a family film that has a straight nose on money.
