"Dressed To Kill" is one of the best thrillers ever made. His relationships with sex and violence make this film an adult film. Brian De Palma, once again, shows why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story. He directs many scenes without dialogue, and tells much of his story, strictly through the use of his images, and the soundtrack by Pino Donnagio. Filmed in Panavision, the film MUST be viewed in widescreen format, since De Palma uses the full width of the film to tell its story. Cut out, on video, "Dressed To Kill", it is barely the same film. Solid performances by the cast, superb direction and, perhaps, the best soundtrack ever written, make "Dressed To Kill" a must see.
