This story was never one of my favorites in Christie's works, so I was pleasantly surprised to appreciate this adaptation. The mouse motif was effective if a little exaggerated, the bones of the story are there even though more emphasis is placed on the "crime in the past" subplot. The students were all more or less as I had imagined them, even if it is a pity that they were not a more cosmopolitan group - perhaps the revised 1930s setting would not allow it! I thought that very daring risks had been taken with the shooting; maybe because I didn't read the book for a long time but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some revealing shots soon enough. <br /> <br /> Humor was far more widespread in these early Poirots. Sometimes it works, but in this episode I found it a little too heavy (even though I smiled at the "Lemon Only" waste line). Overall though, a solid entry in the series though not one of the best.
