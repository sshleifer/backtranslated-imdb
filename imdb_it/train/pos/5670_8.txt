Esther Williams gets her first starring role in the role of MGM and part <br /> <br /> with a good start. This movie is a fun suspense recited <br /> <br /> with a mature theme that will repeat itself a million times more <br /> in the future - an innocent girl who has pursued the terrifying woman hates. Esther <br /> <br /> sounds fantastic and if she wanted to, she could probably have made <br /> <br /> making more and better films, but according to her autobiography, <br /> <br /> practically given up work for marriage. In both cases it is so nice and engaging that it is fun to see it in a completely different role <br /> <br /> outside of "musical swimming". Universal was fabulous for <br /> <br /> making films with former MGM stars after the studio began dropping its biggest names as it started to slide down the hill. The stars <br /> such as Lana Turner, June Allyson and others obtained the quality of the first <br /> movie at Universal, since they obviously still had the power to draw <br /> < br /> the box office. I wish Esther had done more, but since he didn't, <br /> <br /> makes this even more special.
