It's not as violent as I expected, which makes the violent scenes even more brutal and effective. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of twists and punches and double crossings throughout the film which makes it difficult to know who is at the side of a particular character. <br /> <br /> The plot is peaceful with good dialogue and character development and offers an interesting insight into the functioning of the Triad band that follows. /> <br /> Violence when it comes is brutal, without guns or martial arts scenes with special effects, this is credible in your facial violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed to forget that the Triad is an organization violent criminal. <br /> <br /> The finish is surprising but absolutely consistent and credible.
