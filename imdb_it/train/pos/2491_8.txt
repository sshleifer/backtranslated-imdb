Budget limits, time limits, creation of a script and then cutting, cutting, cutting ... This troupe is a group of good and young filmmakers; caring in this script - yes, allegorical - intelligent in its effects at zero dollars when time and knowledge are all you have, relying on actors and friends and kindly others for their time, devotion, positions; and get a first function in the jar, a 1-in-1000 thing. These guys make movies. Good ones. Watch their collection of short films "Heartland Horrors" and look at the development. And I can guarantee, working with them is the most fun you can do in business. I am hindered by harsh and offensive criticisms of this film, I wonder if a critic even listened to a single word of dialogue, pondered over a thought or concept, or if all that was desired of this work was the visual guru of striking and hitting to satisfy some mindless vision of what horror should mean for an audience. Let "The Empty Acre" bring you to you. Don't preconceive what you expect should be only because it is inserted into the horror / thriller genre because of its supernatural premise. It is a drama with depth beyond the distance where you can thread a blade into someone with a reverence for a message that does not assault the visual center of your brain, but rather draws on your empathic imagination to experience the suffering of the mind and spirit of others. mark ridgway, Curtis, "The Empty Acre"
