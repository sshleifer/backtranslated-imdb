Well, this film was probably one of the funniest and scariest movies I've ever seen. The effects are so ugly that you just have to laugh, and acting, well, let's say there's no mel gibson. But Gary Browning, who plays a police officer, is so damn bad, he gets good. I don't know how, but he himself makes this film a 10. You have to see it if your horror / slash movie makes it bleed and fun at the same time. Killer movie.
