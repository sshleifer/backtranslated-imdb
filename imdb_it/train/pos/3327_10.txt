I love and admire the Farrelly brothers! Why did I see this fantastic film 3 years after its release? It made me laugh, made me cry and warmed my heart. Big Time. It is difficult to describe it in my rotten English, but I still have to try: <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent everywhere - from the main roles to the secondary roles, the acting is exceptional, the dialogues are fantastic and the film is perfectly directed and cared for. <br /> <br /> I think the Farrelly brothers' films are often underestimated - they're not light comedies - they're deeeeeep! They talk about what all life is (I don't tell you!). In my case, this film told me what the relationships are: <br /> <br /> If you love someone: liberate them, leave them alone - try to share the passion and the pain and always be faithful. <br /> <br /> I am not an enemy of sport, but certainly an ignorant sportsman. But in this movie - the vibrations give you. I could smell baseball. Finally, this film explained to me what a sports fan can be for you and which fantastic fan families have to be out there. <br /> <br /> Thanks a lot, Pete & Bob! <br /> PS: if you haven't seen it, check KINGPIN!
