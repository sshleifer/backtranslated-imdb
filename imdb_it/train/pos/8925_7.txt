This film has an almost decisive importance for the generation of some of us born in the early post-war years (and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved to spend Saturday afternoons in your neighborhood cinema) you almost certainly saw it . And the memory of seeing him has probably stayed with you. Style is the substance of a brief and somewhat gloriously exciting moment in our growing days. <br /> <br /> He had a modern storyboard, set in space, for the audience of his time. The set was a city with a supermarket and a cinema that would be packed for a midnight Friday show. He has hot rods and young rebels, but in the 'why they can't let us have fun' rather than in the disturbed, histrionic, rebel without a cause. All the characters were identifiable to us - teenagers, parents, the old man, the doctor, the nurse, the mechanic, the boy, the puppy, even the policemen - were in solidarity with us. We could refer to all of them <br /> <br /> He had a singularly horrible monster. She is the first victim who complains "it hurts ..... it hurts" and we were convinced and scared. The threat grows continuously throughout history. There are intense periods of suspense, colorful effects, a fairy tale role in McQueen and moments of humor, both understood and not. He also had a sad part that was almost exaggerated to make us cry more sensitive. <br /> <br /> I saw him in the summer, about 9 years old, double with "I Married A Monster" From Outer Space ', and he was so thrilled by the experience of this particular dual function that I came back a couple of times before he left. Everyone I knew saw it. Everyone I knew loved him.
