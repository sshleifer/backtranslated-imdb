... this is a classic with so many great dialogues and scenes that no one should miss. Nice story, fun situations from rich to rags, Mel Brooks is not a bad protagonist, maybe not perfect but it's fun; D Do not pay attention to the evaluation, it is BS. Look at it, then look at something like the final destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stinks deserves the same score. If you do, I don't think we can be XD friends. At this point I recommend the fourth season of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" for every Brooks fan;) Vote 10 against ignorant opinions of lung worms! Do I have to do 10 lines here to post a comment? I don't want to write a book here: P
