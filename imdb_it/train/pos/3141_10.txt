Let's face it: the final season (# 8) was one of the worst seasons in any show I've ever witnessed (especially, I've never found droughts that lasted for an entire season). But if you judge this show by last season, obviously it will be lower. This is an absolutely unfair assessment - because "That '70s Show" was, in its time, a brilliant and exhilarating sitcom about a bygone era and how the people who lived there weren't so different from what we are here in modern times. <br /> <br /> Okay ... ignoring season 8. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace plays Eric Forman, a horny teenager geek with a perpetual love for Donna (Laura Prepon), the feminist girl next door. Their friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) give fantastic performances in (almost) every episode. The best is probably Fez, a foreign student who is mentally promiscuous. What country are you from? Try to understand it! For another dimension of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are as phenomenal as Eric's parents. Rupp, like Kitty, is both formidable and sweet, a bit like Mrs. Brady meets Marie Barone, while Smith's Red exists primarily to scare the pogei by everyone. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well one in front of the other like Donna's parents, the chauvinist but likeable Bob and the empty-headed Midge. Tommy Chong has occasional appearances like Leo, a braggart who acts as a father to Hyde. <br /> <br /> Apart from the anachronistic errors that appear very frequently and the over the top lessons that sometimes come (and that regrettable final season), "the 70s" is a fantastic show with an incredible writing, a precise direction and a feeling of well-being that pulses through each episode. Are all well.
