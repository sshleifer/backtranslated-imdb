ok, but just stupid. Not bad for a horror / comedy movie. I was reading how people changed with Michael's version and this is a good trick for me because some adults hate horrors and when they see this it will interest them in horror movies like this or maybe (never seen) horror (maybe comedy) Uncle Sam, I'll have to see you rent or buy that movie, but the second is much better than this, but I bought this on Amazon's VHS and got it on November 21st, the day before Thanksgiving. worth the four dollars, l.o.l. to this movie. <br /> <br /> 9/10
