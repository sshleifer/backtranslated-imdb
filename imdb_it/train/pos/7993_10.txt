There are many reasons to watch this film: to see the reality that whips Latin America with regard to kidnapping, police corruption on a continental level, among the many realities we live in the Latins. <br /> <br /> Denzel Wahington's performance was brilliant, this guy continues to be an excellent actor and he continues like this. Dakota Fanning has only been an excellent actress for 10 years and I congratulate her. The rest of the film was a marvel, I have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> I hope they have succeeded to those who produce Hollywood to make a film completely in Venezuela, where they show our reality better about delinquency, drug trafficking or political problems. There have been few films in which the Venezuelan lands play (for example: Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly) should do more, as they do in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The song "Una Mirada" I hope you leave in the soundtrack, it's excellent. My vote is 10/10
