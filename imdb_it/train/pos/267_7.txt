It all starts with a series of apparently unrelated object thefts in a student hostel in Hickory Road, London. Concerned about her sister, who is the housekeeper, Miss Lemon asks Hercule Poirot to look into the matter. He agrees, but soon the stakes get higher when a girl, who has admitted to being responsible for most (not all) of the thefts, is found killed. <br /> <br /> "Hickory Dickory Dock" is a solid brain exercise, without being as complicated as "One, Two, Buckle My Shoe". The crime, theft and the smuggling of diamonds are the crimes involved and the final breakthrough that binds everything is revealed only in the last 2 minutes! The characters are interesting, especially psychology student Colin McNabb and the mysterious American girl Sally Finch, Inspector Japp has his funny moments (perhaps the closest to this series has become "toilet humor"), and Miss Lemon the history of the usual has a more integral part.
