Farrah Fawcett spent the best part of his post-Angel career confusing us, with an occasional acting performance interspersed between his Playboy jokes and Letterman's escapades. But when it comes to this, there is no denying that this girl can act. Far from a story of epic proportions, this well-made TV movie is kind, quiet and sometimes moving. Fawcett plays the rebellious black sheep daughter who returns home only to find that he has lost the last days of his mother's life and even funerals, much to the regret of his more stable and supposedly more sensible sister. Brad Johnson interprets the love interest, and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of the dramatic TV series, but then there is always that confused Farrah to watch, and she, in effect, remains eminently watchable. (And, yes, I admit, I had that Farrah poster on my wall when). Silk Hope gets three and a half stars (out of five) on the Corkymeter. Bosley would be proud.
