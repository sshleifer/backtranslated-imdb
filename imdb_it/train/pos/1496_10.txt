I enjoyed taking this movie very late late late on TV and kept my interest through the whole picture. This wonderful creepy but mysterious English house, with wicked and mobile looking decorations and tired rooms that make you wonder why someone would like to rent this house or even own it. There are four (4) Stories concerning this house, and every resident of the house encounters all kinds of problems. You will notice the beautiful lake and the pond around the house and also the sweet song of the birds, but do not be fooled, there is horror everywhere. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", "80 gives a great performance as one of the people living at home and even Christopher Lee," The Curse of the Crimson Altar ", 68 and his little daughter, Chloe Franks, (Jane Reid) make a wonderful exciting story together, your daughter for some reason loves to read WITCHCRAFT BOOKS! If you love the gruesome, horrible and mysterious movies, with many surprises, this is the movie for you !!!!
