Even if you know absolutely nothing about Ireland, you have to love "My Left Foot" (and in particular the performance by Daniel Day-Lewis). It sounds like Christy Brown, suffering from cerebral palsy. Because of this, he spent most of his life ostracized. Even when they try to warn people of something, they just laugh at him. The light in the darkness for him is that he has control over one part of the body: his left foot. Use that appendix to paint and write poetry, bringing it to the fore. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan did very well in this collaboration, and also in a subsequent collaboration: "In the Name of the Father" (but "The Boxer" was not necessary) . "My Left Foot" can make you feel in many ways: sad, hopeful or something else. But in any case, Daniel Day-Lewis gave the performance of a life here. A great film in every sense.
