The comment of the person who said that Pat Robertson is evil and his program is evil has nothing to compare to what is evil and right. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The same Bible says that in the last days people will call bad good and good evil! He does not even know that he has fulfilled Bible prophecy! If you don't know God and refuse to know him now, that's fine. He still loves you but when you finally bend your knee to Him, and you will, it will be too late for you. God doesn't send anyone to hell, not even you! You will go there of your decision and your vomiting defines it! May God have mercy on you and give you an experience of Damascus. The 700 Club and Pat Robertson ministry is one of the reasons I'm still here. On the verge of alcoholism, adultery and probably death, God reached the television screen and used Pat Robertson to do it, and thank God He did! You have the right to say what you said but you have no right to curse with your words. God have mercy on you
