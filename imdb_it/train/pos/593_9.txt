This game only lasted one season, but it was intriguing for the public because it required a visual attitude and a steady hand. A false move would have disqualified the competitor from winning the prize, although it was clear that the competitor knew the correct answer. It was always exciting when the competitor started drawing, wondering if they would complete the drawing or be buzzed; allowing the other competitor to easily win the competition. It was a carefree show, but it was clear that competitors were often embarrassed because of a stupid mistake made involuntarily. Rarely seen, the game did not survive a single season. Only a game games fan will remember this show, as it turned out to be rather unpopular, even though the games made a big comeback to the screen after the 1950s game scandals. But it was a unique concept for a game show, and one that was never seen again.
