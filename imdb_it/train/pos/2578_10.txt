Superman and the Mole Men is probably the toughest Superman adventure ever. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, home of the world's deepest oil well. While there, some radioactive mole men arrive through the oil well and explore the city. Jeff Corey and many other citizens try to get rid of the men who invade the mole. Can Superman change people's habits in time to save the mole men? Can Superman warn people in time about the radioactive danger that men carry with a mole? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Superman and the Mole Men is a very intelligent film, well written and well acted. Although we can see Superman flying only once, it's still a great adventure for Superman. To see for anyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars
