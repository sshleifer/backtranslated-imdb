Sleepwalkers are creatures that completely subtract the life force from humans to survive ... but they can only use virgins (why not). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one of those who needs to feed his mother Mary (Alice Krige). He takes the nice Tanya (Madchen Amick). Will he escape? <br /> <br /> On the one hand this is a GREAT horror movie. A pressing rhythm, a lot of blood and blood and a pleasant and twisted sense of humor. There are many joke references for horror fans (Castle Rock is mentioned once). Krause is also excellent (who would have thought to be able to act after "Return to the Blue Lagoon") as Kirge and Amick. But I find this film annoying. <br /> <br /> It was written for the screen by Stephen King and is exasperatingly vague. The sleepwalkers are never completely explained. Where they come from? Why are they called that? Why does the child have to feed the mother? Why do cats hate them and can kill them? What are their powers after all (does Krause disappear a car and change color and style!)? Why do they need to feed on people's life force? Why does it have to be just virgins? Why does the son have sex with his mother? None of these are explained leaving the plot confused. It's really a shame because, apart from these questions, this is an excellent horror movie. Excellent makeup and special effects too. <br /> <br /> Fast, bloody and very fun. If only the script was better. Even a fairly explicit sex scene between Krause and Krige has been changed (you can tell) to get a R score. I can only give a 7.
