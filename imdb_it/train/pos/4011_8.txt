After the SuperFriends and Scooby Doo left the Saturday morning wave in the fall of 1986, I practically stopped watching Saturday morning cartoons at that point because those were the only two that kept me in tune. And since neither the Real Ghostbusters nor the Flintstone Kids seemed very promising, I "retired" and started sleeping on Saturday mornings. I returned to TV on Saturday morning only in 1988 for that year only for one and just an animated show. <br /> <br /> A new animated Superman show was something I wouldn't let go of. I was 17 and in high school at the time, but then? I loved this show. From what I can remember, this series was a gift for the fans that I suppose on Superman's 50th birthday that particular year. He had the theme music and musical style reminiscent of the John Williams soundtrack of the Richard Donner films / Christopher Reeve Superman. I honestly heard that Ruby Spears' animation style was reminiscent of the Super Powers Team: Hanna Barbera's Galactic Guardians a few years earlier. Unfortunately, Danny Dark was not back as Superman, but I heard that Beau Weaver did a very impressive job as the voice of Superman and his Clark Kent was nerd like Chris Reeve's version. After listening to him as Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic in the 90s Fantastic Four, I could still see this version of Superman in my mind. Ginny McSwain as Lois Lane. LOL! What a rhyme. She was a director of Hanna Barbera and Ruby Spears and I guess she made the commitment to make Lois. The memories of SuperFriends lingered in this series when it came to the voiceover. Jimmy Olsen is Mark Taylor, who in the past was Firestorm on SuperFriends. Perry White is none other than the former Batman TV writer Stanley Ralph Ross, who in SuperFriends was Gorilla Grodd and Brainiac in superpower shows. And Lex Luthor, now a wisely cracked billionaire magnate, is none other than the SuperFriends standard bearer, Michael Bell, whom I know best as Zan and the Riddler, as well as many other characters in many other series. <br /> <br /> I heard that this series was a combination of the Superman movie along with the post John Byrne crisis in anticipation of Superman, with Lex Luthor as a living billionaire tycoon, Jonathan and Martha Kent to see Clark as Superman. Even the Bruce Timm and Lois and Clark series would do it. Unfortunately, we have never seen Brainiac, Bizarro, Toyman, Metal or Darkseid. Besides Luthor, we only saw the prankster and saw General Zod. I particularly enjoyed that episode with Wonder Woman, which was heard by BJ Ward who also played it in the Super Powers Team. <br /> <br /> The episodes were fabulous and I also appreciated Clark's growth and development stories from childhood to adolescence up to an adult who moved to Metropolis in the short segment, Superman's Family Album. <br /> <br /> The only two things I didn't like. It only lasted one season. And after Wonder Woman's guest place, I was hoping that Batman would show up at Adam West (I still think of the Super Powers Team episodes I guess). I was also hoping that because of the Prankster episode, the Metropolis baseball team clashed with Gotia Golia. <br /> <br /> Every popular superhero has a series of cartoons that is extremely rare. For SpiderMan, I think it's the 1981 solo series airing at the same time as Amazing Friends. For the Incredible Hulk, it's the 1982 cartoon. For the Fantastic Four, it's the 1978 series with HERBIE the Robot. For Batman, it's the new Batman 1977 adventures of Filmation with BatMite. But for Superman, the rarest series is this. <br /> <br /> Superman books and documentaries never cover or mention. This is another series that WB should consider for the DVD version. All in all, this 1988 version of Superman is fine .... Super !!
