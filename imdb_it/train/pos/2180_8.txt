Louise Brooks offers a splendid performance in this well-made French melodrama. He plays a typist called Lucienne who, despite being in love with a man named Andre, dreams of rising above his position in life. She sees opportunities in a beauty contest for Miss Europe, but Andre is furious when he finds out she came in, so he asks her to withdraw. Try to resume your participation only to discover that it has already been chosen as Miss France and that it will now go to the main performance. <br /> <br /> This is a story of love, loss, and a passionate end played decision. The film is very energetically shot by the director Augusto Genina and by the cinema designers Rudolf Mate and Louis Nee. The style of filming is more like modern movies than the 1930s Hollywood movies, and shows the different style used by Europeans. There are many shortcuts and traveling shots, mostly done with great skill and verve. The high energy of the first third of the film thins a little in the middle but resumes in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> The shows were very good from all the principals, but that of Louise Brooks is particularly memorable. Louise leans heavily on her silent screen skills even if it is a talkie, but since her silent style has a surprisingly contemporary and sober feel, she makes the transition to talkies very well. The long opening scene of the fair was particularly moving when Louise used her extraordinarily expressive eyes to convey her growing sense of suffering and alienation, of being trapped in a life she no longer wants. I doubt it's ever been better. <br /> <br /> The film builds a magnificent ending, artfully turned, powerful and elegant. This is really one of the best things about the dawn of cinema. And the tragic plot only underlines the greatest tragedy that this is the final starring role for Louise Brooks. It wasn't just a great beauty that looked fantastic in a swimsuit, it was really a great acting talent that basically threw everything away. We are all the poorest for this. <br /> <br /> This film is less well known than its German films with G.W. Pabst, but I think it's better. I think this troupe is better at Pabst's storytelling, and while Prix de Beaute may not have the deep moral complexity of Pabst's films, it is much easier to follow and is overall a more streamlined and focused work. And it doesn't hurt that even Louise's singing parts are made by Edith Piaf. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, this is a classic Louise Brooks film that is worth looking for.
