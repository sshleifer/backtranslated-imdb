Although I am inclined to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this film, I am ashamed to say that I rather like it. You can't find a huge pile of 80s papillae outside of a Wham! video, so it's definitely worth seeing (Â£ 0.79 a night in my local store!). Pay attention to the insanely obvious seams and the zip on the monster's costume, to the fact that the hero looks a lot like Keith Chegwin and such classic lines as the following: Evil Wizard-Type Bloke: "Finally we meet Kor ..." : "Exciting, isn't it?" <br /> <br /> Incredible !! I also like the fact that, despite the video box is quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by angry seas and a dangerous hawk - like the bird that brings a beautiful hero to safety (among other "interesting and engaging" suggestions) of what happens in the real movie, none of these really happened No, I'm not kidding ... there's really no sea fury or a fierce bird, it's just trying to make you interested ... classic to me opinion.This film gets 10 for pure entertainment value !!
