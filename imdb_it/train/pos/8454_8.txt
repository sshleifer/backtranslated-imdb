The second story of the Gundam universe (G-Gundam is the first), Gundam Wing is another different view of the Gundam verse. Familiar elements are found but Gundam Wing is actually different from its counterparts. The largest of the Gundams is nothing but terrorists fighting a solitary organization. In truth, the series does not really become a show about war until episode 7, but in reality the real conflict, the Eve Wars, does not happen until the following episodes. <br /> <br /> The biggest positives of this series are his characters. All the main characters are enriched during the series of 49 episodes and you can really sympathize with each of the roles they have entered. Another big advantage is the fantastic character and mecha design of the series. The designs put some of the other Gundam counterparts to shame. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest criticisms of this series is how many hard UC fans claim to have ripped the original UC saga. Because Gundam Wing gets this rap when Gundam Seed's most showy UC clone is out there is beyond me. It is true that there are many moments raised, but theirs are told in new ways and there are also distinct differences. <br /> <br /> Take for example the usual comparison between Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. Throughout the series, Zechs is more the outcast in the Alliance and also in the OZ ways, while the Red Comet shone symbol of Zeon. Another big difference is the fact that Zechs loses a lot of soldiers under his command from which he derives the other nickname he gave in the first episodes: "Killer of his men". Char does not have this label. <br /> <br /> The problems with this series are not the mumbo jumbo philosophy but two problems. The first is the reused animation movie of Gundams' attacks. Sure it's fun to see tanks, MS and heavy weapon aircraft for the first time. But at its fourth reuse the scenes like this become old. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that the entire series should take place during a whole year. If you really think about all the events that came out of the series, a lot happens in just one year. <br /> <br /> But I guess you can easily ignore this when you ignore the first few lines of the introduction from time to time. While ranking, this is probably the best in the alternative universe Tales of Gundam and a great introduction into the world of Gundam. After all, this was the first Gundam anime to be broadcast on American television.
