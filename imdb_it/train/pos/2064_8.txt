The ScareCrow was one of the funniest Killers I've ever seen red-handed! Plus it's really cool for most of the time he's been around, which was great! He also had an excellent voice, I mean it was perfect for him. The narrative lines were also excellent. I love how the children's soul has been transferred to ScareCrow, it was great! Also he had a reason for everything he kills I mean after what people have done to him ..... I too would be angry! ScareCrows' look was really good! his look gives that person an "OMG!" reaction when they see it! Which is great, the looks he got were fun! Those people were stupid, who would have looked so long! They had to take a look and run for their lives ... even if that wouldn't have made the difference!
