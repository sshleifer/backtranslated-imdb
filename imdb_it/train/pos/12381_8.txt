A young woman who is a successful model, who is also engaged and who has twice attempted suicide, is chosen by a secret and distant association of Catholic priests to be the next "sentinel" to the door of hell , which apparently runs through an old but well-kept Brooklyn condo. His tenants take the ladder and can reincarnate, but apparently they cannot escape until a sentry is there to block the road. The former (John Carradine) is dead, so she, by fate or otherwise, becomes the next, and the condemned person must have her killed in order to be free. A lot of interesting details lie beneath the surface, his relationship with his father, the stories of the condemned man, his boyfriend, so you can pass on this as a horror of economic exploitation, but given the sets, the excellent cast and the general level of whimsy, this is definitely worth seeing.
