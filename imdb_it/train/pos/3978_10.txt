I had the pleasure of reading Martin Torgoff's book "Can not Find My Way Home" which is chock-full of information on drug culture in America, covering the years 1945-2000. This guy knows his job !! I found him an excellent spokesperson for this documentary. I particularly enjoyed watching the hippie era movies and the stoner culture of the 70s. The soundtrack was excellent. Whoever compiled it was certainly in touch with the motifs of every age. We hope you pack them and sell them as a CD set. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in how the LSD experiments of the 1960s forever changed American culture as we know it. One thing that was missing was a mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie "Blow"), who was presumably responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine entering this country in the 1960s and 1980s.
