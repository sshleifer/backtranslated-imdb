I thought this movie was very well done. In the mid-1950s, everything seemed accurate to me. It was well launched and credible. I don't usually care much for this kind of film, because they don't have any depth, but I heard this in-depth movie in the characters and you could feel how they felt, you really need to know them and worry them. He brought me back to my youth and let me remember a more innocent time. This film could be appreciated by men and women and by all ages. After the film was finished, I wished there was a second part. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and his family. This film is meant to be a classic. If you haven't seen it, you should try taking it when it's on TV or renting it ...
