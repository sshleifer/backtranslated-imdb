I was curious to know how the critics responded to this stimulating and stimulating film, so I went to Rotten Tomatoes and was dismayed to discover that the pompous peanut gallery that is our nation's critic has given the film an average of 43% (or "Rotten") evaluation. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if this movie doesn't move you, you have no heart. (It is interesting to note that the same film on the same site received a 74% rating from viewers). <br /> <br /> Not that the opinion of the critics is so important to me. After all, I can't think of a more useless and overpaid profession. Some cards are paid to go to the cinema (what a hard life) and it does the same thing that everyone else does on the planet: it forms an opinion. But these heels have a way of expressing themselves as if their opinion were somehow more important than yours, and worse still, they love to hate. <br /> <br /> I guarantee that this film is old-fashioned (well, except for the f-bombs), syrupy, and a little predictable ... after all, you know from the beginning that Cuba Gooding Jr. , which portrays the real-life Navy hero Carl Brashear, will triumph (eventually) at every turn simply by the way he comes across: determined and brave; strong and optimistic. <br /> <br /> But his performance and that of De Niro (like Billy Sunday, a composite character of many real-life people) are so strong, so inspiring, that you'll be your feet applauding many scenes from the movie, in particular the climax in the classroom. You should be a real stick in the mud not to be touched by these scenes. Like the film critics of our nation. Michael Rappaport is excellent as well as a sweet and stuttering diving student who makes friends with Gooding's Brashear. If someone has seen "Higher Learning", this character totally redeems that character. <br /> <br /> In any case, this confirms what I've always felt: don't listen to the critics. Watch this movie and be inspired.
