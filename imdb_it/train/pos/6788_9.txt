The story and the characters were among the best I'd ever seen. the graphics were good for PS and the cut scenes and voiceovers were incredible. I beat the game at least 3 times and loved every second of it. I felt that the problems faced by the protagonist were credible and realistic and I believe it deserves a follow-up. or at least a remake. If they do it again for the ps3, I would buy the system only for that game and maybe mgs4 it is also surprising the idea and the execution of the dragoon system is enough to justify a rental and besides this the invention even if sometimes cheating ( stupid wand buster) system of addition to combat and the plot makes this game a well-defined purchase.
