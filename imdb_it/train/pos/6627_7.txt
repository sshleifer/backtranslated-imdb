An obscure scanner, minority relationship, Blade Runner, Sin City and Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow ?? if you are a fan of one of these, then it is worth a try. <br /> <br /> The French animation project "Renaissance" took seven years to make a tight budget and tonight I finally saw it at a private screening for the Stockholm International Film Festival. My spontaneous reaction is awe; my further reflection is "huh, clean" and a closer analysis unfortunately has a resounding "meh". It's a fantastic science fiction triumph on the surface, but I scratch it or even hit it a little and its unnecessarily complex plot becomes glaring, as do the flat characters. <br /> <br /> However it is clear that the people in the Onyx films have done something spectacular with the surface mentioned above. The images are staggering. They used the motion capture of the live action adapted to the animation of the keyframes, with the black of the stiff jet and the contrasts of a brilliant white and a very shady roto-covered background. For those of you who aren't down with "technical jargon", the movie looks like a fully animated Sin City. Its fluid, transparent, dark and stylized model is completed by a large flash. It is a vision. Yet the merit is also due to the clear sound effects that take the form of humming, futuristic weapons, suspenseful music, heavy raindrops and broken glass fragments. It's the wet dream of all tech-nerds ... <br /> <br /> The film magnifies a mysteriously illuminated, desolate and futuristic Paris in which a large corporation called "Avalon" started to intertwine in the lives of the citizens with surveillance (think of the fluid transparent screens of Minority Report) and genetic engineering. The latter leads to a mysterious abduction of the young researcher Ilona (voiced by the beautiful Romola Garai). Cut of our hard and hot cop, the protagonist Karas (Daniel Craig) ?? a man who takes the law in his hands ?? who is assigned the case of finding and recovering Ilona. In this case, he is helped by Illona's sister with whom he also begins a love affair. A very subdued love story, if I may say so. <br /> <br /> The world of the Renaissance is remarkable. The director Christian Volckman takes a good excuse to merge the noir themes and the result is an urban jungle full of cadets, mice, femme fatale and solitary detective who hide in the shadow of the squalid slum. The problem is that the creators have undoubtedly felt the need to have extremely clear and definite archetypes in history, or the film would have been "too surreal" for the mainstream public, due to its filthy animation format. It follows that we have a multitude of clich√© characters like evil-laughing bad guys, squalid criminal bosses and sturdy chicks who blow smoke every time they get. He puts noir in your face, and it is not necessary. <br /> <br /> What's worse is that the dialogue is a bit forced. It seems that every line exists for the sole reason of pushing the plot. This is nothing fatal because the plot is so complex once it needs a clear direction. Daniel Craig also helps here, bringing an absurd attitude to his character as a policeman. At some point in the Renaissance, it is seen in a vivid car chase which is certainly one of the most adrenaline-filled and high-level sequences in the film. Unfortunately, the novelty of science fiction images has exhausted the mail in this car chase and "Renassaince" could benefit from a slight shortening. In summary, a very interesting but imperfect futuristic comics experience. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
