Only after a little reflection did I decide that I liked this film. And after reading the comments of all the other posters here, and thinking about it again, I decided that I liked it very much. I love American films, probably because they are so narrative. They usually have a well-defined beginning, center and end. "Presque rien", on the other hand, does not make this attempt. I disagree with other posters that say it is "too artistic". However, this film is intended to evoke your sensory memories. So often during the film you feel like you're there ... feel the summer sun, the breezes, the heat, the winter cold, the company, the loneliness, etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the director involves you in the lives of the characters, which is why so many people feel so strongly that the film has disappointed them. After I finished watching it, I felt the same thing. But on some reflection, I realized that this was how the film should be: the "story" is not the narrative, it is the emotions that you (the viewer) feel. <br /> <br /> Lighting, landscapes, and camera corners immerse you in the scenes: they are rich, refined and alive with details and nuances. Although I normally can't film without a fully developed storyline (after all, it's not a 'supposed' story to tell a story), this film is definitely one of my new favorites.
