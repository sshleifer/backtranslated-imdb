The Unseen is done in a style more similar to the old Hollywood mysteries than a horror show. The film is rather slow but many bizarre images keep the film alive and watchable. The basic idea of ​​little girls being followed by something in the basement is old, but good acting and production make the film worth seeing. The film is noteworthy for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects. I rated it 8 out of 10.
