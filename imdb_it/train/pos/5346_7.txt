Carol, the girl at the center of the story, is transplanted to a foreign land, Spain, at the height of the civil war conflict in the late 1930s. For this girl, everything is new, in its strangeness. The war and his father are his constant concerns, while she must immerse herself in a provincial culture that is years behind what she has in New York. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe directs this film with numbers. Carol's family is obviously divided, while Carol's mother is married to someone who is an aviation pilot with the left faction, the rest of the family's sympathies are with Franco and the fascists who won the conflict. <br /> <br /> History adds nothing to what has already been said, much better, but it is an easy film to watch. The magnificent landscape of northern Spain is shown. Don't expect much action since most of what happens revolves around Carol and the guys making friends. <br /> <br /> Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and innocence. Maria Barranco is the mother of Carol Aurora, the one who went to America. Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja, the teacher who makes friends with Carol. Carmelo Gomez, plays Alfonso, the man that Aurora left behind when he left for America. This actor, who usually has leading roles in most Spanish films, has nothing to do, as it remains an enigma throughout the film.
