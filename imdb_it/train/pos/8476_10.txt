*** Spoilers * <br /> <br /> My father recorded this film for me when I was 3 years old. At 5, I had seen him over 400 times. I just looked at it and looked at it. And I still do it today! He has a dark plot, a lamb's mother is killed by a wolf - a very emotional scene - and wants to become a wolf, like him. After years of training, the lamb is transformed into a REALLY wicked looking thing. He and the wolf travel in his old barn, but he can't kill lambs, no matter how much he wants. He ends up killing the wolf, but he is no longer seen as a lamb by his former friends, and cannot return to his previous lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Art is beautiful, songs are ... well, okay, and dubbing is better than some things today. <br /> <br /> All in all, you just * have * to see this movie, it's a great masterpiece. Although it is very difficult to find today. <br /> <br />
