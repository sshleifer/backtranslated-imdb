While the films B were going, it was well above average (I warn the reader now that I can reveal some key elements of the plot or other parts of the film, even though I'm trying to minimize such a trend). Since sequels usually go, it was absolutely fantastic (despite a "cookie cutter" approach in trying to copy some elements from the original verbatum of the film. Despite this sometimes boring tendency, it seemed to work in this particular film, as long as the viewer could separate his attention from the comparisons with the original "scanners". <br /> <br /> The film was similar in terms of the "Superman" series, in terms of describing the main character of his early childhood and his relationship with his parents ( which seemed modeled along the lines of the Kents in the stories of "Superman") and the theme of a morally pure hero possessing extraordinary powers from an early age, etc. The representation of profound feelings of alienation of prodigious or otherwise non-children, adolescents and / or compliant adults was a theme that reminded me of films like "Real Genius" and (to a lesser extent) "Doctor Mordrid" and struck a particular agreement strong. <br /> <br /> The film had a positive message and, and it was fun to watch. I found some insights and accuracy (in terms of representation of some aspects of paranormal experiences) fascinating, and even deeply touching at times. These moments occasionally appeared among all the great formula-based and free sex (the quality, in this case, how the sexual elements were made with taste) and the violence that makes the films B (or Shakespearean dramas, for that matter!) so much fun to watch! <br /> <br /> This is a must for all fans of comics, science fiction, "remote viewing" and horror fans! With the right exposure in the right circles, the film could develop a rather cult following, along with the original "Scanners".
