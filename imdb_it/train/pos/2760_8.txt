Everyone we meet influences our way of thinking, modifies our ways, a little of that person touches us. "The Eighth Day" takes up this theme (Compare "Rainmaker"). In this film Harry (Daniel Auteuil), a sales psychology expert businessman meets Georges (Pascal Duquenne), a boy from Down's Syndrome on the run. The winning performances of both these actors give this film its main strength. The opening sequence is excellent in which Georges relates his theory on the creation of the world and in the final scene we discover what God created on the eighth day. There are some moments in history that are very frustrating for Harry. For example, Georges who is completely uninhibited requires a pair of expensive shoes and does not have enough money. It's the kind of scene where you laugh in your tears. I liked the scene where the Down's Syndrome group on a trip to the art gallery ran off on a bus and blocked the Paradis amusement park. The most amusing of all embarrassments is the scene in which Harry and Georges pass a floating horse on the highway and, looking back, Georges gives the driver a sharp greeting. But there are also some delicate scenes, especially the impressive use of the foregrounds of the hands - the hands that feel the sun, the wind and the rain, the hands that reach out, the hands that reach out and tighten in love and in friendship. This is the real cinema that touches the heart. There are very moving scenes in which Georges proposes to Nathalie, where Georges cradles Harry's head in his arms, where Georges continues to call his dear mother, where Georges teaches Harry to laugh ... I heard there was a profound message in the film that life is beautiful - the very presence of the grass (did you know it cries when you cut it?), the trees above your head, the singing of birds, the small insects - all the miraculous creatures of nature. They are all there to be enjoyed if we relax (like Harry and Georges) look around and listen ...... A good movie.
