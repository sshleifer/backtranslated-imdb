This is an incredible film. I can't remember the last time I saw a Swedish film in layers. It's fun, it's tragic, it's exciting, and above all it's a slice of life in the small Swedish city. Crush the clichés and get deeper. It makes you feel connected, not only to the main characters, but to all the characters. <br /> <br /> The girl from the big city that dates back to her roots, her little hometown, to celebrate her father's 70th birthday, crossing streets with people she hasn't met in several years. Although the story itself is not unique, it offers a new approach. The center of the story is the relationship between three sisters (at different stages of life), which are not very close. Or at least you don't realize how close they are. <br /> <br /> A key reason that makes it so easy to connect to people in this film is the immaculate cast. First of all, I am more than satisfied that there are absolutely no so-called "A-list" Swedish actors in this film. There is usually a handful of actors who have the ability to find their way in almost all major productions in Sweden. This time the production company has managed to keep it true by merging actors who really seem to love their profession. Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress from Eva Röse to show that you don't need words to convey an emotion. <br /> <br /> Even writing is very appealing. The dialogue is more than credible, and compared to other Swedish films of last year or two, it is ahead for miles. Maria Blom controls everything from the beginning, and if you didn't know it, you'd never guess that this is her first time writing E to direct a feature film. I can't wait for his neighbor. <br /> <br /> Once you start looking at it, you really want to see it.
