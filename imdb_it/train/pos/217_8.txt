THE SUNSHINE BOYS is the exhilarating 1975 film adaptation of Neil Simon on a retired team of Vaudevillians, played by Walter Matthau and George Burns, who had a very bitter breakup and was asked to reunite once again for a special television or something. The problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with one another. Richard Benjamin appears as the nephew of Matthau, a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this meeting a reality. This hot and winning comedy is a beautiful Valentine's Day for a forgotten form of entertainment ... vaudeville and works mainly thanks to one of Neil Simon's best scripts and the outstanding work of Matthau, Burns and Benjamin. Burns won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for this, but I think Matthau turns away from this film with his hilarious performance as Willy Clark. Matthau was nominated for Best Actor but had no chance against Nicholson for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST; however, in another year, this was an Oscar performance. Matthau controls the screen and there is no fake note in this wonderfully synchronized performance. The scene in which he is doing auditions for a spot of fries and can't get the right name of the product is a classic. THE SUNSHINE BOYS is a warm and winning comedy by Neil Simon that shines thanks to the unbeatable chemistry between Matthau and Burns.
