Steely, the powerful supreme of the gangster Frankie Diomede (the always fantastic rugged and wrinkled Lee Van Cleef) was arrested and sent to prison so he could wipe out a traitorous sans partner. He gets the fool of the buffoon and the young aspirant Tony Breda (an amiable portrait of Tony Lo Bianco) is caught as well. Frank and Tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank get out of the fight and assists him in his quest to take revenge on a rival mobster group led by the ruthless Louis Annunziata (played smoothly by Jean Rochefort). The director Michele Lupo, who works on an engaging screenplay by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, tells the clean story with a steady rhythm, supports an adequately gritty but occasionally carefree tone, and puts on wild action pieces with bri (a bad brawl in prison and a protracted struggle for the speed of the machine as the lightning salient point). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco show a pleasant, shocking and engaging chemistry on the screen; the relationship between their characters is alternately fun and moving. The beautiful Edwige Fenech does not have as much to do as Tony's companion, the orchid, but at least she manages to lay bare her incredibly brash and voluptuous body in a very appreciated free nude shower scene. The pulsating, pulsating, syncopated Riz Ortolani jazz / rhythmic soundtrack certainly hits the soulfully swing spot. The refined cinematography of Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is also impressive. A really elegant and fun little winner.
