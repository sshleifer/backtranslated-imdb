Wow what an episode! After last week, seeing Mellisa continually make cameo on the friendship of Annie and Brandi, I almost vomited. But that was nothing until Mellisa's tirade was seen after she was fired. Seeing her limp over her cast spitting obscenities and screaming for someone to take her purse was absolutely the most hilarious thing I've ever had on reality TV. He kept yelling at people outside the set to get his "everybody" clothes as if someone else was wearing one of his horrible clothes. Mellisa, are you 40 and still acting up? Then Joan starts calling Annie and Brandie every name in the book, and gets up and leaves the show! Both rivers are spoiled brats who have been left on the show so long to keep their vows high. Mellisa cries and refuses to do an exit interview, it simply shows America what everyone thought, you are a spoiled child. WAH WAH I can't get my way! I love how Annie told the cameras that she could manipulate Mellisa to think in her own way, and then she did exactly that. Mellisa is by far the smartest competitor and clearly deserves to win the entire game.
