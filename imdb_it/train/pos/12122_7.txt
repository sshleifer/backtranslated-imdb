The film could be fantastic. I just saw it last night, but I can't give an honest opinion because I read the book first. The book is much better than the film and I was disappointed with the film. If you're going to watch "Of Human Bondage", don't read the book in advance. On the other hand, the book is so beautiful and contains much more than the love affair Phillip has with Mildred, that you could enjoy again after watching the movie. I do not make this statement lightly. I read an average book every 4 days and read such different authors as Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. "Of Human Bondage" gets my vote as one of the ten best novels ever written.
