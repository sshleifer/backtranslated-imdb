This collects about a year after the events in "Basic Instinct". Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. While having sex with a soccer player while speeding in a car that goes 110 miles per hour (don't ask) she gets off the road and ends up in the Thames. It survives - it doesn't. Police take on psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to see if he is mentally competent to stand trial. Of course he starts playing with his mind instead, with a lot of murder and sex. <br /> <br /> This film was condemned before it even opened. It took forever to get a cast and a director, the script problems were constant and the cast wasn't happy (Morrissey often complained about the movie). However it's not too bad. It is very similar to the first - there is lush music, beautiful places, lots of sex and nudity (this had to be changed for an R), a pleasantly twisted plot and good acting - but no impact. It looks like a masterpiece of the first. People are killed here with a choker leash (I think) ... just like people were killed by an icebreaker in the first one. In a cute moment Stone picks up an ice pick and looks at it with desire. He is also playing mind games with a man and may be involved in murders. The similarities are too obvious. <br /> <br /> This is also VERY R rated - there is a lot of explicit sexual chatter, male nudity (Morrissey looks much better naked than Michael Douglas), female nudity (Stone still looks great) and some bloody murders. The acting is good across the board. The stone is simply fantastic here; Morrissey looks sad but that's okay; Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis are good at supporting roles. <br /> <br /> So - this is not bad at all but it looks like a remake of the first. I still recommend it. People just attacked this because Stone didn't like it very much and they thought it was stupid to do a "Basic ..." sequel 14 years after making it.
