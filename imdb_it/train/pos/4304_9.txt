I remember seeing this movie when I was about 7; and at the moment it shocked me. I had already seen a violent film, but I never saw a film with the consequences and the reality of violence. This film not only shows this, but also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this film did and the incident failed to do was to be honest. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had a built-in anti-Asian bias) and came from a morally superior position. The Grand Canyon has come from a point of view so raw and real that it actually ends up on a higher ground than an accident. Especially when comparing the endings. The end of the crash is this seemingly clean little ending that ties everything together. While the Grand Canyon simply ends with a quiet note, in which you know it won't change much in the character's life, but because life goes on too, there is no suitable ending. No matter how good ... bad. There is no end to a chapter to start another.
