Tom the cat, Jerry the mouse and Spike the Dog (here called Butch, his third name, his second being "Killer") decide to sign a peace treaty for everyone they love. It is strange and a bit unnatural to see them all friends like this and their friends also seem to think so. But in the end thanks to a disagreement over a steak, everything is back to normal and everything is as it should be. This short is the second of the three on the new Spotlight DVD to edit and I have no idea why this was. This comic can be found on disc one of the DVDs of the "Tom & Jerry" Spotlight collection <br /> <br /> My Grade: B
