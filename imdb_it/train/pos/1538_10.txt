This is the best movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I live a few miles from the village where the story takes place, and I know how things are going in this area in Sweden. The film tells the truth, believe me! Criticize and honor the lifestyle of Dalarna, and the producer wants people who watch the film to be more open and care more about your closest friends and relatives. <br /> <br /> But if you live in another small village anywhere in Sweden (or in another country) you will probably recognize a lot from this movie too. <br /> <br /> Thanks Maria Blom!
