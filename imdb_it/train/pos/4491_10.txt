I love this movie "Primavera e vino porto". I was born in Leigh, a town about 7 miles from Bolton, I moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20 years old. My job was daily via Little Lever through Farnworth, sometimes on a bike but then in the car when I could afford it. The film brings back all the memories of working class neighbors who were almost always broke, but who would always helped if they could. Fred Dibnah was around the corner from Bromwich St. It was my bed was. If you didn't see the movie when it was first released, you could be forgiven for comparing it with soap like Coronation St, well, I agree it's a soap, but then it was called 'Kitchen Sink Drama!' Watch this film for the talented cast who soon became a household name with frequent TV roles, I look mainly for shots of the location and the positive factor of poor but happy people!
