Would such an environmental production have failed in its main objective, which was to properly adapt Allende's novel? Obviously yes. Bille August has managed to create a superficial and superficial film in which basic elements of the South American mentality are presented simply as collateral events, resulting in total incoherence. I can't believe there was a whole production team that couldn't understand the book! There is obviously technical quality in this film and I think the actors did their best with what they had in their hands, but something is missing. And this something was the most important part.
