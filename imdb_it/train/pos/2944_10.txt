This is undoubtedly the greatest show of all time. I've seen many stand up shows, I've been on many stand up shows and I've seen Bet's Comic View, but I've never seen anyone able to match Murphy's abilities on this show. The impressions are excellent, the scenes are fantastic and the timing is perfect. You can even tell the audience that it really comes. When he did Raw a few years later he was also very nice, but this is the number 1 in my book. It also shows that at one time, particularly the early 1980s, Murphy was funny. My favorite parts of the show is when he is telling the family barbecue and "Gelato !!! Mooommmm !! The ice cream man is coming !!!!" Another big part is where his mother is like Clint Eastwood.
