Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) has just been abandoned by his wife, because he is one of the most irritating and neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his way out, but he can't get it to work, so he heads for his friend's house. Even Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) is recently divorced and lives in a celibate paradise. Smoking, gambling, hitting chicks, eating out and never cleaning is a paradise for him. Well, with the suicide attempts Oscar decides to let Felix enter. At the beginning, it's a game made in heaven, Felix cooks and cleans and helps Oscar pay his food in time, but soon Oscar is happy for women and Felix (who in today's world would probably be gay) is not ready to move forward. They invite a pair of British birds and find Felix so tender that soon they and Felix are crying and chatting about his family life, leaving Oscar denied. It is so, it explodes and throws it out, but Felix is ​​not as helpless as he seems, and soon he has the upper hand. My favorite sentence "Leave me some notes on my pillow. I told you 158 times I can't stand small notes on my pillow." We are all without cereals. F.U. "It took me three hours to understand F.U. it was Felix Ungar!" Based on a play by Neil Simon (who also wrote the screenplay), this has a certain theatrical feeling. The set and the blow and the appearance seem quite similar to those of the game (for better or for worse). Lemmon and Mathau have excellent comic chemistry and have appeared in the Grumpier Old Men and Out to Sea films, taking up the same picky / slob roles, but with different names (to avoid royalty problems, I'm sure). <br /> <br /> This film is like strawberries dipped in chocolate. The chocolate is smooth, sweet and rich, the strawberry is tart, juicy and bright red (unless you get the ugly greenish ones). They are almost polar opposites, but together, the contrasts are evident and make a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
