Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Good boy! Too bad that Knightly is not as handsome as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong did a fabulous job. Bernard Hepton was perfect as Father Emmas. I love the final scene (which is an addition to the novel, but well written) when the harvest is in and Knightly dinner with his workers and high society friends. Emma must show that she accepts it now. She is a changed woman. It's too fast, but OK. I'll buy it. Samantha Bond plays the former ruler and confidant of Emma. She is beautiful. just as I would have imagined. I believe that when the United Kingdom makes a Jane Austen it is the best. The American versions of English literature are made for money and not for quality. See this!
