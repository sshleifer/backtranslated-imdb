Yeah, for sure. Sammo Hung has already starred in the lead role in the 1983 film "Zu Warrios from the Magic Mountain". Now, 2001, he does it again with "Zu Warriors". But this time, he finally does it well. You rarely see it in wuxia, more often in the classic oriental or criminal slapstick. But this role simply fits him! The ancient Chinese legend about the mountain of zu is not often represented in the movies (as far as I know about films translated for the West). Although the legend contains a wide range of interesting stories and possibilities. Straight said: you've never seen a story the same way in a modern movie! And that's great! And wow: all the colors, plus the incredibly deep and heart-directed story makes you fall in love with this movie in an instant. The first time I looked at it, I had to watch it again instantly, and I did it. OK true, I didn't understand all this the first time. But that just makes it better! You know, you didn't understand everything, because there is so much spice in it! Therefore it is a pleasure for oneself to watch it over and over again. And yes, it grows deeper in your heart, the more often you look at it. <br /> <br /> Summary: A story to love, characters you cry with, and really: a film you never forget! - Editor's note: well, I think I have to watch it right away: D
