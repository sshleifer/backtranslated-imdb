I'm not sure why you don't play in Peoria, apparently, but this is a very funny and clever English comedy. It is set at the end of the "swinging sixties". Peter Sellars is as fantastic as the rich, forty-year-old womanizer serial. The delightful Goldie Hawn, who plays a 19-year-old American girl in London, is initially Sellars's "catch of the day". But the critic of urban cuisine cannot help but fall in love with the dizzying American blonde. <br /> <br /> Humor, pathos, great script, strong interpretations by the protagonists and support castes. <br /> <br /> It is a fantastic film, and the best gag is the last line. <br /> <br /> Try it, you'll like it.
