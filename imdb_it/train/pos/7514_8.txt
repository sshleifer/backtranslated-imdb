It's not Michael Jordan <br /> <br /> Think of all the wonderful NBA players whose career light has been tarnished for no other reason than the timing of their birth. Their names could easily escape from the lips of the public like Russell, Cousy, Byrd, Magic, McHale, Oscar, Wilt, the list goes on; but the volume is lowered a bit, for Stockton and Malone, Charles, Patrick and all the other great players who have always lost the titles on Michael. <br /> <br /> I saw written that Gretchen Mol's career was flaming in the wake of the cover article of the 1998 Vanity Fair issue that included the inevitable superstar for Mrs. Mol. Later it was said that it had been exaggerated. I do not agree. <br /> <br /> I still remember that for some time after seeing "The Devil's Advocate" in '97 or '98, I would be confused as to which actress played Mary Ann Lomax. Was it Mol or Theron? Oh yeah! Charlize Theron was the one in "2 days in the valley" and "Mighty Joe Young" and Gretchen Mol was in "Donnie Brasco", "Celebrity" and "Rounders". <br /> <br /> I had seen "The Thirteenth Floor" (Mol) and "Sweet November" (Theron), I had practically straightened them but I still put them in the same drawer of mental files. Both had great talent, they had sweet faces, similar body types, short blond hair and so on. <br /> <br /> But more work was offered to Theron. I loved her as Sara Deever and as Adele Invergordon her beauty was definitely intimidating. <br /> <br /> In 2003 "Monster" was released and from that moment until the awarding of the same Oscar, all the directors knew who "The prize for the best actress would have gone. And deservedly! Theron was Aileen Wuornos. The the only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made the real Aileen Wuornos tick would be to somehow reproduce the digital video trapped in Selby's head, and for a great talent to make oneself so unattractive physically! Unheard! <br /> <br /> Then the "Notorious Bettie Page" was published in 2005. Mol's performance was extraordinary. Perhaps she was standing in the shadow of Mrs. Theron. It was like the ballroom for the celebration of victory for the presidential candidate at a loss, no one came and no one cared, he was seen as a continuation of an old story, once a promising actress with a declining career he plays a nudity part in a "B" movie. , no, no! Mistaken! No matter what you think of the film (and I like films from the fifties) if you go to this, you will miss one of the best performances of that year. Mrs. Moll was Bettie as much as Mrs Theron was Aileen. Unfortunately Aileen, for the film audience, is the most sympathetic character. For whatever reason, an amoral sociopathic killer is less embarrassing for us than a naive, unsophisticated, uninhibited and religious girl, whose capital crime was to live her life totally confident and completely exposed. Bettie Page was one of the icons of the fifties. His photos and films were never sexual, never pornographic, but she presented herself as an almost caricature of all the vicious things. There was no sense of realism, only parody. Ms. Moll has captured the very essence of the character. He earned 20 pounds to add zaftig to his normally slim figure and when he posed for various photographers in the film, his body was Bettie's. His total frontal lack of inhibitions corresponds exactly to everything that has been published in Bettie. Cinematographic nudity normally describes eroticism or sexuality. In this film everything is centered on innocence. Seeing nude Gretchen / Bettie didn't make me want to skip her but I instilled the desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other. If you pass this movie you will miss one of the best performances in recent years. By the way, shame on the MPAA for giving this rating to R.
