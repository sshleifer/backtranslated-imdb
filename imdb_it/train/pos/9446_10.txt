James Dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author. When reading "Deliverance", one is immediately transported to the lush forests of the deep south. When you look at the film version of John Boorman's book, you realize how accurately it holds the essence of the book. The camera is as descriptive as narration. The characters are fully realized and the portraits are fantastic. I saw this film for the first time in 1992, after my first year of college. I was in a phase where I was watching movies that were all released within a couple of years of my birth in 1973. Among them were "Patton", "Papillon" and "All the President's Men"; good movies, all of them. This was easily the group class. This says a lot.
