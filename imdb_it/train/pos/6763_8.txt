Elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when people (at least people who could do such a thing) sit around and talk about film noir. <br /> <br /> Some of the best films of the genre, "Out of the Past", "The Killers", "In A Lonely Place", "Night and the City", manage a level of sophisticated elegance that elevates them beyond a clumsy phrase and its connotations of presumptuous shadows, fedora and femme fatale. <br /> <br /> "Where the Sidewalk Ends", a film quite difficult to find - the only copy perhaps in Manhattan's best video library was a crude bootleg from the AMC cable channel - belongs to a category with these classics. <br /> <br /> From the moment the black cloud of the credits passes, a curtain is wandering around the dilapidated world of soloist Marc Dixon, and as the moments pass, it gets closer and closer, threatening the suffocation. <br /> <br /> Sure, he's that infamous "cop with a dark past", but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a dingy look and tormented intensity that makes you as uncomfortable as it sounds. And yes, he fanned suspects for too long, and the newly promoted boss (Karl Malden, in a typically rugged and impressive trip) warns him "for the last time". <br /> <br /> Yet Dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now. And boy, didn't they have to come? <br /> <br /> "Hoods, dusters, cups, gutters of nickel rats" spits when that hard nut of a leader scares him and unrolls all the complaints that the office has received on Dixon's right hook. The advice is that it cool for its own good. But instead he takes things into his own hands. <br /> <br /> And what a world of trouble he finds when he relies on his instincts, and falls back on a nature that may or may not have been passed down from a previous generation. <br /> <br /> Right from the start it is in depth with the policemen, the union, its partner. Dixon's questionable involvement in a "murder investigation" threatens his work, making him ask if it is simply the basis of those he has sworn to bring. Like Bogart in "Lonely Place", can "escape what is it?" <Br /> <br /> When he has no one else to turn to, he finds that he has practically condemned his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty (the wonderful Gene Tierney) that looks like he could turn his sterile bachelor life into something that it's worth going home to. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of this superb film is tense and compelling. The group of writers who contributed to the production polished the script with a high gloss - the dialogue is quick without disintegrating into a dated, passionate forage parody without becoming melodramatic or sloppy. <br /> <br /> And all this high-level direction and acting are not too clear or polished to loosen the film's emotional grip. The angelic and soft focus beauty of Gene Tierney is used to great effect. She shows herself a sizable actress, and her gentle, kind nature is boundless here like her psychosis in "Leave her in Heaven". The scenes between Tierney and Andrews's Dixon get more intense and touching the closest seems to self-destruct. <br /> <br /> Near the end of his rope, cut, bruised and exhausted, Dixon sums up his destiny: "Even innocent people can enter terrible jams ..." he says. "A false move and you're above your head." <br /> <br /> Perhaps what makes this film so compelling is the feeling that things could go wildly badly for almost everyone - especially for someone who is trying so hard to do well - with a slight shift in the wind, a wrong decision or punch, or, more frighteningly, due to factors over which you have no control. Noir has always reflected the darkest fears, brought them to the surface. "Where the Sidewalk Ends" does it realistically. <br /> <br /> (A choice to be reckoned with: this film, for the rest sterling, has a dubious beauty dub of a blonde model that would not seem out of place on the Mystery Science Theater. What a strange thing.) <br /> <br /> But fans of Noir - heck, ALL fans of the movie - who haven't seen this are in for a terrific treatment.
