I read a little about Che before watching this movie and you want to know something, he was a real hero to people because he just wanted to see equality for all and he hated what oppressive forces were doing to his people as well as all other Latin Americans in general! Now, I don't know about others, but for me it did the right thing by wanting socialism so that everyone had to pay their fair share. However, the powerful elite obviously had no intention of doing so. So rather than understanding what Che Guevera wanted, they were forced to kill him in an attempt to suppress the revolution. It didn't work because there were too many of his other followers who only picked up where he left off. A good example of this was when Castro continued his leadership in Cuba. As far as I am concerned and how he said it. Just before he died: "If you kill me, that's fine, but you're just killing a man, you'll never kill the cause!" I couldn't have said it better than myself. <br /> <br /> But ... ALL ... that's why I give this movie a 7 out of 10.
