Here Italy (I write from Venice). Why canceled? The ABC should have given him the opportunity to build an audience. The cast (with Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I've seen lately. We need more shows like this to make viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals and not carefree drones. I hope ABC will reconsider its decision or another station will take it over.
