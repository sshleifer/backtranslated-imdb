I saw this movie with my mother when I was in high school many years ago. At the time I wasn't the least bit interested in the work, but it changed my opinions. I really enjoyed this film and since then I have really enjoyed the work. I even bought many of his CDs. Who cares what his acting skills were, in practice he only played himself, which was adorable. He was so charming, so charismatic; Honestly, I just wanted to hug him. I feel very sad that so many people criticize him so hard. He was so simple, he didn't accept people pushing him around or judging him for his actions. He deserves to be respected and admired for his talent. We will surely miss it !!!
