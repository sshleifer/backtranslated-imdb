This film is the most cult metal film ever. Premise: a child receives a definitive recording of his favorite artist Sammy Curr, who recently dies in a hotel fire. He plays it backwards and calls him out of nowhere to take revenge in the name of heavy metal on those harnessed athletes who torment him. Any true metal fan will appreciate this movie, and if you are an athletic metal head, play a Sammy Curr album backwards ......... no wait for it to be fictional, take this movie well and watch with his fist in the air, his head beating and the volume at 11!
