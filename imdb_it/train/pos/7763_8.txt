Something about Hollywood, someone has a success and is always quick to be copied. And another thing is that the players have given some of their best performances away from their home studio. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson got such accolades for his performance in the Giant movie in Texas that Universal executives must have thought, let's go to another modern setting in Texas right away. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Robert Stack got good reviews for The High and the Mighty as the pilot who was bursting under the strain of flying a damaged plane that was natural to give it another role slit. <br /> <br /> Both of these goals were achieved in Written on the Wind. Before Hudson was the big owner of the ranch, he is now the son of a hunting companion of Robert Stack's father who took Hudson under his wing. In other words, the part of James Dean without the racism of James Dean of Giant. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency that uses the Stack's Hadley Oil Company. Hudson likes her, but she is dazzled by the millions of Stacks and when she makes love with a girl she has the means to really pursue a campaign. She marries Stack. <br /> <br /> And last but not least, we have Dorothy Malone who is the amoral sister of Stack who has a yen for Rock, but Rock is not about to intertwine with this wild child. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone has spent over 10 years in a lot of colorless film heroine roles before coming to this gem. She won the Best Supporting Actress Award for the part by Marilee Hadley and was well deserved. <br /> <br /> If you like the Fifties technicolor of the Fifties soap opera, this is the movie for you.
