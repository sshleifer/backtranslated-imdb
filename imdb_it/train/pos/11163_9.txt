I love this free-skin movie! Walsh is a true master of the cinematographic form, his film was sometimes overlooked in my opinion. But this film is one of my favorites because it really gives you the impression of the moment when the film was set. <br /> <br /> All the wonderful characters that existed, the lifestyle, the way of dressing, the way they spoke, OK could be exaggerated, but it's nice to know that there were occasions when two men tried to outdo each other with crazy stunts. <br /> <br /> I just felt it was a piece of history that should be solved by many people and appreciated for it. <br /> <br /> Can I have it somewhere on DVD? I only saw it on TV. But for those who want a slice of life movie over that period of time this is perfect.
