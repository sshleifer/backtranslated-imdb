Wow, I can't believe I'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie. <br /> <br /> Although the film itself seemed quite interesting, the real thing that attracted me was Matt Lillard, most people probably think that they are too happy with caffeine or just lousy but we are both the same age and of the same generation and I've seen this guy so many times that it's one of my favorites now. This is one of the few films in which SLC Punk, another great Lillard film, stars. <br /> <br /> Baiscally is the plot of your usual robbery films but with more twists and turns, which start to captivate you with madness. Very noteworthy in this film is another great actor named vincent D'Onofrio, a very undervalued person in the film industry. The woman in the film is a newcomer and it's not so bad even though you know they took her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =) <br /> <br /> It's a game of jack vs jill vs bob I want to reap the benefits but share with anyone. They all try to kill each other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows his true feat as JAck that starts with the whole scheme. Vincent and the woman play a couple of art thieves who need money because of lack of work. Vince's character is a bit unbalanced and skitzed throughout the film, but this only adds to the intensity of the film. <br /> <br /> The surprises on the right and left are well received and the finish is not very clich√© and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like. This film really interested me, besides the fact that Matt was there, it's a fantastic film and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Probably the critic won't appreciate this film, but they don't watch films because in any case they love movies.
