Here's another movie that doesn't really need many recommendations. It's a classic comedy, very funny and fun and that, of course, eventually inspired a successful television series that many would say to be even better (I enjoy both, personally). <br /> <br /> For some, it's hard to get warm with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were weaned on the TV show with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or maybe vice versa). But what we have achieved in both cases are four good actors who in real life seemed so similar to their film colleagues that they managed to make these characteristics their own. It is Neil Simon's humorous material that is the key, and where laughter really comes from. <br /> <br /> For those who have never heard of THE ODD COUPLE, it is the story of a neurotic and fussy (Lemmon) who is chased out of a 12-year-old marriage by his long-lived wife and moves into Manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible friend (Matthau). Pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls makes some situations extremely entertaining.
