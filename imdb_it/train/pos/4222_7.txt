I like this episode a bit, Ruth Gordon is good if not a little friend as always. As has been stated, the music is very good, and has a bad mood that does not exist in all episodes. <br /> <br /> But there is a big hole in the plot, so large that you can drive a fleet of trucks through it. It is established that the light does not work in the vault. Don't you think that the very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked? You would think that in a short time they would have unscrewed the light bulb and so they found the note. Assuming this is a whodunit fiction, and there will always be several holes, but this seems too obvious. <br /> <br /> It doesn't really make Columbo the hidden genius when the light doesn't work but the testimony of the "bed of death" continues without foundation, apparently for days.
