After Chicago, I was beginning to lose respect for Richard Gere and then The Flock arrived. There is only a nice smile and a couple of facial gestures in stock can make you, but it showed me that he finally took possession of his trade and can act with the best of them. Clare Danes was also as super as her "trainee / substitute". Some have suggested that there was too much unnecessary violence, but I don't see it that way. Nothing of what I have seen has penalized the power of this film. I was really shocked not to have heard of it in theaters and instead of meeting him at Blockbuster. Truly an exceptional film with the right mix of action, suspense, chills and social conscience. Good as 7even? Well maybe. And you will see better acting than Gere than anyone who has ever been out of Pitt.
