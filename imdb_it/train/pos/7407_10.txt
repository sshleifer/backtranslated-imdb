This film took me completely by surprise. I watched it 2 or 3 times. I really enjoyed this movie. There were many truths about this movie. I love all the characters in this movie. This film makes a lot of sense because the company "becomes more advanced". What does culture lose? Don't look like a preacher. I can really relate to this film from my son and lose myself in part of my life that will never come back or will never have been the same. This film is among my top 5 movies I've ever seen. There is a truth so raw that I feel when I watch the film and it is not the kind of truth you have to dig right in front of your face. The creators of this film did a great job and I really enjoyed this movie. This movie may not be for everyone, but if you have an open mind I think you'll like it.
