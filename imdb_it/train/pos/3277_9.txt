This film is fantastic in that it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way a child would do it, for adults. The idea that a child's drawings become a place where he can physically visit and have influence is wonderful. At the same time, you could have all the child psychologist and say that he is really exploring his subconscious, just like we all do in our dreams when we sleep. The piece the parrots give me is when his father is in the paper house and chases it. The only thing I can't stand is that it was marketed as a horror movie ... it really isn't. If you want to see something British with a lot of plot that makes you guess without the usual bad emotions that most movies have to use, then look at Paperhouse.
