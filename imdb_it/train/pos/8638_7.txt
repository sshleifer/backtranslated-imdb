David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a young couple of journalists who want to go to California, but can't afford it, so they "share" with another young couple (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) to save on expenses. for them to stop at various roadside murder sites, sites where serial killers have done their thing, since Brian (Duchovny) is a writer and Carrie (Forbes) is his photographer. What they don't know is that Pitt (Earley) and Lewis is a serial killer and a girlfriend who always goes along with whatever he tells me: I don't normally care about Pitt, but does justice to psycho roles. The scary thing is that he does them so well, actually I met people like him before, no, not murderers, but with practically the same mentality. In any case, as the journey progresses, Carrie assumes that the others are without money, but Earley always seems to find the money somehow. . .. it doesn't matter that you leave someone dead here and there to do it though. Lewis plays his role us ll, one he excels on, a not too bright waif who has a good heart but doesn't understand that he doesn't have to endure being beaten by Earley when he does something he doesn't like. As things start to get more unacceptable, Carrie insists that the other couple is put in a service station, and unfortunately it is at that point where she is inside that she sees a news bulletin telling her exactly who they shared the trip with , after which things go downhill for them in a quick jerk. This is not the biggest movie in the world, but it's not bad ... I looked at what was supposed to be the 'unrated' version, but I wonder how much was cut off from the nominal version, because this seemed to me quite docile, really ... not that this makes it familiar or anything, unless it's the Manson family. 7 out of 10.
