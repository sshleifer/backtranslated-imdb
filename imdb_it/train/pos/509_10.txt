"Broken Bow" takes us back to where it all began. Set 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This episode of the "Star Trek" franchise, in my opinion is the first "TOS" series to find the feelings of wonder, danger and excitement of "Going where no man has gone before". Scott Bakula is played perfectly as Jonathan Archer, the first Captain of the first "Star Ship Enterprise". He and the entire cast really show a true reverence for the Star Trek legacy. John Billingsley is as brilliant as the alien Dr. Phlox, and Jolene Blalock is totally luscious as the tempting but logical Vulcan scientific agent T'Pol. Broken Bow is, in my opinion, the best premier episode of any of the Treks, and I think Gene Roddenberry would certainly be proud.
