I love Paul McCartney. It is, in my opinion, the greatest of all time. However, I could not afford a ticket for his concert at the Tacoma Dome during the US tour. I was angry to say the least. Then I found this DVD. It was almost as good as being there. Paul is still the man and I will like this for years to come. <br /> <br /> I have a complaint. I'd like to hear everything about Hey Jude. <br /> <br /> Even Paul is not dead. <br /> <br /> The biggest single concert DVD ever. <br /> <br /> ** *** out of *****.
