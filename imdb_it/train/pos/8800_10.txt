First of all, I don't understand why some people find this film so anti-American. Of course, there are times when the United States is directly accused, as in the segments of Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to some extent, Mira Nair. But come on, they are not naive accusations; instead, they are based on real and documented facts, and all the documents issued by the CIA on Chile confirm this, for example. <br /> <br /> But back to the film itself, what I liked most is the variety of moods we find in it. We find children educated for the respect of all the people who died in the event; we find an unhappy couple who will be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find ordinary people who have their feelings downgraded in the shadow of September 11 events and react differently to this, with dignity or frustration; we even find someone in the film for whom the fall of the towers founds a moment of true happiness. <br /> <br /> All these visions and others - powerful as these or even more - create a coherent mix and help the viewer to take a look at how different people have spread around the world reacted to the events of the 'Sept. 11. So what we see is a much more complex panorama of whites and blacks, and this could make someone angry; but this is the world in which we live, and in it there is no place for the Manichaean ideologies, regardless of what the presidents or priests could tell us. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think it's a shame that there isn't even a release date for this movie in the United States of America. It's a shame because most American people wonder why this disaster happened and this movie could give some clues about them. This film makes it very clear - unlike what some people think of this forum - that everything we do today will determine our future and that the mistakes of the past will influence the way we live today.
