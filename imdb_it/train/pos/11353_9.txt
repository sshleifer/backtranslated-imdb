This film was excellent. It describes in detail the struggle between a detective engaged against the devoted ignorance of the corrupt communist regime in Russia during the 1980s. I give this film a high score for its look with no holds barred in the birth and development of forensic investigations in a globally isolated community (thanks to the Regime community). This is a graphic film. It presents an un-sensationalized picture of violence and its tragic remains. Nothing is "covered in candy" with blood or blood shed to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen. This film is based on the Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. I'm quite familiar with the real story to have a very deep appreciation for how real they have kept the film. It is not a comedy, but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor, this film is not to be missed.
