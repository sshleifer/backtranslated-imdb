This is probably one of Brian De Palma's most famous films, but it's not the best. Body Double, The Fury and Carrie are better films, but this film is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is very influenced by Hitchcock and this film is a takeoff on Psycho. Angie Dickinson is a bored housewife who is thinking of having a relationship and after her psychiatrist, played by Michael Caine, rejects an offer, Dickinson meets a man in an art gallery and ends up sleeping with him. After this point it is better not to know what happens but there is a murder and Nancy Allen is a call girl who takes a look at the killer. Dennis Franz is the appropriate detective who really doesn't trust Allen and must find the killer herself. It's a good film but it's not one of De Palma's best.
