This film is probably my favorite movie of all time. Miriam Flynn is excellent as Bunny Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is a comic genius. The rest of the cast is fantastic and the movie is really fun. A defined satire of horror films, with a strange touch. If you have fun with a fun and full of comedy evening, then go and rent this classic. You will laugh to the end!
