First of all, in defense of JOAN FONTAINE, it must be said that Ginger Rogers would have been terribly disbelieving as Alyce, the young British woman who plays the leading role. Fontaine makes a captivating photo like the heroine here, but her inexperienced acting shows up badly and her dance is better not mentioned. Fortunately, things have improved. <br /> <br /> But here are FRED ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN who get the maximum billing - and they are excellent. Burns & Allen fans will be surprised how easily they adapt to Astaire's dance routines. Particularly interesting is the fun house routine that won the Oscar for the choreographer Hermes Pans. They join Astaire in what must be the most significant moment in the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, not much can be said for the slow pace of the story - nor for some of the stale situations that require a lot of patience on the part of the viewer. It must be said that part of the humor falls to the ground and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in every Fred Astaire film of this period are subjected to conventional treatment. Only musical interludes give history the lift it needs. <br /> <br /> Some nice Gershwin songs appear once in a while, but not everyone gets the treatment they deserve. The beautiful supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner, at his best in a refined comic performance like a conniving servant, Constance Collier and Montagu Love (like Joan's father traded as a gardener by Astaire). <br /> <br /> It's a carefree fun when Burns & Allen are around to remind us how much fun they were in their broadcast days. Both are surprisingly good at keeping up with Astaire's work. <br /> <br /> The director George Stevens makes sure that the dance number of Joan Fontaine with Fred is shot at a discreet distance, but the clever photographic work cannot hide the fact that she is out of her element as Astaire's dance partner, something that seems painfully aware.
