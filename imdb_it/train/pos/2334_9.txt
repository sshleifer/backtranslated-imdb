Pushing Daisies is truly a landmark in television as an art form. Everything seems to pay tribute to Amelie and Tim Burton, but so, in a world where fresh ideas are clearly rare, this show will guarantee that you don't care if it's fresh or not. It's just brilliant. <br /> <br /> I was fascinated from the beginning, intelligent writing, Directing for backgrounds and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece from The Shield and The Wire (ok, not really good comparisons but the The beauty of Pushing Daisies is that it has no comparisons on television). Really compelling and an absolute pleasure. Perhaps like one of the Piedmontese cakes that are mentioned in such tempting ways.
