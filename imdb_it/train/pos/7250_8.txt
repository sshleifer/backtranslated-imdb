I first read the book when I was a young teenager, then I saw the movie late one night. About a year ago I checked on IMDb and found no available copies. Then I hit the web and found a site offering War Films, I'm really glad I did it, I ordered a copy and sat down again and was able to confirm why I wanted to see it again. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, to really enjoy the movie, I suggest you read a copy of the book and then watch the movie. The book is no longer in print but I traced a copy via E-bay, the author Alan White was a commando / parachutist during the 2nd World War taking part in disparate underground operations and this was his first book. It is written by someone who knows this and I believe this fact gives the authenticity of the book and the film. I didn't give the film to ten just because of the nature of the film's ending, not as good as the book. There are also a couple of lines that differ from the book, which is strange given that the book is not about the nature of large-scale war but about the individual in war. The film illustrates this exceptionally well. I have the copy of the book to allow my son to read and then the film to show him, in this order. <br /> <br /> If you can track down the book and the film, it's definitely worth it and I'd just like it to be more readily available for more to read and see, one of my best war movies, ever!
