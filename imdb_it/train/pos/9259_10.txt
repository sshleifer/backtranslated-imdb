It was simple and yet so beautiful. I think the whole sense of sexual segregation in society, which can be bitter, has been shown very gently. He had a bitter kind of hummer. The fact that most of the actors were not professionals made the film more tangible and realistic. There was also a "documentary" side in the film. The best scenes were those that all the girls, banned from watching, listened passionately to the soldier, who should have kept an eye on him, broadcasting the game. If you are an Iranian, the familiar cheer and dance in the streets after a game won, it fills you with national pride !! If you are not Iranian, you will still love it anyway!
