These first two seasons of this comic series were very strange and were not very funny and had a dramatic element in which Bill (the mother) was struggling with all the usual problems of life, but that element was a bit depressing and not it mixed well with the elements of the comedy which is probably why it was abandoned. Then it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the BBC has ever made! The chemistry between the characters of Bill and Ben was a lot of fun and in every series there were always so many brilliant and memorable sketches. Christmas specials were hilarious and a real Christmas treat. <br /> <br /> The show was interrupted when the main actor Gary Olsen, who plays Bill, died, which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films like Up 'n' Under and a very funny man RIP < br /> <br /> This underrated show has sadly disappeared from our TV screens and should not be repeated so often - Although it appears on UKTV Gold once in a while, but one or two should be repeated on BBC to show this brilliant comedy for a new audience
