Beautifully filmed, well acted and tightly programmed suspense film. He made me on the edge of my seat. I really liked the actress and I thought that the bad guy was very well done. There's not much to chew on the way of a theme here, but if you just sit in your armchair, turn off your brain, look at the industrious camera and enjoy the plot, you'll have a blast. The plot is well worn, and regular movie-goers will probably know more or less what to expect from within ten minutes. But that didn't bother me, as I enjoyed watching it unfold. In the past, they may not have focused so closely on just two characters, and there were some tempting moments in which I hoped they would let some other people have a few lines. But probably these people were right to keep the film so tightly concentrated. The plot took me by the throat soon enough and never let me go. It is not a good idea to think too much during or after the film. because I'm not sure it makes much sense. Sit down and have fun.
