Film difficult to comment on, how do you say it's bad? Well, it's not, but it's just as hard to say it's good. What is, is a compelling vision, it is as close as possible to complete devastation without being there. They are photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of Thailand, you know you want to get away but you have to look. <br /> <br /> The Naudet brothers manage the comment very well, even in the most difficult tragic moments of the circumstances, there they see on something that is happening in another country neither panders nor insults. The facts are on the cellulose and for the spectator it is necessary little to understand or understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> You can't change the story, and you shouldn't want to, this film is a testament to humanity in its darkest hour.
