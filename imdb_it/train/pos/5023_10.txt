My husband and I have just finished watching this movie. I didn't expect it to be so good! I was really amazed at how big the plot was. I'm usually very good at figuring out tortuous conspiracies ... but that made me. I loved it! I'll have to watch it again before resuming it. I might even have to buy it. :)
