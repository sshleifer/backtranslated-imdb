Like this it has not become a cult film that I do not know. I think it was sadly overlooked as a genial comedy! <br /> <br /> "Runaway Car" tries to pass through a fast-paced thriller, but taking the quality of acting (good God is ugly), the plot, the practical aspects of the car's demonic possession and the scene evacuation of the child, considering, there is nothing you can really do but laugh. And you will laugh. Movies are made to entertain us, and the degree to which they do can be an indication of the value of a film. This film is the pinnacle of entertainment, I laughed from beginning to end. At one point I had a short and almost suffocated breath, it's really funny in some places. When the child was transported by air from the sunroof into a handbag from a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant speed identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plan, which means that the hook did not make tearing the car roof apart, I was laughing hysterically. But when the child started rocking in the air, he almost hit a bridge and almost tangled in a tree, tears running down my face. <br /> <br /> It also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played Jesus in Madonna's "Like A Prayer" video. Seems to get everywhere.
