I don't see how this show is like the OC. <br /> <br /> First of all, the OC focuses on teenagers and their parents trying to overcome life. North Shore is about a hotel staff that is trying to manage the hotel and have a social life at the same time. Second, the OC takes place in California. North Shore takes place in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> And why would Fox make a show just like one of his other shows on the same network? I think this is a great show with good actors for the most part. It has a good plot and plot. I like the events that happen and how people take care of them and process them. The most recent episode was surprising as the story worked. It wasn't as predictable as most of the stories on most shows. <br /> <br /> I hope Fox keeps it on the air.
