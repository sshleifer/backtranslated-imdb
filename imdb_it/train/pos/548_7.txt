This film was as good as some of the other westerns made by Anthony Mann and James Stewart like Winchester '73 and The Naked Spur, and much better than Thunder Bay and Bend Of The River. This film begins as a run of the western mill but becomes more complex as it proceeds. He starts with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan arriving in Seattle and Stewart is accused of murder. He is found innocent but the cattle is stolen by a corrupt judge. Stewart then agrees to drive something but I forgot what it is, but Stewart is only interested in bringing his cattle back. As the film goes on it is as if Stewart cared only for himself, just like his character in the Naked Spur. It gets a lot better halfway after their arrival in Alaska. This is one of Stewart's best westerns.
