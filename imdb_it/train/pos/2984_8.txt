David Zucker directed one of the funniest comedies of the year with this funny farce. Yes, it's a matter of acquired tastes and depends on a wealth of sophomoric gags, but it's constantly amusing unlike some recent comic endeavors. The film is full of jokes of all kinds, from the most obvious to the most subtle that you have to pay attention to everything in the frame or that you will probably miss. Like his previous efforts including "Airplane!", "Top Secret!" And "Naked Gun", humor flies almost every second. There are so many moments that work, it's easy to overlook the few dishes that fall. What distinguishes this film from other pale imitations in the spoof genre is that it has a real plot. While others depended on making fun of too many famous scenes in almost casual films (take "Mafia!", Please), this film tells a new story with cute characters. These are sports films in general and satirize the real sports industry instead of saturating each specific film. Even for people who don't care about "South Park", its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make a couple of important actors with natural chemistry. The film also makes an extremely effective use of cameos of athletes, sports announcers and other celebrities, especially a bit exhilarating with Robert Stack of "Unsolved Mysteries". By the way, keep the end credits for a last joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All in all, Zucker has achieved, in words perhaps by applying to the sports mix of the film, a home dunk.
