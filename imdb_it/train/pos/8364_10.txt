Robot Jox does not suffer from stories or negative effects. I mean, this was 1990 if you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 still used stop animation as most movies did in the 1980s. If you look at your greatest successes during this time, many of them did what they could with the special effects shots that were available to them at that time. It wasn't until Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was made, and the storyboarders started using this motif. But you'll have fond memories of Transformers, Gundam Wing, even Power Rangers, if you watch this movie. The enemy robot is very threatening. It makes you not want to face the man without a good backup plan. And there are some great moments in this movie. A traitor / spy is working within their midsts. Whoever you think is on your side, cheering you up, could be the person you didn't expect to be. And this is very annoying to think so, don't you agree?
