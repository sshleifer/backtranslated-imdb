* What I like about SPOILERS * The teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) goes to live with her older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father; but she doesn't know half of the bizarre things that will happen to her from now on, and not only for her, but also for her sister, her friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), her boyfriend Henry (Michael McMillian ), cotta Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie's boyfriend Jeff (Simon Rex), first boss (then firefighter then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), the annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and second boss Peter (? ) If you don't have a funny bone in your body, please skip this; if you only like a sophisticated comedy, this is not for you; if you like a fun show, sometimes touching with two hot chicks that can act in the head (and no less than the fabulous 'Mary Cherry' by Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast), then what the hell are you waiting for? ? You are welcome to Casa De Tyler! What I like about you (2002-2006): 8.
