To be honest, I had no idea what this movie was when I started it. That's how I watch movies whenever possible. No preconceptions. I thought it would be a movie about stoners in the woods or something. I was wrong, a little. <br /> <br /> Loaded was a little boring at first, but once he started going, he really loved it. I know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless, but of doing things you don't want to do. <br /> <br /> Another user commented that this film was silly and implausible, but I beg to differ. This kind of thing happens. I'm sorry but not everyone lives in a world of dreams where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are "implausible". Really sorry, but the reality of the WORLD is that they happen. The creator of this film and the actors have done a great job portraying how things can go wrong and how people can make really wrong choices. Sometimes things go well, sometimes they turn out to be bad and such is life. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
