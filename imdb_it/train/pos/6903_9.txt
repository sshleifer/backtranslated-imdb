This little appreciated film is one of my favorites. I can watch it over and over again. Dreyfus and Braga are masterful, but Raul Julia steals the show! Gomez Addams, ironic and threatening, with the right tone for this irreverent parody of this often told story. <br /> <br /> Generally without frills and little appreciated, Moon Over Parador allows you to control reality and join the fun by going on screen. Two thumbs up!
