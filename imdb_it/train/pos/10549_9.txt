I have just seen him at the Toronto Film Festival, and I hope it spreads because I want to see him again! It's a movie based on the characters, and Andrew and David are more than up to the task. Any discussion of the plot could be considered as a spoiler, so I will simply say that the plot is intelligent, the acting is superb and the effects are amazing. Also well turned and well structured. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and very refreshing in this gloomy summer movie <br /> <br />. It made the audience laugh all the time. Look at it if you can. (I particularly liked the "Candy bar! Candy bar!" Scene.)
