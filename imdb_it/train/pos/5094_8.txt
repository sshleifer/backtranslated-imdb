If you are a purist, do not waste time - otherwise, keep your hat and enjoy the adventure. I loved Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr's version - I've seen it dozens of times, but this movie is just as good, just different. I will not specify the differences because it would ruin the film. Also, it's a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (I'm a big Indiana Jones fan), Patrick Swayze is as good as Quatermain and the supporting cast is superb. I find that the quality of the supporting cast is one of Hallmark Production's trademarks and this film was no exception. The cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect. If you are looking for entertainment, you will not be disappointed.
