Indian filmmakers have difficulties, they have to compete with films like "Laggan" where 11 divinized, castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots. "Devdas", an unfortunate return abroad, fedar, celebrated drinking to oblivion, with characters running in endless corridors unaware of someone's feelings or feelings - alas they live in a squalor adorned with red tapestries and pomp. But to make a good movie, you have to walk in a crumpled way to appease the frontbenchers which are the cards par excellence that are hypnotized by the Split skirts and by the Dishum-Dishum fights that preferably involve a "Bollywood" nitwit, the main actor that is marginally beautiful . So you can get in touch with a director who wants to tell a story about the head of the village of Leonine who with his own words "defend his village" is considered a violent film or too masculine for a male audience. There are very few actors capable of transmitting anger and pathos like Nana Patekar (Narasimhan). Nana Patekar leaves you in her backyard and watch him drinking and mocking the Politician when his faithful admirers burst out laughing with every word of satire thrown at him, meanwhile his daughter is bathing his nephew. This is an authentic scene that you can get in the India countryside. Nana Patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old acting school which is a missing breed in Hindi Films. The violence represented is an intricate part of the storytelling with Song & Dances launched for the curious without which the films will not sell, a state of sad but true state of affairs. Faster this changes better for "Bollywood". That said, this is a good movie.
