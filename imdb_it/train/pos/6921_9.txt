Keep in mind that I'm a fan of the genre but I've only seen this movie for the first time recently. As I have neglected all this time it is a wonder for me. For me this is a better film than the much praised "High Noon". It's a great western with excellent acting and a great story. The DVD is in black and white with an extraordinary cinematography. If you like westerns or James Stewart, this movie is not to be missed.
