This was certainly the case with Angels in the Outfield. He was on TV last night and I guess I haven't seen the movie since my second year in high school and I'm now in my fourth year of college. Even if the film has many flaws, it's so touching that you can't help but sit, watch and have fun. It's also hilarious. Danny Glover's ranting is so exaggerated that you can't help laughing out loud. He adds to the film and I'm sure that's exactly what the director wanted. Actually, try for the characters in the movie even if the development is not the best. A must see I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8/10
