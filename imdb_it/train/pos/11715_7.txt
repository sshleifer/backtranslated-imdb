This is a small parody / horror comedy with Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, the most infamous horror hostess of all time. This was to be the pilot vehicle for Elvira and it was so successful that it was picked up by the NBC network. They filmed a pilot for a television series to introduce the busty girl in black, but unfortunately the sitcom never passed in front of the pilot stage because of its sexual references. This film, however, is a lot of fun. Elvira is today's Chesty Morgan and the queen of one-liners. This film was followed a few years later by the abysmal "Elvira's Haunted Hills", which was supposed to be the take-off of the old Roger Corman films, but fell on his face. Watch this movie for a much more fun experience!
