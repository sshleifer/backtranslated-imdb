Although there are no new episodes, and it is rarely shown. I love the magic of Sabrina and the teenage witch. I've never seen the last few episodes, but I want to know what happened to Miles, or Josh? And why did the aunts have to disappear from the show forever? I'm sure the ending would have been perfect. But there are many unanswered questions. And I want to see the last episode of S.T.W! Because I heard that he decides between Erin and Harvey on his wedding day! I really hope you choose Harvey! And I can say that Nate Richart is HOTT !! Too bad, it's too old for me though. Melissa Joan Hart has her own sense of cuteness that she adds to the show, but there are many small "stupid" things about the show, like the way famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs and the whole cast is listening, her kind of stupid. Furthermore the cat starts to get really lame, as the show continues, the jokes started only to become stupid, and the things that the audio controlled by the "public" would laugh, I would think it was so lame. Don't get me wrong, in some parts it was fun, but I think the show lost its "magic" so to speak while the show went on. However, I congratulate the whole cast for trying, even though that Soleil Moon Frye girl had no taste for it, and she was a horrid actress. I wonder what Melissa or someone in the cast is doing now that the show is over.
