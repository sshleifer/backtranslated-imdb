I liked the innocence of this film and how the characters had to face the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst. The gorilla looks simply fantastic, and the eyes were particularly realistic. Sometimes it is also a bit scary and should have slightly frightened children without going over the top. Rene Russo plays his wonderfully feminine role. Usually these types of Hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a bad straw man, but the only opponent is the gorilla. It's interesting to see how close animals are to humans, how they feel the same emotions we do, and yet how we really can't treat them like people because they aren't. Not many films venture into this territory and it is worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human-animal similarity.
