This shorter film is the epitome of expected results when the imbecile manages the asylum. It is sad that the future of these young people has been pulled down from a craps table when neither Saddam Hussein nor the people of Iraq, God rests the souls of the $ 350,000 they were killed, have been dealing with terrorism with Al-Quida. <br /> <br /> Following this film, the astute spectator will have to pick up or download a copy of "Loose Change". This film is available for free on the Internet, as long as the Bush cabal does not block it, looking for the title on google, as shown in brackets. <br /> <br /> God Save our country. This will not be done by following the Christo-fascists who controlled Congress Halls for over 10 years before November 2006!
