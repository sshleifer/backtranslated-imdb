It's not very often a movie can literally make the whole audience laugh, and five minutes later they fill their eyes with tears. Many films try to do it, but few manage to give the emotional impact that this film has had. Adam Sandler practically drags you in with his bursts of heat and often violent, but it also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past doesn't pull him down. I'm not going to ruin anything, but there's a particular scene that should make your eyes and eyes tremble. Even the most macho of men should be a heartless bastard for not trying something while watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another great performance, but it is Sandler's out-shined. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith give solid performances, but nothing in the line of the two main roles. Sandler's humor is still present, which actually saved this film from being borderline depressing. There are several laughs to do, but don't think you will stay there long, because it will become serious again without many warnings. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on regarding the success of this film on every emotion that the human body contains, but I will cut it briefly. I feel there is no need to tell you anything else. Do yourself a favor and take the time to watch this movie. Even if you have to wait until it is released on DVD, it is worth 100% of the time. A deeply moving film that will bring tears to your eyes and a smile on your face ... unless, of course, you are a heartless soul.
