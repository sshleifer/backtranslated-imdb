I recorded this century ago, but I could only watch it today. I was sick so I had finished things to look at! I'm so happy to have seen it, and that I could erase my memory and look at it again for the first time. This movie is so wonderful! It reminded me a lot of Fried Green Tomatoes At The Whistlestop Cafe. <br /> <br /> The story goes back to the past and at the end of the film we see what the connections are. Some people have said that this is a children's movie. I disagree - it could be done by Disney and many characters are children, but I'm 23 and I loved it! There have been times when my spine has tingling. The story is different from any other movie these days, full of adventures. I just ordered the book from Amazon, I can't wait!
