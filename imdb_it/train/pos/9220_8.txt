An enviable and unpretentious envy of Romeo and Juliet. Approach without expectations in addition to having fun and you'll like it. A talented group of comic actors lets go and has a fight in this carefree vehicle. The negative reviews were due to the snobbishness of Shakespeare's treatments. Some people think that all movies should be "important" --- If you share these opinions, don't worry. The credits read "introducing" Angelina Jolie, who is not even remotely faithful, but she is incredibly beautiful as Juliet's character and, as always, her acting is wonderful --- and, considering her age at that time, even his dialect is pretty good. Recreating this classic story with the struggling Italian families in the New York catering industry translates into great fun. Look at it in the right frame of mind and you'll laugh out loud.
