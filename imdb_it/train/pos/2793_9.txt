It is a pity that, due to the title, this film is avoided by those who hate football. Fold it like Beckham is much more than just a sports movie. The plot is moving and intelligent without being sweetened, the jokes make you laugh out loud and the characters are well recited. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are young and brilliant like Jess and Jules, performing well both on and off the field. Anupam Kher is as wonderful as Jess's worried father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so incredibly bad in "Ride with the Devil", runs so well like the good guy for once, making full use of his gorgeous Irish accent ! Even if you don't like football, go see this movie. If it ever makes you smile.
