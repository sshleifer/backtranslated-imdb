Delightfully romantic comedy with intertwined subplots that weave wonderfully together and actors who bounce the lines with each other with precise comic timing, a feat that is beautiful to look at. When Cher's spinal-free boyfriend asks her to help him make peace with his estranged and moody younger brother, no one could dream of the consequences that follow. Operational symbolism, confessions of Catholic churches, love bites and falling snow ... "Moonstruck" is timeless and smooth. It takes about 15 minutes to trigger the rhythm of the image (there is a first sequence with the grandfather and his dogs at the slightly upset cemetery, and a subsequent scene with Cosmo and the old man at the gate who seems dull) , but the patchwork of the plot is intertwined with agile skill, and the shaky tone of the film and the kooky spirit are both contagious. *** 1/2 from ****
