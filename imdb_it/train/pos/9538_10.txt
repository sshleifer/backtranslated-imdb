Why are there no more films (mostly American) more like Meatball Machine? <br /> <br /> This is my first official online review and I am accused of "electric ecstasy" after choosing "Meatball Machine" as my first attempt. This is a review, so I will try to stick to simple reflection and instinctive emotions. <br /> <br /> I mean, this is a creative work even though it is clearly inspired by the now classic TETSUO! So what if it's not all original? I own both these films and although Tetsuo is a strange son of a bitch, Meatball Machine is far superior and can be heard without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind-altering drugs to clarify the meaning of the film. The Meatball Machine is as elaborate in its history as in its high blood and blood supply. Thank you Jesus for the Japanese cinema! <br /> <br /> Simply put, the last time my dreams were filled with visions of horror happened after seeing Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 7 years old. I could imagine in my dreams a language that comes out of a phone for weeks and weeks. This time (at 31) my dreams were pleasantly stimulating. <br /> <br /> In this film, human bodies are home to aliens whose sole purpose is to try to satisfy their impromptu extinction with human flesh and blood. Humans become cyborgs by eating meat !!! There's more!!! Fight scenes !! Great music !! Great shots of point of view! Decent acting of the Cyborg woman (at least better than her male counterpart). The combat seen at the end is worth watching ten or twenty times. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I forgot to mention that it's a love story! Wow, I hate love stories but this takes the cake! <br /> <br /> I look forward to having friends watch this movie again just to see the reaction on their faces. Unfortunately I took time to write this review because I fear that most friends and family will not understand the Meatball Machine. The truth is that America as a whole is not prepared for Meatball Machine. <br /> <br /> Finally, my wife came in while I was watching the climate fight scene at the end and she was speechless. Normally it says something like "why are you looking at that garbage?" This time he had nothing to say. I was happy! <br /> <br /> This is not garbage. This is not only SPLATTER (even the splatter for splatter reasons is excellent). This is art, my friends. Art. <br /> <br /> CHACHO
