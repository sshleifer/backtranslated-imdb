This is really an excellent film with a revolutionary message (both in form and in content) that should not be missed by any fan of the French film New Wave or Underground. There are hardly any credits opening or closing: we have just entered the world of consumer art, revolution and youth. This film has little to do with the documentary and is more interesting in playing with our advertising ideas and its relationship with reality. Lines of real and not real are crossed in a familiar way with films that speak of documentary, but this time we do it for consumption and marketing, not to describe reality.
