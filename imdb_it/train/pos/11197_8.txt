Another film from Hitchcock's silent love triangle, not a mystery, but very English, very well paced and photographed. Smooth boxer Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) recruits the "One Round" circus boxer Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) as his sparring partner, partly to keep the beautiful but fickle Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis) nearby. There are a lot of actors and grotesques at Jack and Mabel's wedding, the shameful, standing in the church corridor, catches a shock at the sight of very tall and very low men, the fat lady, the Siamese twins who, of course, argue which side of the nave will sit and the bridal party is fun. The rest of the film has Jack losing Mabel and recoils his heart, or something like that. It was another era, with the audience in evening dress, and even the boxers dressed when they were out of the ring. The angola camera, the rhythm, the use of symbols, the cut all very elegant and masterful. The camera-job and the modification of the last boxing match are very exciting. Brisson's good looks are well used in this; his smile is not so unconscious of what's going on around him like in Hitchcock's The Manxman, and so it's not annoying. But can boxers have these dimples?
