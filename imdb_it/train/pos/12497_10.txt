If you haven't already seen this Mary-Kate and Ashley movie, then all I can say is, "What are you waiting for !?" This is another fantastic and wonderful movie of the twin brothers that we all know and love so much! It's fun, romantic, exciting and absolutely breathtaking (scenery-wise)! Obviously; as always, Mary-Kate and Ashley are the main scenery here anyway! Would a real fan want to do it another way? Obviously not! Anyway; it's a great movie in every sense, so if you haven't already seen it, you have to do it now! I mean now too! So what are you waiting for? I promise you won't be disappointed! Sincerely, Rick Morris
