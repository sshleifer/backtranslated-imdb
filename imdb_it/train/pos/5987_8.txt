Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) leaves the reform school and returns to the slums. His sister (Ann Sheridan) does her best to keep him out of trouble, but he seems to follow him. Apart from his association with the Termite gang, Gabe is followed by real-life gangsters who have a scheme to burn random buildings to collect insurance. They need someone to blame for arson, and Gabe is like that. It's up to the Termites to work the law in their favor and give the gangsters their sweets. <br /> <br /> The scene that features the Dead End Kids is really quite good. The boys move towards the furniture of the new resident on the street, and proceed to make them their own. They talk to each other with elegant accents and talkers and talk about drinking tea together; Bernard Punsley takes a nap on a chair. The boys then start arguing with the new guy, but after being a good fighter, they ask him to join their club. <br /> <br /> Even the scene of the initiation is pretty good, full of ill-feeling that at first seems dangerous, but it's really quite intelligent and innocent. <br /> <br /> Later, when Billy Halop studies to become the mayor boy, he has a dream about schoolwork. This is wonderfully staged, with tiny holograms of children walking on his face and asking questions. <br /> <br /> Angels Wash Their Faces is an exceptional title because it plays with the success of Angels With Dirty Faces, and it really says what children are doing. Famous for bad behavior on and off the set, these guys are nice in this movie. But rather than appearing unreliable, he laughs a lot. This is a preview of what many of the kids would become in the Bowery Boys series. We also have some incomprehensible words from Leo Gorcey.
