This is like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" in a more surreal fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer-generated images that would put Industrial Light and Magic to shame. The plot may be difficult to follow, but this is the nature of the translation of Chinese folklore on the screen; certainly the general story would probably be more familiar to its native audience. However, an intelligent person should be able to keep up; furthermore, the power of martial arts scenes is amplified by CGI.
