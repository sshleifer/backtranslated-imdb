I didn't know the real events when I sat down to watch this, just the fact that this was based on a true story. After the death of the child's father, Rhonda tries to help her daughter Desiree (... I didn't know that someone actually called their offspring) who faced the loss. This is really done for children, as often happens with "familiar" gestures (with that said, go ahead and get everyone together for a vision, even if I would keep the teenagers out of it, unless you are sure that they will buy the concept), but does not minimize the point that the death of a parent is, and does not really speak to anyone. The plot is sufficiently interesting and moves quite well. The varied acting, with the excellent Burstyn dominating most of his cast, Mathis follows him very well, and Ferland and his peers (with few exceptions) are the least convincing of the group (and frankly, they are irritating, then again , I'm not really in the audience for this thing. Editing and cinematography are standard, and certainly no less than this. While humor is limited to a handful of funny lines or so, the tone is not unpleasant. There is an intense scene or two in this. I recommend it to fans of these types of movies. 7/10
