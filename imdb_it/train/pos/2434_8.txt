I have often wondered how CASPER was intended for children ... with all the questions that revolve around his identity (in this film we are led to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child, given that his house is a cemetery plot ), as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular film. Perhaps Casper was meant more as a game of morality, or famous studies seemed to enter new terrain in "real" cartoons. <br /> <br /> THERE IS A GOOD BOOS TONIGHT is a lively project, no doubt there. But the development of the plot involving the fox (who becomes Casper's friend, but encounters a tragic end) is a concern. <br /> <br /> Give credit to Famous Studios: face death with respect ... but, the strong image of Casper's mourning is rather graphic and disturbing to children (although the conclusion offers a happy ending, but I won't give away the ending), and the violence is quite steep, even by 1940 standards. <br /> <br /> This could be a good comic to use to help parents explain death to children - but I'm not going to put it in the VCR for a lively puzzle.
