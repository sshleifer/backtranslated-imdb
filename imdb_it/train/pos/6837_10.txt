Typical De Palma film made with a lot of style and some scenes that will take you to the limit of your place. Surely the thing that makes this movie better than the average thriller is style. It has some wonderfully modified scenes and some scenes that are really destructive that will take you to the limit of your place. The best scenes in the film; The museum scene and the murder of the elevator. There are some loosely erotic scenes and the film's rhythm may not be fast enough to allow the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie. So this movie may not be suitable for everyone. <br /> <br /> Even the plot is pretty good, but it's really the style that makes the movie work! It could only be for fans, but casual viewers should also appreciate the tension accumulated in the film. <br /> <br /> There are some nice characters played by a good cast. Michael Caine is an interesting choice for casting and Angie Dickinson behaves equally well, but she is pretty (not bad for a 49 year old!). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack by Pino Donaggio is also typically De Palma and fits well with the film, just like its soundtrack for De Palma's other film, "Body Double". <br /> <br /> Fantastic nerve-control thriller. I love De Palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
