I'm kidding. <br /> <br /> Looking for greener pastures in the form of activity in New York, Jon Voight is the young optimist Cowboy (almost Forest Gump) Joe Buck of Texas. It doesn't take long for the Big Apple to swallow it mercilessly and its whole ambitions and very soon Joe is the target of the coldness of New Yorkers and the cons of street criminals. Given his pure heart, he has pity on one of these thugs, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) and later moves with him to his apartment wreck and the two literally struggle to survive. <br /> <br /> While Midnight Comedy is labeled as a drama, it is best described as a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy in my opinion. It is above all a beautiful film that is elegant in capturing the contemporary hippie atmosphere of the late 1960s with its dizzying Warhol party cinematography and juxtaposing it with the ultra-urban New York City. The film involves Cowboy Joe Buck in the middle, thus emphasizing his position off the field. We feel in his struggle to adapt, but also to receive enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy brought tears to my eyes because it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart. I imagine that this film must have inspired both Forest Gump with his pure and out-of-world character and, to some extent, Dundee's Crocodile films dealing almost the same kind of humor - a contrast between the countries - cowboy clear cosmopolitans of New York. Very compelling and incredibly creative film that I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
