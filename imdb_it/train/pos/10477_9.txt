Walking on the razor's edge between comedy and drama is one of the most difficult acts of cinema. How can you laugh at the misery of others and not start feeling sick when it lasts too long? <br /> <br /> Well, this amazing little gem of a movie will offer great laughter, wonderful scenery and quite a good buzz as well. I particularly like the notion that a historical trick has made alcohol legal since white Europeans liked it, and marijuana was illegal, since "those other races" used it ... undoubtedly true and exhibited a racial to marijuana laws so openly flaunted by people around the world. <br /> <br /> An extraordinary comment on "DVD Extra" ... two of them in fact ... they run through the whole film with both actors, and then again with the writers. I kept seeing things that I was sure weren't in the first movie, but then I realized how easy it is to lose much of the subtle comedy at the first shoot. What fun! Not to be missed! 9/10 stars
