Unfortunately, due to the tendency of US spectators to avoid subtitles, this film has not received the distribution or attention it deserves. His subtle themes of belonging, identity, racial relations and above all how colonialism damages all parties, transcend the obvious dramatic tensions, the nostalgic memories of the protaganist childhood and the exoticism of his relationship with the "boy" of the parents, perhaps the only "real" human, she knows. We won't even look at his mother's relationship with this elegant man. There! I hope I gave you enough of a hook to take it in, whether you speak French or subtitles or not. I challenge you to be as brave, strong and aware as La P'tite.
