Say what you want about Andy Milligan - but if his family were even 10% more unbalanced than this movie, well then I guess it could have gotten worse. Unfortunately, the video print of this film contains inserts of sex scenes originally filmed by the distributor to increase the box office appeal. Several times during the film, Milligan's ugly film cameras and silent film music abruptly cease, and suddenly the beautiful views of Milligan's home actors take over and begin doing so with the psychedelic rock rock of the 1960s. It is easy enough to advance quickly if you are trying to pay attention to Milligan's original film, which, unfortunately, lacks some action that has been cut to make room for the added sex scenes. What remains, however, is still compelling. I don't think I've ever seen a more hateful mother in any movie before.
