All right. This film is pure pleasure. He's always so violent Horror mixed with a little suspense and a lot of black comedy. The dentist really starts to lose his mind and it's nice to see him do it. This film is for certain people, however. Either you will love him completely or he will totally hate him. A good movie to rent and watch when you have nothing else to do. Also recommended: Psycho III
