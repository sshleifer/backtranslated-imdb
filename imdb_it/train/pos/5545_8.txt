**** Includes Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> I have been a fan of horror films for many decades now. Just when I think I saw all the older ones, another one opens up to surprise me. I've never seen this movie before. It was a pleasure, even off the beaten track ... not just the path to the marsh ferry either. Here is a horror film made in the 1940s that dared to try something VERY different. The beautiful girl is (prey) without fear of change and saves men, including the man she loves, from the monster! What's it like for a breakthrough. This girl was the exact opposite of most women in the movies of that time, she doesn't scream in her own shadow, she doesn't faint with fear, she doesn't trip over a leaf while she runs. This girl was not afraid to live alone in an isolated hut, far from the rest of the villagers. Not only that, but the place was on a foggy marsh that was rumored to be haunted. Hell, he even takes naps on the swamp grass outdoors ... like a regular 1940s version of Ripley. No snake, alligator or strangler ghost would dare disturb this girl. Books on early feminist films should be sure to include this undervalued work. <br /> <br /> See this if you are a fan, like me, of those wonderfully suggestive classic B / W horror films made only in the 30s and 40s. And make sure you wear the turtle neck in cast iron to protect you .
