Waiting to see a "nice little movie" from mainland China, I was ill prepared. Family dynamics, community and the inevitability of change have rarely been explored so expertly on the film. Each character is solid and I was completely involved in the story. The organization is much more complex than the American public is used to. However, there is no difficulty in following the progression, even while reading the subtitles. Jiang Wu, as a late brother, is a constant and shining light. Leave your cynicism in your locker. It will be there at check-out.
