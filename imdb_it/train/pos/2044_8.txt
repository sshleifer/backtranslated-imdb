This is a good little shock; not perfect from any stretch of the imagination, but narrow, competent and disturbing. An excellent example of a simple idea developed in an irresistible 90-minute script. <br /> <br /> The installation does not require bells and whistles, no long exposure or lengthy story; Kate (Franka Pontente), a young German business woman who lives in London, walks away while waiting for the last subway train. He wakes up to find the deserted place, but he soon realizes that he is far away alone. Someone, or something like that, is down there with her and her intentions are completely harmful. <br /> <br /> Actually he meets many other characters in his quest to survive, including a libidinous work colleague, a homeless couple and a caged working sewer, which adds rhythm and substance to the plot. There is a slightly awkward gear shift somewhere in the middle of the film, when the tension thriller turns into a blood feast, but nothing so clumsy as to slow down the frantic pace. For those of you with weak dispositions, this is probably a harrowing ride; for those of you who enjoy some well executed carnal chaos this should press all the right buttons. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film is perhaps less successful than the main body of the film, but it is punctuated with a beautiful moment of unexpected social commentary that provides a satisfactory conclusion. <br /> <br /> Some may feel somehow deceived by a clear explanation of the exact nature and history of the threat encountered by Kate and her confederates, however, for me this was not the case. A horror film writer should not need to feel obligated to tease every ego and cross each t, ​​in the same way that one might expect a writer of political thrillers. There are enough clues to give you a very clear idea of ​​what led to the existence of this evil, making a detailed and conclusive solution superfluous. The preservation of a certain sense of the mystery must be welcomed and reminds us that in this film the race will always be more important than the exact destination. <br /> <br /> My understanding is that the budget for this film was, to say the least, minimal, in which case our applause for this British horror should be stronger, because you never get the impression that the corners are cut or the effects are not delivered. <br /> <br /> If this sounds like your kind of movie, it probably is. Buy a ticket and get on board.
