This was a good film. I'm not sure this is considered a spoiler comment, but I didn't want to risk it. However, towards the end of the film, the prosecutor reads a verse from Scripture and cites another from memory. I cannot remember the first passage that he reads, but the second is Genesis 9: 6. He says it is Genesis 9:12, but he actually mentions verse 6. This is a common passage that many use to defend capital punishment. It is a pity that prosecutors do not dare to quote the Bible today. Has anyone ever heard of John Jay, the first Justice of the Supreme Court in the history of this country? He said the Bible is the best of all books. Too bad we lost that sight in America.
