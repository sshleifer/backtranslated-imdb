about a year and a half ago my father told me about The French Doors. I thought it sounded pretty interesting but I didn't try to find it anywhere. Then about a year ago I remembered that movie and thought "hey why not" and tried to find it on the internet. in the end, after about a week of research, I found it on atomic films. I called my dad to the computer and I said "Hey Dad, I found that scary movie you told me about centuries ago!" He smiled at me, turned and turned off the lights so that they were completely pitch black on the computer screen and told me to look at him. I started well ... Then when he started to worry about what was there, I found it very unnerving. in the end I pushed back my chair and got up ... it made me jump !: P if you haven't seen this movie I strongly suggest you do it because it's worth it. even after the fourth or fifth time it is still disturbing. <br /> <br /> GREAT FILM!
