Many people think of it as a fan movie, since a lot of super stars play this movie (Gackt, Hyde and Wang Lee Hom is a very famous singer in Japan). But don't judge him before looking, that's what I say. Gackt and the staff are very serious when they made this film, and they worked so hard. It's a good movie with a delicate story inside. Several scenes can be so funny and some others are so sad. They made it so beautiful until I can stop watching it again. <br /> <br /> History has written quite well, but I admit that their act is not very disappointing. This is especially for Hyde because his acting ability is under another and it is strange to hear the road when he speaks with another language except his native language (Japan). But it is understandable because this is the first time they are acting in the film. I think Gackt tries to show us how someone can be so weak when he loses the most important person in their life. When Toshi was killed, when Sho asked Kei to turn Yi-Che into a vampire like him, because he won't let her die, when Sho's brother died, Kei Shoot Son dies, and the best and best scene is when Sho disappears ~ I also said that Hyde's ability is still strange but I give him two shots on that scene !! <br /> <br /> There is a time when the plot goes too fast as if they didn't say why the child can join the local mafia and Sho's enemy, because I'm a good friend in the past and also Son is Sho's brother-in-law. <br /> <br /> Whatever, I love this movie ~ (very ^^). <br /> <br /> This is an action movie with a beautiful moving story.
