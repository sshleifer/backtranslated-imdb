I was happy with the cast of reputable players. The story is to defend a cause, even if you are at personal risk. At a time when violence and pain are often at the forefront of the film, this film focuses on the old-fashioned cop. Even if similar plots have been made repeatedly, these guys do well. Relax and have fun. Dennehy is a master at taking control of a film.
