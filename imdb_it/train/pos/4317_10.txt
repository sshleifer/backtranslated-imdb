I really enjoyed this movie when it was released, and I still do it, because the plot makes you hope for life in general, and also for people ... one of the things I like about Lawrence Kasdan's movies. In addition to the positive vibes of the film, there are other reasons to appreciate the Grand Canyon. First, he has an exceptional cast ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the acclaimed film that won the Oscar for best film, was very similar to this film. The difference is that the Grand Canyon leaves you with positive feelings. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very dark I would choose Grand Canyon over Crash every day.
