This film is somewhat reminiscent of the German film, THE NEVERENDING STORY because a child is magically transported to a strange land to be a hero. However, thanks to far superior modern technology, puppets and CGIs are used to create an incredibly realistic-looking world - one that will blow your socks off for its realism and purpose. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, but in the beginning it was a thankless task! Unfortunately, for most Westerners, this film is one of those that you could give up very quickly or reject because everything in the film seems so strange. However, give it a chance. Don't think or try to understand everything you see, let the story unfold and you'll probably appreciate the film. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this is exactly the kind of advice I would like to give to adults who watch Miyazaki's SPIRIT OF WAY because it is very similar and contains tons of Yokai (Japanese mythical spirits). The big differences between the two are that THE GREAT YOKAI WAR is live-action and SPIRITED AWAY is much more suitable for children. While I think THE GREAT YOKAI WAR was intended primarily as a children's movie, in the United States, most parents would not want to show it to children because it is so violent, scary and has some adult behaviors. So who is the public in the West? Well, older children and adults who appreciate foreign films with non-Western themes and composition. This is a pretty small audience, really! <br /> <br /> While you are watching, look for all the little little touches. In fact, you can watch the film dozens of times and notice different little things every time. Some of the funny references that I liked were the comment on Gamera, the scene that came with the comment "KIDS: Do not Try This At Home" as well as the use of Kirin beer to allow a person to see actually the Yokai (hmm, ... maybe that scene should also contain this warning)! <br /> <br /> By the way, director Takashi Miike is difficult to define stylistically, except to say that none of his stories I saw seemed "normal". Some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and I hated them (especially AUDITION and ICHI THE KILLER) while some of them are magical and among the best films I've ever seen (THE HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS). One thing is certain, it is difficult to watch one of his films and not have a strong reaction in one way or another.
