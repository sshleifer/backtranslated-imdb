"The Haunted World by Edward D. Wood, Jr." is the definitive documentary on the life of man that brought us films like "Glen or Glenda", "Bride of the Monster" and, of course, "Plan 9 from Outer Space". This exquisite film far surpasses the point where other documentaries, such as "Look Back in Angora" and "The Plan 9 Companion", have failed. Complete his surviving entourage, many of whom have died since filming, and gives an honest review of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that it retraces the darkest corner of yesterday's Hollywood, sentimental in the director's treatment (up to haunting music), this documentary is not to be missed for those who love the director who has failed so much in his day. The entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively bring together Ed's life and premature death for the viewer. Better looked at 3 in the morning while wearing an angora sweater.
