Here is one that the whole family will like ... even those who consider themselves too old for fairy tales. Shelley Duvall has surpassed herself with this unique and imaginative vision of almost all the popular fairy tales of childhood. The scripts offer new twists on the ancient fairy tales in which we grew up and present a handful of stars in each episode. "Cinderella" is no exception to the Duvall standard and I think it is one of the top five in the series, highlighted by Jennifer Beals (let's remember from "Flashdance" - and is still in Hollywood today shooting a movie here and there) in the main role, Jean Stapleton as the fairy godmother with a southern accent and Eve Arden as the embodiment of the evil stepmother. Edie McClurg ("Ferris Bueller's Day Off") and Jane Alden make a hilarious pair like the stepsisters. Matthew Broderick is an affable Prince Henry. You will keep coming back for this!
