In the Citadel film The Films of Gene Kelly, Anchors Aweigh is described as a pivot of a musical. I certainly can't do better. It's such an important film in the careers of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Even Kathryn Grayson didn't do much harm with this. <br /> <br /> Louis B. Mayer had lent Gene Kelly to Columbia, where Harry Cohn had been inspired to let Kelly choreograph his numbers and for that, Cover Girl became a classic. So, if Mayer didn't learn a lesson, producer Joe Pasternak did and allowed Kelly artistic control. When Anchors Aweigh finished, Fred Astaire eventually had a dancing rival for the monarch of the film dance. <br /> <br /> The main issue everyone talks about with Gene Kelly is the dance with Jerry Mouse. Originally Kelly wanted to do the number with Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, but Disney didn't lend Mickey to anyone. Mickey would have to wait for Who Framed Roger Rabbit to make an external film. Not to worry because MGM had its own rodent animated half of Tom and Jerry's team. <br /> <br /> Kelly as a dancer has always tried to do something new and different on the screen like Fred Astaire. For the next twelve years, these two were given all sorts of artistic control and were praised for their work even if the films themselves were not up to par. It was as if everyone had inspired the other to a greater and better creativity, Kelly for MGM, Astaire for MGM and any other number of other studios. In Anchors Aweigh, Kelly made Sinatra dance a little. Actually Frank Sinatra has always given credit to Gene Kelly for showing him how musicals should be made, given that he gave credit to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for their help in earning an Oscar for From Here to Eternity. <br /> <br /> When Frank Sinatra bought half of his MGM RKO contract, he insisted on creating a small artistic creativity. He had become friends with the composer team of Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn. In his autobiography Sammy Cahn tells how Sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film. Louis B. Mayer gave in and the team wrote some beautiful ballads for him to sing. One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh, I Fall in Love Too Easily. Frank sings accompanying himself to the piano in an empty Hollywood Bowl. It is Sinatra at its best. <br /> <br /> With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn earned the title of putting more words than songs in the mouth of Frank Sinatra than any other person. They were lifelong friends and Cahn always believed Sinatra with this milestone in his career. <br /> <br /> In a bet, Styne and Cahn said they could write a song using only a chromatic scale. They demonstrated it in Anchors Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson put her soprano to work on All of a Sudden My Heart Sings. He also made classic numbers. <br /> <br /> Singing here is actually the basis of the plot. Two sailors on leave through a combination of circumstances meet Kathryn Grayson and her orphan grandson Dean Stockwell. Trying to fix it with Sinatra, Kelly says she can audition for Jose Iturbi. They spend the film trying to do just that. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment in Anchors Aweigh is that Pamela Britton, who plays the "Brooklyn" waitress, never had a number. She got rave reviews from her portrayal of Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway and that's what brought her to Hollywood. I suspect he had a number that was cut and somewhere in the MGM vaults might still be. <br /> <br /> Anchors Aweigh is a great example of why musicals are no longer made. All that creative talent was under contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. If you had to pay a market value for this, the cost could withdraw the debt of some third world countries. <br /> <br /> But the film's results would be extraordinary.
