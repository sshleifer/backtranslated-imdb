Slaughter High is about a boy named Marty. He was molested and got into high school. A group of kids played many tricks on him, and these jokes were REALLY bad. The last joke ended tragically. <br /> <br /> starting 5 years later. The gang of boys meets for a meeting. One of them installed it in the old high school. The school is now abandoned and must enter. For some reason, the janitor is still there, but tells them to go ahead and have fun because they give him a beer. <br /> <br /> They start by celebrating and looking at the old lockers, and they see something of Marty. One girl feels sorry for Marty, but another boy calms her. <br /> <br /> Once the killings begin, it's great. Every kill is creative and bloody. We see a figure in a jester mask, chasing them one by one throughout the school. Looks like Marty is back for revenge. After the first person is killed, they find that they are locked up in the school. They start looking for a way out. <br /> <br /> Now, there are a number of illogical things in this film. First of all, I don't know anyone who has a 5-year meeting. Secondly, after the first child dies, a girl takes the blood everywhere. Everyone runs away in a panic, yet runs to the bathroom and finds a bathtub. Hrr friend has just been killed and she decides to take a bath !? More importantly, because there is a tub in the school bathroom. However, the bathtub does not seem to really work ... and dies horribly, this is a film from the 80s. it's a horror slasher. WHO EMPLOYES if he has illogical parts. I don't do it first. This film has really great deaths. The ending .... there is a turning point. Having recently seen the Haute Tension, I can compare the two. The only way they are similar is that there is a turning point, which left me disappointed ..... THEN immediately after the turn, a great, if not the best, one arrives in the film. <br /> <br /> After the last kill, the killer looks at the screen and does something crazy too, and it was the perfect way to end the film. Makes me go "wow ..."
