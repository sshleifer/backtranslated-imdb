Together with Darkwing Duck this is unjustly canceled. Disney has been in decline since Tarzan and we need a show like this to bring Disney back on track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo (does it sound familiar?) The theme of the theme is also captivating. Of all the villains, all of whom are great for their merits, Tony Jay stands out as Shere Kahn. Louis and Baloo actually sound very similar to dubbing in the jungle book, which is not bad at all. As a matter of fact, it is really inspiring! The entertainment was perfect and the script was full of spirit which was seriously lacking in animations for years. PLEASE BRING THIS SHOW! 9/10.
