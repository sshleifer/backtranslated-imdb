I haven't read the novel, or anything else by Kurt Vonnegut, but now I intend to start. This grips you from the first frame and doesn't let you go until the end credits start spinning. Taking places you don't expect, the plot is interesting in everything. The stimulation is apt, nothing lasts too long, and this makes a perfect work of balancing between unexpected twists and allowing the viewer to process what we have seen. It is well told and well thought out. I've never seen a movie for which I could compare it in particular. It's intense and exciting, as well as fun and sad. The acting is excellent, Nolte absolutely shines, Goodman proves once again that he doesn't have to go and laugh, and Lee and Arkin are fascinating. I could go on, really ... no role is treated to a less than stellar performance. The editing and the cinematography are wonderful and all the images are fantastic, with a couple of unforgettable and surprising images. I intend to go for other films directed by Keith Gordon, as well as the other two apparently related to this, through the author of the books. There is a scene of sexuality and a very disturbing and disturbing content in this. I recommend it to anyone who can appreciate it; not pleasant 8/10
