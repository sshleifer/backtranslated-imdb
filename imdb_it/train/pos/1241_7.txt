This film is very funny and every criticism is based on personal preferences, not on the quality of the films. In addition to the common excessive swearword in some Murphy scenes, the film is a great vehicle for its kind of humor. It has some pretty good special effects and exciting action scenes. <br /> <br /> As a seeker of missing children, the character of Murphy begins by looking for a missing girl, who takes him on the path for which others believe he was "chosen" - - to protect the golden child. The boy was born as an enlightened, destined to save the world from the forces of evil, but whose very life is in danger, if not for the help of Murphy, and his beautiful, mysterious and mystical helper / guide / protector. /> <br /> In addition, there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge members of the public who are interested in reflecting on profound thoughts. One of these scenes is where the Golden Child, whose character Murphy is solicited to protect, is tested by the monks of the mountain temple. An elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from, and the child is tested on his choice. <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy / comedy that is based on the concept that there are both good and evil forces in our world that most people are completely unaware of. By accepting this premise of the plot, we must let go of our touch with a perceived everyday reality, and prepare the earth and the walls to crumble and reveal a kingdom of evil that is just waiting to destroy us. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent film, with a good plot, acting and, for the most part, a fairly decent dialogue that combines a serious subject with a healthy balance between martial arts combat and Eddie Murphy's humor .
