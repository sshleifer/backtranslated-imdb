This film has a special way of telling the story, at first I found it rather strange since it jumped over time and I had no idea what was going on. <br /> <br /> However the plot was also simple, but still very real and moving. You met someone the first time, you fell in love completely, but in the end you got rid of and promoted a deadly agony. Who hasn't gone through this? but we will never forget this kind of pain in our life. <br /> <br /> I would say that I am quite moved when two actors showed great performance in showing love between the characters. I just hope the story can be a happy ending.
