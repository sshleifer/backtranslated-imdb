Pressburger and Powell's biggest movie. David Niven plays the RAF bomber pilot who loses his death, but is given a second chance in life when the sky realizes he is absent and sends an angel to investigate. The scene in which the young soldiers, men and women, white and black, all killed in action, arrive in heaven to be tried for eternal life is unbearably moving. Attention also to Roger Livesey, a deeply underrated actor, and Kim Hunter as the love interest (later, of course, Zira in Planet of the Apes). Incidentally, Steven Spielberg launched the actress who played the chief angel (Kathleen Byron) as the elderly wife of the private eponymous names in Saving Private Ryan half a century later, an act that talks about the volumes for its film literacy.
