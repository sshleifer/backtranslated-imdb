Dear readers, <br /> <br /> The final battle between rebellion and empire. The Second Death Star is nearing completion and when completed it will mark the destiny for the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi knight, returns to Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia, now revealed as Luke's twin sister! I agree to conduct the attack on the shield generator on the Endor forest moon while Lando Calrissian leads the attack on the Death Star. They do not know that a very ingenious trap was placed for them and Emperor Palpatine himself is personally supervising the construction of the Second Death Star. <br /> <br /> The Return of the Jedi is my favorite of the Original Trilogy. He has action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic acting, incredible fight scenes and fantastic John Williams music. Mark Hamill is now fully mature in a Jedi Knight, the naive farm boy is gone and in his place is a calm and relaxed Jedi determined to save the galaxy. Leia is still beautiful in this film, as are Han and Lando. 3P0, R2 and Chewie play their role in a T, while James Earl Jones is still the greatest villain of the cinema: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also an excellent villain like the emperor Palpatine, twisted and brutally ruthless. The action sequences of this film are incredibly incredible and the sword fights are serious and gritty. The soundtrack of John Williams is still beautiful and improves the film of different levels. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
