I haven't written a review on IMDb for the longest time, however, I felt compelled to write this! When I searched for this film I found a particular review that pushed people to NOT watch this movie. Don't pay attention to this ignorant person! NOTHING is a fantastic film, full of laughter and above all ... imagination! Aren't you sick and tired of being force-fed with the same old cycle of chewing gum? Sometimes a movie like NOTHING comes along and gives you something you've never seen before. I don't even care if you don't like (even hate) the movie, but nobody has the right to discredit the movie. IMDb has a monumental impact on reputation and no negative review should discredit the film that way. Just say you hate him and why you hate him ... but don't try to tell people that they shouldn't look at him. We have our minds and we will take care of it. <br /> <br /> If my judgment is positive, I would say that more people will appreciate this film than those who hate it. <br /> <br /> Give your mind a little pleasure for the eyes! See NOTHING!
