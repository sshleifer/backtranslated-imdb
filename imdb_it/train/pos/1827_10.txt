All dogs go to heaven is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I saw it for the first time when I was 3 years old. Now I'm 12 and I rent it, it makes me think about things and brings back so many memories, those were "the days". I love music, I like it when Charlie comes to Heaven, I love the song "Let me surprise". I love the way Charlie looks and his voice, Bert Reynolds could only play the voice of Charlie so much. I love this movie, the first one is the best because it's so original and fantastic. It really brings back memories that no one can describe, not even me. If only I could go back to those days. I love the characters. If this is how the memories come back when I'm 12 I imagine how I feel when I'm 19, I hope I can see it when I'm older. When I saw it for the first time I never knew that I really looked back and felt like this, I hope you will be available to watch. I am so happy that this film was made and the incredible idea came to my mind and heart. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give a perfect 10. It's a fantastic movie. It is so difficult to explain the feeling, when I get older and if I have children, I hope they can experience this feeling.
