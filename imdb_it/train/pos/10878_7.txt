Personally, I really enjoyed cutting myself. It was the first time I saw a drama in Australia with a theatrical presentation. A genre normally limited to mainstream Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> With all the usual cooking comedies and dramas coming out of Australia, I enjoyed being able to watch a home-made horror movie that wasn't a rip-off. I didn't even think it was really a parody of other movies. It was a supernatural-themed horror movie like Nightmare on Elm Street, not Scream or So what did you do last summer and so there was more than one suspension of disbelief. I think the time has come for Australian films to try to get more into traditional genres. <br /> <br /> The cut was original, quite scary and in the end just a little fun. I'd give it seven out of ten and I wouldn't treat it as something serious. He did what I expected him to do, entertain him and scare me enough times to be satisfying. I liked it.
