Sword fighting was out of this world, spectacular combat scenes without flying on a wire technique (to the end) that are too common today. The scene with Chan and Pray was probably the best part of the film. The characters in the villa's assault on villains were clich√© but the film is at ease. An injection of humor by Woo. <br /> <br /> The plot with its twists and turns was unpredictable and exciting and you couldn't tell who was good or bad or where to stay. <br /> <br /> A good sense of suspense and well-planned surprises. The depth of the plot is pretty intense for a fickle movie of this kind and it reaches you in ways that most kung-fu movies don't.
