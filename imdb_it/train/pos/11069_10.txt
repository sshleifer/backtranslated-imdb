"Ah Ritchie made another gangster movie with Statham" thought the average fan, expecting another Snatch / Lock Stock; expecting perhaps a couple of time changes, but none too hard for "me and the boys" to swallow after a few beers. <br /> <br /> Ah, be careful, you need to watch this movie. No cups of tea, no extra coke from the counter, nothing "keeps running" screaming while eating in the fridge - watch the movie! No laughter other than what you could get from the considerable violence (and if this floats your boat, so be it) but a solid direction, an excellent dialogue and great performances. <br /> <br /> My favorite - Big Pussy from The Sopranos, always a reliable bonnet.
