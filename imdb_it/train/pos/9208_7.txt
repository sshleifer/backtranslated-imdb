"The Shooter" was a different kind of film for Michael Dudikoff. Although normally associated with action films that incorporate martial arts, this film, because it was a western, allowed him to prove himself to be a much more capable actor than allowed by some plot lines. <br /> <br /> the problem, of course, is that the film does not allow for solid character development. The carnage is really left to the viewer. We can only guess the sadness that made the shooter, whose real name is Michael Atherton, the murderer who is - a murderer, mind you, that a small city, terrified by a local bully, welcomes like a hero who can free from his suffering.
