I still have late-night graininess, no-cable, low-cost VHS dub of this waaaaaayyyy show when, late at night, commercials and everything, when I stood at any strange time they would have slapped this show - just so I could record it. <br /> <br /> The series was not really on CIRCA Freddy Kreuger - only the first couple of episodes actually involved him as if he were not a Rod Serling announcer. Instead, each episode was a distinct nightmare, using the traditional horror themes of horrible childhood, dating, cannibalism, meetings, money, death, meetings and ... hmm ... meetings. <br /> <br /> episode in which a boy accidentally says "I will love you forever" to the wrong girl, and stays with her (literally, at least for a moment, they grow up together ...), to that in which a young woman hostess returns home with a strange man, only to find himself in his cabin, where he has a trophy room full of other hostesses, and I only vaguely remember that I respect blind dates for hockey (and for the injuries and rigors that derive from it) - dating was certainly the scariest thing in the series. <br /> <br /> An episode had Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, etc.) as a pizza merchant motivated with a tasty new secret ingredient. Not original, but still creepy and fun .... <br /> <br /> Even so, some of the episodes were fantastic. My favorite was "It's a Miserable Life", where a young man is trapped while working at his parents' college when he wants to go to college. Stuck talking to himself and doing small puppet shows with old cheeseburgers - until late at night, when a strange boy crosses the driveway and suddenly his life is not the same. No, not Freddy, just a thug with a gun - it turns out that the whole shocking episode is just that - the last thoughts that go through the baby's head ... along with a bullet. <br /> <br /> the second half of the same episode (many of the episodes of Freddie's Nightmares were essentially two vaguely connected stories) followed his girlfriend, who was also injured but not killed in the drive-by, and who was taken to the hospital "by the heck" - they creep into all the most disturbing nightmare hospital cliches, and then some - for accidentally closing their mouths - or waking up during an operation - to have your dead boyfriend try to lure you in the morgue for a little pampering. /> <br /> Again, that was my favorite. <br /> <br /> Some of the episodes were much more stupid, like ALMOST ALL THOSE THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE ON VIDEO. They put the crumbles out as representatives of the series, and then nobody likes them, he thinks the show is smelly, and then they don't put them on video anymore. It's a Miserable Life is only available on PAL DVD in England - but I'll buy it anyway.
