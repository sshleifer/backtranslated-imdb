so, being a fairly deep fan of horror movies, it's been a while since I've seen one that really made me jump (or get nervous). <br /> <br /> I will definitely get it on DVD when it comes out ... much better than the ring. the thing I don't understand is that so many people we talked to after the movie thought it was horrible, well, if that's what you think, then so be it ... I know what I liked and it takes a fair amount to make me feel really scared, so I have to say this is worth watching. <br /> <br /> now, you might be disappointed with the story if you need everything in a clean and tidy line, because the plot goes back a bit to help build the story (I think if it were shown in chronological order , it would have ruined everything). <br /> <br /> I'm really glad that this movie had very few bloody messes ... maybe the rest of you studio writers and that people know that you won't have to splash red things all over the set to scare people.
