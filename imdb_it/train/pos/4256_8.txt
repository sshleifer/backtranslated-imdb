A film so delicious! Very hot. You can't help but fall in love with the character of Gigi. He is adorable as a child and becomes a sensitive artist. The whole film revolves around him. Do you live in a wonderful world ?? live all your life ?? curiosity, desire and anticipation. There is an older brother who tries to steal his glory but really remains in the shadows all his life. The father is very stereotyped Italian and so is the mother. Did I want the father to come together with his mother in the last scene ?? and make them cry and laugh. I would also like there to be at least something of salvation regarding the older brother. His personality seems to have been entirely destroyed. Passion and ardor ?? this is the key to life. And looking through the camera ?? focusing on small details and savoring the delicate details of life.
