The director Sidney Lumet has made some masterpieces, such as Network, Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico. But he hasn't had too much luck in his most recent works. Gloria (1999) was pathetic and Find Me Guilty was an interesting but failed experiment. Now, Lumet has been bringing his best film for decades and, from my point of view, a true masterpiece: Before the Devil Knows You're Dead. I think this film is like a rebirth for Lumet. This film has an excellent story that, profoundly, has many levels. Also, I think the ending of the film is perfect. The performances are brilliant. Philip Seymour Hoffman brings a magnificent performance as usual and is, without doubt, one of the best actors of our time. Ethan Hawke is also an excellent actor, but he is underestimated from my point of view. His performance here is exceptional. The rest of the cast is also excellent (especially the great Albert Finney) but these two actors carry monumental shows that have been sadly ignored by the pathetic Oscars. The film has a good level of intensity, in part that thanks to the scripts and, in part, thanks to the brilliant script. Before the devil knows that you are dead, it is a true masterpiece with perfect direction, a great script and excellent performances. We need more movies like this.
