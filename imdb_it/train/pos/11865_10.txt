I heard some friends say that "Scarface sucks ... an idiot tried to make another Godfather in the early 1980s". Now, I usually listen to idiots / watch CNN, so I decided to stay away from it. Then my partner handed me the DVD and said "This is the number 1 with pelicang", I confused to have tried it. This is the best movie ever made. It's more realistic than all these crap on stolen cars that are too expensive for someone in that area he could afford (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *) There's a bit of humor though ... ie the Pelicang and the light 80s music. And yet, what's better than Al Pacino handling a m203? I give this ***** to ****, perfect for fans of Al or GTA: Vice City.
