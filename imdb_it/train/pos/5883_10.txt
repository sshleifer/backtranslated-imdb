I observed, enchanted and hypnotized, by vocal and physical acting. The roles played by each character were performed with excellence. The texts, the words, every gesture, the dawn, have told everything. The film told me. He enlightened me for a different perception of a person who believes in humanity. Who believes in peace and gentle behavior. I was also judged non-believer, from the sacrifices and human dignity was portrayed. Power without grace, is demented and without feelings. Wanting power at the expense of humanity is so incredible. This film made me afraid for people who are no longer in this world. And it is with sadness that I think of them. I like this movie for conversations and facial expressions. May this film be blessed.
