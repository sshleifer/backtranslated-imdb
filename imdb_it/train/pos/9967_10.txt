There are some things I will never understand; because underwear comes in packs of three when clearly this is not enough is an example. Likewise, I will never understand this film, and this is brilliant. If you approach this movie expecting a real movie, you could even get close to Satan waiting for a hug; although this could be possible if you greet the satanic figures in this film. Take Pitch for example; the most ineffective, encampment, greasy portrait of a devil since Freddy Mercury and Wayne Sleep joined forces to create a ten foot Satan costume with red body paint and condom-covered horns. However, it creates some of the funniest moments of any movie ever. Seriously, this is not an understatement. The same can be applied to all the other characters, apart from the little girl who behaves in such a way that she is so innocently innocent that she is probably overcompensating for some serious crime of which she is a part. Then again, if Santa's inter-space reconnaissance station is real, there's no way she could have avoided it for so long. Simply put, if you haven't seen this movie, you can't consider yourself a true fan. Painfully amusing characterization, acting, concept and racism almost under the radar make this a must see above any film to date (if you're looking for pure laughter).
