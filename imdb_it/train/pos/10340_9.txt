Although this film came out a year before I was born, it's definitely one of my favorite comedies. He stars Redd Foxx as a father who tries to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, he knows nothing about what it means to be gay and he has all these stereotyped notions about how gay people are. His son, Norman, is now grown up and lives alone. When his father, Ben, discovers that his son is gay, he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him. The title comes from one of the funniest lines in the film - when Ben arrives in Norman's apartments he runs into a prostitute and thinks it's his son to drag ("Norman ... are you?"). The film made me laugh from beginning to end. Redd Foxx is fantastic. Although many content is stereotyped, I have found nothing offensive about the way the material was handled, and it also has a good ending. Highly recommended.
