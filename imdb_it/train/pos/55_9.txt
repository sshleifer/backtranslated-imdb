At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie when it appeared on my guide, so I searched on IMDb and thought the cover was very nice, so I thought I'd give it a try while waiting for a movie like Elephant. <br /> <br /> Once I got over the fact that I didn't like Alicia's excellently played by Busy Phillips, I realized the good work this film was doing towards the relationship between Alicia and Deanna . Alicia is so bad with Deanna played by Erika Christensen almost throughout the film, but in the end we find that despite being polar opposites they have one thing in common besides being present at the shoot. They share solitude and how far it is revealed as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> I just have to say how much I loved this movie and I was glad to see all the positive comments about it. I couldn't even get past Elephant because he seemed to take advantage of the Columbine tragedy. This film on the other hand was compelling and realistic. Phillips's acting is out of the CHAIN ​​!!! This is a good thing and I would like to see his progress in more mature roles.
