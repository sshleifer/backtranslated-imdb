A highly atmospheric cheapie, which shows great ingenuity in the use of props, sets and effects (fog, lighting, focus) to create a disturbing and moody texture. The plot is unlikely, the acting is simply functional, but it shows how imaginative effects can develop an entire visual narrative. This film is recommended for its mood and its consistency, not for its history.
