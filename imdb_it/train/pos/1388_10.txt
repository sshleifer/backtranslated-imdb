"the day time ended" is an incredible image. somehow, it is better than "close encounters of the third type". (I prefer independent punch movies to big spectacular budgets.) The special effects ARE stylish, but this is an important part of the fun. jim davis offers an excellent performance in this film. it's probably one of the best roles I've ever had in a feature. the soundtrack is very good. the story DOES NOT make sense. BUT THAT MAKES YOU ONLY THE MOST INTERESTING. like many of the best works of art, "the day is over" is not afraid of being thin and ambiguous. "the day time ended" could be a low budget independent film, but it is not too long to compare it with the "existential" European films of the fifties and sixties. (many of which were low budget independent productions).
