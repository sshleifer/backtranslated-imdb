He seemed very balanced in showing what Jehovah's Witnesses have done to protect American freedoms. It also showed the strong faith of two families who were first generation witnesses. I also appreciated how he demonstrated how becoming a Jehovah's Witness affects non-witness family members and how difficult it is for them to accept the fact that they do not celebrate holidays, the sad part is that families who are not witnesses do not think about their family witnessed for family dinners / visits or giving them gifts at any other time, but for holidays or birthdays. When it comes to medical care, witnesses want and expect a high level of medical care, what people forget is that blood transfusions allow for poor medical care and surgery while bloodless treatments cause the medical team be highly qualified and trained, which one would you prefer? to treat your loved ones? I highly recommend this video!
