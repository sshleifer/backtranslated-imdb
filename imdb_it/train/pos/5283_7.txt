The premise for this film is simple, as is the script: an elderly Muslim convinces his teenage son to guide him in his equally ancient family car from France to the haj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, so that he can fulfill his sacred Muslim obligation before he dies. The father is clearly devoutly religious, but the son is not impressed; agrees to be obliged to his father rather than to religion, he prefers to be with his girlfriend (non-Muslim). The father is stubborn in a lot of things that the son does not understand and the petulance between them is the device that keeps the drama, even if it is often rather annoying. However, like any good road movie, there are extravagant characters encountered along the way; for example a woman on a secondary road in Croatia, who after asking directions to Belgrade, simply enters the back seat and points with her hand to a word that they presume to be a place but does not find it on the map. In Bulgaria, another man asks for directions to confirm that he can speak French, but then provides an extensive commentary in Bulgarian. There is also an occasional humor - in one country the son gets tired of eating egg rolls and wants meat - he is given a goat, but unfortunately (maybe luckily for the spectator) he escapes before the father can perform the ritual of Muslim butchers. Eventually they arrive in Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican, but on a much larger scale. For Westerners it's all bizarre but fascinating. The film is not sophisticated but is fascinating in its own way, a sort of National Geographic with the soul.
