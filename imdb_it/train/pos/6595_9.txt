I happened to borrow this film from a friend without knowing anything, and it turned out to be an exceptional documentary on a journey on an ancient ship across vast expanses of the ocean. Thor Heyerdahl had developed a theory that the ancient Incas in Peru could travel thousands of kilometers across the ocean to Polynesia, based on some relics found in both places, certain types of ancient ships that we know we have at arrangement, analysis of ocean currents and wind and the knowledge that the Incas, in fact, traveled in undetermined quantities at sea. <br /> <br /> To test his hypothesis, Heyerdahl and his crew build a boat as closely as possible to what the ancient Incas had available, using only balsa wood and other materials available at the time , and departed from Lima, the capital of Peru, to try to reach the islands of Polynesia, about 5,000 miles away. <br /> <His theory, like many things about ancient history, is impossible to prove with 100% certainty, but the coverage of their journey provides strong support that is right. The film is really little more than the narration of videos taken during the expedition of more than 100 days, but it is a very detailed description of how it was and the trials and tribulations they faced. I often hope that the Academy Award winning documentaries are easier to find, and this has been interesting and informative for more than 50 years now as I'm sure when it was released.
