This was a gem. Extraordinary interpretation of the protagonists Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and all the supporting cast. The film raises a topic not only relevant to Ireland and Irish history, but to many communities around the world and to many marital units within those communities. With intensity and sincerity, the film shows how religious beliefs and traditions have driven a wedge on a loving and passionate family. The title "Love divided" could not capture it better. Although it was a true story and happened in Ireland in the 50th, seeing how the life of the whole village erodes and the "pogroms" are starting to remind me of Russian history. Intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and unfortunately they are deeply hidden in human nature. Just like in the movie, the character of Liam Cunningham says "hatred had always been there beneath the surface". It was interesting to observe the moral choices that people were making in this story. Even the character of a Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the story was quite significant. However, history gives hope that the love of two people can conquer everything and love makes us better, stronger. The character of Liam Cunningham goes through the entire transformation throughout history becoming a man who has always wanted to be. Again, acting is top notch. The story is hectic. The Irish countryside is more beautiful than ever. Highly recommended.
