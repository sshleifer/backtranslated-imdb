My mother took me to see this movie as a child and I want to see it every year while I make all my other Christmas favorites. What I remember most was the stupid Devil and Santa who looked through his telescope. I waited and looked through the T.V. every year later to see when it would be shown. I used to find him playing Saturday afternoon. I found the film in English that took away something special from the movie and I wanted to find a copy of it in Spanish. I keep this film dear to my heart and I have never suffered from nightmares like others might suggest. Yes, it's a different movie about Santa Claus and this is what makes him special and unique. I can't wait to get a copy of this movie and watch it with my kids explaining my favorite parts and memories !!
