I found the film quite expressive, the way the main character was lost, but at the same time much clearer about certain things in the lives of people who mocked him (his roommate for example). <br /> <br /> he was tortured and you loved to see him tortured! he had this perverse side that was scary, but we were all happy to see him come out of misery again. <br /> <br /> he was like a character in the game or a pan-man through a land of mines or the enemy and we love watching him under attack from sniper or fire, but in the end we are happy to see him survive ... br /> <br />.
