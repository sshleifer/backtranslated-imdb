If TV was a baseball league, this show would have a perfect record! With an excellent cast and a perfect plot, this show gave 8 amazing seasons and a great joy on TV after dinner. With the constant changing of relationships and discovering who Hyde's real father is, this show was a success when it started in August of 98, even though it was set in 1976. And spending time in Foremans' basement was always what to do then, and it still is today, together with the circles. This show gave great laughter in the previews, and it still does so during replicas. If you watch a few episodes of this show, you'll get everything and want more. Now only this show is one of the best ever created, it's smart and fun.
