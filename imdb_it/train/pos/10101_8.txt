The Dominion Tank Police is a contradictory film production exercise. The plot through the 4 parts fuses meaningless action, slap-stick humor, touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions. It is hard to believe that there was only one director, since the style changes from one episode to another. A must for all those who love anime.
