A few years ago, the satellite channel U.K. Gold promoted "Men Behaving Badly" replicas with exaggeration: "Here, the original flat sharing sitcom!" This was actually false. 'Man About The House' was also a flat-sharing sitcom and ran from 1973 to 1976. <br /> <br /> It was the brainchild of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, the creators of the popular sitcom "Father Dear Father ". When it was over, they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times. <br /> <br /> In the first episode, Chrissy (Paula Wilcox) and Jo (Sally Thomsett) are tidying up their Myddleton Terrace apartment after a wild party when they find a man in their bathtub. It's Robin Tripp (Richard O'Sullivan), a homeless Southampton cookery student. While her clothes dry, she wears a woman's dressing gown and prepares a meal for them. They are so impressed by his culinary skills that they invite him to stay. But there must be no bad business. So Robin has to pretend to be gay ... <br /> <br /> On "I Love 1973" by BBC-2, shown in 2000, Julie Burchill said "House" showed her an envying lifestyle . She wasn't alone. One of the most iconic images (for me, anyway) of British television in the 1970s was Sally Thomsett coming out of the London subway carrying a parasol, and a blind man who made a double hold while his pertic background swayed. <br /> <br /> A man who lived with two girls was a subject for the moment, but Mrs. Mary Whitehouse did not need to warm up under her collar, she was innocent, good-natured. The scripts by Mortimer and Cooke came as close as possible to the limit without crossing it. <br /> <br /> Richard O'Sullivan was still playing "Bingham" in "Doctor In Charge" by I.T.V. when it started. In fact the second version of "In carica" ​​overlaps the first of "House". He was born to play the crazy sexual Robin. "Chrissy" by Paula Wilcox was more streetwise than "Beryl", her character played "Lovers", while "Jo" by Sally Thomsett was a lovely dizzy blonde. Over time, he has become almost an older brother to them. <br /> <br /> For many viewers, Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce stole the show as the Ropers fighter. George had lost interest in sex, but Mildred didn't. They went to their show - the aptly named 'George & Mildred'. The late Doug Fisher had a good relationship with Robin's friend Broadman, Larry. He worked so well that he became a director. <br /> <br /> One year after its debut, there was the inevitable cinematic spin-off. I'm not a big fan of the movie 'Man About The House' because I think it was stretched to fit the big screen. Most of his characters had never appeared in the series. <br /> <br /> The format was sold in America, where it became the longstanding "Three's Company" starring John Recon and Suzanne Somers. It was much more impressive than the British original, with Somers often seen in sexy clothes. <br /> <br /> After six seasons, "House" ended with Chrissy who married Robin's older brother, Norman (Norman Eshley). The fans were devastated to see Robin fail to get the girl she loved, but there was some consolation in the fact that he also brought his show - "Robin's Nest".
