I saw this picture in 1940 for $ .11 and I would like to get a DVD in 2006 The film was the greatest adventure of the time and, like all epic films, it is still a marvel of entertainment (B & W and all). the true friendship linked to the chemistry between the actors and performances of Sam Jaffe and Eduardo Cianelli is exceptional (this could not be done today I particularly liked the finale in which the colonel recites the end of Kipling's poem on the body of Gunga Din and tells the "Untouchable" "You're a better man than me Gunga Din" They don't make films of this character today. The only cast member who is still alive today is Joan Fontaine
