Before watching this movie I had heard a lot about it and some scenes from the movie, but listening was not doing it for me so I planned to watch it and wow! Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds form an interesting group of individuals who are determined to canoe along the Cahulawassee River and the unfortunate series of events that shines through all of them. Character development takes time to envelop the viewer with a better understanding of each person, but in the end you know these guys as if they were your friends. Acting, dialogue is very real, closer to the reality you can get for acting in Hollywood. The character of Reynolds "Lewis" was as interesting as a guy who comes off very hard but under the manly jacket lies a very soft and destroyed man (I was impressed by his performance!) Jon Voight seems to be the character who is most in the spotlight , the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him at every corner shape him and turn him into a different man in the end (the character's transition was excellent). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox really look like the silly talkers who like to joke and don't seem to get too horrible unless they have them too, and they did it ... I was really amazed by the vision of director Boorman of Dickey's novel, very impressed . You can't live your whole life without watching this movie. I give him eight out of ten stars, extremely impressed.
