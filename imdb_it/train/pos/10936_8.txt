Most of the 1970s (and the 1980s) Kong Kong's martial arts movies work just like movies; there are usually some well-planned combat sequences, but the plot is scraped pretty thin to fill the gaps between those knots - like porn movies, really. <br /> <br /> But this does many things well. More openly, there is the direction and the choreography, which borders every fighter in a "style" - is really based on Chinese circus acrobatics and comedy, but the effect works. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is the language of the camera, which uses some impressive techniques (even with today's measurements), changing the speed of projection from real time to slow motion and from unfiltered views to those filtered to represent the direction of history towards the past or towards the future. <br /> <br /> Less explicit, but more powerful and unexpected, is construction. The winner of this contest is determined by who "reveals" the story. The master (the screenwriter) organizes a game in which the protagonist does not know who he is looking for, which is the same situation in which the spectators find themselves. One by one, he finds out who is who, at the same pace that we find out who is who. Everything follows a tragic / noir arc. The ending tends to irony, to "The Sting". Much smarter than what we usually use in this genre. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the "five poisons" is the model for the "deadly adder killers" of Tarantino from the volumes of "Kill Bill".
