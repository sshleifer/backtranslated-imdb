This is a great film, it shows what our government wants in other countries if we don't like their government. It's not as bad as what Reagan and Bush did in South America, but the US still has no problems with other countries like this. This film also shows that the American media spread government propaganda. This is exactly what they did to Aristide in Haiti. The reason why this coup against Chavez was unsuccessful was Chavez elected with over 90% of the votes. <br /> <br /> This film is not just a political documentary, it would still be a great film if it were a drama, it's incredible that this is real. <br /> <br /> The other reviewer is lying when he says "Chavez takes over the radio waves", the private media are doing anti Chavez propaganda all the time.
