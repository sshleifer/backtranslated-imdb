A long-dead prison, closed for over 20 years, is reopened and Ethan Sharpe (the late, great character actor Lane Smith), once a guard there, is put in place as a guardian. While the prisoners are set to work to fix the place, they are instructed to enter the old execution room. This unleashes a fierce spirit that causes merciless devastation to both guards and prisoners; the low-key prisoner Burke (Viggo Mortensen, who shows true balance in a youthful role) is pushed into the role of the hero. <br /> <br /> I know it's a piece of cake to praise the film for its atmosphere (it was shot in a real abandoned penitentiary near Rawlins, Wyoming), but it raises this horror movie at a higher level. It has a great sense of foreboding, established from the beginning. Director Renny Harlin did his fourth directing job here; gave him the role of director of "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" and he actually started an impressive career in action films, thrillers and mainstream horror films. <br /> <br /> He may have characters of the series, but he has a capable cast bringing them back to life: Chelsea Field as the young woman running for prison reform, Lincoln Kilpatrick as the convict veteran Cresus, Tom Everett as restless with Rabbitt , Ivan Kane as the outgoing Lasagna, Tommy "Tiny" Lister as a soft-sounding giant Tiny, and Arlen Dean Snyder as captain Horton. It is also worth noting that one of the first acting titles for Kane Hodder (like the vengeful spirit) that helped * him * land the Jason Voorhees concert on the "Friday 13" series. <br /> <br /> Decent special effects, the moody lighting courtesy of the prolific cinematographer Mac Ahlberg, the spooky music of Richard Band and Christopher Stone, the great visual effects, the incredibly gloomy position and an overall presentation flashy and intense they help make it quite fun. It's ugly, creepy and fun for a horror fan. <br /> <br /> 8/10
