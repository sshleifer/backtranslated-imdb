Perhaps the most lucid and complete film of all Indian films - Pakeezah does not fall into any of the pitfalls commonly associated with the Bollywood film (ie stickiness, farce, gross and unfruitful imitation of Western films / genres). Pakeezah is indigenous to the sub-continent and authentic, almost like a butterfly similar to the plot. The characters are well developed, oriented, although sometimes not refined by today's standards, insightful and convincing. The environments of Urdu language at the time of Pakeezah were masters of understatement and of how dialogue transmits the subtleties of the era! Acting (in particular the 'looks' and the dynamic between the characters) is a delight for the eyes, even if the nuances can be lost for contemporary spectators or for those who do not know the customs and customs of Muslim India. <br /> <br /> Coupled, with a captivating script is a beautiful musical score, enhanced by the protagonist who shows an eminent command of classical Indian dance (kathak). As in the case of the most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but does not take leave of the public without the viewer feeling involved in a truly memorable cinematic experience. Pakeezah is certainly the pinnacle of what Indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be parallel.
