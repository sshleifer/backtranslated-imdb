Interpreting an incredibly interesting western by a director who had few colleagues in the genre. Just like the other images by Anthony Mann, The Far Country combines a powerful pot story with a clever knowledge of suggestive landscapes. Both interpretations of some of Mann's sins like honor, integrity, betrayal and, of course, death! The story sees Jeff Webster (James Stewart) and Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan), fortune-hunting companions, travel to the Oregon Territory with a herd of cattle. Aware of the boom of gold in bloom, they plan to make a good profit by selling the cattle in a Klondike town. Arriving in Skagway they find the autonomous judge Mr. Gannon {John McIntire} ready to give justice to Webster because of the fact that Webster broke the law, all with an honest cause, along the way. In punishment, Gannon takes the pack of partners from them, but they steal them back and cross the Canadian border towards Dawson, with Gannon and his men in pursuit. Here beautiful women and a mild and lawless city will fill the destinies of all those involved. <br /> <br /> Interesting from start to finish, The Far Country greatly benefits from the boiling hero {anti} of James Stewart waiting for portraits and Mann's smooth direction of the Borden Chase script. William H. Daniels' cinematography is superb, he didn't do any favors with the current DVD prints, and the film has some surprises and a "will it won't?" core reeling viewers. Paying dividends on re-watches for fans of the toughest genres, however, remains an essential vision for beginners who venture into the wonderful, but dark western world of Anthony Mann and James Stewart. 8/10
