I love cinema, so what I'm about to confess deeply embarrasses me. I gave a thumbs down to "Che, parts 1 and 2" without having seen the movie. Terrible I know. But I felt in a trap perpetrated by ... who? I don't know, but there was a negative word of mouth that spread like wild fire and, no matter how smart I was, I fell into it. Fortunately, I came across an Argentine director, Martin Donovan, a man I love and admire. When I told him I wouldn't see him because I knew the film was a failure, he looked at me as if he were ready to punch me in the face and Donovan is a pacifist! He took me aside and told me how much he loved the movie and why. I went to see both parts immediately and "Che, part 1 and 2" is the best film I saw in 2008. It is, with such purity that it will remind you of the work of some of the great masters of the past. Respect for his audience is something we are no longer used to. I don't know if we've ever been. To revive, move, without concessions and Benicio del Toro is simply extraordinary. We can see his soul, we can actually perceive it. Man's humanity is overwhelming. So, thanks again Martin Donovan for educating me so honestly. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and all those involved in this reference film. Don't make the mistake I was about to make. Go see it now on the big screen
