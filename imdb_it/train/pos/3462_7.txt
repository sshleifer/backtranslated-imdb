This was the first television episode of the Columbo series (although it was shot after "Death Lends a Hand") and announced one of the most successful TV series in history. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy (who played the killer in the series three times) excites equally pleased, arrogance and self-assurance, as Ken Franklin, a half of a mysterious writer who elaborates an elaborate plot to kill his partner, Jim Ferris (played by Martin Milner) who decides to interrupt their professional relationship, leaving Franklin exposed as a mere publicist rather than a prolific writer. <br /> <br /> The initial layout of the murder is fantastic and Cassidy's performance facilitates an unquestionable recognition that was the best Columbo Assassin in the series. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is wonderfully underestimated in his role as Columbo and the intrinsic characteristics and oddities of the character, underlined by an apparent slowness and distraction, contrast particularly well with Cassidy the extreme complacency of the character: one of the their first scenes together where Ken Franklin builds a reason to kill through the nonexistent expo-showy discovery of Jim Ferris that operates underground and exemplifies it very well. Franklin suggests to Columbo this potential motive and Columbo (intentionally or ignorantly) fails to attack, forcing Franklin to express his disappointment in a markedly paternalistic way and confronts him unfavorably with the detective in the books, Mrs. Melville. <br /> <br /> In addition, the first directorial contribution of 24-year-old Steven Spielberg is noteworthy. Despite some elementary camera inclusions that cast shadows on actors and actresses, he adds some stylistic and elaborate touches to support the general professionalism of the episode. A particularly strange image is of the body of Jim Feriss lying on the sofa, almost dark in the foreground, while Ken Franklin raises a glass in the background after having finished answering a phone call to Ferris's distraught wife. I have no doubt that working on a 10-14 day restriction program, Spieberg's efforts should not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the event of the second murder, necessitated by a blackmail scheme that is traced by a female friend of Franklin (and ironically called "sloppy" by Columbo in his climate summary) takes the steam of everything. The main theme of the plot is compromise and the screen-time between Falk and Cassidy decreases inexorably at this point to perhaps help the writer (Stephen Bocho) to come out of a narrow corner, since he cannot develop the story individually without another murder . <br /> <br /> The climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode. The initial joke and the exchange of words between Falk and Cassidy are performed in a strong and effective manner, but merely publicize the fact that it should have happened more in the episode. The main aggravating circumstance lies in the indication of sealing (if it can be called a clue): the character of Cassidy so far complacent and arrogant is extraordinarily expelled from a clue that actually does little to imply his guilt; and once mentioned, it surrenders in a rather inconspicuous and unusual way. <br /> <br /> All in all, a bold opening to the series, which inevitably announces and predicts all that is good in Columbo and, on the contrary, the problems associated with such ingenuity, namely maintaining high standards and in particular, the creation of a credible and appropriately intelligent ending.
