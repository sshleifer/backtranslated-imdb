The show is about two sisters living together. Holly being the youngest has some teenage problems, on the other hand her sister Val has work problems, boyfriend, boyfriend like most women on the planet. They try to support each other sometimes they make mistakes but they don't give up and continue. And the show is also about friendship. Priorities in life. I loved this show so much. It's fun and the actors are so good. I'm really sad about the finished show. I still watch the replicas from time to time :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth may be new to comedy, but it sounds very good. She is one of the actresses I like to watch. I like the relationship between Vince and Holly, they are very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh every time he shows up. With Tina Holly I found a real friend and I like them a lot when I'm around. Lauren's character is so funny and she's a natural talent. I'd like to see it more. This show involves you and makes you laugh. I wish the show wasn't over.
