As an old white housewife, I can still appreciate that Laurence Fishburne is one of our best actors. anyone who appreciates his work as in Deep Cover could enjoy watching the incredible acting variety of this actor. Since I think this is his directorial debut, it could be even more interesting. All the acting is pretty good. If you can't take junky worlds from Manhattan or the reality of criminal life (not glorified action shooter) then this is not a movie you'd like. It is Mr. Fishburne's usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships. I'd like to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins go to each other one day in a movie.
