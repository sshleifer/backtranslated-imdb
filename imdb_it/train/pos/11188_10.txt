I'm a big fan of Stephen King's work, and this film made me an even bigger fan than King. Pet Sematary speaks of the Creed family. They have just moved into a new home and look happy. But behind their house there is a pet cemetery. Creed's new neighbor Jud (played by Fred Gwyne) explains the burial site behind the pet cemetery. That cemetery is pure evil. Jud tells Louis Creed that when you buried a human (or any kind of pet) in the cemetery, they would be alive again. The only problem is that when they come back, they are NOT the same person, they are bad. Shortly after Jud explains everything about Pet Sematary, it all starts to end in hell. I won't explain it anymore because I don't want to give away some of the main parts of the film. The acting of Pet Sematary was pretty good, but he needed some work. The story was one of the main parts of this film, mainly because it was so original and compelling. This film has many makeup effects that make the film more disturbing and scary. One of the most basic reasons why this film gave me the creeps was actually the trick. There is a character in this film who is really crazy. That character is "Zelda". This particular character appears in the film about three times to be precise. Zelda is the sister of Rachel Creed who died years before, but Rachel is still haunted by her. The first time Zelda appears in the film is not generally scary because she is not talking or anything, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the second time scares the life out of me. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film, it's almost perfect. Pet Sematary offers great scares, a pretty good acting, first-rate plot and a charming make-up. This is truly one of the favorite horror movies of all time. 10 out of 10.
