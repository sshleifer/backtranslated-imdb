The House of the Spirits is a compelling story of family intrigue, South American politics and supernatural powers. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons give life to Isabel Allende's novel with all her passion and suspense. This, in my opinion, is one of the best films of the 90s. Jeremy Irons as Esteban Trueba ages and mellows very credibly, while Meryl Streep in the role of Clara maintains her gentle and loving warmth during her relatively short life. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas form a beautiful couple who are fighting for family acceptance in a racist culture. Glenn Close, as Esteban's sister, gives a very moving performance. The Portuguese campaign is a reasonable substitute for a non-tropical Latin American country. The settings of Clara's house and Esteban's ranch are effective and the American cars of the period are pleasantly added to the post-war atmosphere.
