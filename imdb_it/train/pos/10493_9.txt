This film is an inspiration to anyone who is or has been in a tough jam, both financially and emotionally. You will surely laugh, which is the best medicine! :) Left in an unfavorable financial situation when her husband dies, Grace has to find a new way to make money and it's not exactly legal that adds to humor. Even my boyfriend liked it so I don't think it's a chick-flic.
