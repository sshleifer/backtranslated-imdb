First of all, I must say that I made the mistake of watching out-of-sequence Election movies. I say unfortunately, because after seeing Election 2 before, the election seems a bit of a disappointment. Both films are epic of gangsters similar in shape. And while Elections is a beautiful piece of cinema ... it's not nearly as good as its sequel. <br /> <br /> In the first episode of the Election, we are shown the two competitors for the President; Big D and Lok. After some discussion scenes between "Uncle's" about who should have the Chairman title, they decide (almost unanimously) that Lok (Simon Yam) will direct the Triads. Suffice it to say that this does not go well with the competitor Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) and in an attempt to influence the acquisition, Big D kidnaps two of his uncles to influence the electoral commission on his side. This has disastrous results and directs the triads into a total war. Lok is determined to become President but will not become official until he is able to recover the "Dragon Head Baton", a material representation of the power of the President. The current president, Whistle (Chung Wang) has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland China and the race is scheduled to see who can recover it first. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is dedicated to the recovery of the witness. While both would-be leaders seek him they have to dodge cops and opposite sides, which leads to one of the prominent scenes of the Election, which involves a sub-lieutenant called Jet (Nick Cheung), a machete and many villains. The presence of Nick Cheung is attention to say the least ... I wonder if this influences the director Johhnie To in any way while doing the second Election, since it provides more of the character of Jet in the sequel. <br /> <br /> While Nick Cheung gives a scene that steals the performance, I can't help but give the rest of the actors in the film. The elections have a fantastic ensemble cast with well thought out performances, which are both subtle and engaging. Simon Yam is his usual glorious self and the film also benefits HK heavyweight actors such as Louis Koo, Tony Leung Ka Fai and the underestimated Suet Lam. There are no weak ties in acting and one could easily believe that they are watching the real gangsters. <br /> <br /> Although the performances are great, one of the most impressive things about the election is Johnnie To's eye for the camera. There are some really surprising shots in the film and it goes without saying that he surely knows how to frame his shots, given that the viewer is treated with a series of innovative and quite brilliant shots and angles. All this makes Elzione, above all, a very beautiful film. <br /> <br /> My problems with the film stem mainly from the amount of characters involved in the elections. It becomes a bit difficult to follow because the film is so full of characters that are not an integral part of the plot. While the sequel chooses to focus more on the two candidates, the first election offers the electoral process as a whole with tons of Uncle, underlings and police officers crowding the plot. Perhaps the film would have worked better if it would have been a little longer with more time devoted to the inner workings of the Triad, or if the director Johnnie To would have channeled the necessary elements and exposed them more. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line - All in all, this is a wonderfully brutal film with an exceptional cast, excellent direction and a pleasant rhythm that gives a punch. It's just a little more complicated than necessary.
