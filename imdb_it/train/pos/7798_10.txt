I can't begin to describe how amazing this film is. Suffice it to say that every time I am depressed about how unfair or futile things seem, this is the film I'm going to take to put myself in the right condition. The background music makes you understand the ease of existence and how simplicity offers maximum happiness. The Indian girl who sings is just one example of a character in this film who doesn't make a lot of effort, and is happy accordingly. Persifina, Ruby's laundry colleague (Ashley Judd) is another = - her eyes and smile could make a person's day more difficult. I watch this film and dream of better days to come or a nice conversation with friends, and I realize that being alone - Ruby is often enough - is not like being alone. Recommended for all those who enjoy a quiet movie break.
