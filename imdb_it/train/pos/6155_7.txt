"Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is a magical adventure film with a certain charm, despite not being one of the best Disney works. It has a generally good story, good songs, great characters, good actors, magical and delicious special effects, good settings and enchanting landscapes of England. <br /> <br /> It also combines live-action and animation very well. The animation itself is, of course, quite good. The animation looks a lot like that of the 1973 animated film "Robin Hood" and the same can be said of the animated characters: there are many wild animals like bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and others like in "Robin Hood ". ". Furthermore, the King (a lion) seems to be a mix of Prince John and King Richard, not to mention that the bear resembles Little John. <br /> <br /> This film is often compared to" Mary Poppins " "With a reason. Both combine live-action and animation with a similar work of art. Both have similar settings in London. Both have their magic and a magical woman. The children (Carrie, Charlie and the cute little Paul) are a bit like Banks's children, both films were directed by Robert Stevenson and both cast David Tomlinson, but instead of a very serious man like George Banks, David Tomlinson plays a skinny, thin man - Professor Emelius Browne: With its magic, this film also has some slight but significant similarities to the Harry Potter stories. <br /> <br /> Most of the songs are good. "The Age of Not Believing" and "The Beautiful Briny Sea "are the best. Even" Portobello Road "is beautiful. <br /> <br /> David Tomlins Not in this film again. Angela Lansbury is as fantastic as Miss Price and the 3 actors are good too: Cindy O'Callaghan in the role of Carrie, Ian Weighill in the role of Charlie (a boy in the age of not believing) and Roy Snart in the role of younger brother Paul. <br /> <br /> I like the black cat. It's very beautiful. It looks a bit like Salem, the black cat from the television series "Sabrina, the teenage witch". I find it cute every time one of the characters in the movie is turned into a white rabbit. Rabbits are really cute, soft and adorable animals. I simply love them! Even more fun is when Professor Emelius Browne is turned into a white rabbit because, when he is again transformed into a human, he shakes his nose like a rabbit. It's really fun, combined with his comic figure and that mustache. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is an ok film, but its finish is pretty ugly. The first few minutes of the film are nothing special, but then they improve a lot. The ending, however, is weak. This is my main criticism, largely because the thing about the animated knights is a little too much for me and also for the feeling of war.
