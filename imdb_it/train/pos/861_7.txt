What can you say when you see a good French film that tries to draw a suspense story in line with the social background of the characters? The main point is that we believe in those characters and, once met, we want them to stay together. It's simple and really efficient. The background story is less important. Why does the script play the part of a semi-developed thriller? It helps not to get stuck in those social events that most French filmmakers like to do. Not too much ambition, right: Sur mes l√®vres is just a fun French film with a good characterization. <br /> <br /> For all the smart noir points in the script, the end is too easy. It is quite easy as in Rear Window (an obvious reference and certainly not a film noir) but with a less compelling context. Where I am amazed is to see that the character of the surveillance officer has not been canceled. It brings very little to history; when it appears alone we ask ourselves if we have not lost a part before. Jacques Audiard is not yet a newcomer. Strange and strange
