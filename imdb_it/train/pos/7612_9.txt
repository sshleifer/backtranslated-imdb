OK I'll be honest, when I first saw the trailer for the program, I thought it was an advertisement for some sunscreen products. With all the people walking on the beach. Despite this I decided to watch it, thinking it would be a new show that I could have laughed at. But I was really stunned. <br /> <br /> From the first 10 seconds of the program I was captured, because he is lying in the trees, because the plane crashed etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> It is not every day that a show arrives that combines intelligence, humor, action and suspense. But 'Lost' handles all this. With a fantastic cast and crew, beautiful settings and fairly decent special effects, "Lost" will capture anyone who tunes in, and is a must see for all those who are fed up with poor sitcoms and crappy TV. <br /> <br /> Lost on Tuesdays at 10 on channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O
