OUR Short Comedy of our GANG. <br /> <br /> The Gang forces Spanky to look at their younger brothers. Taking care of these FORGOTTEN CHILDREN turns out to be a nuisance, leaving the little caliper with no other choice but to devise some ingenious solutions to the problem of baby-sitting ... <br /> <br /> Spanky is in his glory in this hilarious film, probably its best. Highlights: Spanky is telling the story of the TARZAN movie he recently saw to the children's public. Film stars will recognize the voice of Billy Gilbert in the radio drama.
