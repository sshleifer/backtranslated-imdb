The film is a fantasy. The plot is subtle but serves as a framework on which some wonderful songs are sung and sung wonderfully. (I still can't believe that such beautiful and attractive people can sing so well.) Some of the dialogues are wonderfully intelligent. The costumes made me feel like I was watching a 1942 haute couture show. <br /> <br /> The films are designed to serve a variety of purposes. This is designed to entertain and certainly does. If I had a negative comment, Nelson Eddy would have been a little too old to be the magnificent Count. Some of the close-ups made me feel uncomfortable. But he could still sing and sing beautifully. However, Jeanette MacDonald was just as dazzling as ever. She makes a spectacular angel. <br /> <br /> This genre is long before my time and I a new film by Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy and its conversation. The music in this film is beautiful. As much as you love classic rock music that fills the most modern movies, there is no doubt in my mind that this music is simply and clearly more memorable, more enjoyable, better built. The stars of this film are more talented than the stars I see today in theaters. And Jeanette MacDonald, without the benefit of Beverly Hills plastic surgeons, was more beautiful than the stars I see today. I'm not clear why so many other posters apologize for appreciating this film and more generally this group of films. They say it is dated and try to explain why it is as it is. And those who don't like it say it's not very good but about what? I think this film will surely be fun for people when many other films have long been forgotten. There is only too much quality in every sense in this film to avoid being remembered and appreciated. I recommend this film without reservation to anyone who appreciates great talent, great beauty and great music.
