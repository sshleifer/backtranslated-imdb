I have very fond memories of this film, as I saw it with my two younger sisters when it was first screened in 1977 and I was eight. Apparently it was considered a failure - and now it's practically forgotten (the pan-and-scan videotape - which never did justice to the image or its ambitious Panavision compositions are now out of fashion). The film is very stylized (shades of YELLOW SOTTOMARINO) and certainly irregular. Some of the characters and sequences are exquisite, while others are somewhat youthful and indistinguishable. The sad discarded blue camel (shades of Eeyore) and his blue song are truly moving. Joe Raposo's songs are mostly simply beautiful. Definitely a worthwhile curiosity that probably (unfortunately) will fall back into total darkness.
