Once again, Madhur Bhandarkar takes you around the wild side. And it is remarkable, literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> Mumbai hi-society - stars and stars, glam dolls and sorcerers, magnates and business brokers, yes, all the smelly - I'm in strong focus here. In the typical scandal style, their worlds develop, with each colorful story an intelligent secondary plot in itself. <br /> <br /> A star in distress discharged by the producer after becoming pregnant, the hostess and her high-profile husband, the pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife, journalists and the police captain ; all the nuances on display and innumerable intermediate shades. <br /> <br /> Bhandarkar does a nice job of digging the dust on the drama kings, the dancing queens and the living dead. Atul Kulkarni packs a punch, as do Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul. Konkona Sen Sharma is effective as a former crime reporter, but could have been a bit up to date based on the job change and the party circuit. <br /> <br /> Very concentrated (lasting 140 minutes) and a pleasantly different film, worth the money.
