In this film by Muppet, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillia, Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Animal, Janice and Zoot are graduates who decide to bring their hit musical, Manhattan Melodies, to Broadway. Unfortunately, no producer will even meet the Muppets. After being denied by too many producers, Scooter suggests that the Muppets decide to go it alone. However, Kermit still believes he can get his show on Broadway, but after he finally does and let everyone know that he sold the show, Kermit gets amnesia and the others don't know where he is. <br /> <br /> There are many fantastic scenes, including a live action sequence that introduced Muppet Babies, a sequence of Muppets-filled weddings, including the cast of Sesame Street and Traveling Matt (from Fraggle Rock ), Scooter as a cinema usher and a scene in which Rizzo and the other rats eat breakfast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that more characters were not included more. Of course, many of them appear at the wedding, but there should have been significant roles for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard and Sweetums, and Lips should have been part of The Electric Mayhem in this film as if it was the last season of The Muppet Show and The Great Muppet Caper, and also Miss Piggys' dog, Foo Foo, should have been with her (after all, Rizzo The Rat, also played by Steve Whitmire, played an important role in this film, and was not very well known at the time).
