If you think "Weird Al" Yankovic is fun, you won't be disappointed by THE COMPLEAT AL. Not only does this rare mockumentary present many of Yankovic's most memorable videos ("Like A Surgeon" and "I Love Rocky Road" among them), but they are intertwined with cartoons that allegedly highlight the rise to fame of the parodist. Yankovic isn't to everyone's taste, but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non-fans will be at least slightly amused. The hardcore fans will love it not only for its content, but also for its relatively early appearance in Yankovic's nearly three decades career. Suitable for all ages, children will surely love funny pictures.
