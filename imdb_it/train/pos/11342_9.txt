I watched Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10 years old. He was right after Bay City Rollers. I saw him arrive at Family Channel one day and recorded it for my then three-year-old daughter. I had forgotten all the things I had loved as a child, the magic flute, the zoom broom, Witcheepoo's trick. <br /> <br /> This show is definitely low-tech. The mayor is certainly a precedent for Mayor McCheese, and everyone is a stuffed animal with annoying googly eyes. But children love this stuff. They would rather watch a guy working with a sock puppet than sit in front of a high-tech computer animation. There is disgust (mild), but there are no adult themes like sex or people who die, and children accept Jimmy's patterns. The children think it would be nice to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone that their house was on fire, and I loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought Witchypoo flew over her head. The music is old, but you really get used to it, and my daughter really loved it. She sang "different is difficult, different is just" in the car. My daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months, and it's still one of her favorites. <br /> <br /> I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 is in the works. I really hope they try to keep the old flavor and do nothing like the characters that animate the computer, etc. I think an entire new generation can love Pufnstuf.
