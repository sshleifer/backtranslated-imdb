This movie is good for TV. I like it because I'm a big fan of catastrophic movies even though this is a family movie. The accuracy of the film taken from the book is half and half. They took the names of the characters, but there was no storm hunter in the book, the scene of the car involving the Hatch family escaping from the tornado was not in the book, instead it involved Dan hatch and his friend riding with an agent police officers on their way to the police station for safety. and in the book Dan and his friend are both 12 years old. This is all I can think of. Overall this was a good movie although it could be a little more accurate for the book. Did you know that the book was based on a true story of a series of tornadoes that devastated a small Nebraska town in 1980?
