I attend a Filmmaker's Symposium and this film was shown after we had already seen a movie that was not great and participated in a 40-minute discussion. Even though it was incredibly late and we were tired, I really liked the whole audience. <br /> <br /> I personally thought the film was hilarious in all the right places, and I loved the extravagant cast of characters. They really grow on you in the film.
