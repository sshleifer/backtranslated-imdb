Ten of the 11 short films in this film are masterpieces (I found only the disappointing Egyptian one). Strangely, all but the Mexican director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in relation to September 11th: Afghan refugees, deaf people, Palestinians, widows of Srebrenica, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, love at first sight in Pinochets and consequent bloodbath, suicide bombings in Israel, American Muslims affected by paranoia and persecuted by the state in the United States, old people living alone and the consequences of the Second World War in the hearts of Asian soldiers. This could say something sad about the limits of empathy, either way: directors might feel that Americans ignore the rest of the world and only care about their tragedies, while actually doing the same with their short films. br /> <br /> Surprisingly, I found the piece by Sean Penn one of the best in the collection, and *** SPOILER AHEAD *** I also imagine his portrait of Ernest Borgnine as a half-crazy man who grows in an apartment of New York experiencing the happiest moment of his widow's life when the Sun shines through his window after the WTC "collapsed away from the light", I imagine that this could also be one of the most offensive as the general American public would see it .
