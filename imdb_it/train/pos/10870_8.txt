Personally, I find the film a good watch. It describes the current situation of the triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer an idea of ​​how the triads are organized. <br /> <br /> Not only that, it shows the viewer how the Hong Kong police monitor the triad situation and why the police are not limited to everything and cancel the triads. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is quite violent due to the gangland killing and torture methods. However, the film remains true to the real world, so violence on the screen is just a reflection of what really happens. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to any fan of the Triad / Mafia movies. Another good watch would be Dragon Squad. That movie has more guns than this, since in this film there are more knives than guns (in reality I don't remember seeing a single cannon).
