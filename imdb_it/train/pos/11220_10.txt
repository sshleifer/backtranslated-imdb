Aim for the Top! Gunbuster is one of those anime series that has written classics about it. I loved this series and to this day remains my favorite anime. And while it was not the first animated product of Gainax, it was their first OVA series. <br /> <br /> Initially started as a parody of the sports drama of the 70s Aim For The Ace (Ace O Nerae!), The Gunbuster takes steam as a serious drama towards the end of episode 2, when Noriko Takaya is forced to relive the death of his father, who was killed in the initial encounter of humanity with the race of insects with which humanity is at war. It is because of his father's death that Noriko wants to become a fighter pilot. But her lack of confidence proves to intrude at times and she falters. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, even has doubts about whether Noriko was chosen as a pilot. However, Noriko's coach, Koichiro Ota, trusts her. And he made his personal mission to see that she manages to become a pilot because he was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko's father was killed. <br /> <br /> Other characters include Jung-Freud, a Russian The fighter pilot assigned to serve with the squadron Noriko and Kazumi belong to, Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko who is killed in their first sortie together, and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's childhood friend. Kimiko's involvement is also interesting, as while Noriko is in space, Kimiko stays back on Earth to live a normal life. And due to time dilation, Kimiko ages on Earth normally while Noriko is relatively the same age as she left school. At the end of the series, Noriko is around 18 while Kimiko is in her fifties. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an excellent series of souls to watch if you are a fan of the giant mecha robot and Gainax animation. If you like other Hideaki Anno shows, or you're a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's works, give this show a chance. It will grow on you.
