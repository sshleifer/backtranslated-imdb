Have you ever read Jim Thompson? He is a sweetened noir with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy he has ever encountered. There are rarely any private investigators in his work - only losers, psychotics and scammers of little importance. This movie nailed Thompson - "If God has made real mistakes in this world, it was in giving us a will to live when we have no excuse for it". Each character in the film is balanced on the razor's edge between surreal and creepy realism. There's the deranged Uncle Bud, played by Bruce Dern and Doc Goldman, spectral well-intentioned, played by George Dickerson. Jason Patric offers a wonderful, often heartbreaking interpretation of Kid Collins, a fighter not too bright and shy who is more afraid of himself than anyone else. Rachel Ward is Fay, the sexy femme fatale we can't understand ... It's not your standard noir movie, nor is it intended to be. After Dark My Sweet, along with The Grifters, are two excellent adaptations of novels by one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson.
