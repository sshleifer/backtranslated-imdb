I first saw Enchanted April about five years ago. I liked it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy of the following Christmas. These are two women who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, leaving their monotonous life behind. They are very sad women at the beginning of the film, and you can't help but root them while planning this get away with two other women who invite you to share the expenses. This is perhaps the most beautiful film I've ever seen. It is pure and simple, without car chases, without animosity and without deaths. It was made with care and in excellent taste. You can't help but smile all through it - except when you cry happy tears!
