Silly, hilarious, tragic, sad, inevitable. <br /> <br /> A group of rude people join an "expert" swindler to rise from their poverty. Great idea ... if you ignore the breaking factor. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see George Clooney do something really fun to change. The casting is perfect and the acting standards are very high. Although it can be said that the theme of the crew is not new, I think this film handles it in an interesting and unique way. Sufficiently so that it stands out from what it was before. <br /> <br /> Boys very well done.
