I am very sorry that this fascinating and extravagant film (which I saw for the first time shortly after being released in the early 1950s) has had such a poor reception recently. In my opinion it has been very underestimated - but perhaps it attracts more the sense of European humor than (for example) the American: perhaps we in Europe can understand and appreciate more subtleties and situations, because we are closer to some of them in the real life! A special mention should be made of the limited but good music - especially the catchy and memorable song "It's a beautiful, beautiful night", which was published separately on a HMV 78rpm disc (10 inch plum label, I think!) In the Fifties . I would urge anyone interested to give it a try if you could: you might have a pleasant surprise.
