'Holes' was a GREAT movie. Disney made the right choice. Every person I spoke to said he LOVED it. Everyone who chose was in shape for the part they had, and Shia Labeouf really has a future with acting. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for The Warden, it was exactly how I imagined it. all those who haven't seen it recommend it and I guarantee you we'll "dig it".
