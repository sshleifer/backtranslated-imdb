Yesterday I saw this movie for the third time. It was recommended to me by a fried several weeks ago. I've never seen or noticed it before, because it falls (so typically) in the "Swedish film" category and those who have stood up (like me) with Hollywood productions tend to be skeptical of any foreign film. What the hell paradigm shift! The film touches me, because it continues to hope that humanity can change in a better way. The Swedish village is just a pattern for all areas of the earth where people live together - controlled by religion, misunderstandings, lack of courage, predictions, masked brutality, but also the ability to have fun, meet, sing ... It takes a trigger from the outside to tear off the masks of everyone (whoever holds one) and make them feel that we are all just human beings with the desire to live our lives. I can never stop seeing stories like this, because my hope continues as described above. The five minutes that contain the story of Gabriella's song, including her performance, are one of my film highlights of all time! Thanks Kay Pollak for just these 5 minutes, which made me happy!
