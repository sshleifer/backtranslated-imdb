This video is shaken! Eddie is one of the funniest comics I've ever seen. Not only does it have class, it makes some of the funniest remarks about the history and culture I've ever seen. Eddie is the most original and smartest comic I've seen in a long time. Tell all those other stand-ups to get off the stage and let this "executive" reign!
