I saw this film at the BIFFF Festival in Brussels, spring 2004. What a surprise! This German production, a shocking stylish and imaginative, is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Be careful: it's not a joke! This terrorist has a cast of good actors (for example: Peter Martell as European guru has a strong presence), excellent direction, beautiful production design, a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy gore like Italian horror films in the 80 . The meat has been cut to the bone ... and the blood is flowing red ... this wild heart cap will grab you ... and give you dark dreams ... Don't miss it !!
