We often talk about landmarks of cinema: Kane, The Godfather, A Bout de Souffle. However, a film is too often overlooked by "serious" film critics. I speak of course of the classic Doc Savage (M.o.B.) <br /> <br /> This film is not only exciting, but also seriously explores the question of the exploitation of developing nations by US imperialism. Not to mention the kung-fu. <br /> <br /> He also owned the greatest soundtrack in the history of cinema (until, of course, Queen's breathtaking work on Flash Gordon). Although it is a bit rare, this film is worth looking for - it will repay the effort of your search ten times.
