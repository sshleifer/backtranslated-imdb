I didn't research the film before my first vision because it was part of a Welles box that I had recently purchased. A casket I got mainly because I wanted to own A Man For All Seasons and also re-evaluate Waterloo. So I read Orson and Rita in the player and am treated in class and confusion in equal measure. <br /> <br /> On the surface the story seemed simple, the man meets a wonderful woman and saves her from a couple of hooligans, they immediately click and the man receives the job offer on a cruise with the woman and the her famous lawyer husband, and then ............. <br /> <br /> becomes murder mystery of the plotted devil and many tricks. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) does not really know what is happening, he is as confused as the viewer, and it is wonderful to see since he is practically conquered by all the actors in the film. Obviously being attracted by the strings of the heart by a femme fatale of a beauty like Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) has her moments, but you only know that things will go to pear. <br /> <br /> So many wonderful things in the film, it has the visual style of Welles everywhere, seeing a scene in an aquarium that is wonderful and the final sequences in a fun house is majestic on the eyes. The narration of O ' Hara is joyously self-deprecating, and we get good relief from the light through a court case with Everett Sloane which triggered the events considerably. <br /> <br /> However, the film is an oddity, and in fact it is a clumsy visual experience, because {as I would have discovered later} The studio leaders cut the film by almost a whole hour, and this does not it's just frustrating for us, but it makes it unfair on Welles' vision. I am sure that an original cut of this film would have been praised and revered wholesale, because it is a very beautiful and intriguing film, one that sadly only hints at greatness, but remains a diabolical and compelling film that I am happy to review further. 8.5 / 10
