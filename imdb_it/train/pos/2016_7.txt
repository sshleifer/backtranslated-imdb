Higher and Higher was one of Rodgers & Hart's minor Broadway musicals, he had only 84 performances on Broadway in 1940. Yet he produced one of their biggest hits It Never Nevered My My Mind. <br /> <br /> However, except for a minor song, So Disgustingly Rich, the entire Broadway soundtrack was discarded when RKO purchased the movie rights. Instead an entirely new soundtrack by Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson was written, mostly to house a Francis Albert Sinatra who was making his film debut. <br /> <br /> Sinatra who had made some vocal cameos in the previous films, takes a puff from the page of his singing rival Bing Crosby. When Bing made his feature film debut in The Big Broadcast, he played Bing Crosby. Frank Sinatra took on the role of Frank Sinatra and I can't think of anyone who could have done a better job. <br /> <br /> The chairman of the board is ranked third here behind the stars Jack Haley and Michele Morgan. He is the butler and she is Leon Errol's kitchen maid. In reality Errol is a millionaire who has not paid his help for seven months. Especially because it's about to go into chapter 11 or so, inform the staff. <br /> <br /> Errol is a delightful old soul to work with and none of the staff wants to miss a good thing. They gather their resources and convince Michael Morgan to imitate Errol's daughter, who is in Switzerland with her mother. The idea is to grab a rich bankroll in the hopes of saving the family's fortune. Only Michele starts looking at another one. <br /> <br /> It is a light plot and certainly not worse than a lot of musicals, but RKO has invested this film with a good cast of players. Barbara Hale and Elizabeth Risdon play another debutante and her mother suspects that something is not right, Victor Borge is a fortune that does not ask for explanations, Dooley Wilson, Paul Hartman, Grace Hartman, Marcy McGuire, Mel Torme and Mary Wickes, play the others of the Errol family. It's not a bad group. <br /> <br /> Sinatra sang three good ballads all with some sort of commercial success, The Music Stopped, a lovely way to spend an evening, and I couldn't sleep a wink Last night. The latter was nominated for an Oscar for Best Song, but was lost to Alice Faye. You will never know it. <br /> 1943 was the year of the Musician's Union Strike against the record industry. To extract the material, Frank Sinatra recorded the songs of Higher and Higher with an acapella choir for Columbia. Bing Crosby recorded songs from his film Dixie in the same way as Decca. Both were reported by the president of the union, James C. Petrillo as a strike and both failed to cross the picket line again. The strike was not completely resolved until 1944, although Decca broke ranks before the other record companies and settled before Columbia, RCA Victor and the others. <br /> <br /> The strike provided some anxious moments for Sinatra. He had just left the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra when the strike was called. He closed a necessary place for his artistic talent when he wasn't sure if leaving Dorsey would prove to be a right move for his career. <br /> <br /> Fortunately higher and higher was received, a legend was launched.
