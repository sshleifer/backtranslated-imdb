After racism, the rural exodus - also known as migration from the countryside - is another socio-political issue of the 1960s. WestSide Story had faced racism from a love party in an artistic vision. Now, Midnight Cowboy deals with the rural exodus of a tragedy of friendship in a psychological perspective. It has a deeply painful ending that we witness one of the two companions of the destiny that disappears. <br /> <br /> Director John Schlesinger skilfully delivers the deepest thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and insights of two New York City foams. While the handsome Joe Buck (Voight) dreams of all the beautiful women of the world who beg him to share a wild fantasy of love, poor Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in the thriving and sunny Florida. As a result, Joe becomes a braggart to turn his fantasies into reality; and Ratso becomes a snatcher to raise enough money to emigrate to Florida. In addition, Ratso helps Joe find ways to do everything he can. They start sharing everything in life. They share food, share medicine, share an uninhabited house, share their earnings and then share a destiny. Unfortunately, as the story progresses, Joe realizes that being beautiful is not the only thing that makes all beautiful women beg him to have fun; and besides, Ratso can't see Florida since his heart can't beat his illness while he was on the bus that takes him there. <br /> <br /> The Might is always right, and the weak have no right to daylight. Thus, "Midnight" gives the real view. <br /> <br /> Despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy. Every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bring their inevitable destiny. Thanks to this, Midnight Cowboy is a provocative vision of a socio-political issue, the rural exodus.
