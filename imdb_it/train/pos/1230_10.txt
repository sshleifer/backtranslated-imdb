after seeing this movie for the third time now I think it's the worst Adam PUNCH DRUNK LOVE IS POOR movie compared to this I have to say at the end when Dickie is knocked off the boat is so funny (the hair is different from his and I like it when it turns everyone off. This movie should only be worn if you are a true Adam Sandler fan. <br /> <br /> the characters are poor compared to his funny movies like the Waterboy, who has the same people in it (Peter Dante ) who is one of the killers trying to kill the Australian bird. <br /> <br /> this film lacks depth and a decent narrative line and deserves to be at the bottom 100
