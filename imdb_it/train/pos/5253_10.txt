I really don't understand why people get so angry and put this movie in the pan! Remember people, this is an SNL movie, not something that should be unpredictable and original in the plot or direction! The Ladies Man is a hilarious movie, though sometimes stupid, with an extravagant cast and, as usual, WONDERFUL performances by Will Ferrel and Tim Meadows. Yes, some of the jokes are stupid, and yes, the characters are incredible but it's a comedy! I really don't understand how nobody can laugh a lot during this hilarious movie. However, all I ask is that people take it as it is: a SNL, a silly and irreverent comedy. Nothing that will win prizes, but nevertheless, a little gold of modern comedy. "10-4 Apricot!"
