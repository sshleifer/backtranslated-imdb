I could not believe the comments made about the film. <br /> <br /> As I read the horrible opinions about the film, I really wondered if I had actually seen the same movie I did. <br /> <br /> What I saw was incredible! I think the actresses and the director did a fantastic job in the film. <br /> <br /> I had not had the pleasure of seeing the actress first and I could not have been more backward from the incredible work that I should have said that it is the most credible film I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> What I don't see is why everyone has such a problem with choosing Deanna's drug in an attempted suicide scene, from the comments made it seems it was the choice of the actresses and her choice stupid. Which I don't understand, it's a film written by someone else and directed by someone else, so how can it be the mistake of the actresses that I can't see. I think it was a credible film that I would review and recommend. Opinions are what they are and they are too ugly that so many are so close. I hope to see all the actors soon, I think they all played great roles. <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps will be the highest paid actress one day and I hope she can laugh in front of all those who have criticized her! Go girl!
