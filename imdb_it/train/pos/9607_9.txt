This is a film that should be seen by anyone interested, affected or suffering from an eating disorder. It is an incredibly accurate and sensitive portrait of bulimia in a teenage girl, its causes and symptoms. The girl is played by one of the brightest young actresses working in the cinema today, Alison Lohman, who was then so spectacular in "Where the Truth Lies". I would recommend that this film be shown in all schools, because you will never see a better one on this topic. Alison Lohman is absolutely exceptional and marvels at her ability to convey the anguish of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder. If the barometers tell us the air pressure, Alison Lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy. Its emotional scope is so precise, each scene can be measured microscopically due to its gradations of trauma, on a scale of growing hysteria and despair that reaches unbearable intensity. Mare Winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother, and she does it with immense sympathy and a range of equally well tuned emotions like those of Lohman. Together they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators that vibrate in resonance with one another. This film is truly an amazing achievement and director Katt Shea should be proud of it. The only reason for not seeing it is if you are not interested in people. But even if you like more naturalistic films, this is after all the animal behavior at the limit. Bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy its own body in a frenzy of despair. And if we don't feel sympathy for people who suffer in the depths of despair, then we died inside.
