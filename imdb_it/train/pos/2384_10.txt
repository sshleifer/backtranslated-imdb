It is known that when Gene Roddenberry first launched Star Trek at NBC, the original pilot episode, The Cage, was rejected for being "too cerebral". When the series had another chance, Roddenberry thought it would be fun to set the events of the episode rejected as a canon, and he did it by writing The Menagerie, which has the distinction of being the sequel to what was still, at the time, an unwanted episode. <br /> <br /> This time, instead of exploring a new planet, Kirk and his crew are on Starbase 11, visiting former Enterprise commander Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney), now horribly disfigured and paralyzed because of an accident. Pike joins his successor on the starship, where he awaits an unpleasant surprise: Spock, who used to serve under Pike, has actually hijacked the ship and set the course for Talos IV, a planet that is off-limits (the punishment is the death) from Pike and Spock's last visit there, 13 years earlier. Of course, being a logical creature, Spock transforms and organizes a court martial so that he can justify his actions. <br /> <br /> There's no need to say more about the plot, since the rest will take place in Part 2. What really impresses is how Roddenberry creates the connection between The Cage and the rest of the universe of Star Trek, coming with a particular type of flashback (to say more would be too much) that allows everyone, on screen and off, to see what could have been Trek, NBC had not rejected the original project. In particular, it's fun to see Jeffrey Hunter (who hasn't been able to return to The Menagerie) play Pike as a more serious captain than Kirk normally is and Nimoy's beginnings as Spock, whose personality was not yet fully established : this is the only time of the entire series that Vulcan favored by all smiles spontaneously. <br /> <br /> In short, not only a great "mysterious" episode, but also a pleasure for those who cannot be bothered to track down The Cage in its original form (it is available as part of the third season box set) .
