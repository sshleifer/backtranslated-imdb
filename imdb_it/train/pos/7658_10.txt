<br /> <br /> I've seen this movie many times. At least a dozen. But unfortunately not recently. However, in my memory I don't remember ever leaving a scene in which Mickey Rooney, - "Killer Mears" knows that he must be executed and is approaching the moment of truth, he dances and cries, and laughs, he wavers from hesteria to euphoria and runs the bet of always emotion. I've never seen such a brilliant performance from any actor who lives or died, past or present. That's when I know for sure that Mickey Rooney, yes, "Andy Hardy" was and is an actor of great genius. However I kept it, my opinion for me for years thinking, surely I must be alone in this point of view. About 15 years after watching the film for the last time on television, I read the old Los Angeles Times question and answer section. The question was put to Lawrence Olivier, and the question was: "Mr. Olivier Are you considered one of the greatest actors of all time, who then consider yourself to be among the greatest actors?" His answer was "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney". I was stunned, but not surprised. I immediately returned to his "Killer Mears" and felt very good about seeing this great skill in him, and now I have my point of view supported by another work that I admired. Later, of course, there was "Bill" and many other great moments with Mikey Rooney. This film, "The Last Mile" should be seen by all the students who act. Frankly, I can't remember much about the movie after all these years, but Mr. Rooney will never leave me. If anyone out there remembers this movie like me? I would be interested to hear from you. For this photo engraved in my heart alone I gave a 10 right on the face of his performance.
