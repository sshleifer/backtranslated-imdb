The girl is using a formula well known as someone pointed out, however, I've seen a lot of movies that don't do well or that aren't credible. I believe that in the end it is easier for a woman to emphasize the character and in this way feel more touched by the film. <br /> <br /> the film is encouraging both mentally and physically even if your life and environment were completely different and, I think the viewer can still make a lot of money seeing this. although it took me 5 years to start boxing and sport in general, this is the film that gave me the spark. <br /> <br /> so the plot is familiar / common. the actors are good. but the thoughts that can sparkle is what makes it above average in my opinion. made a great impression on me and I know I'm not the only one.
