The plot does not begin to describe the film: a man is writing a film, or rather, * this * film. It is totally self referential to the point that you think it will fall back on itself like a black hole. The writer writes something and it happens, or something happens and writes about it. <br /> <br /> It is very philosophical, like "Waking Life" but more Zen oriented and, in this regard, much better, in my opinion. At some point there are personal interviews and then you see the shots of these people being filmed, and then you discover that their answers are written when you continue to flirt his jokes. There is beautiful scenery and optical illusions. <br /> <br /> I hope it is released on DVD, so I can watch it more carefully again. Seen at Cinequest (the San Jose Film Festival, CA) on 02/25/2002.
