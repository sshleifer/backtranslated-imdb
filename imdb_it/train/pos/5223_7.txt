It does not seem that this film has managed to satisfy many people. First of all, not many seem to have seen it in the first place (I stumbled upon it by accident), and therefore judging from the reviews and the evaluation, those who made many did not like it very much. <br /> <br /> Well, I did it. I usually tolerate Gere for his looks and his charm, and even though I don't consider him a great actor, I know he can drive me pretty well (I liked his Mr Jones). But this performance is all different. It's not cute in this, and it's not charming. His character is completely different from everything I've seen from him up to that point - old, ugly, destroyed, determined. And Gere, in what for me is so far his best performance ever, pulls him beautifully. I imagine it's a sign of how much an actor does his job if you can't imagine someone else doing it instead - think Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, or Washington as Alonzo in Training Day. That's how Gere was here. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast also went well for me. I guess I wouldn't have chosen Danes in this role, especially since I think he's too attractive for this. But actually he does an excellent job, keeping his with a Gere in good shape, which is no small feat. Strickland easily offers the best support action, in a part that requires considerable autonomy from her. Actually I think it owns the key scene with Gere and Danes, and that's a nice result. <br /> <br /> So what about the rest of the film, apart from some excellent acting? The story is perhaps not very surprising, some aspects of 8 mm, but adding the plot of the "rookie break veteran" to chi-dunnit, and also (like Silence of the Lambs) adding a sense of urgency by trying to save the girl and the imminent withdrawal of Gere's character. All of this is the background to the development of the two main characters, who help each other settle into their respective new stations in life. This is a lot to accomplish in 100 minutes, but it's done well, and we end up taking care of the characters and what happens to them. <br /> <br /> Management and photography were adequate. I could have done without modern video camera movements and cut, but then I'm an old brat, and it wasn't so bad, in fact I think it helped the atmosphere of the film, which like you might have guessed, on the whole he is not happy. <br /> <br /> To see.
