This is a beautiful, rich and very well made film with a rich and meaningful history. Basically, he tells how an old narrator needs to find an heir (male) to carry on his trade, but ends up not getting what he expected in his world dominated by men. The characters must therefore come to terms with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire as companion and heir and his traditional notions of society. <br /> <br /> The story is fun, emotional and complex. The exploration of the characters, their lives and their emotions, is rich and compelling, the character's development is strong while the characters are complex and not at all dimensional. The film expertly conveys the old man's emotions and his desire to find an heir, and shows convincingly how he and the child manage the situation. There is also humor, sometimes rather subtle, at appropriate points. The film also examines the good and evil of traditional Chinese culture, creating further interest and depth in the film. <br /> <br /> Direction, acting and scenery are all exceptional. Added to other strengths, this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling and real characters. As a result, the film evokes strong empathy and feelings towards the characters. Some have claimed that the ending weakens the film, but I don't necessarily agree. Perhaps he could have been stronger with a different ending, but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small.
