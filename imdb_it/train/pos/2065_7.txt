Timid Symmetry is a pleasant episode with some flaws. The first thing about the episode is that it takes place near the Home Air Force Base in the southwest of Idaho. The first "deep gorge" season takes place near the Ellens air base, also in southwest Idaho. I wonder if the bases of the air forces are one and the same, but they decided to use the real name in Fearful Symmetry. Mulder and Scully have a good dialogue, always an advantage. Ed Meecham, the zoo keeper, reminds me of the irritable old-school teachers. They must have loved children at once, you can't imagine how. Just like you must have cared for animals more at some point. I liked the concept of the episode, but I heard it had some inconsistencies. If aliens are so good at abducting humans and bringing them back safely, why can't they put the animal back in the right place? And are the aliens having trouble returning the animals? I don't buy Mulder's theory of a problem with the space-time continuum. As if he were an expert in this. I also thought that Jayne Atkinson's performance as Willa Ambrose wasn't well done. In addition to those nitpicks, I still liked this episode because of the intriguing concept of aliens that collect animal DNA and human DNA.
