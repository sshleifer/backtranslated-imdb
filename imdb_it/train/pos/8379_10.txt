I remember this film since I was 12, it was incredible ... I remember that for the day I didn't like the thing I saw then, I even tried to buy it but it's like a rocking horse sh * t! Anyway, the acting is a little rubbery, but the story is incredible considering it was a real B series movie with a low budget and events that the fight scenes were incredible to watch, I must have seen it about 20 times. It was a very well done film and I liked the idea of ​​fighting the robots controlled by the giant man, too bad they had to ruin it by disgusting "Crash and Burn", not watching that movie the way it is total pants! If you are a true fan of science fiction movies, look at this, if it had been redone today it would be a winner .. I would really like to see a remake or even publish the DVD of it.
