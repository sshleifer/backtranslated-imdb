OK. I'm biased. I live near Shrewsbury, England, where this wonderful film was shot. It still looks the same now. I remember turning around quite vividly here, and fake snow in the streets for days and days. Often when I walk to Shrewsbury, I see a street or a house and this will remind me of this movie. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott's Scrooge is a more realistic character than many other versions of the screen. His physical appearance is not the typical miser. Scott's is large and impressive. A man who finds himself inferior to be inferior. <br /> <br /> We all know the story and the quotes. The book is one of the most appreciated works in English. And I don't think there are many cynics who would say that people are not able to change and redeem. This film version portrays everything very well. George C. Scott could be American but plays the role of stingy English with wonderful skills. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you haven't seen this version, I strongly suggest you do it. Is it usually available for a small amount of money ... or are you too bad?
