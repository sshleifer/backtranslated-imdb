Why did I enjoy the show until the last episode? Because of the true talent Melissa Joan Hart and her supporting cast have shown that humor, comedy, light humor and deep thought could really coexist. What I liked best was the fact that I could go home after a hard day's work, and smile ... I was inspired ... and why? It was an inspiration to look at this magical person so happy while helping others. <br /> <br /> Sabrina was a hero in my opinion ... even though he was vulnerable in ways that weren't that different from ours ... very different; he had powers at hand, desires and command that could be used for better or for worse that can only exist in many of our imaginations. Most of everything we see, that we have, that we know, that we possess, or that we desire ... can be used for better or for worse, and how we choose to define it, define the person we are. <br /> <br /> He traveled all over the world and in other realms with these constant and indomitable ideas in mind ... to learn, to live, to laugh and to love. She was always learning how to improve her skills for the benefit of everyone around her; he made mistakes while he was living life, going through different paths of growth, like her, his aunts and Salem (the underrated but imperfect hero) did well to show that even through mistakes, you can still be noble, gifted it's wonderful. <br /> <br /> He also demonstrated many altruistic, learning and love actions as he walked along his path. If this is not enough reason for 10 stars in this war-torn world, where people are so hostile towards each other, without realizing how the differences are the spice of life rather than a reason to kill ... then I don't know what it is. This show was definitely a trip to a better world as well as an inspiration to be better ourselves and a gift destined to tear a smile on our chops ... I heard from a doctor before everything I mentioned above leads to a healthy "deer" ... and isn't that what we all need? :)
