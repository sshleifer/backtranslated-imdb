'They All Laughed' is a superb Peter Bogdanovich who is finally getting the recognition he deserves and why? There are many reasons why it is set in New York that really sets the tone, the fantastic soundtrack, the captivating star that turns from Ben Gazzara, and the late John Ritter who is superb. and of course no classic is complete without Audrey Hepburn. the film is a light and airy romantic comedy that is very much in the mood for a thirties comedy screwball, the film is essentially about the Odyssey detective agency managed by Gazzara who with his colleagues detective smokers and eccentric roller skating Blaine Novak (co- producer of the film) and John Ritter, in practice the Gazzara falls for the wife of a rich tycoon (Hepburn) and Ritter falls for the beautiful Dorothy Stratten who sadly murdered sadly after the production, 'They All Laughed is an essential vision for the fan of Bogdanovich.
