I went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. The place was quite full and we all laughed so much that it was easy to lose the lines. I knew it would be nice but it was a lot more fun than I thought. I liked both Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they looked really weird just like normal people, if that makes sense. I get sick of movies that show teenagers as people who love cookies, like "jock" or "geek" or "cheerleader" ... etc. Both characters were unique but still very human and fairly normal to relate to. I will recommend this film to all my friends and look forward to seeing it on DVD, go see this movie with your friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life! I'm going to see him again at the theater and I'm not going to see things more often than once.
