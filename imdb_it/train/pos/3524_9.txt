For the attention of Chuck Davis and Emefy: I saw PHANTOM LADY many years ago, when I was not yet a jazz fan. There is an exhibition that will go until the end of June in the brand new MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY in Paris, called LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, not to be missed, with a special NINE entertainment taken from jazz films, including PHANTOM's famous drum sequence LADY. I saw Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr - in almost all their film appearances, and I can confirm the following: 1. Elisha Cook Jr was DUBBED in the film. This was progress, since in most of his other appearances he was KILLED (mainly in THE BIG SLEEP by Howard Hawks). 2. Krupa probably nicknamed Cook in PL. I could recognize his style, since he had already graduated from the used (and abused) tom-tom at the beginning of his career - precisely in the SINGLE, SING, SING sequence of Hollywood of 1937 - and in the end he got everything it was possible from what we call in French "la caisse claire". 3. The sequence from PL, at least as shown in the Museum, is not censored. Harry Carasso, Paris, France
