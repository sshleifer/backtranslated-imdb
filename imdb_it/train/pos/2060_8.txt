This movie is not your typical horror movie. It has some rural humor and scenes of death that can be comic. I personally liked the film because of its off-beat humor. It's definitely not a super scary movie, which is good if you don't want to be scared and paranoid later. I really liked the performance of the hillbilly and Lester type ... very credible. I think I'll dye my hair red like that girl in Scarecrow - very beautiful! However, overall it is worth renting for the campy humor and the non-typical horror experience.
