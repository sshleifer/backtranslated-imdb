I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 13 years old. It left me speechless and in many ways it is still now. But I'm less inclined to see it as a precise historical piece now. There is a precious little effort to examine and interact with racism - and therefore fails to recognize that the most powerful weapon against racism is to understand it internally in those who commit it. What we get instead is a dichotomy - on the one hand, beko and woods in panoramic 3D rainbow view - on the other, the two-dimensional characters are portrayed as an unthinkable unrealistic evil. <br /> <br /> All this makes the film a great story, but it worries me that people see the representation as 'accurate'.
