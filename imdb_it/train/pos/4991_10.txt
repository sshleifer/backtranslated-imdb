It's a shame that this movie is so hard to get your hands on in the United States. I found it through a rare video merchant, and it was worth it. This is, without a doubt, the best film made during the pre-code era, and the best movie of the 1930s. The masterful director Frank Borzage has made wonderful films on the Depression, and with MAN'S CASTLE he has created a fairy tale among the difficulties of the time. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have a wonderful harmony between them, and help make this film a wonderful love story. Young Trina is sweet and full of hope, while Tracy's Bill is gruff and closed. The dynamic between the character creates one of the most difficult but ultimately gratifying relationships in the film. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the most soft-focus pre-code film I've ever seen. Borzage uses the vague and dreamy technique to transform the abusive village where Bill and Trina live in a palace. The difficulties of the Depression are never ignored, rather they are an integral part of the film. But since Borzage creates the film as a soft focus fairy tale, the love between the characters makes the situation less hard. Makes the film warm and affectionate. <br /> <br /> THE MAN'S CASTLE is the culmination of the pre-code era. If only more people could see it.
