"The Grudge" is a remake of the Shimizu series of famous Japanese horror films. Shimizu knows he has nothing to do with something new, so he does what any intelligent person would do in his place: forget logic and concentrate on giving viewers a fun ride. Use the commonly known clich√©s associated with ghost stories but Shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative way. Non-linear fiction is not a simple expedient, but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives. In the end, all I can say is that if the only purpose of a horror movie is to scare the audience (the way a comedy is to make people laugh), this film was successful with flying colors. I saw him in a theater with an audience and it was fun to see the audience go crazy about this. It probably doesn't sound as good in your living room.
