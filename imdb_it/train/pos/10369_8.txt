"A Cry in the Dark" is a masterly piece of cinema, disturbing and incredibly provocative. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who in 1980 saw a horrible spectacle, seeing her 3-month-old baby brutally taken away from their family's tent while camping in the outback of Australia. Azaria (the child) was never seen again, and the result of his horrendous disappearance caused a real frenzy of life all over the world. Meryl Streep makes immaculate justice to the role of Lindy, as always. But the only thing that helps "A Cry in the Dark" to never fall is the brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate perspective on this puzzling case, tears are brought to the eyes. The concept is no less than terrifying, and later you are left bewitched, but also inspired.
