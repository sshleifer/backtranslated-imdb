But on the contrary, sorry gem, I have completely understood how one can be dragged into a film because it relates to the subject (and one has it). This film is terrible, the main character would give any subtitler charlie brown a run for his money that he constantly mumbles and that is always a laugh, most of the scenes feel embarrassed with the characters more often than not looking at another with a look ... is your line now, so I will react. Best British comedy? Please friend, you have a strong word with your badness ... at the end of the day ... the sun sets ... and this movie is terrible. I mean well done for the people involved ... they made a movie ... and maybe motorcycle enthusiasts could be involved, but people who still live here on earth with a real sense of humor will struggle with this rather than smile at Christmas gifts were bought by them ... was it too hard? I'm sorry...
