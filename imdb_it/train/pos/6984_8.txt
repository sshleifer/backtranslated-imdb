I was amazed by the revisited Battlestar Galactica, a show that has always guessed me and made me cry on more than one occasion. A passionate fan of science fiction, I like to think I can choose the good things of BS, and this was a good thing. <br /> <br /> As such, when I heard about the prospect of a series of prequels a few months ago I had a sick feeling in my gut. I feared that the formula that would make Battlestar so effective would be reused in Caprica, which would not work at all. The history of BSG, of a lugubrious band of survivors, trapped aboard decaying starships and guided by a prophetic vision and a sequence of pseudo-miracles, was perfectly complimented by extraordinary music and a cast of better actors. <br /> <br /> Caprica feels different. Where BSG takes place after the fall of a great civilization, Caprica portrays that civilization in its cold and decadent apogee. The general atmosphere I had from Caprica was similar to that of Minority Report, minus the excessive and counterproductive theatricality. In pure BSG style, Caprica has already dealt with the themes of religious freedom, racism, the morality of interpreting God and the nature of the human soul in a few hours of programming. <br /> <br /> Casting for Caprica is also excellent. Each character is unique and profound, from the obsessive and distant scientist turned entrepreneur, to his tormented and obstinate daughter, every actor and actress launches into their respective roles. <br /> <br /> Music, which was so strongly used in BSG, also plays a significant role in Caprica. Battlestar's powerful rolling drums and lugubrious duduks served his themes very well. Caprica uses a more orchestral sound, which gives the show its own feeling quite distinct from both of its predecessors. <br /> <br /> The new Caprica is definitely a show of its own, which only takes out as much as it needs from the Battlestar franchise. I look forward to the complete series.
