Now, I've seen a lot of movies in my time, but from each one of them there have been a select few that have been really good to me. And I'm a 19-year-old man who is struck by this film aimed at a younger audience. This is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign films. Almost all the acting is believable, the graphics are decent (for which you don't even worry about watching the movie. Trust me, complaining about the graphics would be a stupid thing to do), the story is well written and it's a movie that everyone they can appreciate not only children. <br /> <br /> That's pretty much what this movie brought me to. This made me laugh ... a lot, two, made me feel for the characters like you, and three, it's a very uplifting story. At the end of this film you will feel good. Of course, as an anime out there he hasn't seen some kids turn into a great warrior and anything to defeat some great evil. It is a formula that is used a lot. But in this case it is forgivable because even if they use puppets for some characters and an average graphic that you would see 5 years ago, the aspect is not to judge. It is very touching, the finish is original and keeps you in the movie as it is supposed to. However, if you try to compare it with other films like "The Never-ending Story" or anything else will change your opinion. Watch it as it is and you'll like it. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I've been impressed in this way. The only other movie in which I had this feeling is when I saw the TMNT when it came out. There is something in this film that I heard about TMNT that really made me love. So don't go too far in analyzing or taking this movie too seriously, have fun.
