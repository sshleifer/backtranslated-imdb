A very well made film set in communist Yugoslavia in the early 1960s. The five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story offer strong, sincere and exciting performances. A clear representation of how the natural trust and ingenuity inherent in adolescents can be easily manipulated and how this has affected the rest of their lives. Highly recommended.
