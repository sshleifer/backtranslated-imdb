I just watched I. Q. again tonight and I forgot how much I love this movie. It is wonderfully fun and makes you feel that all is well with the world. I love the allusions to Mozart throughout the opening with "Einstein" playing the "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" violin on the violin humming Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during the Ed Walters IQ test. I like that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career, a particularly unique situation for the 1950s, the moment when this film is set. (I myself was a teacher but I stayed home to raise my children, so please don't think I'm a stubborn bookseller of women.) It's wonderful as a man who is "just a fat monkey" is finally seen as important and worthy as Catherine's boyfriend, a clinical behavioral researcher. The message to me is that we are not what we do, but who we are we are defined by much more - no labels. There are so many small gags and one-liners that are almost thrown away if you don't watch and listen carefully. <br /> <br /> I have captured some things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page. In the scene where Ed Walters speaks at the symposium, there are 3 instruments (goniometer, ruler, etc.) hung on the right on the chalk ledge. In the next shot, there is only 2. In the end credits of our video, list the character of Tony Shaloub as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti who shows up in the film and is listed here on Imdb. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. It can be a soft toy in some estimates, but it has many more substances than they give credit. Not only that, what a great cast has gathered here. Watch it and have fun!
