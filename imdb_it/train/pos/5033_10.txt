This is one of those films that, after watching it, you will continue to think and come back even months after watching. The acting is spectacular for having played two children (I usually hate movies with the acting of the kid). Bill Paxton is fantastic, his directorial debut is even better than what I expected from an actor whose most memorable line is "Game over, man! Game over!" (from the movie "Aliens"). <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is the dichotomy between those scenes in which the actors play a family and when they do their "work". Makes the film credible and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keep it up, Bill. I will wait for other films that I will surely love!
