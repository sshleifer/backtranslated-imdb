Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is treated cruelly by her evil stepmother and stepsisters. One day, a ball will be held in honor of the prince, but Cinderella has no chance of going, because her stepmother and stepsisters will not leave her. With the help of her fairy godmother and her animal friends, she is out for the ball, with the warning of going home by midnight. At the dance he meets the handsome Prince Charming. When the clock shows midnight, he runs home, leaving behind one of his glass slippers. With the help of his animal friends, his true identity is revealed. She and the prince later marry, and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Cenerentola, released 56 years ago, was a huge box office success and continues to fascinate audiences to this day. He has a well written script. The characters are memorable. The songs, including "A dream is a wish your heart makes", "So This Is Love" and the great "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo", help to tell the story. This has been my favorite growing film and has lost none of its appeal. A true Disney masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The recent DVD version is the best way to enjoy this film, including featurettes, deleted scenes, music videos, vintage radio programs and a restored print of the film!
