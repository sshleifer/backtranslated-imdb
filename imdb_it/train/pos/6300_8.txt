I loved this movie. I thought it would be easy to look at and easy to forget. I ran into it after seeing this to buy the DVD, but it wasn't easy to forget! <br /> <br /> The script is brilliant and the casting couldn't be more perfect. Every character has his moment, and I laughed a lot during this movie, the comic moment was perfect. <br /> <br />
