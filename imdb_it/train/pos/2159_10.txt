First, there is NO way in which the remake can be equally valid, because the Japanese company is very different from ours and plays such an important role in this film, as explained in the initial narrative. Adds to the humor and warmth of this film. There are a large number of different characters / support personalities. Everyone is part of making this movie wonderful. This film is full of comedy that is not at all as vulgar as most of today's "gross comedies". Yet he can still laugh out loud. The reality is that in real life you can't choose who you work with or go to school with ... etc. This film really emphasizes this and shows that the natural good in people can overcome small differences. Not to mention, it's a great secondary plot and a lot of humor. This is a story about dance that actually has a story, and a good one to that. There are some secondary stories that are not out of place, but actually support the main storyline. Really a well written film. The dance is also great. I happen to be a fan of any film with dances of any kind, for that aspect. However, this film goes beyond all others with dance, in the fact that, it is a story in the first place and seems to be written about dance in Japanese society. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
