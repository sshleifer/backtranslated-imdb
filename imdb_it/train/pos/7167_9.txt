I could not avoid commenting after reading the short comment "Not bad". This film is much better than not bad. The acting is stellar, even from the cast children, who do not act funny or anything, but act just like my son's friends. The film is intelligent and expects it to be also the public. The narrative lines with double flash are imaginative and contribute to the plot rather than filling the time. I saw this movie with my children and then I looked at it again just a few days later. If you have children and you are sick to death of films that inspire a diabetic coma with their syrupy sweetness, then take a look at "Buchi". My 6 year old loved it as much as my 11 year old son, and my husband and I enjoyed it as much as the two of them. How many movies can you say this?
