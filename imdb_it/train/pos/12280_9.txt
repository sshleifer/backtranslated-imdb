This is one of the few movies I've seen twice in the cinema. I love this film because of its atmosphere and its life story of the tragic hero Esteban Trueba. He makes many mistakes but has a chance of redemption. Isn't it a rather comforting thought? <br /> <br /> When I first saw it, I thought that after the election, the film would end - I didn't know the book. So the boy was wrong when the dramatic climax was yet to come! I was literally swept away by the sheer power of the last half hour of the film. <br /> <br /> Many people here do not like this movie. I can't understand a single bit of it. Perhaps those who read the book first are - as often with film adaptations of novels - simply disappointed that so many things have remained incalculable, invisible, inexplicable. But like a film that tells a touching story - the story of a family, the rise and fall of a man, a woman's deep compassion, the power of love and the madness of hatred (and conservatism) - this film is simply splendid! Furthermore, the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is also wonderful - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> So, definitely one of those movies for which cinema was invented!
