I saw it in the movies with my girlfriend at the time and I can say that I didn't have the best time especially because I didn't know about Ned Kelly or her story. <br /> <br /> But since this is a biographical film, it's important to at least know what to expect from the character. <br /> <br /> I don't know if the way events are told is true or if everything is fictitious. But the way Ned Kelly is portrayed as a hero and a justice fighter really makes me want to believe that everything is true. I don't think he's portrayed as a criminal or a redneck thief, but that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a solid Western-style movie for all tastes. Heath Ledger is fantastic as always and sexy Naomi Watts fascinates the screen. <br /> <br /> Give this film a chance if it goes on cable. Otherwise, I don't think I can recommend it.
