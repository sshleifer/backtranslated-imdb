Along with "King of the Rocket Men", this was still repeated on BBC TV in the early 1980s. If I was loading a time capsule from this period both series would surely have come in. <br /> <br /> Someone who looks at it for the first time will think it's silly, but this is one of the best examples of "magazines". Don Del Oro will make you laugh (when I was little, my nickname for him was Mr. Dustbin's head) and it was fun when he was shot he said "Your bullets can't hurt me", then he stumbles back, apparently less than happy . I also like the way he dispenses with Sebastian in the first episode. I looked at this again because I've had good memories of it for years, there are good stunts and good music, you have the ingredients you expect to include water, boulders, chariots on the run ... Apart from the first episode (with Ralph Faulkner) the game with the sword was not as nice as I remembered it, and yes it is characterized by the inevitable "flashback" episode! He gets 8 out of 10 because he still suffers from slow pace, padding and other tricks. If you are interested in these serials, I recommend William Witney's book, "In a door, into a fight, out a door, into a chase", although there is only a small entry on this series.
