David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson ... if it sounds strange to you, then you are right, because it is. <br /> <br /> People are known for their scripts with moral implications of what is right and wrong, the value of life, etc. He covered these problems in Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and in almost all his scripts there is something similar. <br /> <br /> Paul Anderson's first successful film was a violent thriller. Not surprisingly so they have all his other films! And here is a violent thriller with moral implications! <br /> <br /> The script of the peoples is quite evident in the first half of the film. Soldiers trained from birth, taught to kill and never had a normal life. They are replaced by better and genetically modified soldiers and Todd, one of the original soldiers, is left on a planet and left for dead. There he has to deal with a group of refugees, some want him to stay the others hate him and here there is an interesting drama. BUT THEN ... <br /> <br /> ... The bullets start flying as the new soldiers move around the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people. Violent and violent action follows and the screenplay of the Peoples turns into an Anderson action festival. It's hard to believe that the script was originally written that way, but the final product is better than I expected. Entertain, in some way, even if, let's face it, not much, stimulating and stimulating once the action starts. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: a lot of violence
