Goldeneye will always go as one of the most legendary games in VG history. There is no doubt about this. But this game, although very different, could very well be the modern Bond champion of his time. <br /> <br /> This was not a bond game based on material from another medium. This was completely new; script game. Which also had its own theme song! (it wouldn't be a bond without it, haha!) The gameplay was excellent, and if you're a fan of bond games or similar movies, you'll like it. <br /> <br /> Unlike some / many games, these cast members have retraced their characters, as opposed to fictitious game creations. Which gives it a more cinematic touch. With a very "bond" storyline, you feel like you're in the game as much as you're lost in a movie. <br /> <br /> Fun in all respects, from start to finish. Even after beating the game there is still a lot to do. With the ranking system and the unlockables to achieve, as well as its multi-player missions, this is a prominent game. Despite being rather old now, in the years of video games. It is still a good game that you can collect and play whenever you feel the need to get a little more Bond in your life. Even now just thinking about it, I put the theme song in my head. A cast so big and a well written plot. <br /> <br /> The story comes to life on the screen, almost as if the actors were in front of you, and it's just as fun as the game itself. Superb fact, in the true bonding fashion. Which can only be called Fantastic, Completely Fantastic. <br /> <br /> I have to go and launch this game now. If you haven't played it yet, you're missing out!
