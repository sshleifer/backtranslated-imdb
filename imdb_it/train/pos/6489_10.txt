I saw this series when it first came out in the 70s. I was 14 and I looked at my best friends in my house because my father didn't want to watch it. It has become a weekly ritual every Sunday, and like anyone else telling you that for two fourteen year olds watching a documentary in almost reverential silence must mean that it was something special. <br /> <br /> The extensive tour of the events of the Second World War makes it difficult to document a subject. Even the creators have broken it down into what they considered the most significant key events and dedicated an episode to each. Some episodes have covered long periods like "packs of wolves" that covered almost all the six years of the battle of the Atlantic. while the battle of Stalingrad had an episode unto itself. <br /> <br /> this documentary could not be realized today simply because most of the interviewees died. The list of significant players that appear offers an incredible view of the thought at that time. Anthony eden the foreign secretary, Carl Donnitz, head of the u-boats, Albert Speer, a confident architect and then minister of arms for Hitler. In one of the last episodes we see traudl junge, Hitler's secretary, who was with him in the bunker and it was for her that he dictated his last will and testament - he left the bunker after Hitler's suicide and fled through Russian lines. these and many others play an important role in the realism of the portrayed events. <br /> <br /> if I have any criticism The series is that the bletchly park code switches are not included, but the revelations of their part in the war emerged only after the series was made, so I can't blame the creators of the program. <br /> <br /> the opening titles and the music is magnificent, and the narrative of Lawrence Olivier gives a natural severity to the script. <br /> <br /> the best documentary series ever made? no doubt. unmissable
