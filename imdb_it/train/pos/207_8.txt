At first it looked like a boring comedy like The Odd Couple, but when I walked in it seemed like a really fun movie. The basically forgotten former comedians Willy Clark (winner of the Golden Globe and Walter Matthau nominated for an Oscar and BAFTA) and Al Lewis (Oscar nominated and Golden Burns George Burns) were an exceptional couple and they came back together to revive the sketch of the hospital for a TV show. Willy's nephew, Ben Clark (winner of Golden Globe Richard Benjamin) is confident that he can meet again without rancor for each other, how wrong he is. They can't keep going all the time, they are both forgetful, especially during the conversation, but in the end they do. She also starred Lee Meredith as Nurse in Sketch (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuise as Mrs. Doris Green, Al's Daughter, Rosetta LeNoire as Odessa, Willy's nurse and F. Murray Abraham's Space Muppets . I think the best part of the film is Burns who said that Matthau called him "a bastard bastard child". He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Set Design and Set Design, Best Screenplay, Screenplay Adapted from Other Material, was nominated BAFTA for Best Screenplay and Won the Golden Globe for Best Film - Musical / Comedy, and was nominated for Best film script. Very good!
