I had seen this movie in the 80s and I had almost forgotten it when I noticed that it was on TV again and I watched it. I remembered appreciating this little sleeper when I first saw it, and I liked it even more in second sight. <br /> <br /> All the actors, in particular Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest, and Jason Presson (like the twelve-year-old who feels responsible for the accidental death of his older brother), is superb. The film has a very genuine feeling - an understated, silent, and moving story of a family suffering from pain. The dialogue is scarce but significant, and the non-verbal recitation is exceptional. A bit like a simple rural version of Ordinary People without psychiatrists, but with equally impressive family dynamics. <br /> <br /> The Stone Boy is worth the time and emotional energy involved in watching it.
