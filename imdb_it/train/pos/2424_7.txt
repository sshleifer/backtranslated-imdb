Three crumbs take their rightful deserts after wasting their lives in greed, drugs, ego, and bad attitudes. Interesting and well done; this style of film always makes me think about where reality moves away and imagination takes over. Even though these people were the scum of the earth, I still felt sorry. They never really had a chance.
