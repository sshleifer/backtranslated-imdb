I've always been a big Cybill Shepperd fan since I saw his series a few years ago !! This film certainly shows it in its best light yet !! The film was played and played so wonderfully !! Every now and then he drops funny lines, just to make this film one of the best I've ever seen !! They all really do themselves out there !! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd, they really made the movie a reality! I also loved the little one where Mavis loses her wig and she almost dies when it falls to the ground !! This is the film at its best !!
