"The Odd Couple" is one of those films that far exceeds its reputation. People know, hum the theme song, complain about living with an annoying "Oscar" or "Felix" ... but they are underestimating the film without knowing it. It is not just a clean boy who lives with a sloppy boy; is a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce. It's also damn funny from beginning to end, but it's the kind of comedy that comes from realistic, stressful and simply horrible situations. Thus, some viewers have actually found the film a bit uncomfortable, but I think its verisimilitude is its strength. Besides, Matthau's bulldog's face just makes me throw up! My favorite one-mile country comedy.
