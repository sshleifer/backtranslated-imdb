What begins as a predictable and rather dull business is in the end quite fun and entertaining. "Right to Die" is not very suspenseful, but is more than compensated for with some extravagant pieces and above the top gore. <br /> <br /> Spoilers here: <br /> <br /> go to the Martin Donovan dead-on performance as one of the most despicable characters that has ever graced the screen. By playing the character in a large "secluded" way, you almost feel bad for the boy at the end, when his grandiose plan fails. Corbin Bernsen also chews the landscape by playing a not-so-good guy who gets his sweets. <br /> <br /> Fine Spoiler. <br /> <br /> Like a revenge from the dead right, "Right to Die" benefits greatly from its performers and is more than an OK way to spend less than an hour.
