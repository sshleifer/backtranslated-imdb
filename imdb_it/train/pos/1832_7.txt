I saw two movies over the weekend, one was "kaal" and the other "Waqt". Both films are made in "Bollywood" but are worlds apart. The fundamental difference is the story and the director. Vipul Shaw made his indelible mark with "Ankhen", one of the best Hindi comedy films. His Casting of the Charecteres is perfect. The story apparently based on a Gujerati Play is fantastic, the treatment is superb with some exceptions. In Bollywood, when a movie is put together, the first thing a Bollywood director is inclined to do is sign up with a music director and this guy (mediocre Malik in this case) is forced to play six songs to fulfill his contract. So even a good director like Vipul Shah must use them to appease Finacier and his grandmother who can't get enough of these numbers. No music director can churn out good songs without stopping as clearly evident in this film. None of the songs have a melody and are clearly intrusive to the narrative of the story except for the background music and the westernized version of Bharat-Natyam. The duel and the role of father and son is a good acting of Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. His acrobatic scenes are clearly exceptional. A good director surrounds himself with good actors and is willing to wait for a good story to arrive as in this super movie. Then we have an insipid and classless economy manufacturer like Sharukh Khan who will stoop to shamelessly connect and promote garbage like "Kaal" to get rich at the expense of improving Art, and surround themselves with borderline talent, and recover the investment before the word goes around. These are the Bollywood locusts that prey on the unexpected audience to get the "Film Farce" awards from Bollywood Chamcha and many of them are in the media.
