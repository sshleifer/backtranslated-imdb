I should say that this is the first-class romantic comedy I've ever seen. it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together, there was still nostalgia and waiting. the thought that maybe they won't join ... after all it's an independent film. this film was well written, directed and performed. the dance on the side of the street scene was magnificent.
