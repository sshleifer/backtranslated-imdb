Forget the depth of meaning, leave your logic at the door and have fun with this incredibly manic, totally absurd and ultra-campy "live action" comic. MYSTERY MEN is a broadcast of every superhero hit you have ever seen, but its unlikely super-aspirants are so interesting, varied and well made that they are memorable characters in all respects. Dark humor, reckless nonsense, good faith action, and even a couple of moving moments combine to make this comic fantasy about lovable losers a real winner. The comedic talents of the actors playing Mystery Men - including a Mystery Woman - are perfect for Wes Studi as what can only be described as a Yoda-based deal, and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most out of the world. the wall villains (and bizarrely fascinating) who have never flipped through the pages of a Dark Horse comic book and on the big screen. Get ready to laugh, cheer and say "eh?" more than once .... have fun!
