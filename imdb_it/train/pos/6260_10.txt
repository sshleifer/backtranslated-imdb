This provoked the soul! I am Iranian and I live in the 21st century, I did not know that such large tribes lived in conditions similar to my grandfather's time! <br /> You see that today, or even in 1925, from a part of the world a woman or a child could have everything for him or her, clean and on-demand, but here 80 years ago, people ventured into their life to go somewhere with more grass. It is really interesting that these Persians endure those difficulties in finding pastures for their sheep, but they lose many sheep on their way. <br /> <br /> I praised the Americans who accompanied this tribe, they were as strong as the Bakhtiari.
