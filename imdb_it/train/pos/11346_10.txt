I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and the talented Jack Wild and now even my daughters love Jack Wild fans. This film is exactly what the film should be: fun and entertaining. This film is not limited to children. Much of the dialogue is directed at adults and Witchiepoo's performance is something you don't want to miss. The music of this film is perfect for Jack Wild and Mama Cass. And as a Jack Wild fan, I will never miss the chance to watch him dance or hear him sing. Knowing the hard life that Jack had now makes this movie even more wonderful especially when he sings the opening song "If I Could". It makes me stop in loving adoration for him for giving me splendid childhood memories that I am now transmitting to my children. We all go to Living Island where there is friendship and fun! And keep Jack Wild's memory alive by having Pufnstuff pass on to the others.
