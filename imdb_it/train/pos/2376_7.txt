All the people who review this film and probably many professional film reviewers simply don't understand. This film was made with sequences of mats and artistic techniques similar to those of the great Czech filmmaker, Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you take one of the Zeman films, like Jules Verne's The Fabulous World, Baron Munchausen, Journey to the Beginning of Time or On The Comet. If you are unable to locate a movie, read the reviews in AMG. They will explain the processes used. If you look at Zeman's work and try to compare it with any of the other fantasy science fiction films of the time, probably not even the spectators would have achieved the result. It is not fair to compare one of these director styles with the standard technologies of the day, because both Zemen and Hines "don't calculate". They have a style that is unique to them and should be judged only for their creativity. If you look at this film from a perspective in which YOU KNOW that he intentionally tried to create a pastiche collage mixed with live action, you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterly job. It is not easy to make a flow of computer clippings. I thought that even the creatures were pretty good, considering also how they were made. Hines made a big bet, and I think his film won't be judged enough for years to come. Someone who promoted the film should have diverted the public from what they would have seen, rather than letting them blindly go into the theater expecting the usual CG job. As for the actors, I think Hines also took a page from Zemen's book, as many of Zemen's actors were somewhat inexpressive at first, but they became much more engaging as the film and action progressed . I'm really glad to have this movie in my library. I'll watch it for years to come, all three big hours.
