Apparently Ruggero Deodato understood, at the beginning, that his story would not have worked if he had approached too seriously, so he decided to camp. The result is a film that can be seen as a ridiculous sword and witchcraft epic or as a very funny comedy! And I think I'll go the second way. The short moments of gore are well done, the Paul Brothers openly play around with the material (they even bark at one another in a scene!), And there is also a charming, lively, good-natured performance by Eva La Rue, like the girl who labels herself with the "boys". Also, where else can you see the inside of a dragon lit up like a nightclub ?? (***)
