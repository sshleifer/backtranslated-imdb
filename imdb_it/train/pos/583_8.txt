Two brothers grow up in a small town in Montana. One of these is Norman (Craig Sheffer), the other is Paul (Brad Pitt). Their father is Reverend Maclean and they grow up with his religion-related lessons and fly-fishing lessons. In this film fly fishing represents life, a little. <br /> <br /> The story is good and keeps your attention even if there are some moments when you need some action. Probably the film has this moment because it doesn't really concern the events that happen, but the message. But some things happen. Norman goes to Dartmouth to study. After six years he returns and gets involved in a beautiful girl named Jessie (Emily Lloyd) and is invited to teach in Chicago. Paul became a journalist and is known as the "fishing journalist". He is famous and seems to have a good life, but he drinks a little too much and plays too much. <br /> <br /> The film is very well directed, has a beautiful soundtrack and all the actors are fine. The most beautiful thing about this film is cinematography. The mountains, the woods and the river all look very beautiful. If the film was made just for these things, it was good enough to watch. Fortunately, there's more.
