This is a moral comedy, so occasionally a slight touch of bitterness occurs, but a lightness softens all sarcasm and irony flows until all of a sudden a moment stops your heart and changes everything. <br /> <br /> This film, wonderfully written and directed, is a gem that sparkles perfectly, with a beautiful acting by everyone. Jean-Louis Trintignant is exquisite as usual and Romy Schneider is a pearl, perfect and luminous, not to be missed. A truly wonderful film !!
