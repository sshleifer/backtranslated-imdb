David Duchovny plays the main role in this film. Now many people, after discovering that this fact, didn't even bother to watch it. Very unfair, to put it mildly. David has made a name for himself on the x-files and is a decent actor. The dott. Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a drug addict affected by negligence. By pure chance he becomes a private doctor for the criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom. However, the FBI is interested in using Eugene to trap Blossom. Angelina Jolie is in the supporting role of clare, the gangster moll. Performs in a solid performance. Timothy Hutton on Blossom is superb and immerses himself deeply in his character. Duchovny himself is not as bad as many people would think and in the end I would consider his credible interpretation. His familiar and monotonous tone and his serious face are present but does not distract too much from the film
