My personal opinion is that this movie didn't have a real vampire plot for the first john carpenter, but I don't care if he LOVED me. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was exceptional in this film. It really drove me crazy believing he was the person you never thought was a famous ROCKSTAR. There were some bad things about this movie. Like the plot, it should have been more to the film. It had to be a sequel to the film that followed the plot of the film and should have kept the same main characters in all three vampire movies. I really liked the clothes that people wore and the setting they chose in Mexico. I liked how old Mexico was and not New Mexico. with clay houses and old fashion churches. I was a bit confused with vampires and how they were able to walk in churches but it was nice how they didn't follow the rules of Dracula's vampires.
