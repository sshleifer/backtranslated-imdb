Although far beyond the target audience, I've always had a soft spot for YA fiction, so I was naturally intrigued by Nancy Drew's return to the screen. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie. The central mystery involving a long-dead actress is presented in simple and simplistic terms with flashes of danger for young investigators. Nancy and her friends never take threats seriously, so the young viewers won't be upset. <br /> <br /> What I really liked about the story is that the final results were pretty serious and significant and Nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience. <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is as fantastic as Nancy Drew and I hope we will see her in another mystery.
