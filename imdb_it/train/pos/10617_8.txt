The stunning Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a television journalist who travels with her crew (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) to Solvang, California, to cover a Danish festival. The problem is that their homes have collapsed and all the hotels in the city are full. So they travel out of town to a remote place and take advantage of the seemingly friendly hospitality of Ernest Keller (a phenomenal Sydney Lassick). You wouldn't know, Ernest and the gentle companion Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) hide a big secret in their cellar: pitiful, deformed, "Junior" diaper (Stephen Furst, in a remarkable performance) that eventually terrifies the girls. <br /> <br /> A delightful Lassick plays the real monster in this haunting horror movie. It builds slowly but surely in an intense confrontation / climax, freeing the horror in small doses up to the final half hour. The hotel and the cellar of omens - big echoes of "Psycho" here - are great settings. Above all, the perverse plot involves incest and parricide, allowing the film to take on a truly obscure quality. Yet it also becomes moving when we realize that Junior is not a bogey scarecrow, but a victim as much as girls. The last shot is particularly sad. <br /> <br /> "The Unseen" is a small horror film worthy of being discovered. <br /> <br /> 8/10
