This film is a classic not to be missed. It is not perfect, certainly. The rhythm, perfect for the stage, is in the form of a slow movie like a turtle with arthritic knees. Jean Seberg is ill-advised to be too sweet and too kind. Fully show enough talent, skill and acting skills to convincingly interpret the intelligent, passionate and confident Joan, but unfortunately the director missed the point of the character. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright. In no other game his dialogue was clearer, nor the more musical lines. However, the processing of this film requires that you look at it as a lawyer. This film is a case and the viewer is the judge. This is how you can enjoy this image. 7/10.
