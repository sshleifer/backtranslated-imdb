This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I agreed to watch a chick movie and some how it ended with this. I had never heard of it or anyone (except Mike of Friends). <br /> <br /> But it's great! Eva, Lake and Paul give incredible performances. Humor is constantly dry and witty. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd plays the character of Mike (which works great). The other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formidable (I mean we're not talking about 'Apocalypse Now' here) But the characters are nice, the story is compelling, the soundtrack, the production and the direction all work well. <br /> <br /> In all a fantastic film that really deserves much more credit than it gets. <br /> <br /> Everyone has their tastes but I really don't understand the reviews of a star for this.
