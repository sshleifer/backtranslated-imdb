DeMille's original film was made in 1938 with Frederic March. A really good movie. The love for Hollywood remakes gives us a fairly interesting film starring Yul Brynner. Obviously he was brilliant, almost always in all his films. Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson was a stroke of genius. However, the film has tended to be a bit long in some places. It doesn't move to the rhythm of the 1938 version. Still, it's a funny film that should be seen at least once.
