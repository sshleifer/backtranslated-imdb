They are on the opposite side of the previous comment. <br /> <br /> First of all, I don't think this was intended as a sequel to "The Jerk". I mean, it's not called "The Jerk 2" ... it's "The Jerk, Too", which leads me to believe that while many of the characters are the same, it actually revolves around a completely different person. /> <br /> Think about it: practically no connection to the previous film, apart from the names of the characters; a completely different story; different cast; and the fact that it is a partial musical. <br /> <br /> I say give a little credit to this movie. He has a lot of laughs in it .. Mark Blankfield at his peak.
