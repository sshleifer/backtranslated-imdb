Two years ago I saw "The Matador" in the cinema and I liked everything about this movie. Obviously, I was totally impressed by the magnificent role of Pierce Brosan. Yesterday I filmed this movie on TV, so I looked a little deeper. Now, I can say with certainty that this film is not so special but you just have to "love it for a man. <br /> <br /> Brosnan raises his opinion in my opinion with the extraordinary performance of Julian Noble, a tired killer who does not have friends. Julian soon meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City, an unlucky man: his son died in the accident, his job is not going so well and he is not sure he can support his wife Bean (Hope Davis). br /> <br /> I've always liked films like this, a crime film with a great touch of humor, mostly that humor comes from Brosnan while he tells jokes about dwarves with a big d ... or one of the my favorite jokes in this film: "I look like a prostitute in Bangkok on a Sunday morning, after the left-wing city of the marina." Brosnan says this with his charm while drinking his margarita as usual. I also like the typical American face of Greg 'Kinnear as the loser who is very much there vace, because there are many people like Danny Wright. <br /> <br /> So I suggest you look at Brosnan's best role ever. It will make you smile and admire it at the same time. Great Brosnan in a film not quite as beautiful.
