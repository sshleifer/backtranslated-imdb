Every time I watch this movie, I'm more impressed with the entire production. I have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made. All concerned are perfect; script, acting, direction, set and editing. While James Stewart can always be invoked for a good performance, and the supporting cast is magnificent, it is Margaret Sullavan who reveals which undervalued actress he was. His tragic personal life gives intensity to his qualities as an interpreter in which the ability to play comedies is not easy to obtain. Lubitsch managed to get the best and obviously did his best. Look at the number of scenes that were made in one shot: breathtaking.
