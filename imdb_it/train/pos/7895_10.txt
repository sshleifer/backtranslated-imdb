In the opening scenes of this film a man shot arrows in his hotel room in another man's bathroom and turned off all the lights. This must have been very hep for 1936, but rather way out and had nothing to do with the movie, Robin Hood did not make an appearance as far as I could see. However, Bette Davis (Daisey Appleby), "The Whales of August", '87 was very young and attractive and played one of his best roles in a long career in Hollywood. Daisey never stopped teasing or being very sexy with her nightgowns and the so-called swimsuit on her yacht with George Brent (Johnny Jones), "The Spiral Staircase", '46. Daisey even proposed marrying Johnny with a Ferris wheel upside down and even had a black eye. Davis and Brent made a great couple, one to be very rich and the other a very poor journalist. Offstage, Davis and Brent were having a real torrid love affair, which is a good reason why there were sparks when these two appeared in this movie. If you liked Bette Davis and George Brent, this is the movie for you!
