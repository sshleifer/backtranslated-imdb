The Class Lampoun's Class Reunion is a classic comic movie from the early 1980s that combines unique characters, lots of laughter and great Chuck Berry music. When Walter Bailor is utterly humiliated by his high school classmates, he takes the opportunity to take revenge for his class reunion. One after the other, he chases his classmates who include an innocent blind girl, a fat and horny boy, the beauty of high school, the king of all preparations and even the ugly old lady of the lunch who served the crumbs to all the children during high school. This film has some sort of scary element in it and has some brief sexuality scenes, so I wouldn't recommend it to young children, but it's a great movie for teenagers. If you are looking for a movie with a beautiful soundtrack, complex characters or special killer effects you may not like Class Reunion. If you want to sit for 90 minutes and enjoy some good laughs and lots of fun (and who doesn't), this movie should be in your movies to see the list. ++
