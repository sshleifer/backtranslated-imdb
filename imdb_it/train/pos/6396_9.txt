Do you think you had any difficulties? You should take a look at this movie. Carl Brashear is the epitome of courage and determination. What this man had to go through to become an underwater sailor, should be an inspiration to us all. And significantly, after watching this movie, I learned that what is shown is not even half! Cuba Gooding, Jr. does some of his best work to date as Brashear. De Niro, as usual, is as good as the southern redneck who trains him. George Tillman in only his second feature film (after "Soul Food"), made a leap in quality as a director. If you want to be moved and inspired, you should definitely take a look at it.
