Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is a wonderful film in general. The combination of animation types is unique, the plot is amazing and the music is wonderful. <br /> <br /> The animation designed is a peculiarity of many animations. As the characters have expressed, especially the horses, through their animation they are particularly spectacular. While the way horses communicate through body language is easy to understand, many children and people who have not studied horses may not understand. Without words, I imagine that it should be difficult to express them through the features. For this reason, I understand the "eyebrow" they added to the horses (while the real horses don't have those big lines). One of the few things I noticed about the habits of horses that might have been portrayed strangely is that the Spirit guided his mother's pack. In the herds of wild horses, the main stallion usually hunts young foals out. <br /> <br /> Also, while some people might think of portraying white army officers while the "bad guys" are stereotypes, think of all the movies that Native Americans have been portrayed this way. Sometimes then; they treated the mustangs very badly. For example, in real history, the Appaloosa breed was almost wiped out by army officers. Imagine what would have happened to one of the most beloved horse breeds in the world if Native Americans had not saved them. <br /> <br /> I think it's incredible how realism hasn't been taken away by making the horses talk to each other. The feelings of the spirit were expressed by some narration, but mainly through music (by Bryan Adams). The songs express the story very well, and Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams did a great job telling the story through melodies and lyrics. <br /> <br /> The excitement I had watching the film, both the first time and the twentieth (yes, I saw it so much), you wouldn't believe it. Some scenes take your breath away, while others seem to force tears into your eyes. The opening sequence, which shows Spirit's homeland, immediately takes you to spectacular action. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why some people are so hateful about this brilliant movie. Overall, I consider it a 10/10 - a must-see.
