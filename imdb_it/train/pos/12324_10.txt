This movie is incredible. With great characters, especially the old swordsman who can fly in the shape of a fireball and jump through the trees, this film tells a classic story of battle between good and evil forces. The final showdown is particularly breathtaking and the music is quite beautiful. <br /> <br /> Very, very recommendable. Not for younger children though. This deserves a 10.
