I wanted to see Valentine since I saw that there were Denise Richards and Marley Shelton because they had played in some of my favorite movies of all time. When I saw Valentine, I was stunned by the size of the plot. It kills me to see that it has a low score because it's not horrible at all. The actors and actresses played the parts beautifully and the way he finished was so brilliant and clever. Some scenes were a bit far-fetched or poor, and I admit that in some minor parts it was a bit boring, but overall it was fun and full of suspense. He had an intriguing plot that made you guess everything and doesn't deserve all the shit he gets. I recommend this movie to watch it at any time, but especially on Valentine's Day because it will surely give you a lot of thrills. Oh, and don't even pay attention to the trailer or evaluation, please, DON'T ...
