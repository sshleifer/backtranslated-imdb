I didn't read anything about the movie before watching it, by chance, last Saturday night. And then, as I looked at him, I felt the pain of Lena and Boesman in my bones. I was so fascinated by the acting and the tone and the shots that I only partially heard in the dialogues. My husband fell asleep shortly after we went to bed and didn't sleep under the impact of the movie. I wanted to wake him up only to say: "if I ever voted for an Oscar nomination, it would be for these two actors". I decided to wait until the next day. Then I read more about the film on IMDb, and it was sad to learn that Mr. Berry died before the film was released and he probably never saw the latest version of his brilliant masterpiece. I still want to tell him that for me his film was a true independent film, in its concept and in its spirit. The actors must be praised not only for their brilliant performance, but for having accepted a part without luster, without showing, indeed, showing the true image of human depression. Sad but moving.
