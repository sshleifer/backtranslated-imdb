Since Keifer Sutherland plays my favorite character in TV history, it was a foregone conclusion that I was going to the movies and spending $ 15 for it. I think this also applies to Eva Longoria fans. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a leak that a secret service agent is planning to assassinate the president. As the investigation unfolds, it seems that the only likely candidate is the highly decorated Pete (Michael Douglas). Pleading for innocence, Pete continues the fun and fugitive style to find the truth. <br /> <br /> It is solid, but certainly not spectacular. A decent cast, a decent story but it left me a bit empty, but surely you could do a lot worse.
