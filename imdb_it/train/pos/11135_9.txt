What makes Midnight Cowboy a successful film is the way Joe Buck becomes tied to Ratso Rizzo through a series of difficulties that affect them both. There are not many glimpses of hope in this film for both characters, but the harsh reality that haunts them both gives the film its own kind of optimism that these men can at least find humanity inside each other. <br /> <br /> This film features the best performances of Jon Voight and probably also of Dustin Hoffman. The rest of the cast is composed of strangers, although it is complemented by a beautiful series of actors, including the cowpoke on the bus at the beginning of the film. Also, for those interested, Andy Warhol's apprentice, Paul Morrissey, briefly introduces himself during the party scene. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, it's essential. Check it out.
