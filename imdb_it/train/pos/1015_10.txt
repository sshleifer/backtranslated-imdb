I wait for every new episode, each one taken up with anticipation! The new look of science fiction created by Stargate SG-1 is a wonder that I hope will never end. Combining the past with the future is a new twist that fascinates me. Season n. 9 should be a thrill in itself. I wish Richard Dean Anderson would show up more often in the new season, because I love his spirit as dry as his outbursts of anger in his character like Jack O'Neill. The other characters add their uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner, season after season. Cancel this program in the next three years and make a serious mistake. Furthermore, you need a more important role for Asgard: they are simply too beautiful.
