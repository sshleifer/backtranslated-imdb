I just watched the movie two days ago, and I was filled with expectations, as Paris is my second favorite city in Europe and I spent 18 very romantic months in the 1980s. I was a little disappointed that most of this group of cartoons, although original and artistically done, did not capture the "light" and beauty of the city very well. Not enough of romance! We didn't see any of the tree-lined streets ... There was too much darkness, not just literally but figuratively. Some plots have manipulated the observer that seemed, and left him "flat" (the sequence Marais, the committed sequence of combing, to give two examples). The best edifying: the sequence of the Mime, the cemetery, the Montmartre (even if it left too much space for the viewer to understand), the cartoon "Cowboy" and the Sacre Coeur - they seemed few and far between, and I would have liked to have seen an actor as wonderful as Orlando Bloom being in something that would show his originality more.
