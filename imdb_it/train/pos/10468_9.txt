Monstervision was a show I grew up with. From late night hosting with Penn and Teller to the one, the only one, Joe Bob Briggs. The show kept me awake Friday night in my high school years and provided me with some of the best drive-in memories for never getting out of the drive-in. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the best late-night television ever. If you didn't get up, you were missing out. <br /> <br /> I know that John Bloom and Joe Bob live, but I want them back where they belong ... MONSTERVISION! Question ... did anyone else attend all 4 hours of "The Swarm"? q :) <br /> <br /> Viva Monstervision!
