I've always enjoyed seeing Chuck Norris in the film. Although the acting may not be exceptional, the fight scenes are fantastic. I also enjoyed seeing Judson Mills perform next to him. In my opinion, the Norris brothers proved to be excellent entertainers and this was another good production! I hope you have time to watch this movie!
