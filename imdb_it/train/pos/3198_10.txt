This is what I felt while watching this movie. I loved it. It was fun. But I felt like I was sneakily looking into someone's psyche and then laughing as he turned to make an interesting point. A friend says: <br /> <br /> "I feel like I walked into someone's house and is looking at their horrible home videos without their knowledge." <br /> <br /> Another of those facts is stranger than fiction films. "Groovin 'Gary", the original "Beaver Kid", is a boy from a small town who shows up at a nearby TV station hoping to film - and certainly he does, though perhaps not, as he initially expected. With great hopes of fame and significance, he invites Harris to come and film a truly horrific search for talent that he organized in his hometown, with the title "Olivia Newton-Don". <br /> <br /> The director, Trent Harris, does a brilliant job with this evolving story. Some shots of a clumsy child who wants to be someone turns, in two successive reinterpretations, into the history of freedom from sexual identity repressed in small America. Harris simultaneously criticizes the attitude of the small American city, the cult of celebrity and the practices of exploitation of the film and television industry. Both Sean Penn and Grispin Glover extract their stunning performances. a young Sean Penn is the most evocative - so closely he follows the current "Gary movie", but with strong nuances given to push the sense of interaction in the way Harris wants it to go. <br /> <br /> In the end the naive naivety of the original Gary is what moved me - when it is in contrast with these possible interpretations of his situation. <br /> <br /> A movie not to be missed. I haven't seen anything like it. <br /> <br /> Jacob.
