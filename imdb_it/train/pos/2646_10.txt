I think most people don't have the right idea of ​​the film, at least that's my opinion. I'm not sure it's a film about drug abuse; rather it is a film about the way of thinking of those genius brothers, drugs are side effects, something marginal. Once again, it is not a commercial film that you see every day and if the author wanted it, it has certainly failed, as many think it is one of the many films related to drugs. I, however, think that something else is the case. As in many films that portray different cultures, the public usually fully understands the films that portray their own culture, that is to say something they have grown up with and are quite familiar with. This film is to show what those "brilliant" people think very often and what problems they face. The reason they behave this way is because they are bored by their mind :) They have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept those things as if they were launching space shuttles on a daily basis. They start a fairly hard job and excel in a short time. They feel like - I went to work, I didn't do anything, I still made twice as many people around me as they were around their projects, what should I do now with my free time. And what's more boring? When you can start predicting behavior not because you're a psychologist, but because you've seen this model in the past. So, for them, on the one hand it is a non-binding job, which at times is also quite boring, and on the other they begin to understand people's behavior. It's a recipe for great big boredom. And the stupidest things are usually done to get out of this state. They have already said that their biggest problem is that they are trying to understand life in terms of logic (mathematics describes logic), while life is not really a logical thing, in reality it is absolutely right.
