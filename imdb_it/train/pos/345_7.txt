The first hour of the film was for the most part boring to say the least. However, it improved later when Valentine's Day began. Apart from the plot twist of the murderer's identity at the end, the hot bath murder scene is one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this film. The garden scene with Kate was well shot and so was the last scene (the "twist"). In those scenes, there was a certain suspense and chills and the scene of the hot bath murder had an ugly (the way the woodcutters had to be) in front of it. The previous murders are frustrated and bloodless.
