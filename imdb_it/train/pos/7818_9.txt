I think the context of the story was covered by other posters, so I would just like to write about the impact this film has had on me. I first saw this film in the year of its release in 1987. My school organized a trip to the cinema to see it, for a RE project I believe. We all went naturally excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema! We didn't know what we were about to experience. To this day I still remember the feelings he aroused in me and I remembered that I cried as much as most of my friends were. I think at the age we were we found him shocking and calm rightly outraged in our youthful way. It had such an impact on me that I joined the Anti Apartheid Movement in the same year. <br /> <br /> I think it was useful in my case.
