I watched this movie on DVD yesterday and was stunned and stunned. DDL's continuous acting just drove me crazy, and I was surprised by the whole cast and its superb acting. The whole character was so authentic to me, I really got DDL for Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker for her mother. Go see it! You would cry your heart, but you will live a wonderful catharsis! Furthermore, it teaches you an important lesson: determination is everything. You could be a cripple in the Dublin suburbs, but when you're stubborn enough you won't have any problems. If you can only get your left foot working, you're still pretty good at being a painter or a writer. The worst thing you can do when you're mentally challenged is to indulge in self-pity. It will not get you anywhere and the only person who will have mercy on you will be yourself.
