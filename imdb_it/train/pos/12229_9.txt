For me there is something so attractive and nostalgic in low-budget science fiction. As a child in the 1950s that's all there was. In 1957 I saw "The first man in space" in a cinema with my father. He had Marshall Thompson starring and some other poor slob who got the lead role. It is also a space mission that went wrong where the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer. I frightened good and good right from me. The memory of those heebie-jeebies still lives inside me. The Incredible Melting Man is almost a re-make only in glorious colors ... ie wherever the scenes were well lit. You just have to love him for what he is ...... a little over an hour of badly lit scenes, disgusting noises and that disturbing music. Good boy!
