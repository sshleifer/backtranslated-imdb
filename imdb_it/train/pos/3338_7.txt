Fever Pitch is a pretty funny movie. It has many funny moments (including a hilarious and disturbing shower scene). Like most romantic comedies, it has a "dead zone" in the middle where all the heavy, "she's breaking up with me" happens, but other than that it continues to be fun until the end. <br /> <br /> Even if the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the Red Sox, it is not overloaded with sports. You don't have to be a fan to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course it's easy for me to say: I've been a Red Sox fan since I was a kid myself. <Br /> <br /> 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Barky
