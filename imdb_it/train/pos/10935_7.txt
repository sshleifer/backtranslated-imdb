Well, I have to say that this was a really fun movie. Despite the fact that dubbing was pretty bad, and there were some strange moments when the movie seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason, I wasn't disappointed. The story was actually quite interesting: the last member of the Poison Clan has to track down the other five members and find out who among them is using their skills for evil and who is using them forever. The problem is that during training, all the clans were masked, and since then everyone has returned to society in disguise and changed their name. <br /> <br /> Fighting is a joy to watch, like any member of the poison The clan has a different fighting style: toad (my favorite), snake, scorpion, lizard and centipede. The fighting scenes have the actors jumping all over, and luckily the camera remains planted and uses a fairly large shot so that you can clearly see all the action. <br /> <br /> The only drawback of the film is that the plot tends to drag a little in the first half until the first fight sequence. But remain faithful and you will not be disappointed!
