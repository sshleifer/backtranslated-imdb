This and "Her Pilgrim Soul" are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of Twilight Zone. As I said in my comment on the new series, there is something missing in this new series. Perhaps they emphasize too much the lesson to be learned. He's a little more sloppy and sentimental than Serling's version. However, this episode can also be considered rather sentimental. I think the appeal is that, regardless of what they do, lovers can never come together. I remember not being surprised by the Korean movie "Il Mare" (later turned into "The Lake House".) I think it was because I saw this episode before, so it ruined the impact of the next movie.
