I took this movie in my local movie channel, and I really enjoyed watching the movie. It has all the elements of a good movie for boys, and more - this film, besides dealing with relationships between men and women and the like, also deals with the problem of steroid use by young people. <br /> <br /> The film has that feeling of real life - without loud music, without special effects and without outrageous scenes - which, for this film, was right. This feeling makes it easy to relate to the characters in the film - some of whom we probably know from where we live. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good movie, fun to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
