Considering all the teen movies like "the Breakfast Club" and "Pretty In Pink" that are lionized. It is surprising that this is so ignored. <br /> <br /> There is no sex in it, but we think about sex, including the idea that it may matter what others think about it. Children do not always get along with their parents, but neither parents nor children are seen as always right or wrong, and parents are not seen as monsters. <br /> <br /> It deals with the adoration of the hero. Like a girl she does a dangerous thing, which could have led to a real pulverizer, before realizing she was wrong. <br /> <br /> The film is a little ahead of its time. A child asks another child what birth control he uses. He says he is not doing anything he needs birth control for. She replies (wrongly) "oral sex".
