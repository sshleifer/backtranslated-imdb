Gandhi, my father, is like seeing a book, read it chapter by chapter (with your eyes) and learn more about Harilal Gandhi and, in this regard, about Kasturba Gandhi. So little is known about both and this film uniquely describes them. The title is misleading, but it's so much a film about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son, as about Harilal and his mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayya do full justice to their respective roles. <br /> <br /> These films are like leap years. They come after only so long. <br /> <br /> Gandhi My Father also talks about an internal struggle, which is sometimes more difficult than any struggle for freedom ever undertaken. <br /> <br /> Watch it, if you like quality cinema.
