Wow baby, this is really a nice Asian horror / gore and a crazy wacky movie. This is a Japanese splatterfest that reminded me a little of Tetsuo, except that in this case with all the blood and guts, there's a bizarre love story. It's hard to imagine how they even imagined this visually stunning film, with some unique alien creatures that infect humans like parasites, turning them into a partial machine or I imagine cyborgs. The only thing wrong with these creatures after they have hired a human is that they have to kill each other and eat each other. hmmm, yum yum. This would probably be called industrial splatter or something, with a superb soundtrack to add to all the fun. The film also borrows from Carpenter's "The Thing" in the design and effects of the creatures. I would put it in the must-have category for the gorehounds, since there is a never-ending carnage and some very fine gore. It's a must for stoners, because you don't even need to read subtitles, visual images alone are enough for a mental journey. The design of the small creatures that inhabit the human body as a fetus reminded me a little of the films of Frank Henenlotter, which is another tribute to some excellent gore films with a sense of humor. "Meatball Machine" is a lot of fun for the gorehounds, no doubt, and I just loved it.
