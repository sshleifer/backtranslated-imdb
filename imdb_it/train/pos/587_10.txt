One of the things about the movie that warmed my heart was that dry fly fishing was an important part of the scene. I have occasionally completed my dry fly fishing periods, having tied my own flies and, accompanied by my brother and my father, we spend a day in a river or another trying to try the always elusive brown trout to get up and take the flight that was offered to them. <br /> <br /> When we have had occasions like this, any difference between us has disappeared and any pressure in the world has melted away to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in the activity and surroundings of the place where we were. <br /> <br /> This was one of the extraordinary things that were portrayed in the film when the minister and his two sons, Norman and Pauly, performed the ritual. Because there is something ritual in fly fishing, since there is something ritualistic in so many pastimes. You can't just start throwing your line and hoping for the best. You have to tune in to the place where you are, you have to scan the surface of the water considering how it flows and where the best point could be to position your fly and, depending on your skill level, you could even get your fly to land there long enough for a fish to take note and hit. The "Art of Fly Fishing" has been directed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists. <br /> <br /> The title of the film could not have been chosen more appropriately, because the river had actually run through the life of a father and two children. However, this film spreads wider than the family and the community in Montana, near the Blackfoot River, where the film takes place. It has the ability to attract you, to fascinate you, to capture you, while the history of the family, of the community and of the period is unfolded. The story told is not just a family story, but a life story. What can be classified as a "river of life"
