"World's Finest" is a unique project. It's a trailer for a crossover film Superman / Batman that doesn't exist and will never exist, at least not in this form, with these characters, actors and plot anyway. <br /> <br /> So the movie is a great tease, even more than the standard real movie trailers of everyday life. The trailer will do anything for nothing. In this regard, I did not really like this short project. When you watch this trailer it makes you hungry and excited for more and at the same time sad - and maybe you will also feel unjustified, when it turns out that a full length movie of this trailer will never exist. In a sense, you wonder why this project was implemented in the first place. Definitely to showcase the abilities of Sandy Collora, but he couldn't have done it with a real short, like his previous movie "Batman: Dead End". <br /> <br /> But when you have to judge this short purely for what it is, then from the technical point of view of the film, it's really great. It's beautiful and much more professional than you'd probably expect, even if the people who have already seen "Batman: Dead End" will know better than to expect a short set with cardboard sets, cheap homemade costumes and evaluate the actors . The short film is not always impressive and obviously the budget was not very high, but for the most part it is very impressive and professional looking, with beautiful costumes, sets, special effects, cinematography and lighting. <br /> <br /> In short, a good fast and typical trailer accumulates, with maybe a bit too many shots too realistic to find it believable but, hey, it works well for the style of the trailer. It has some impressive shots but also a couple of crippled ones, mainly Superman's flight sequences. It was obvious that the boy was in a moving car, with a camera aimed at him from a lower angle. I also found it a nice thing to see. But really the best and most spectacular moments make up for this. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn looked like a good Superman / Clark Kent, although obviously not the greatest talented actor around. Clark Bartram resumed his Batman role well and Kurt Carley looked like a fantastic Lex Luthor. The rest of the cast is also served quite well. <br /> <br /> It is particularly interesting to see this short after the recent new modern interpretations of the two main superheroes of this film, in the films "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns". It is interesting to compare the style and treatment of the characters in these films with this one. It's really surprising and fun to hear how Kurt Carley sounds like Kevin Spacey, the actor who played Lex Luthor in "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful and well made and built trailer that makes you hungry for more, even if you know there will be no others. By the way, does Waner Bros. plan to create a real Superman / Batman movie? I thought the developments were going on a couple of years ago, but nothing has been known since. Instead, two new Batman and Superman films were made; "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> 7/10
