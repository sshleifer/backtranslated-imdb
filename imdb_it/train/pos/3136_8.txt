A strangely pleasing effort, combining an appropriately unlikely plot involving Adam and Burt and the flashbacks of the original TV series. Most of the flashback scenes were raised directly from Burt Ward's book "Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights" and I imagine his book was the inspiration for this film. Like the book, it left the fans of the original series hungry for more. <br /> <br /> If you have lost this broadcast, it is definitely worth it to borrow a tape from a friend who may have recorded it. I'm making a copy for my kids now.
