An interesting thriller that has as a detective Paul Winfield the case of a murder. Paul Winfield was an undervalued actor who brought out all his roles so easily, it was hard to say that the man was acting. Perhaps best known by younger viewers as the voice / narrator of "City Confidential", Winfield ends his career with a film like this; but as always, Winfield shines. A pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> Erika Eliniak is fine, Erika Eliniak, she is nice to look at but leaves much to be desired in the acting department. Although, to be honest, this is one of his best efforts. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: a watchable thriller that no Paul Winfield fan should miss. A decent TV series to help send Paul Winfield to the celluloid paradise. What an actor. We'll miss him.
