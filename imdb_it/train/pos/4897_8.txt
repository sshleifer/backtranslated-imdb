Does this film attract you from the beginning because it attracts our attention by recognizing, yes, that this story opens with a cliché ?? a funeral. <br /> <br /> In hands other than those of Judi I would not have given an 8 as this material has been done over and over again: the once-famous big meeting, choose that please, team, army platoon , theater group, singers, group. <br /> <br /> But this film never yields to economic sentimentality, and when you think it's going, it moves in another direction. A case in point is the flowers sent by an admirer to Judi. <br /> <br /> The members of the group are an interesting group and they also ride the clichés. One is in prison, one has found religion, one is an alkie and one is sunk in dementia. But the joy of living rediscovered by Judi, turned on by her niece's interest, drags us and makes us forget the sometimes simplistic nature of the plot. <br /> <br /> The cast is a talented who's who, Leslie Caron, the incomparable jazz musician Cleo Laine with her incredible high notes, a last performance by Joan Sims, good Joan, a nice brat who has a ball with Ian Holm, and Olympia Dukakis as a divorced woman who earns her living in the Scottish highlands with her ghillie and her whiskey, The final scene is the classic Hollywood fare, the star's sons have become fun-loving supporters, the old lovers have reunited, the young have taken possession of the music of the old timers. Life should be so simple. But I would look at him again, and I intend to do it, with my own granddaughter. Because in the right hands, sometimes you only love these old cheeky clichés. 8 out of 10.
