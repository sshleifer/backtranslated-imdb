Whether this film is propaganda or not (I firmly believe it is not), it really shows the power of the media. The importance of this documentary is not to show how good a Chavez man is. Really demonstrates how the Bolivarians saw how it happened, the way Chavez saw it. Although it may seem wrong and the bias to support a film, I think the point of view shown in the film is absolutely legitimate. The Venezuelan people through the private media society of Venezuela saw only a side perspective of the neoliberal coup. This film shows us how the Bolivarians saw it. Call it propaganda, I say it's a judgment call from you.
