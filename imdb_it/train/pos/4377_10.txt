The early 90s was a high point, in my opinion, for the historical drama. The last of the Mohicans, Braveheart, Rob Roy - all portrayed a distinctive passion and intensity in their respective time periods. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy was a unique and intriguing taste of a time and place rarely represented by the film. It really has it all - interesting story, great acting, extraordinary dialogue and breathtaking scenery. I was particularly struck by the seemingly genuine dialogue. I guess this is how the eighteenth century people talked and behaved. <br /> <br /> Something else that surprised me was the vulgarity expressed by the characters. I found it more repugnant and shocking, though often more subtle, than what is found in films set in modern times. The film had a very bold and sexually charged side that was unique and very probably very realistic in the context of the era. <br /> <br /> The pace was very tight, with a little boring moment. There were many intrigues and secondary political plots that complicated things a bit, but they took nothing away from the main plot. <br /> <br /> The action was also very well done and compelling. Something that I will always find remarkable is that during the film's action movie, there is absolutely no soundtrack. It's a very tense and exciting sequence, since we have no musical indications about the direction and resolution of the scene. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy will always stay on top of my list of favorite movies. I would recommend it to everyone.
