This movie is very funny and it's never boring to even run at almost 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and the rest of the cast are fantastic in the film and are very credible. The violence was a bit extreme in the film, but then showed how vicious the drug trade was at the time of the film. The finish is surprising and is probably one of the most beautiful scenes ever. Great movie and you will probably really like it.
