This is a very amusing and sometimes rather gruesome anthology, which if somewhat late in the screenwriting department, amply compensates for the lack in acting, localization work and general exuberance. The best episodes of this are the first with Denholm Elliot who plays a horror writer chased by a character of his novel in the works (a perfect example of the acting that pulls him out of the simple pawn); the third, with Christopher Lee as a man terrified of his daughter and the last episode with the late great Jon Pertwee as a pompous horror star who gets more than a new role in his latest project. The dialogue between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is bubbly and inspired, both obviously enjoying the opportunity to do it! Cushing is typically good in the weaker segment, which is certainly not helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman who is obsessed with the local wax museum is far from "beautiful" as we are told to believe it to be! A shocking beauty was needed and instead we are given a woman with a tortoise's jaw. Minor jokes aside this movie and his wonderful country house is the one to take when you can.
