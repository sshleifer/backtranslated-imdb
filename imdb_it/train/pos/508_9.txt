In 2151, in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, a farmer shoots the Klingon Klaang with his plasma rifle after a methane warehouse explodes on his farm and the Klingon is sent to Starfleet Hospital. The Vulcan ambassador Soval proposes to disarm the life support system and bring Klaang's body to his warrior empire on the planet Kronos with honor. However, Captain Jonathan Archer proposes to go with the Enterprise on his first trip and bring Klaang back alive on his home planet. Jonathan invites Ensign Hoshi Sato and Dr. Phlox, who is treating Klaang, to complete his crew, and sub-Vulcan commander T'Pol is assigned to participate in Enterprise's dangerous first mission. When the ship's equipment is turned off, Klaang is kidnapped by the Sulibans after a hospital shooting. After the autopsy of the Sulibans killed in the shooting, Captain Archer is informed by Dr. Phlox that the alien was actually a mutant, altered in a sophisticated genetic engineering process. T'Pol modifies the sensors of the Enterprise to track down the Sulibana spaceship until it reaches the planet Riger X. They examine and reveal that Klaang was a courier, bringing an important message about the Temporal Cold War from the Suliban Sarin to the Klingon leaders in Kronos. <br /> <br /> Despite being a big Star Trek fan, I did not follow the "Enterprise" episodes on cable television. I decided to buy the first season's DVD box and this first episode surprised me. The adventure of the first Enterprise, Captain Jonathan Archer, the beautiful T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, Dr. Phlox, Hoshi and Trip is excellent, at least in this pilot. I noticed in IMDb that this episode is actually divided into two parts, but on DVD they are only one, so my review is valid for both. I didn't like the theme of musical score, which I found very annoying, but this was an exception in this great show. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Broken Bow"
