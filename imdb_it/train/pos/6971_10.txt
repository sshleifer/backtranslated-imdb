Obviously the "Battaglia Stella Gallactica" fan of the "Sci-Fi" series will hate it. This makes me happy. I don't like those Cheese-type science fiction shows, especially the Gallactica battle star and that's why I like this show. <br /> <br /> The creators of the show had a lot of warmth for doing this (unconventional skis -If so) and it was worth it. I read on Wikis that they wanted to appeal to everyone, including women and not just science fiction nerds. <br /> <br /> This is probably the most promising show from Lost. It has the most interesting, intelligent and profound script of any show for some time and is truly unique. <br /> <br /> What I love most about the show is that it plays like a big Anime! From the young teenagers who go around guns to an extremely well balanced and complex script, robots remind me of something from Japan, except a little better (most of the Anime is too confusing).
