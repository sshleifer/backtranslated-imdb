Later, I watched the movies ... I thought, "Why the hell was he so successful in the Korean Box Office?" Even if the film had a smart / not useful scenario, the acting wasn't so good and the characters weren't very interesting. For a Korean movie ... I liked the fight scenes. If you want to watch a movie without thinking about it, this is the movie for you. But I have to admit that ... the film was a bit childish ... 6/10
