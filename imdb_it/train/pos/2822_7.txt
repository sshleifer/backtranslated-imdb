The movie Torrent was the first and last for Greta Garbo. It was his first American film at MGM, the only studio in the United States he would ever work for. It was also the last time someone else was charged above her in the credits, her protagonist being her Ricardo Cortez. <br /> <br /> Torrent is based on the work of the famous Spanish writer Vicente Blasco Ibanez Entre Naranjos. It's about a couple of mismatched lovers, Garbo and Cortez, who can't be together, mainly because of the machinations of Cortez's mother, Marta Mattox. <br /> <br /> Mattox is a bad woman who has some ideas about who to marry her son. Remember that this is Spain and such arranged marriages were still quite appropriate at that time. Mattox has in mind Gertrude Olmstead as a daughter-in-law, is the offspring of Mack Swain a man who is enriched by raising pigs. Swain offers some moments of comic relief with his tender concern for piglets before they become large slaughter pigs. <br /> <br /> Blasco Ibanez had already published previous novels about The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse and Blood And Sand shot with Rudolph Valentino in the lead. It would have been interesting if Valentino had done this with Garbo, but he could have been beyond making a film when it was done. In any case, one of the aspiring Valentino, Ricardo Cortez, is filled with the male protagonist. <br /> <br /> One reason that Valentino may not have wanted this film is because clearly the protagonist is Garbo, unlike the other two works mentioned above. When made from filth by Cortez who is doing what Mattox tells her and his banker "advisor" Tully Marshall, he leaves Spain and goes to France, where he becomes a great star of the opera. And it leads the scandalous life there. <br /> <br /> When he returns to Spain and tries to rekindle things, Mattox is even more indignant. He has a political career in mind for his son. Cortez is now in the running for the Spanish Parliament, which is curiously called Cortes. <br /> <br /> The title refers to a flood and a dam that break causing all kinds of devastation in the countryside. Cortez, in fact, challenges Torrent in a rowboat trying to save Garbo from danger. When they get together they have a brutally frank discussion, the brutality that comes from Garbo. <br /> <br /> The special effects here, primitive even though they seem now are quite remarkable for their time. They look very similar to the shots used in The Rains Came by 20th Century Fox, released in 1939 and which won an Oscar for special effects. Unfortunately for Torrent it came out a year before Oscar made his debut. <br /> <br /> I have no intention of giving any final so you have to see the movie to find out if Cortez and Garbo meet at the end. Garbo rightly got rave reviews for his performance and at a time when exaggerated gestures were the norm in acting on the silent screen, he was remarkably subtle in his role. So it would be the rest of his career, he had a remarkable face for close-ups. <br /> <br /> Although Greta Garbo would have continued to do a much better job than Torrent, this film is still a fitting debut for her on the big American screen and holds up very well for today's audiences.
