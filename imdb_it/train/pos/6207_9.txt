I just watched this movie @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Hal Hartley fans will not be disappointed !! And if you're not familiar with this director's work ... it doesn't matter. This film can definitely hold it all by itself. I have to go to the second screening ... it was incredible I need to see it again - and fast !! <br /> <br /> This movie is a lot of fun. The dialogue is very intelligent and the performance of Parker Posey is exceptional, given that he plays the title role of Fay Grim. Fay Grim is the last film that revisits the world and the characters introduced in the film Henry Fool (2000). Visually, the most salient stylistic feature employs the usual use of the inclined (or Dutch) corner, which can often be seen in Hartley's works of the past that appear in various short films, available in Possible Films: short works from the 1994-2004 collection by Hal Hartley, and in The Girl from Monday (2005). <br /> <br /> I saw this film more appropriately on September 11th. At a textual level, the adventure of Fay Grim in this story is counter to the world changed after September 11th 2001. Without going into the main spoilers, I see this work, and the world of history as a courageous political and original portrait of geopolitics which is rarely, if ever, foregrounded in traditional fiction cinema after 911 (see Syrianna: of side note - Mark Cuban Exec. Prod in both films ... the most interesting, to say the least). <br /> <br /> Finally, for those who are closely related to the characters of Henry Fool, Simone, Fay and Henry, this film is hilarious and self-referential. That said, Fay Grimm's character begins in the film, exactly where he was when Henry Fool finished, but at the end of the film ... Fay's knowledge and experience have changed and expanded throughout the narrative. What can be in store for the future of the Fay and the Fool family ... ?? I look forward to the third part of this story!
