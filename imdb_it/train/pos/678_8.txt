Peter Weir's first international hit, THE LAST WAVE is a predominantly effective chiller with a fascinating background story based on the Aboriginal myth. Richard Chamberlain offers a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly uneven from reality as he investigates a murder case involving Aboriginal tribal rivalries. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to lead Chamberlin through the reign of "Dreamtime", an alternative reality / central timeline for Australian native tribal history and customs. Strong in atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in the plot, the film builds a disturbing ending that is somehow dwarfed by the negative effects, probably due to budget constraints. However, an intriguing film whose general impression of mystery and terror that lurks just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will remain with you.
