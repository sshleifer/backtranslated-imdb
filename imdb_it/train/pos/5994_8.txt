I had the pleasure of seeing the short film "The Cure", by debut director Ryan Jafri. What really strikes me is the work with the camera and the music. I think that many young directors (as I myself am one of them) would struggle with cinematography when it started to create an indie. We see that the output is not exactly what we imagined or below our ambitions. But this film, the directorial debut of a young director, has managed very well on the screen. Camera movement, color, lighting and compositing all contribute to the film's history and emotion. <br /> <br /> And even music, as a key element of the language of cinema, helps a lot. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to portray a woman's heart, her desire, her fear, especially in short. But still, I have to admit that I'm not a fan of v / o (narration), especially when the film is advanced by narration, instead of shots and cuts. My personal feeling towards part of the narrative part is, I suppose, the narrator has tried a little too much. So energy pushes the audience back from the excitement of the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a well-made short film, I could see a director's contribution. Well done, Ryan!
