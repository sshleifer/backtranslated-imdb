Glacier Fox is one of the most harrowing and beautifully photographed wild animal films ever made. <br /> <br /> The film makes you worry about every member of this family of foxes, from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are sometimes hilarious and even tragic. Set in an inhospitable countryside, the heart of the public is affectionate to family members. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack and the lyrics tell the story with the story of what is happening in general terms. <br /> <br /> Man remains one of the greatest predators, but we have no doubt that foxes are capable of living, not just surviving beyond human efforts.
