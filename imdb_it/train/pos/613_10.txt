please, future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie! <br /> <br /> I had never seen such a bold and original story created for the big screen of cinema. audacious, because the script has consistently taken a step so that many fancy films safely avoided - a step towards something new, creative and bold. just when you think 'oh, I've seen this before' or 'I'm sure this is what's going to happen now' - StarDust would make an unexpected breakthrough and involve you more and more in history. <br /> <br /> the actors are fantastic - even the smallest part is performed with such talent that it fills me with awe for the creators of this film. Robert De Niro is magnificent and performs with so much energy that he simply steals the show in every scene in which he finds himself. Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch and Claire Danes is a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving "star", Yvaine. Other big names play exceptional roles. I had the fill everyone is trying to give their best for this movie. But again, the story of Neil Gaiman, all the little things he "invented" for this universe - simply exceptional. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in a pre-screening today, a day before the official release and I hope it will be a huge success. There is so much humor, but also moments of tension and tender and fascinating scenes. The look in the eyes of Yvaine, the "frivolities" of Captain Shakespeare, the passion of Lamia the witch - impressive, unforgettable <br /> <br /> For me this is the number one funny film of 2007, look at it and have fun it < br /> <br /> 11/10 - Exceptional <br /> <br /> peace and love
