Don't let yourself be influenced by opponents. This is a wonderfully spooky film. This was a thesis project for the writer / director, JT Petty. He did a great job of making me sit on the edge of my seat. I never really knew what to expect, and for a passionate horror film-goer, this is Nirvana! The film is about an old man who lives in an isolated cabin in the woods. One day, while looking for his cat in the woods, are you witnessing the murder of a child or not? The rest of the film agonizes over this. The most unusual thing about this film is that there is no dialogue here until the last scenes. I found this intriguing. The writer manages to seize your senses and gives them a relentless tug. Give this film a twist, you won't be disappointed.
