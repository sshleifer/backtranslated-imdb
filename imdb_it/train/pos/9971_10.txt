This film was excellent, I thought the original one was quiet and mediocre. This however took all the ingredients, a 1970 Hemi Challenger with a 4-speed transmission that shows that Mother Mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars! I was at Chrysler's paradise whenever Kowalski acted as a pioneer in that big Hemi block, and he certainly did a lot :)
