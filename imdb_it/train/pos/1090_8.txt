One of Cary Grant's most enduring comedies is Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House. Although judging by the size of it, the house would be a dream villa today. Still Cary was earning a living in the advertising industry even though he was having a hell of a time trying to invent a slogan for the Wham brand ham. <br /> <br /> What made this film so popular was the housing shortages of the post-World War II years. Veterans returning from the war were claiming their rights under the GI Bill of Rights that included home loans. The problem was that literally there were not enough houses to satisfy the demand. At the time, Eric Hodgins' book and the film were so famous that Congress passed and President Truman signed the Taft-Ellender-Wagner Housing law which put the government for the first time in the residential construction sector. <br /> <br /> I had an uncle and an aunt who were at the same time building their own house in which they moved in the early fifties. Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy they had two daughters and were trying to get out of downtown Rochester. Their place was not as great as a house in Connecticut with eighteen rooms, but they lived there the rest of their lives as Cary and Myrna most likely did. <br /> <br /> Obviously it was expensive and the costs continue to add up and increase, threatening to send Cary to the cleaners. Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas around to offer advice, usually too late. Actually, he's kind to Myrna and Cary knows it. <br /> <br /> The role of Myrna Loy is simply an extension of Nora Charles. If you can imagine that Charles moved into the country and William Powell with the headaches of Cary Grant, the film would still work well. <br /> <br /> Blandings Builds His Dream House still works well as a comedy because the situations are universal. And this review is dedicated to my uncle Walter and Aunt Kate who have lived together in their dream home for over 40 years.
