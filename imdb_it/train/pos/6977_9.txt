I'm really addicted to Caprica, because it's really a good series of prequels for Battlestar Galactica. It really has a slow start, but it will surely resume shortly after the new episodes continue to go on air. <br /> <br /> I've heard great things about future episodes and guest stars for the first season. <br /> <br /> This Sci Fi drama is sure to please us fans who love a mix of both genres. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz does a fantastic job, as does Polly Walker as Clarice Willow !! <br /> <br /> Absolutely not to be missed !! <br /> <br /> Catch Caprica on Friday at 21:00 / 8pm central on SYFY
