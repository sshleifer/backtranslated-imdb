I recently saw this movie and loved it. gives an idea of ​​independent cinema and how much work is really involved when you have a low budget but you need an actor / actress name to convince people, people to come and see it and give visibility to the film. Bobby Myeres played by Modine and his partner Saul - Paul Linder makes an excellent combination by finding the eccentric Miachel Bates, an "NAME" actor played by Alan Bates which was a perfect decision in the film and for the film. My favorite cast member was Sandy Ryan, played by the magnificent and underrated Debra Kara Unger with her special performance back in the film within the film. If you like to think when you watch a play, this is for you. A low budget meets the lowest budget with High ride content.
