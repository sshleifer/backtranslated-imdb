Call me stupid, but I loved the 2001 horror movie, Valentine. It was so well done, well written, well acted, well directed, etc! Everything was wonderful! There were relatively routine parts (Lily's death), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), completely terrifying and creepy (Paige's death), and simply heartbreaking (the first scene). I think the whole cast did a great job, especially the three main characters: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (both of whom I met and received autographs from, during the filming of this movie - VERY good people!), And Marley Shelton. <br /> <br /> I am very tired of those who call this film "another Scream clone". This film is in no way a Scream clone. In reality, this film turns rings around Scream. It actually makes SENSE! Even Scream was NOT the only movie to contain a masked killer. Sorry, but it seems that Scream was also a clone (um ..., Friday the 13th, Halloween, and many other scary movies also included masked killers). I also think that the novelty of the masked murderer is brilliant. It is so strange to see a sweet and greedy face that does all these horrible things. Another novelty (the bloody nose) gives way to a fantastic ending! The final chills me every time I see it !!!!! So, even if you didn't like it the first time, look at Valentine again and give him another chance! <br /> <br /> PS- Keep an eye on my new website (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Coming soon...
