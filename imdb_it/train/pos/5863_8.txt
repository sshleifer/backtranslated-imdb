Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War, "Jacknife" arrived not too late or was even superfluous. He is one of the few who tries to tackle the second sad side of the war: time later. Unlike films like "Taxi driver" or "Rambo" which they use to present their main characters as heroes destroyed in a post-war environment, this film allows the public to face a different view on Vietnam veterinarians. Their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war. The problems are obvious but in all this tragic there is always the feeling of some hope based on love and friendship. "Jacknife" could be the quietest Vietnamese film ever, but after almost 15 years this is really plausible and therefore justified. Furthermore, it may make us believe that the war is not over yet; at least for some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are fantastic. De Niro did one of his best works, but Ed Harris is the protagonist of this film. Perhaps this was his best performance ever.
