I can't believe I see this movie just now - I think maybe I thought it was another movie about abused slaves, and I avoided Roots for the same reason - just like I haven't seen Schindler's List yet - I don't want to be "entertained" from the pain of others, no matter how authentic or informative it should be. <br /> <br /> So I guess the main thing I noticed about The Color Purple was that it wasn't black people who were abused by white people. Black people were perfectly able to rape their daughters or give them away to be considered slaves by their "husbands". It was painful to watch, but eventually everyone redeemed themselves and the acting was phenomenal! I could not believe that the Oprah character played at the age of 35! And I love Whoopi to start with - it was incredible. I'm so happy that yesterday afternoon I felt bad and Showtime ran The Color Purple.
