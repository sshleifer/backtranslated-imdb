Superb. Initially I thought that the communist inclinations of Amrita Pritam and the nationalist film of dr. Dwivedi were more frank than a novel, but when I read the novel I was surprised to find that it was reversed. <br /> <br /> Kudos to marita Pritam for not being pseudo-sec and for Dr. Dwivedi to be objective. This film touches a sensitive sensitive topic. The victims of every war are women, as some poets have said and this film personifies it. It is also a sad commentary on the Hindu psyche because they cannot resist the kidnappers of their girls or their Hindu brother who can only burn the fields of his tormentor. On the other hand it also shows economic angles behind the partition or actually because the girls were kidnapped in the first place. I think the kidnappers thought that kidnapping girls would become the legal owners of the houses and therefore the new government. he will not be able to ask them to return the houses. This apart must greet the courage of the characters of Puro and his Bhabhi, they are two simple girls of the village who do not know the outside world and risk doing so trying to return after being dishonored. Because there are many documented cases when such women were not accepted by their families in India. No wonder he required a woman to understand the pains of other women.
