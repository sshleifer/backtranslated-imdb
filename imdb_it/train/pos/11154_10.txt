In my opinion, this is one of the biggest films ever made in America and deserved every single prize won and is placed on the top 100 list of AFI (even if it is shamefully too low on the list of IMDB's Top 250, for only $ 183 as of this writing). If you like top notch performances (Voight and Hoffman are a superb pair), well-designed characterizations and creative direction, editing and filmmaking, you'll like it as much as I do. Schlesinger paints a vivid and always believable image of the New York scene of the late 1960s and many victims struggle to overcome personal demons and survive amid the amorality, poverty and despair of 42nd Street, New York City. <br /> <br /> The directing techniques employed here capture brilliantly the sensation of the underground cinema movement of New York (and of the city) and are nothing less than dazzling. I've seen a lot of ideas (including rapid-focus editing, voice-over flashback management, drug / travel sequences and cartoon faces stuck in a murder scene to convey anxiety and terror) stolen by other directors. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Joe and Ratso is managed in such a way that it is seen as an unusually strong friendship or with its homosexual bases. I think the director managed this way subtly so as not to rely on the censorship of the times, but rather to focus his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life, be it sexual or not. <br /> <br /> MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave, moving film of magnitude, influence and importance that has lost absolutely nothing of the impact over the years, so if you haven't seen it, you're really missing a true American classic. I recommend this film to everyone. <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 10.
