Entertainment for the elderly ???? I am 15 years old and have watched the show since I was 12, recoding it to my Sky + box every day from Hallmark and the BBC 1. I really hope they haven't deleted it, they haven't even had the right farewell. But what an adventure, all those episodes, I think I've seen them all, and it doesn't occur to me that I didn't like and enjoy myself. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the BBC continues to trade between Diagnoses Murder and "Murder She Wrote" - Never watched and I'm not going to do it. However, the characters of Diagnosis Murder are so thorough and the chemistry between the actors is amazing. It was really a sad day when they canceled this show ........
