There is so much that can be said about this movie. It is not your typical nunsploitation. Of course, there is nudity and sex with the nuns, but this is almost secondary to the story. <br /> <br /> It is found in Italy in the 15th century, at the time of the martyrdom of the 800 Christians of Otranto. The battle between Muslims and Christians occupies much of the film. It was interesting when everyone ran away from the Muslim tribes, which the mother superior asked: "Why do you fear Muslims, will they do nothing of what the Christians have done to you?" Sure, there was enough torture on both sides. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is sent to a convent to challenge her father. In the process, she witnesses and endures many things: the stallion gelding, the rape of a local woman by a new duke, the torture of a nun who was overwhelmed during a visit from the Tarantula sect, and a lash when she is escaped with a Jew. The torture was particularly gruesome with the hot wax that was poured on the nun and her cut nipples. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia is destined to continue to get into trouble while questioning the society dominated by the men she lives in. He even asks Jesus, because the father, the son and the holy spirit are all men. <br /> <br /> In the end, he joins the Muslim leader as his lover and plunders the convent. This is where you see more meat than you can enjoy at once. But the tragedy must come. He manages to get revenge on everyone, including the Duke and his father, but discovers that the Muslim lover treats her exactly the same way. She is a woman and that's all there is to it. <br /> <br /> I will not describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic in the end, but it predates the torture of Saw or Hostel of decades. <br /> <br /> Nunsploitation fans will be content with delights, but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest.
