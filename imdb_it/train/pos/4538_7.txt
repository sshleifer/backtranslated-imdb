I didn't even want to watch this movie after reading Maltin's review and the 1 1/2 star rating. I looked at it anyway on my son's advice and found it much better than I expected. I would give 2 1/2 stars from a 4-star system. You have to watch the movie more than once to understand everything. If you don't know much about religion, you'll miss it a lot. I graduated from high school the year the film was made, so maybe I could identify it better. Yes, there is a certain claim in the film and it's strange to some extent, but it was the 70s, so what do you expect. I can understand why people might not like the movie; however, I can't understand the people who say it's boring. The film is anything but boring. He will hate it or love it. If you find it boring, you're probably brain dead.
