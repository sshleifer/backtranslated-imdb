I wasn't sure what to expect from this, outside of the positive and uniform reviews I read. Turns out, I could never have imagined this film, because it is very close to "The bride with white hair" to be operatic and face the fantastic. This walks a fine line between being a farce, a comedy, and simply the story of good old-fashioned. There is nothing scary about this, it is not the theme, it is above all a love story that deals with a tramp who meets a beautiful ghost, who is in trouble with other ghosts. So the main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost. This also happens in ancient China, with wild and wild Kung Fu performances and a trip to hell (more or less). Some of the stop-action ghosts are quite interesting, and the visual effects are of the highest quality. I could watch this kind of Chinese movies all day, because they are very funny, fantastic visuals and practically ironic. And I'm looking forward to seeing the first sequel to this film too. Highly recommended.
