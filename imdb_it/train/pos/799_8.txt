he is the narcissist and the manipulator par excellence; in this case, portray the lawyer (and murderer) Tom Capano. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Morris is a sympathizer as a victim, Anne Marie Fahey, but at first she is a bit of a victim. We apologize for the situation, but become disgusted at the same time after seeing his victimization of several other women (including Rachel Ward). <br /> <br /> The sad part is where he is actually helping with his self-esteem problems, and Capano actually had his psychologist killed. Rather hard to believe, but this was based on a true story. <br /> <br /> There is a cameo with Olympia Dukakis (excellent) as Capano's mother. All in all, an interesting story because it is based on a real murder and you would like to read Ann Rule's book to get the accurate details. 8/10.
