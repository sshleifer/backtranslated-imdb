Homeless (or homeless, as George Carlin declared) has been a problem for years, but never a plan to help those on the street who were considered human and who did everything to go to school, work or vote for the issue. Most people think of the homeless as a lost cause, while caring about things like racism, the war in Iraq, pressuring children to succeed, technology, elections, inflation, or worrying about whether they will be coming to an end roads. <br /> <br /> But what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you had from a house, the entertainment sets, a bathroom, the pictures on the wall, a computer, and all that you once treasured to see what it means to be homeless? This is the lesson of Goddard Bolt. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks (who directs) who plays Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until he decides to make a bet with a rival sissy (Jeffery Tambor) to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries; if Bolt is successful, he can do whatever he wants with a future project to build more buildings. The bet is on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor every move he can't get off the sidewalk. He was given the nickname Pepto by a tramp after it was written on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters including a woman named Molly (Lesley Ann Warren) a former dancer who divorced before losing her home, and his friends Sailor (Howard Morris) and Fumes (Teddy Wilson) who are already used to the streets. They survived. Bolt is not. He is not used to reaching mutual agreements as he once did when he is rich where he fights or flees, kills or is killed. <br /> <br /> While the love affair between Molly and Bolt was not necessary for the plot, I found "Life Stinks" is one of Mel Brooks's observant films in which before being a comedy, it shows a tender respect. to his slapstick work like Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, or Spaceballs for the matter, to show what it means to have something precious before losing it the next day or, on the contrary, make a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don't know what make with their money. Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it as Monopoly money. <br /> <br /> Or maybe this movie will inspire you to help others.
