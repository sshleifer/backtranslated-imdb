I saw this film in the joy of shire. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the best films of all time. It has timeless value, you can do it so much that it's incredible. There are moving parts, fun and simply fantastic. <br /> <br /> All aspects are clear, the representation of the story is perfect, every detail is 100% authentic, even the small Irish subtleties have been treated. <br /> <br /> The use of low and high shots offers two fantastic panoramas on Cristy (watch out for that). <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is incredible. I've never seen an actor do it, ever. It's really great. <br /> <br /> And it's so nice to look at, it flows so well, it's probably the closest thing you can get from real life. I love it. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, you should see it. Have no doubts about it, there is something for everyone.
