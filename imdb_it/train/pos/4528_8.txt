Although the film is clearly dated, the public can still easily identify with Buster's unfortunate plight in this timeless and very entertaining story. Buster fights against unpleasant oddities in three different eras: the stone age, the Roman age and the Moden age, playing almost the same character with only a change of scenery to help us identify the different "ages". In this film we see one of the first comic representations of the stereotype "caveman", who wins his love not for romance but for brute force, as well as a funny twist on fights between Roman gladiators, two comic sketches that precede similar cracks such as "History of the World: Part I" by Mel Brooks. The basic theme of the film is simple but convincing: although times can be changed, we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times to "win the girl" (keep in mind this is the theme of America of the 1923, a period in which chauvinism was still in vogue). It is interesting to look at this film more than eighty years later and consider how things have changed radically from the "modern times" of this film to today.
