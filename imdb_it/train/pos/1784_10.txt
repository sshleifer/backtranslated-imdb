Evening is a fun movie with a certain depth. All the actors and actresses turn into spectacular shows. With the huge cast, however, stellar acting is expected, but in this film expectations are exceeded. One can relate to personalities and situations in one's family. As you watch the interaction of family members, your family's memories are immediately remembered. This is one of the few films that inspires one to read the book. It is usually the opposite; one reads the book and then wants to see the film. I will definitely get a copy of Susan Minot's book and read it. The scenery of Rhode Island is spectacular as is the soundtrack. Any car lover will appreciate the seemingly expertly restored vintage cars. Needless to say now, but I highly recommend the evening. You'll like it.
