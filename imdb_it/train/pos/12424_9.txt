I had always wanted David Duchovney to enter the world of cinema, and he finally did it, and made me proud. This film lived up to what I was hoping for. Duchovney played his character very well, managing to stay consistent with something new, instead of playing Agent Molder we're used to. So I gave him an extra credit for his role, also because I couldn't see anyone else playing that particular character. David was exceptional, but nothing compared to the psychotic Timothy Hutton. A brilliant performance that does not tire you of the whole film, because it never fails to surprise you. It has weaknesses and strengths, making the story even more credible. I also loved the storytelling, added a lot of things to the story, and had some memorable quotes that I still use all the time. This film also had an exceptional score. I recommend it to anyone who loves drama and doesn't mind the blood.
