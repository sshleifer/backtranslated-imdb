A fun action comedy in which Damian Szifron comes across the life of Díaz, a policeman whose wife betrayed him. He lives in a hotel feeling guilty about his wife's infidelity, falling into depression and stopping worrying, making the red lights work just for fun, feeling sorry for himself. And Silberman, a Jewish asshole on probation, a leftist liberal who doesn't trust the cops at all. He is told to accompany Díaz in his daily duties, unable to refuse because of the terms of his probation. Soon the situation returns when Silberman himself finds out that his wife is cheating on him, and ends up being comforted by the same person he was supposed to help, a person he didn't trust at first. A nuclear conspiracy, car thieves, international spies, a hysterical wife. Strange characters in a delightful comedy about friendship and heroism.
