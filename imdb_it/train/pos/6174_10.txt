It is really regrettable that most people outside Canada think that the only things Canada produces are snow, mounties and hockey players. This film is the second superlative Canadian film I've seen in recent weeks (the first was "The Red Violin"), much better than all but the best Hollywood efforts. <br /> <br /> Gustad Noble is everything but that; is a middle-aged Parsi bank employee in Bombay in the 1970s. This film sensibly explores various things that happen to him about his family, his friends and his work, and their effect on him. At the same time, it is a fascinating and, I assume, accurate, representation of bourgeois urban life in India at the time. <br /> <br /> However, I was a little prepared for this, having read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. The film, as one might expect, cannot capture all the complexities of the book, but if you want to read a really beautiful book and see a really beautiful film, read and look at "A journey so long".
