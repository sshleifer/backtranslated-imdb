It worked from 1959 to 1973. It is more than its longevity that says a lot for this series. He also survived the changes in fashion and taste in the 1950s, psychedelic 60s and remained popular in the 70s. I remember repeating this series. It was a successful combination of all its elements of stories, cast and productions that made it exceptional. Lorne Green had his definitive iconic character from this series. His charm was through the generations. All family members could enjoy this. It balances morality with violence, humor with seriousness. A series of cartoons was made as a spin-off of this as a result of its impact. The shame is that this series is not repeated and many will not know its meaning.
