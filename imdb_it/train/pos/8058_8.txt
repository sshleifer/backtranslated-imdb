Like many people here, I started to find my patience with this film. In the end, I actually shed a few tears. <br /> <br /> It seems to be in the nature of most old movies to be dragged for 7/8 of length and then catch fire right at the end. Older spectators have learned to wait patiently for their time through slow, calm parts knowing that the big profit is coming. But it's not precise enough. You see, for previous viewers, what "slow parts" are for us were the main body of the story. They looked and found anecdotal and thematic interest there. The post-Spielberg modern public is in a constant state of anticipation to be hit by a small peak every two minutes when they see older films. It is the problem of the inflation of modern films. Well, it won't happen. It is not necessary to apologize for these films; it's simply that you have to adjust your expectations and your personal rhythm when you look at them. At this point, the difference between Avatar and The Informer is like the difference between Euripide and an itinerant production of Rent. Think about it for a minute or two. Not to force the obvious, but Euripides still deserves an audition. <br /> <br /> The "exciting part", for most modern viewers, starts with the IRA court scene and intensifies until the last couple of minutes, which, if you are on board or even paying attention at that moment will tear your heart out. It is not a universal high-pitched appeal for forgiveness; it is a plea from an idiot and one who is sorry for the great lummox, for a little pity. It's a personal matter and an embarrassing appeal. Because after being angry with Gypo, irritated by him, thinking that this is the most stupid character of all time, in the end you find yourself conquered by the scene of Gypo's girlfriend who begs another woman to convince her man to go slow . <br /> <br /> The film can be sentimental, but sentimentality is not as cheap as some have accused. There is a question of life or death that takes place here, and as long as you take seriously the proposal of a life for a client, it is the sentimentalism torn from the most serious stuff. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10. And the blame for not being 10 out of 10 is mine and to some extent yours, if you're reading this. We all asked for more, more and more, faster, faster and faster until we could put ourselves in 1935 - just yesterday, really - as easily as we should be able.
