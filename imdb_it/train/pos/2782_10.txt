"Bend It Like Beckham" is a film that has had little visibility here in the United States. It is probably due to the fact that the film was strongly British in dialogue and terminology and was very concerned with football, (soccer here), that some might have problems even in the United States. It is unfortunate because this film is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage here. I think the basis of the plot, (following a dream), is something that many people can relate to and in the end, "Bend It Like Beckham" turns out to be a film of goodness with a really good source of inspiration and acting. I wasn't overly enthusiastic about seeing this movie initially, but now I'm sorry I didn't see it first. I highly recommend this movie!
