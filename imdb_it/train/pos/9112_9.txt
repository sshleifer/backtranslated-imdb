Being half-Portuguese does not make me semi-blind (or even prejudiced) when it comes to Portuguese films. Not that I can do it very often anyway. But this film was so full of adrenaline! Yes, that's right - it was mostly accurate as far as history goes, but he didn't punch to venture beyond the usual territory of Portuguese films: things like using real places in the middle of congested Lisbon and recruiting a real crowd to defend the real crowd of almost 30 years ago. And by God they did well! OK, to summarize: very emotional if you've experienced it, but you'll see minor improvements that may have been made, as well as plot needs that were. If you look at it only by chance, you find yourself in a beautiful historical adventure, only of the very recent history and a little more thoughtful than usual. Even by European standards, yes.
