Spacecamp is my favorite movie. It is a beautiful story and also inspires others. <br /> <br /> The acting was excellent and my wife and I went to see Lea Thompson in Cabaret years later, due to her performance in the film. It is unfortunate that the Challenger incident delayed and injured the film. <br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the Challenger incident is coming. I knew one of the Challenger astronauts back and forth from childhood on the Carnegie Mellon campus, where my father went to school; I also know a dear friend of the late pilot. <br /> <br /> I was last year the technical exam for the national BSA for the Boy Scout astronomy merit badge and I still find Spacecamp a great film to recommend to Scouts who make the related Merit Badges to the space I teach. <br /> <br /> I ran into the last adult astronaut again and was following an engineering education program that we had put together when Challenger broke out. I found myself sitting with Willard Rockwell and his engineers, "invisible", to retrace things after the Astrotech Shareholder Incident, by accident, so I am much closer to the Accident and the cinematic similarities. I made sure I was a good student and finished my degree four years later, strangely, on the recommendation of the Rockwell engineer who told them not to fly Challenger in 1986 and later built the Endeavor.
