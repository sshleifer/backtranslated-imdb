This is a really good movie. Sumitra Bhave has always made sensible cinema and this is my favorite movie of hers. This film should have won the national award and it would have been my choice to represent India at the Oscars. It's at least a thousand times better than 'Shaaws', which will go to the Oscars, from India, this year. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that information on this (and all other Indian films) on IMDb is missing and sometimes even wrong. Sadashiv Amrapurkar has played a very important character in this film and is not even credited on these pages. Even the rest of the cast and crew are not mentioned at all. The awards and nominations for this film are not awarded even when Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this film. There was not even a single vote for "Doghi". <br /> <br /> "Doghi" is not a Hindi film. It is Marathi, and fortunately it escapes the sequence of songs and dances, it does not allow itself to be entangled in a glamorous glamor and astute stylists. It is a real life, a story full of feeling and rare respect. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' which can be roughly translated as 'two women' is the story of two sisters, Gauri and Krishna. In reality it is a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave does not venture into many secondary plots, and this makes a film very difficult to direct. The entire film is set in a remote non-descriptive village in Maharashtra and the screen rarely moves away from the house of the two female protagonists. No aesthetic sunset in this. <br /> <br /> The film opens and we are presented with the whole house, which is preparing for Gauri's wedding. Gauri's father and Krishna being a hard farmer, the house is full and happy; there is nothing you want in their simple lives. However, on the eve of marriage, Gauri's husband encounters a fatal accident. Gauri's father cannot bear the tragic news and suffers a serious blow. Without a strong and functioning member, the house could collapse but Gauri's mother takes responsibility. He works as and when he can, but he can't make ends meet. But his life is even easier than that of Gauri. Superstitions, which people barely try to forget, make Gauri a bearer of bad luck. It is marginalized by society. <br /> <br /> Gauri's mother writes to her brother. Desperate for help, she accepts his suggestion. He takes Gauri to Mumbai where he is forced to work in brothels. Gauri sends home the money he earns and their conditions improve. Gauri gives her life for that of his family. <br /> <br /> However, when Gauri returns home for Krishna's wedding, his mother does not go out to meet her. He does not allow Krishna to approach her and does not grant Gauri in front of the guests. He loves Gauri but fears for Krishna's life. This completely interrupts Gauri and decides to return to his unfortunate life. But Krishna ends and holds Gauri. She begs her beloved sister to come back. Krishna promises to stand by her. Do you promise that they would face the world ?? together. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that is not required in this film. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gauri goes to Mumbai but what he does there is never said ?? subtle dialogues tell us what there is to know. It's just the bare story, which is profound in its simplicity. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' is the responsible cinema. He is respectful of the subject he manages. Is he respectful of his audience ?? he does not think they have the mental abilities of a four-year-old child. <br /> <br /> Acting is top notch. The direction is wonderful ?? the silences carry on the story in a way, no word could have. The script is well studied. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates good cinema is bound to love "Doghi".
