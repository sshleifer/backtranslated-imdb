This long episode contains a surprising amount of surprises, thrillers, mystery and concerns for a battle of Sherlock's wits against Charles Augustus Milverton, a head blackmailer. This is an excellent extended runtime of the Jeremy Brett-Holmes series. In the film the usual Holmes cannon appears as Inspector Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson, although no Moriarty, however it is the greatest villain, Charles Augustus. <br /> <br /> It is an authentic mix of intrigue, thrills and suspense, including an exciting final twist. This is a particular Sherlock movie, but we find Holmes falling in love with a servant, who kisses, cries and even steals. This time together with the episode "Scandal in Boheme" with Irene Adler, he appears to be the only one Holmes is in love with. Brett's first-rate performance, along with Peter Cushing, are the best Sherlock TVs, while in the cinema it is always Basil Rathbone. Brett acts like a resolute, stubborn, impetuous investigator. Here Doctor Watson is not a comical friend, botcher and clumsy personified by Nigel Bruce, but he is an astute and astute partner well incarnated by Edward Hardwicke, a perfect counterpoint to Brett. The casting is frankly magnificent, a special mention to Robert Hardy as a cunning villain. Hardy, now famous for his role as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter, is a veteran actor with a forty-year career and several successes like, The 10th Kingdom and Winston Churchill. Also appear secondary actors with terrifying performances, Nickolas Grace, Sophie Gordon, Serena Gordon, among others. The film has a colorful atmosphere, the streets of London and the home of 221 Baker Street are well designed. The film is well directed by Peter Hammond, director of various episodes. It's a must see for Arthur Conan Doyle fans.
