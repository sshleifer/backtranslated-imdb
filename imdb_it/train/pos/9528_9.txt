Frankly, this film has gone beyond the heads of most of its detractors. <br /> <br /> The opposite of perdition (being lost) is salvation (to be saved) and this film is one of the few to deal with those two concepts. The film also explores the love and disappointments that accompany the father-son relationship. It should be noted at the outset that none of these themes is currently in fashion. <br /> <br /> The premise is that the fathers on the move, the assassin Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his criminal John Rooney (Paul Newman), love their children and will do everything to protect them. But Rooney's son, Connor, is even more evil than the others. He kills one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to cover his own robbery from his father. When Connor discovers that Sullivan's son, Michael, saw him, he accidentally kills Sullivan's other son (and Sullivan's wife) in an attempt to silence witnesses. Sullivan decides to take revenge at any price, even at terribly high price levels of perdition. Rooney, who curses the day Connor was born, refuses to give up his son Connor to Sullivan, and hires a killer named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. So Rooney joins his son Connor on Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the film, accompanied by his surviving son Michael, Sullivan pursues Connor Rooney along The Road to Perdition, and Maguire chases Sullivan. When Sullivan confronts Rooney in a church basement, and asks to leave Connor because Connor killed his family, Rooney says, "Michael, there are only killers in this room, .., and there is only one guarantee, none of we will see Paradise. " At the end of the film, somehow predictable, a character is saved and a character is repeated. <br /> <br /> I'm not a huge Tom Hanks fan, but he exits the character to convincingly interpret the leading man Sullivan, giving a subtle and laconic performance. Newman is good as the old Irish gangster Rooney, showing a tough side and ways, his eyes tormented by Connor's misdeeds. Jude Law interprets Maguire appropriately creepy. Tyler Hoechlin plays the young Michael naturally and without affectation. <br /> <br /> Cinematography has constantly illuminated darkness, echoing the themes of salvation and perdition. The camera has drawn from a palette of greens and grays. The grays belonged to the fathers and the urban landscapes of the Depression of the Illinois era. The greens belonged to the younger sons and the rural plains of the state. Thomas Newman's lush, resonant and haunting music had slight Irish undertones and played in chords like those of Copland. The sets were authentic Mid-Western urban - factories, churches. The houses shone with shining wooden objects. <br /> <br /> The film's excellence lies in creating a unique feeling among the deep themes, distinctive acting and enveloping music and cinematography. The only negative aspect was a slight anti-bullet message inserted in the script, the film is the only hint of politically correct. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 10 out of 10; over time it will be recognized as a great film.
