Simply fantastic film no doubt about it. Great history and superb performance, whether it's Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal. The Hindi film industry is becoming brazen with Mallika and Co, this film is totally devoid of vulgarity and therefore destined to fail in the vulgarity dependent on our Indian society. But the message and the concept of this film are absolutely superb. Anu Malik (boring copy-cat) could have been avoided and Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya could have been used as musicians. I think Vipul Shah should have given a slightly Gujarati touch especially to music too. Anu Malik is the worst musician around and believes himself popstar but this is not the film in which presence is required - It just looks good with Govinda style songs. I heard that good serious music with a couple of Ghazals or sad songs could have made this movie more memorable.
