I took part in a small mini production of this when I was in school 8 and my mother bought the video for me. I've loved it since then !! When I was younger, it was the spectacular songs and dance sequences that I liked, but since I saw it when I grew up, I mostly appreciate the fantastic acting and character representation. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant. I can't imagine anyone else playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. Nancy by Shani Wallis is the best character for me. He endured so much for those guys, I think he's such a strong character and his final scene when ... Well, you know ... He always makes me cry! The best musical in my opinion of all time. It lasted all this time, it will live for many more years to come! 11/10 !!
