It's not well shot, well written or well acted, but it must be the most compelling show I've seen since Twin Peaks. Every single revelation is timed so well that you have to see the next episode to get any kind of closure. They even slowed the pace of the show where they reveal only small amounts of information per episode, but they seem to have just told you everything you wanted to know. However some of the acting are simply horrible and some of the duologue are decidedly brutal. Some characters are very two-dimensional. The more experienced actors like Locke and Ecko stand out on the actors who play Jack, Kate, Sayid and so on. The development of the show can also be very frustrating as the following episode may not show what the previous episode led to. Annoying side plots have become part of the story that sometimes tell you nothing. However, the second season has developed to a point where previous stories reveal more about the Island than before. All in all it's a great show but not perfect.
