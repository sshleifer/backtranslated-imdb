Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a retired car thief who is forced to leave retirement when he is forced to save the life of his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) when he does a job, completing the work of his brothers to steal 50 cars in one night. He must reunite his old crew he can trust to help him get him out and get his Dutch brother. But the cops are on him, so can you get him out? This was one of the great candidates for a film to be redone, given that the original was far from the classic. And if you don't go inside you expect a lot, and turn off the thinking part of your brain so you can ignore the hole in the plot and take the movie for what it is. You'll end up enjoying the journey. Watch it on a double bill with "Fasting and the Furious" for a night of high-speed hijinks, just don't take the car for a ride immediately afterwards. <br /> <br /> My Grade: B - <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: 7 minutes of interview with Jerry Bruckheimer; Bruckheimer Bio / Filmography; Action overload: highlight the coil; The Big Chase; "Featurette from 0 to 60"; Featurette "Wild Rides"; Stars On The Move; Cult's music video "Painted On The Heart"; Theatrical trailer and trailer for "Shanghai Noon", "Mission to Mars" and "Coyote Ugly"
