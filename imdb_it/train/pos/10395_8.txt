A fantastic Arab adventure. A former king, Ahmad, and his best friend, the thief Abu (played by Sabu of Black Narcissus) seek Ahmad's love interest, which was stolen by the new king, Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There is hardly a negative moment here. Always invent new adventures for heroes. Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a bit boring (no need to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is ranked fourth in the credits). Conrad Veidt, always a funny actor, is a great villain, and Sabu is very funny like the prince of thieves, who at one point finds a genius in a bottle. I also loved Miles Malleson as Sultan of Basra, the princess's father. Collect fantastic toys from all over the world. Jaffar corrupts him at the hands of his daughter with a mechanical flying horse. This will probably count as one of the great children's movies of all time, but nowadays the special effects are horribly dated. The children will certainly deride the overlapping images when Abu and the genius will be on the screen together. And the scene with the giant spider seems particularly terrible. Although most of the younger generations probably think that King Kong looks bad right now, Willis O'Brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a string puppet that doesn't even seem remotely similar to a spider. 8/10.
