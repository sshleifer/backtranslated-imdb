I saw him in Detroit in what must have been his original race. I literally rolled into the theater hallway. It was so funny. I haven't seen him since, but I'd like to. Where do you get a copy? Someone who says it's dated or overdone is, for my money, just a bunch of poseurs. Every script is evil, erotic or perversely exhilarating. Each one! There is not a weak one included. The opening sequence, for example, which parodies 2001, presents gorilla go-go-dancers with the pendulous breast. Felinni would have filmed if he had the evil spirit of spirit ... If you come to this movie with an open mind and a mockingly sneering heart, you will pencil it in your best list.
