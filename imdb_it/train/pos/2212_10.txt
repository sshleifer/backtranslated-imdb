IS! TV is a great channel and Talk Soup is so much fun, in a moment you can watch the episodes change. We want the funniest writings of the best writer ever Stan Evans .. The patron of the mindless masses ... He is a talented writer, actor, smoker, producer, director and creative consultant, talented. Anna Nicole loved him, but he was not a billionaire billionaire, so he left him for a billionaire. Many super stars wanted to make films with actor Stan Evans, who has an acting style of "Humphrey Bogart" {Clark Gable}. He should make a lot more movies. Perhaps with Stephen Spielberg, or perhaps many other talented producers. We wish him a FAME moment with a great fortune to gain. Did you produce any fake U-drama? or maybe some docudrama ??? A project on Bernie Madhoff would be a great TV movie written by STAN EVANS. How many scripts did you write ?? Is it below the price of $$$$$$$$$$$ Billion with Disney ?? He should earn more than $ 50 million ... He could even write a TV movie about the late king of pop .. Michael Jackson. We want to see a lot more than Stan Evans in movies and on TV. Thanks a lot. Elvis left the building !!!!!
