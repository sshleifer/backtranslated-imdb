In 74 Eric Monte produced the classic T.V show Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite and I love watching Reruns on T.V Land. Jimmie Walker always seemed to be the star and not Esther Rolle. John Amos most often felt a little jealous of Jimmie Walker's popularity by winning millions of fans to sit down and watch Good Times. The show would have been dead if JJ wouldn't have been there to save him with his always Kool Aid attitude. Drinking KOOL AID was like his favorite thing on the show. I was 3 when he came out and 8 when he finished. Instead of 1974-1979 it should have gone longer as in the 1980s, when I was growing up.
