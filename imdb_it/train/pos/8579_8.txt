The plot: a crime gentleman is joining 3 different mafias in an enterprise to buy an island, which he would then serve as a money laundering facility for organized crime. To counter this, the FBI attempts to arrest one of the Mafia lords. The thing goes wrong, and from some unexpected twists, we are presented with another film of "friends of the policewoman who do not like each other" ... one is an agent of the FBI female and the other an agent of ex-DEA male. <br /> <br /> So far, so stupid. But the strength of this film does not lie in its history: a bad joke, at best. It is funny. (At least the German synchronized version is). The action is also good, with a memorable scene involving a gunshot and a rocket launcher. But the focus is directly on humor. Satire not intelligent, not just slap, but somewhere in the middle, you get lots of funny jokes. <br /> <br /> However, this film is the opposite of political correctness. The abuse of legal drugs is prominently present, without criticism, and even showing it as a fig. This is the piece of the film that has seriously bothered me, and makes it unsuitable for children, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> All in all, for a nice evening watching the acceptable action with some funny jokes, this movie is perfect. Just remember: in this genre, it is normal to leave the brain at the door when entering the cinema / TV room. Then you will have fun. 8/10
