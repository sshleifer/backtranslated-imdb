Mysterious murders in a European village seem to be the result of the VAMPIRE BAT horde affecting the terrified community. <br /> <br /> This surprisingly effective little thriller was created by Majestic Pictures, one of the Hollywood Poverty Row studios. The scattered production values ​​and the approximate assembly actually add to its disturbing atmosphere and give it an almost expressionist quality. Overall, it leaves the viewer with the feeling of being involved in a bad dream, which is appropriate for such a thriller. <br /> <br /> Even if the explanation for the horrible crimes is rather ridiculous and is not given the right development of the plot, the film can boast a good cast. Grave Lionel Atwill offers another of his typically beautiful performances, this time as a doctor doing scientific research in an old castle. The beautiful Fay Wray plays her assistant in a role that requires her to do little more than look adorable and alarmed. Dour Melvyn Douglas appears as the perplexed police inspector who is also, conveniently, Miss Wray's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Maude Eburne, who could be extremely funny given the right situation, steals most of her scenes as Miss Wray hypochondriac aunt. Elders Lionel Belmore plays the terrifying burgermeister of the village. And little Dwight Frye, who will always be remembered for his strange roles in the films of FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula, is very effective here as a crazy bat lover.
