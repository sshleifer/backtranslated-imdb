How can you go wrong with the incredible Ramones? What a crime two of them are already dead. It reminds me of Dennis Leary's joke about great musicians who die in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you have the idea. <br /> <br /> ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of children without rights who fight against their oppressive high school administration. It is an extremely silly thing, but there is an optimism about it that is refreshing (even if they resort to blowing up the building). Who knew this would actually become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music was important and could make a difference for the larger society. It is full of children who know that authority does not have the correct answers. Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust. <br /> <br /> But more importantly, it is pure exploitation. <br /> <br /> Don't take any seriously. Come in and have fun. If this wasn't high school life in the seventies, then it should have been.
