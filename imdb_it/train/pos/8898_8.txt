The 1960s is a great film (I saw it completely in one night) on the hippy movement in the late 1960s. Although the title would suggest otherwise, the first 5 years of the 1960s are not very important in this film. <br /> <br /> The film's main character is Michael, a political activist who travels to the United States against the Vietnam War. There he meets his girlfriend, Sarah. Michael's brother, Brian, goes to Vietnam to fight (what a surprise!). Returns from the war and changes to "Tom Cruise Born July 4". in a Hippy.His dad is a type of pro-vietnam war (what a surprise !!). Michael's sister, Kate, is pregnant with a Rock & Roll artist and runs away from home and goes to San Francisco during the summer of love. The ending is very poor (the father becomes a liberal and everyone is happy), but I gave up this vote (the rest of the film is very good!). <br /> <br /> The actors' performances are pretty good and the film's soundtrack is absolutely brilliant. All the major events of the sixties are in the film, such as the murders on JFK and Martin Luther King and the great hippy protests, the summer of love and Woodstock! Look closely for Wavy "Woodstock Speaker" Gravy (What we have in mind is the breakfast in bed for 400,000!) As a first aid attendant at the Woodstock festival! <br /> <br /> In the end, the 60s are a beautiful film over a decade! 10/10
