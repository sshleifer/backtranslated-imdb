An unpretentious, slim and slim film, "The Man in the White Suit" is yet another breath of fresh air in the Ealing studios' film format. While I suspect that some modern viewers may initially find it obscure, I doubt that many would fail to be fascinated by the expert way in which the plot, themes and characters are transmitted languidly during the course of the film. <br /> <br /> The real great Alec Guinness gives another beautiful characterization in a film perhaps not so obviously virtuous as "Kind Hearts and Coronets" by Ealing of 1949. This time, he simply plays a character rather than eight, but as the inventor and scientist of Sidney Stratton, he is always finding the correct tone and expression. Along with the subtle and expressive performance of Guinness, the rest of the cast is effective. Among the main players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger stand out. Thesiger is irresistibly disheartened as the nephew of the business, crippled but influential, while Parker is reliable as the owner and father of the ineffective and yet decisive mill. Father, that is, of Joan Greenwood, the talented comic actress, who is at her insurmountable peak in this film. Splendid and seductive in appearance and diction, it is rather sublime in this film, a nice contrast to the Guinness, equally unusual but more clumsy. The scene in which she seems to try to tempt him is so skilfully interpreted by the couple who is both deeply moving and amusing ... <br /> <br /> The themes are managed very effectively, without an easy moral drawn . The complexities of the relationships between science, economics and the workforce are examined intuitively and pleasantly. Expert as director of Alexander Mackendrick, this film is technically expert in all areas; the evocative photography, the adaptation of sound effects, the music and a melancholy screenplay, easily impress. A really satisfying film, with magnificent Guinness and Greenwood. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: - **** 1/2 / *****
