Roman Polanski is considered one of the most important directors of our time, like the mind behind classics like "Rosemary's Baby" and "Chinatown". Probably what makes Polanski's cinema very interesting is the fact that while it is capable of creating commercially interesting films like the masterpieces mentioned above, it is also keen on making low-key films of a more personal nature. "Le Locataire", or "The Tenant", is one of those films; a horror / suspense story about paranoia and the obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror films ever made. <br /> <br /> Polanski plays Telkovsky, a young man looking for an apartment in France. When he finally finds one, he finds that it is empty because the previous tenant, Simone Choule, tried to kill himself by jumping out of the window. After Simone dies of his injuries, Trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her, to the point of believing that his death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the building. <br /> <br /> While sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other "apartment-themed" films ("Repulsion &" Rosemary's Baby "), a film centered on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in Trelkovsky's head , the catastrophic effects that paranoia has on his mind and the bizarre obsession with the previous tenant. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky's descent into darkness is portrayed perfectly by Polanski, while at the beginning his performance seems strange and wooden, slowly it turns out that Polanski acts in that way because Trelkovsky is thought to have acted in that way, like a simpleton with almost no life, that is trapped in this maddening underworld that seems to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people .The secondary actors gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters are very important for the success of the film. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the beautiful Polanski photo employs n el film helps to increase the feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that acts as a cage for Trelkovsky. The haunting images that Polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them at the same time frightening and attractive. <br /> <br /> If there is a flaw in the film, it is that it is certainly a bit slow in the beginning. this may seem like a turn-off, but in reality the slow rhythm of the beginning works perfectly as it imitates the boring life of Trelkovsky and how gradually you enter a different realm. Moreover, the twisted plot is certainly not easy to understand because of the many complex layers it has. However, more than a defect, it is a joy to face a stimulating plot like this. <br /> <br /> While "The Tenant" may not be suitable for everyone, those interested in psychological horror and surreal narrative lines will be satisfied by the experience. "Le Locataire" is truly one of Roman Polanksi's masterpieces. 10/10
