Since I remember, I loved airplanes and flying. Now I'm in college with a private pilot license and I'm trying to become a commercial. I could never remember why I was so obsessed with the subject until I came across my old Tail Spin tapes in my basement at home and it hit me, it was so. My parents bought every single ribbon they had and this was the only show I would watch as a child. I learned the theme by heart when I grew up and can still recreate it today. It's absolutely amazing and I'm going to buy the DVD soon! It is truly exceptional for children and adults and is absolutely timeless. I can't get enough of this show.
