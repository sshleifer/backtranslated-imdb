There are numerous films related to the Second World War, but Mother Night is quite special among them: in this film, Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American resident in Berlin and married to a German, Helga Noth (Lee), is presented decides to accept the role of a spy: More specifically, a CIA agent, Major Wirtanen (Goodman) recruits Campbell who becomes a Nazi propagandist to enter the highest spheres of the Hitler regime. However, the agreement is that the US government will never recognize Campbell's role in the war for reasons of national security, and so Campbell becomes a hated figure throughout the United States. After the war, he tries to hide his identity, but the past returns and haunts him. His only "friend" is Wirtanen, but he too can't do much for the avalanche of events that fall on poor Campbell ... <br /> <br /> The story is deeply moving, as we watch Campbell's tragedy that despite a great patriot, he is treated by the contempt of all those around him. Not only that, but he also gradually understands that even the people closest to him have many secrets. Vonnegut gives us a lively atmosphere, with Campbell's desperation accumulating and almost suffocating the viewer. Nolte plays the role of his life, in my opinion; it is even better than in "Affliction", although in both roles he plays tragic figures destined for self-destruction. Even Sheryl Lee is excellent, and the same can be said for the whole cast in general. <br /> <br /> I have not read the book, so I cannot evaluate how the film compares to it. In any case, it doesn't matter here: my criticism is about the film itself and the film deserves a 9/10 with all my heart.
