John Garfield plays a Marine who is blinded by a grenade while fighting on Guadalcanal and has to learn to live with his disability. He has all the stereotypical notions about blindness and he is sure that it will be a burden for everyone. The hospital staff and his wounded fellow Marines cannot reach him. Not even his girlfriend can go home played by Eleanor Parker. He is stubborn and blinded by his own fears, self-pity and prejudice. It is a complex role that Garfield plays in a memorable way in a great performance that maintains a glance despite the ever-present syrupy melodrama. The best scenes are in Guadalcanal, where he is in a machine gun nest that tries to repel Japanese soldiers advancing in a night battle from hell, and then a dream sequence in the hospital where he is seen walking on a railway platform a white cane, dark glasses, and holding out a tin cup, while his girlfriend walks away from the camera.
