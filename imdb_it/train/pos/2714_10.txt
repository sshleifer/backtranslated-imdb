This was one of those wonderful rare moments in T.V. that I wanted to capture forever on VHS. Will it never come back on the air? <br /> <br /> It was so creative and I remember it was broadcast once a week and the wait for the next episode was atrocious. I want to see everything again. I want to buy it. I want what I can't have. Not even on EBAY. <br /> <br /> So, having sung enough was, by far, one of the best series of the 80s put out. It should be considered a classic but is lost in space. At least this site and Wikipedia mention it. Sob. <br /> <br /> It was absolutely attractive, fun, flirtatious and original. Maybe it's not like the original Sherlock Holmes, but actually I think Quintin is much more attractive and has a better chance with his protagonist than with the stiff and chalky Holmes she has ever been.
