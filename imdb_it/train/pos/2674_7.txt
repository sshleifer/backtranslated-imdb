If the redundancy of getting off the boat, on the boat, off the bus, on the bus ... it's a way to waste time, then you should go back to Hollywood movies that wrap this part in a frame to get to the money shots. and in doing so left without connection and in the cinematographic limbo that derives from not really showing the reality of life. The long travel sequences actually allow the viewer the same frustration and the "waiting" feeling that the characters have to endure. Frustrating? Yup. Vital? Indeed. the limbo of that journey is the key to the "absence of roots" of this Turkish family. Beautiful film with great acting. Sad, but it's worth it.
