I was surprised by the low rating this film received from viewers. I saw him late at night on TV and got it right - I really think he came back in 1989 when he first appeared. Yet I remember it quite well, with a nice lap or two, and an interesting setting on a windmill farm. Michael Pollard seems rightly absurd for his role, which essentially sums up the unfulfilled promises of his career, and all the others interpret it fairly straightforwardly. I would definitely recommend it as a rent, even if some of the themes, which might seem a bit angular in 1989, can now seem domesticated, which is a shame, considering that the contemporary "edgy" is often used only as a necessary marketing tool, a bit like asking for hype just to get noticed.
