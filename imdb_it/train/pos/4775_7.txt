If it's the action and adventure you want in a movie, we suggest you look elsewhere. On the other hand, if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to get along with that mood, take a look at "The Straight Story". <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth stages a compelling performance like gently Alvin Straight, in this true story of Alvin's trip on a three-state lawn mower to see his stranger brother who had a stroke. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth is perfect in this role, as he travels his long and winding road, making friends with strangers and distributing a lot of grandfather type advice about the family along the way. The story moves slowly like the lawnmower in the saddle, but somehow manages to keep the viewer looking, waiting for the next life lesson that Alvin will offer. <br /> <br /> Lie on the couch, relax and enjoy. It's the only way to see this very beautiful film, which evaluates a 7/10 in my book.
