The periodicals were short subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film related to serialized fiction on pulp magazine. Known as "theatrical passages", moving images have been extended, divided into a number of segments called "chapters" or "episodes". Each chapter would be shown in the same theater for a week. The serial will end with a cliffhanger, as the hero and the heroine will find themselves in the last dangerous situation from which there could be no escape. <br /> <br /> The public should come back next week to find out how the hero and heroine would have fled and would have fought the wicked one more time. Serials were particularly popular with children, and for many children in the first half of the 20th century, a typical Saturday at the movies included a chapter of at least one serial, along with cartoons, newsreels and two feature films. > <br /> The golden age for the serials is 1936-1945. This was one of the best of the era. <br /> <br /> Zorro has been seen in many films, but Reed Hadley ("Racket Squad", The Undying Brain) has been excellent in the role. <br /> <br /> The action is constant, and we are guided chapter by chapter towards the ultimate goal where we discover the identity of the evildoer. <br /> <br /> Zorro triumphs, as always.
