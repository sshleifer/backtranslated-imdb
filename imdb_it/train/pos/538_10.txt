The return to the cabin on the lake is perhaps one of the few sequels that can live up to the original. There was Black Humor, Good Suspense, Nice Looking Girls and, of course, Psycho Killer. What are we missing? I don't think anything. Except we were left with a small amount of Gore and Nudity because it was made for television. Besides being one of the best sequels, it is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family. Recommended for everyone.
