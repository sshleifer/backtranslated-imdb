I've never been a big fan of horror movies. They usually look for cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain infinite abundance. The only horror movie I like is Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. He was well acted and had a good story. But it was joined and perhaps even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, probably the scariest movie ever. <br /> <br /> The film follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to monitor a hotel while it is closed for the winter. It was rumored that the place was haunted and the last resident went mad and killed his family. But Jack is convinced that he will be fine and will be able to use silence to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence, however, Jack becomes grumpy and then violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving it crazy? <br /> <br /> One of the most disturbing parts of the film is Kubrick's feeling of isolation. The hotel is very quiet and the rooms are huge, but still empty. He is also strangely calm when Jack's son is cycling through the bare corridors. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his best, scaring me to death and getting me out once in a while. My favorite scene is when he's talking to a ghost from a walk-in refrigerator. <br /> <br /> The Shining is the ultimate horror film in my opinion, beating the shitty snot like Ring and The Blair Witch Project. He may be an old man, but he is certainly a treasure. 8/10
