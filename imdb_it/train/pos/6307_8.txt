I had never heard of this film despite the connection with George Clooney (whose company produced and appeared in a very funny medium) and its director of Ocean's 11, Steven Soderbergh. Worse, we raised this at a discount for $ 4.99 (Canadian dollars at that!) What a great and pleasant surprise. But then I am of the opinion that if William H. Macy were in it, one cannot be disappointed. This was very reminiscent of those Ealing comedies from England in the 1950s. OK, with more swear words. This is a strange and sometimes heartbreaking movie. The current robbery made me laugh so hard that I was crying. Perhaps the funniest use of underwear in the history of cinema. Maybe it was the poor expectations I had but I watched with a group of people and we had a lot of fun. The best $ 5 I spent in age.
