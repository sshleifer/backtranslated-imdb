Nicolas Mallet is a failure. A cashier in a bank, everyone walks on him. Then his friend, a writer who does not like books, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss he is quitting. He plans to spend the rest of his life making a great deal of money and sleeping with many women. And he can do just that. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the amount of death (murder / suicide / natural causes) in the film, this would be a farce. There are numerous blows to marriage, politics, journalism and ... to life. <br /> <br /> Jean-Louis Trintignant is a nice amoral rogue. Romy Schneider is more attractive. Definitely worth a look.
