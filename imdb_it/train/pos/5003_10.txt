I wasn't going to see this show. But I'm glad I did it. Critics of this just don't understand! It's one of the most fun and funny things about T.V at the present time! However, when interviews were done with ordinary people, they probably seemed useless; but, put them in the mouths of animals and insects, and it's a riot of laughter. I laughed so hard, I had tears in my eyes. The pig with nursing babies and his mother is priceless. The birds husband and wife who talk about health problems, and the male bird that takes a crap after his wife said he was constipated completely destroyed me! Creature Comforts is the most imaginative show I've seen in a while! I hope he'll be back next summer when this race is over.
