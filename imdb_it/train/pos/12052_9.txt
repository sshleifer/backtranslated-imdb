I saw it on TV a long time ago that I can't remember when it was, but it's still one of the scariest and scariest movies I've ever seen. There is a fear simultaneously subtle but intense induced by the woman in black that lurks at the edge of the frame, not quite clearly visible, so that you feel (like the hero of the solicitor), uncertain whether it is only imagination or not. It is also one of the few films that really made me afraid to keep watching. "Production values" are hanged, good films are about a director's ability to create atmosphere using films, actors, locations / sets, music, attention to detail and ... imagination. A real gem.
