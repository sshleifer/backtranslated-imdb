I only saw this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. Being made almost 30 years ago, I thought the moments of fear would have been rather quiet. The boy was wrong. There are some great moments that sent shivers down my spine. The acting was great too, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and Donald Pleasance was superb. <br /> <br /> The negative aspect can be quite slow to start, but once you proceed you can't stop it. It makes all the scripts, eg Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream looks very tame. I can't really say he is the best of Carpenter because I haven't seen many, the only one I remember of him is Starman (I think he made it). Halloween is the crowning achievement of the horror genre.
