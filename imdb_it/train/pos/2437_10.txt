To say that this film is simply a demonization of Catholics and a false representation of history is not true. This film is not this. <br /> <br /> What this film is is a comment on the abuses of the Church (although this could be replaced by any powerful body), the ways in which this abuse affects people and families and the way so many people simply choose to allow and often participate in abuse without thinking about themselves. The fact that the Catholic Church is wrong is simply because of the nature of the true story on which the film is based. Defining it as propaganda against Catholics seems to lose the truth about what the Catholic Church has done sometimes; his story is often not exceptional and is something that films like this highlights and must be highlighted. Yes, we should comment on the abuses committed by other organizations, but this is not for the purpose of this film. <br /> <br /> It is a fantastic film that brought me to tears and it is worth looking at - "If we don't study it in the past, we have to repeat it '
