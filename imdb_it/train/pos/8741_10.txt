"A Bug's Life" is like a favorite candy bar: it's packed with little pieces that add up to something really tasty. <br /> <br /> The plot could not have been better; he is intelligent, has "heart" (emotion) and each character has a "bow" (a growth or a change). In comparison, the only characters in "Toy Story" to have a "bow" are Buzz, who learns to love being a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his resentment towards Buzz. There are tons of laughs and nice moments in "A Bug's Life". All the actors make a great vocal work, and the animation, both the movement and the details, is superb. <br /> <br /> This serious movie fan does not revolve around "10", but this film certainly deserves the "10" I gave.
