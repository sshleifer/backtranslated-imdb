This film does a great job of representing the suffering of an ALS patient (Lou Gehrig's Disease). The topic is done with compassion and humor. Helena Bonham Carter is as convincing as a person with ALS who found it hard to believe she was acting. Kenneth Branagh, a superb actor, lives up to expectations as the bizarre artist who behaves badly and is forced to provide company to the character of Helena as part of his "community service", an alternative to prison time. Looking at the development of the relationship between these two is a treatment from beginning to end. The fact that it's a fairy tale doesn't detract from the fabulous performances. One comes to take care of them deeply.
