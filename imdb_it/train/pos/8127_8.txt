Although it is a bit ambiguous on the subject of progress as the saving grace of humanity, this is still a breathtaking film that foreshadows the science fiction successes with special effects that would take another 40 years to reach the silver screen. It predicts the global chaos of the Second World War, but expands on the premise by making the conflict last for 30 years, and then tells the epic story of man's struggle out of the rubble and wilds of space. The acting seems wooden and strangely sterile, but this is perhaps the result of its contrast with the images that must have been absolutely breathtaking at the time of the release of the film, and which still impress today. This is a film not to be missed by anyone interested in the SF genre.
