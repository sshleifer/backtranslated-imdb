Kurt Russell is strong and (mostly) silent in this futuristic action thriller by Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil.) Set on a trash planet, Soldier sounds like a cross between Rambo and Shane, with Russell talking to barely a title character, an "obsolete" genetic soldier left for dead. The settlers' supporting cast, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and a surprisingly angry Michael Chiklis, is able. They spend most of the film scared by Russell, and the rest runs for their lives. Russell's performance here is one of the best I've ever had. With almost no word to say, it conveys emotion, feeling and meaning with looks and looks. It's almost a mime performance. When the action sequences go into action, he gets his ass kicked - and he does it in a strong, silent and concrete way. There are faults Jason Scott Lee is as brutal as a "superior" genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs makes a big impression of Frank Burns from M * A * S * H ​​as a skinny commanding officer, and Gary Busey busts a gut (and almost busts his belt) as Todd's mentor. This is an underrated and excellent sci-fi movie, recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the Blade Runner universe - David Webb Peoples wrote both screenplays.
