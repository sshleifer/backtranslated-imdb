Time For A Hit! <br /> <br /> Waqt Dir- Vipul Amrutlal Shah Cast- Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani. Written by- Aatish Kapadia Rating- *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We have it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen ?? in Vipul Shah's "Waqt", we probably found the first bona fide success this year. Filled with all the necessary ingredients of a commercial Bollywood fare, "Waqt" has everything you need for a movie to click with the Indian public. It's the kind of movie that makes a distributor feel happy and contemplates his next visit to the phoren! In this "saga of Indian emotions", therefore, we have a happy family (isn't it always?) Of three. Ishwar (Amitabh Bachchan), the postman who became a millionaire (don't ask how! ... there is something about the sale of toys while delivering the letters and all that is serious - who cares!), Married with Sumi ( Shefali Shah) is an adoring father of Aditya (Akshay Kumar). Ishwar must make a serious decision about his son's negligent attitude towards life responsibilities. His love for Aditya, however, translates into his procrastination of the grave problem. However, faced with a situation that will test his race against time, Ishwar has no alternative but to throw Aditya out of the house, hoping that the new situation will make him more conscientious of his life. But this supposed solution becomes in itself a problem, as the rift between the loving father-son increases and the fences continue to grow. <br /> <br /> You don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such a story offers ample opportunity to infuse comedy and drama in the same way. So, pre-interval, you have the first and most fun and boring comedy by Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav; and post-break there are the best moments for your handkerchief between Aby and Akki! The writer Aatish Kapadia (he also wrote the original of Gujarati "Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu" on which the film is based) does a good job in maintaining the narrative fluid. The dialogues tend to become inconsistent at times. It doesn't help songs to look like acne on a teenager's face and ruin the process. Clearly, a couple of numbers could have been eliminated. On the management front, Vipul demonstrates its natural talent for storytelling. 'Waqt', as well as his previous debut 'Aankhen', manage to keep the interest until the last reel. On a personal note - the thrill of emotions was a bit jerky for me. But judging by the reactions of the public, it worked to the end. <br /> <br /> Finally, "Waqt" focuses on its performance which equals one point in the overall ranking! Amitabh Bachchan is as reliable as ever. His energy is visible and so is his age! Shefali launches a finely nuanced performance and matches the superstar with every step. Boman and Rajpal cut down the house with their histrionics. Priyanka has little to do but fulfill the superficial role of a heroine. When everything is reduced, however, 'Waqt' is Akshay's vehicle. I have always maintained that Akki is as good as the role that suits him. Put it in a 'Mujhse Shaadi Karogi' and it's fantastic, but in a 'Bewafaa' it's sadly bad. Here, Akki is probably at its best. Whether it's his comic times or his emotional representations, it's almost perfect. There is also an action scene for his fans! Ironically, his previous best effort was in 'Aankhen'- with the same director and Big B by his side! <br /> <br /> 'Waqt' is not a memorable film at all. It is not one of the best films in our industry. But it's one for the masses. And at a time when the industry is waiting desperately for universal success, "Waqt" could simply do the trick! <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Curiosity - This is the second consecutive Akshay Kumar film after "Bewafaa", in which he performs on stage during the climax! <br /> <br /> Evaluation- *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Medium *** Good *** * Very good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> 22 April 2005
