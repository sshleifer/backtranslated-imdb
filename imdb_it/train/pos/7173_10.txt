I just watched the documentary "Fog City Mavericks" on the Starz cable TV network. It is without doubt one of my most enjoyable viewing experiences ever! Describes the artists from the San Francisco Bay area and the creative talent responsible for some of the best films ever made. In addition to the well-known artists listed, t also includes segments with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and a segment on Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it will be distributed on DVD, this is a must for any collection on the history of cinema and the fantastic film. If you are even remotely interested in movies and the people who create them, you will not be disappointed.
