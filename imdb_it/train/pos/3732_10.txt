Producer Joel Schumacher, who also directed "Phone Booth", "02" and many other great films, showed in great detail how no person can be trained to become a killing machine without destroying his personality and true fears what a person has to face when entering COMBAT !! Colin Farrell (Roland Bozz), "Intermission", '03, gave one of his best performances and actually brought this whole picture on his back. Matthew Davis (Jim Paxton), "Blue Crush", '02, gave a great supporting role and Shea Whigham (Pvt.Wilson), "All The Real Girls", '03, showed his true acting skills in the role who played. There were two brief scenes in which the soldiers were able to find some warm romance on a short visit to the local city and had to pay for their love and sexual desires. A veteran Vietnam Army instructor told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy using electrical wires in all the wrong places of a male human body. Fun and entertaining movie to watch.
