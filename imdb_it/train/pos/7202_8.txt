Long before "Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years earlier), "Deathtrap" was the first time I saw two men kissing passionately on the screen, and honestly I was shocked. I understood it in terms of plot, and it didn't really change my sensitivity (not much), but it was the first time I saw it, at least, in a "mainstream" movie. I thought it was a brave move for his time, and I took courage for them to try it, especially Christopher Reeve, in the middle of his time as PG-rated Superman. Male bisexuality on the screen may have reached the right point with "Brokeback", but it is interesting to note this very first incarnation.
