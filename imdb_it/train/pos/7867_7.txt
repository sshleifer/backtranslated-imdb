Madhur by CHANDNI BAR started making realistic films, which some have called dry <br /> <br /> He has made SATTA, another realistic but filmed movie, but a great film <br /> <br /> AAN men at work was a film he formulated that he flopped <br /> <br /> Back with his superlative PAGE 3 <br /> <br /> A film that fits into the lives of journalists and is a brilliant film <br / > <br /> The film is well narrated even though Konkana's half-cooked romantic portions could be avoided but this is forgiven <br /> <br /> The entire Upendra Limaye track is superb too <br /> < br /> while Atul Kulkarni's track <br /> <br /> The dial between Manoj Joshi and his friends are fun at first but repetitive at times <br /> <br /> The Bikram-Tara subplot is brilliant , as well as the entire hospital scene and even the abuse of the final child that upsets you <br /> <br /> The film has an open ending that is well managed <br /> <br /> Madhur makes a great job Music is ok <br /> <br /> Konkana excels as Mad havi, using his expressions for the best Tara Sharma is decent except his voice Sandhya Mridul is good as usual Upendra Limaye excels in his part as a policeman , one of the talented actors Sadly not well used today Even Atul Kulkarni is good at his small part Boman Irani is contained and does a good work rest is fine
