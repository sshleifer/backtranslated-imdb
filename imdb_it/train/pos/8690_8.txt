Alain Resnais' films are disturbing in the way they are not really modified for continuity, but instead the shot seems to end exactly where a memory has been modified. Love to Death is sometimes a silent existential drama and a circularly creative magical realist film, and in both cases it treats the public of a completely new aspect of the Eros / Thanatos relationship ... or perhaps creates a new relationship, that of Agape / Thanatos. <br /> <br /> The beginning is like a bizarre surrealist horror film. A woman desperately runs into the house while a man is dying in his bed - did he kill him, or what happened? Soon the tension dissolves when a doctor arrives and declares him dead, but from there begins a more new and unknown drama: the man wakes up and, after being dead, the woman and the man fall in love with really tragic consequences. Meanwhile, their friends, who are both priests, observe and present their debate on the nature of love, faith and devotion. <br /> <br /> Resnais always seems to have some way of making these types of fiction work and what is so surprising about his films is that those devices always work. In this case, Resnais intercedes with the snowstorm scenes that fall on a fading orchestral soundtrack, which fades and bleeds in successive shots that continue the story. Trapped periodically by this elegiac, the film develops a rhythm not too different from an epic, and I got strange flashbacks of Dante's Divine Comedy from this, despite the lack of direct references within the film. Resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker, but this extends beyond the structure of the cinepoema to something that forces a certain degree of introspection in the viewer, which has the possibility of bringing out some bizarre memories. Memory-narrative, creates Resnais. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
