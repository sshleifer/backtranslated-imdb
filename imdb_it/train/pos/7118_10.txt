This is a great classic movie from the 40s and well produced. There are very dramatic scenes in this film with John Garfield, (Al Schmid), "Force of Evil", "48 and Dane Clark, (Lee Diamond)," Last Rites "," 88, fighting the Japs during the Second World War completely surrounded and with only one machine gun. When Al Schmid was able to return home after being injured by a horrible injury, his problems have just begun with his family and girlfriend. Dane Clark gave Lee Diamond an exceptional supporting role, who did everything to help his friend Al regain his life. There is never a complete victory in the War and let's not forget all the Brave Wounded Military personnel at Veterans Hospitals from All the Wars and our current Iraq veterans!
