"SÃ¥ som i himmelen" .. as above so below .. that very special point where Divine and Human meet. I LOVE this movie! A gem. YES incredible grace! <br /> <br /> I was so deeply moved by his own HUMAN quality. I laughed and cried through an entire register, in fact several octaves of emotions. <br /> <br /> Mikael Nyqvist is BRILLIANT like Daniel, a passionate performance of the first order, charismatic and powerful. His inner light and exceptional talent shines through in every scene, every interaction, in every encounter. I was totally hypnotized, enchanted and captured the story, which is our collective history, the history of life itself. <br /> <br /> The film was also so inclusive of many archetypes, messiah, wounded child, magical child, artist, teacher, priest, rapist, abused, victim, bully, crazy mad - ALL the characters so true and faithful to life - all have awakened great affection and compassion in me. <br /> <br /> It is a real pleasure to see a movie so engaging and fun. Oh ... don't forget the heavenly choir of angels and the incredibly beautiful sound. <br /> <br /> THANKS TO EVERYONE - This Swedish film will surely win people around the world. BRILLIANT!
