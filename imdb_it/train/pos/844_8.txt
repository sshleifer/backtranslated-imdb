A chance encounter between a salesman and a hit man changes both their lives. This is a strange film that works, an impressive effort for writer and director Shepard. In a boldly inelegant role that is very different from James Bond, Brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lonely killer who starts to give in under the stress of his job, but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope. Kinnear is just as good as the salesman, a good guy with a void in his life. Davis is good as Kinnear's flirtatious wife. Primarily a character study, the film is rewarding because it looks fresh and unpredictable, an extremely dark comedy.
