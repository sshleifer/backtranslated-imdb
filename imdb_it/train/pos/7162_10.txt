This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I read the book and liked it, but this film expands on everything the book has made famous. The acting is fantastic, especially from Jon Voight, who plays Mr. Sir, a very evil character. This film has a certain way of telling stories that keeps you glued everywhere, until the end, where everything is combined for a fantastic ending. I also like the way this is directed, flashing back and forth between the modern day and the stories of Stanley's ancestors. The story was written by Louis Sachar, yes, but it seems this story is made for film, and Andrew Davis does a great job directing it. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves good movies.
