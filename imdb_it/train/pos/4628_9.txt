One of the best parts of Sundance is to see films that you would otherwise miss. Unless you are a true devotee of art, you probably don't take many documentaries. Only a handful get a recognizable distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its commitment to documentaries in recent years. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare Behind Bars is a powerful documentary on a drama group at the Luther Luckett Correctional Complex in LaGrange, Kentucky. Every year a group of prisoners presents a Shakespearean comedy. Director Hank Rogerson and his crew follow the crew while the roles are self-selected, interpreted, tested and finally performed. <br /> <br /> The film is full of fascinating revelations for those of us who have not been exposed to prison environments. Despite the labels we know (convicted, criminal, murderer, etc.), we soon started to appreciate and respect these men as people who feel feelings. Serendipitamente, the show chosen for the shooting year was The Tempest, with its penetrating attention to forgiveness and redemption. The actors test themselves with the relevance of the game in their lives, discovering patterns and parallels with their characters and the meaning of the drama. <br /> <br /> For a documentary film, like a book, the best that can be hoped for is that we experience something that changes our lives. Shakespeare Behind Bars was a personal revelation for me. "O brave new world, which has such creatures in it."
