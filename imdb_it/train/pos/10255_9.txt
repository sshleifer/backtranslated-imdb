This film is the first of the six notorious Guinea Pig films and is one of the best. At the same time, it seems realistic and unrealistic, only knowing that the film is fake. The story is about a woman captured and tortured in many different ways. A man at the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address, and includes a video manga, which shows the torture. The men who capture it are testing the limits of a human before they die. Some scenes are shocking, such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl who is stabbed 100 times, because you see punches in almost all the movies. This film has a lot of blood so I would recommend it to people at least 17 years old. <br /> <br /> 9/10
