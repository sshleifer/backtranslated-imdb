Darius Goes West is a film that describes the American belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough. This wonderful film full of fun and sometimes heartbreaking shows a young man who never expected, but wanted to see, what was outside the confines of his beautiful city of Athens, GA. Darius wanted to see the ocean. His longtime friends, Logan, Ben and many other good friends decided to fulfill Darius's wish. They started small - Ben & Logan's mom started an email campaign to raise awareness of Darius's condition: Duchenne muscular dystrophy and raise funds for the kids so that Darius not only saw the ocean but saw these big US. To say that the young college mates managed to bring hope and awareness to this dreaded disease would be an understatement. They realized the dream of Darius and then some. They pause their lives as they show love, care and so much fun to Darius as they help Darius see how he can in turn show those same traits to others who suffer from DMD. Darius continued to volunteer for the Red Cross - sitting in his chair collecting money (with his friends) outside a local grocery store. Her wonderful smile tells the world that dreams come true: all you need is a hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you. Give Darius and all the boys an Oscar - no one else deserves it more. Martha Sweeney.
