Great drama with all the areas covered EXCEPT for the script, which was too slow and would have had to show more relevant scenes like the Pitt character interviewing the president, or Pitt being murdered instead of simply describing it. Scenes like that would have kept him awake the public. Canceling some useless minutes could have given more space to more suggestive scenes like those. The drag of the film has always maintained this beauty, even if to see Pitt here makes the film so worthy of being seen. Also, big Fising fans, soon 20th century styles and Montana will love them too ........
