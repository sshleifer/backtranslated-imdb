There seem to be only two types of reviews of this movie on the net. Those who hate him and curse the name of Ralph Bakshis and they love him and call him genius work. I'm inclined to stay in the middle. I am forced to agree with most of the criticisms of this film (for example the cruel cut of history, the rotoscated charlatans, the acting etc ...) But despite this I still love this film. Rotoscoping (when done correctly) adds a mysterious realistic dimension to the characters and the final scene of the battle at the end of the film is fantastic. The surreal scenes in which the nineriders chase Frodo are elegant and well executed and the musical score ... magical. Sadly, the weak point is the outgoing film, but if you can get yourself ignored it is a great film. <br /> <br /> (No doubt I will be lynched by an angry mob of people who hate this movie after writing this review, ah well, such is life)
