As part of our late 50s vocabulary, we were familiar with the Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, etc. in that great show "Bonanza". <br /> <br /> It arrived Saturday night and everyone was glued to the TV. This was a real show that showed family values. There may have been a weekly crisis, but it was the strong family atmosphere that brought everyone together. <br /> <br /> Lorne Greene was dominant as the patriarch of the family. His words represented wisdom. We often stayed to ask ourselves that Ben Cartwright, a widower, must have been the best of husbands for that poor wife of those who had died. He raised wonderful children. <br /> <br /> Of course, we wondered why Pernell Roberts left the show. The show was a gold mine and Roberts gave up a lot of money when he left. His career never took off as he was associated as Cartwright's son. He should have tried to return to the series. He certainly lost a gold mine and left behind.
