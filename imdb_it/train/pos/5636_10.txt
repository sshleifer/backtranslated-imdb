In "Brave New Girl", Holly comes from a small Texas town, sings "The Yellow Rose of Texas" in a local competition and is admitted to a prestigious art college in Philadelphia. From there the film turns into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I loved this movie. It was full of great songs and acting and characters that kept him moving at a very pleasant pace. The acting was, of course, wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were exceptional, as was Nick Roth. The work with the camera was done really well and I was very satisfied with the end (it seems that a sequel could be in progress). Congratulations to the director and all the others who participated in this production. Rather a jewel in the film archives.
