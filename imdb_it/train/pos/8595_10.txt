I can admit that the script is not very good and that it has some slow parts, but all of you critics of this film have to learn to have fun. First of all, the performances are great (Michael Douglas, Kim Basinger, Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria), Michael Douglas proves he still understands and Kim Basinger plays a very interesting character like the sullen wife Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria, playing the duo dynamic, both adding their incredible talent to the plate and, secondly, this film is the most fun I've had over the years in a Theodore. It's simple and simple, if you want to go to the movies and have a lot of fun seeing, The Sentinel.
