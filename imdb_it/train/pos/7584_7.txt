This PM Entertainment production is full of enough bullets to make John Woo say: "Enough already!" Of course, it's not as nice as Woo can provide but it does make the exploiter work in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is an undercover cop in the near future. When his wife is framed for killing the Governor by a team that uses a look-like cyborg, it's Eric's job to make his name clear. Wilson gets the job of Van Damme as he plays the heroic protagonist and his diabolical cyborg doppelganger. Because the Academy has not taken notice is beyond me. Being a PM production, there are tons of car chases, cars that explode (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And they shoot out. I particularly liked the van that swivels in mid-air before it comes close to touching an exploding truck. My other favorite piece was a girl from the neighborhood who came over to perfect her karate in Don's simulator. It's just a chance to show some of the effects of Cheapo LAWNMOWER MAN around 1995.
