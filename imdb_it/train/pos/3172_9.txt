Debut? Wow - Cross-Eyed is easily one of the funniest indie films I've seen in the last year, making it hard to believe that Cross Eyed is the writer's debut film. I mean - I recorded on IMDb to find other films by this writer ... because Cross Eyed has that unique signature - you want to see what else this writer could say. These days it is rare to see a well-written, well-directed, well-maintained and well-acted film. For me - Cross Eyed sums up what should be the creation of a film - combining the best of all the elements of the film to create an intelligent, artistic and touching story. More please.
