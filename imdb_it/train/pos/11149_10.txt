Joe Buck (Jon Voight) decides to leave his small life in Texas and make it big in the Big City. The women are there to ask and the men are mainly "all-fruttis". With his eyes wide open, he arrives in New York City, unprepared for the series of humiliating mishaps he experiences, one worse than the other. In the midst of that chaos, he meets and befriends Rico "Ratso" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffmann), a homeless who lives in an apparently doomed building. <br /> <br /> There is not much of a story as MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a series of cartoons intended to bring forward not only the suffering of Joe Buck in the City, but also intertwine with his past and show us in shock and sequences of semi-psychedelic dreams fragments of his past: his failed relationship with his girlfriend Annie (Jennifer Salt) who was raped by a gang, her abandonment by her mother and her apparent abuse by her grandmother, who he also had the habit of passing off men for money. An air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the melancholy beginning, while Nilsson plays his deceptively flourished "Everybody's Talking" in the opening credits; we feel that even if we want Joe to eventually leave the mark in the City, the odds are high that he won't and will end up working for a few cents in a landlocked job - shown in a masterly stroke from his outer point of look later in film watching a man who works like a dishwasher in a kitchen canteen through a window and sees himself. We know from the look in his eyes that he doesn't want to end like this. <br /> <br /> A dark story of dashed hopes, John Schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls in the late 1960s, and in the center, the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sense of their life in the elusive comfort of a dignified life. There is the implicit idea that they may have been lovers - Ratso is trying to hug Joe in the party scene and their last embrace, in the end, certainly points to this - but this is essentially a friendly film that manages to survive, literally, to death, and bringing some form of hope to Joe who ultimately looks very changed, older, wiser in Florida.
