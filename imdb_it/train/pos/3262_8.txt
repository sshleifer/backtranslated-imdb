I don't think I could have had more fun, even though some things were scary. I won't say what, if you haven't seen it ... you'll have to find out for yourself. However, what movie can Robert Downey Jr.'s puppy eyes miss? Overall, the plot has been developed sufficiently. Nothing seemed too rushed, as films like this tend to be. The characters were fantastic, and there were many funny scenes. The general idea is that the story is very well connected, although some aspects may be unsatisfactory ... for matters of opinion. But as I said before, it's hard not to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
