James Michener's books that took readers to faraway places with strange sounding names were probably the most popular in the 40s and 50s. His South Pacific Tales became a huge Broadway success for Rodgers & Hammerstein. South Pacific was directed by Joshua Logan and it was natural for the film adaptation of another Michener hit, Sayonara. <br /> <br /> It was only a decade before American films during World War II represented the Japanese kindly. I'm sure it wasn't easy for people who fought the Pacific war to change attitudes during the night. That and a general policy of non-fraternization with the occupied peoples in general are at the center of this story about interracial romanticism. <br /> <br /> Sayonara is a relevant film today. The military has always relied on the personal lives of its staff so that no civilian employer could get by legally. In America, at the time Sayonara was created, there were still laws on crossover in books in many states. Gays in the military are a big problem today. Someone could one day make a movie like Sayonara on that theme. <br /> <br /> Joshua Logan was on familiar ground. Even the South Pacific had racism as part of its plot. With a sure hand, Logan has assembled a great cast and made a beautiful story. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner, Kent Smith some of the western players do a great job. But the image was stolen from the Orientals here. Miko Taka strikes beautifully as Brando's love interest. But the real protagonists are the two that both supporters Oscars, Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki supporters. <br /> <br /> Buttons is your Air Force member. He passionately falls in love with Katsumi played by Miyoshi Umeki. They marry and the military cruelly do everything they can to break them. They presume to KNOW what is best for Buttons and Umeki. Buttons was a television comedian and a decent talent, but he never had such a good part as the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> And Miyoshi Umeki's Oscar was the first to be assigned to an Oriental. He got a lot of attention because at the time of the Academy Awards, Miyoshi starred on Broadway in Flower Drum Song. I had the privilege of seeing him on Broadway, it was the first Broadway show I've ever seen. I still remember it. <br /> <br /> This Oscar also symbolized something else. Our war with Japan was over and we saw Sayonara as a great nation with a proud tradition and culture. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Montalban plays Nakamura, an actor from the Kabuki theater. If Sayonara were finished today, Logan would never have gotten away with it. But Montalban is fine. <br /> <br /> Good location photography and a great story. This film should be filmed more often has a great moral.
