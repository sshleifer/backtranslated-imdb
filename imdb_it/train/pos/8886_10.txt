I wasn't alive in the 1960s, so I can't guarantee that this film was a completely accurate representation of the period, but it's certainly a moving and rewarding experience. There are some excellent performances, in particular Josh Hamilton (with With Honors), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), who plays brothers divided by the war. Bill Smitrovich, a character actor who has long been ignored by many, gives a heartfelt performance like the stern father, who is forced to question his beliefs and values ​​as one of his sons makes him proud by going to Vietnam but returns empty inside, while the other is exactly the opposite. All in all, this is a powerful and moving film that I hope everyone has the chance to experience.
