As others have said, all naked women in this film are mostly absolutely stunning. The plot deftly shows the hypocrisy of female libido. When men are around, they want to be prosecuted, but when there are no "men" around, they become the pursuers of a 14-year-old boy. And the boy becomes a very fast man (we should all be so lucky at this age!). Then the courage to pursue his true love rises.
