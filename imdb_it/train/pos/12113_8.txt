I usually avoid TV movies because of the many ways you know they are five second TV movies in the picture. This caught my attention because of the unusual title and its dark and well-made mood that was established from the beginning. While the ever-present rain confirmed my suspicions about a misplaced story (although claiming to be set in California, the film was mostly shot around a stormy Vancouver, C.), darkness and the oppressive open air beautifully complement the excellent acting of Olmos.
