One of the best, if not the best rock'n'roll movies ever. And it's not just unreasonable fun. There were really a lot of smart jokes. Of course I love the Ramones. But with all the themes "anarchy" and "I hate high school", the film does not take itself too seriously, which is fantastic. <br /> <br /> I saw the film for the first time in the spring of 1980 and I recently reviewed it. Since I went to high school in the late 1970s, I was a bit nostalgic. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film does not take itself seriously and is not as pretentious as so many other teenage things of the seventies, eighties and nineties. And talk about, it's not really dirty or disgusting. PG only evaluated. This is rare for a film in this category. A great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule.
