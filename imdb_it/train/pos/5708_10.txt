This is so exciting! After seeing "La Roue" this afternoon, a small and light short film, I consider this a real surprise! This is absolutely delicious and one of the most fascinating images I've seen this year. It is the most surprising since it is an old talkie and puts some good photos of the 1930s to shame for its innovative use of sound in cinema. He is simply full of music and an adorable mood that is really optimistic and ultimately made me happy! Obviously it would not be so difficult to recover the lottery ticket that the male protagonist was looking for, but the rhythm is so hilarious and the film is so extraordinarily funny that I didn't even think twice about it. Comedy is often hilarious and I think it is even superior to the Marx Brothers, perhaps the greatest comic force of the time. This is pretty perfect.
