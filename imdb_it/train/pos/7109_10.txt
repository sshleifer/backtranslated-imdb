First of all, let's start with the negative points: 1) There are HUGE, deep integers in the plot and questions that will never be reached; 2) The film is not for all people, so rude viewers will become restless and begin to yawn during the film. <br /> <br /> Point two above is important because the film is very quiet. In an older type theater (like the one I went to), you can hear the coil spanning the projector sometimes. I loved it. The film does not keep you busy with music, nor the effects: it allows you to reflect on what is happening. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of rhythm that creates an atmosphere that is fascinating and absolutely enjoyable. The same kind of atmosphere generated by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to movie fans, because the film work is fantastic. Those who base their appreciation on a film exclusively on history will be completely disappointed. It's the kind of story you need to create the links in your mind later. (My version is quite nice, but probably quite out of the way!) If you go to get the movie, there's a very interesting part: when the two cops talk to each other on their cell phones. An ultra-cool sound effect that really puts you right now. An affectionate greeting to the person who thought about doing it.
