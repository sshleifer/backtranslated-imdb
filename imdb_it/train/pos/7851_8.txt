The Cameraman's Revenge is an unusual short film not because of the subject (adultery) or because it is animated (Winsor McCay had presented Little Nemo at this time) but because it describes bugs to tell the story! Ladislaw Starewicz originally wanted to film the real bugs they were fighting, but he couldn't get them to do the camera because of the hot lights they had suffered, so he took the dead ones and started using stop-motion techniques to manipulate the movements satisfactorily . This short does a good job of putting human characteristics on little creatures like riding a motorcycle, painting, filming, kissing and dancing. Starewicz would also have made Frogland (1922) and The Mascot (1933), but his first major work would have been this.
