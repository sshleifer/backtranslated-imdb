Some critics found this film bleak, but for me there was enough good humor and optimism to overcome this impression. For example, the quietly positive and stoic character of the daughter is the still center of the film, often counterbalancing the unhappy aspects of the setting and the plot. <br /> <br /> The film is full of original ideas and characters, and the end result is not predictable: I thought it could have gone either way. <br /> <br /> By the way, many reviews I read mention the effective use of black and white, but the print I saw, shown on the SBS TV network here in Australia, was in color. <br /> <br />
