At that time, "My Left Foot" was the little movie he could. It was very popular, and everyone applauded the fact that such a small, independent film could reach the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Since then, films like "My Left Foot" have been a dozen times, so it might be difficult, a posteriori, to figure out what it was. It is certainly a well-made and competent film, but it is clear that the bulk of his success lies on the shoulders of Daniel Day-Lewis, who plunges into the role of Cristy Brown, a man who lives with cerebral palsy. Day-Lewis brings out the same piece of acting that Dustin Hoffman had won an Oscar the year before for playing a man with autism in "Rain Man", and the Academy followed the example by giving Day-Lewis the same honor. <Br /> <br /> The only thing that really separates this film from a big-budget Hollywood production is just that: its budget. In any other way it is just as formidable as any standard product. This does not mean that it is not a good film, but it is not a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Vote: A-
