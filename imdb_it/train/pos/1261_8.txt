I really enjoyed this movie. All three stars (Connery, Fishburne and Underwood) offer credible performance and Harris is pleasantly exaggerated. The lighting and camera angles in some scenes of Harris make his face really diabolical. The surprising turn of the plot eventually makes it interesting. Not a great movie, but a nice one. I gave it 7 out of 10.
