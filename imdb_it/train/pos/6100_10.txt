This is a very funny (and sexy) movie - it's not just silly but it has fantastic acting. It's the kind of movie where the characters are so funny that you feel like you're connected to everyone in the theater. I saw it at the Boston festival, and I often found myself laughing out loud with everyone else, and also moved by some of the more serious parts of the film. It's a unique film about two doctors, and I don't want to give anything but there are powerful and also very funny scenes - and the dialogue is fantastic. The character of Wood Harris has a unique relationship with his girlfriend, Zoe Saldana, and Brian White and Mya are also fun and sexy in their roles. If you have the chance to see it - go - you won't be disappointed. It is worth seeing it again. Wood Harris deserves an award.
