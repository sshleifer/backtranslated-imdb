This is my favorite of old Tom & Jerry cartoons from the early 1940s. The original version with Mammy Two Shoes is on the Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2 set, disc one and shows the wonderful detailed animation of the first cartoons. The gags on this are not all Avery-style crazy, but more subtle and aimed at anyone who's ever been up late watching scary movies (or radio shows)! Tom is listening to a creepy radio show, and Jerry decides to do a series of tricks to scare him. The nine-screw gag is well done here, and I don't know how many times I've tried to make a void and a scary sheet when I was a child. When Tom's owner is awakened from the ruckus - Mammy was NOT the maid, it was her home - she gets a nice surprise, with a big laugh. Prepare your pause button, it's worth it!
