Terry Gilliam's extraordinary feature adaptation of Chris Marker's short film, LA JETEE, is full of amazing surprises, yet it still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast. Gilliam's talent for phantasmagorical works with the script of David and Janet Peoples to play with your head as much as with poor James Cole (Willis to his style of Steve McQueen - better than McQueen, too!), A time - a convicted of traveling from the future who literally does not know if he will arrive or leave, as a team of scientists continues to send him back to the wrong times while trying to prevent a plague in 1995 that is deadly for humans but harmless to animals. Willis, rightly Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-intentioned psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers. Paul Buckmaster's tango-style score is also haunting. This is a must-see!
