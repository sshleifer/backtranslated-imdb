In general, the plot was much better than I expected. Laughter was a little annoying at times and tended to intrude; however, there was enough laughter in this episode to fix it. My biggest surprise was finding some of the best lines and the situations weren't shown in the trailers. Spade, in particular, was not presented in the best light of previous promotions, but his character comes across quite well in the pilot. There is enough makeup to please almost everyone and all the normal characters seem to live up to the task ahead. Now, if writers can simply live up to what they started.
