I just want to say that out of all the so-called classic hiphop movies I've seen like Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Style Wars etc ... IMO BEAT STREET is the best among others. Every time I ask other people what their favorite is, it seems that BEAT STREET is the most beautiful. But still, it is the lowest of all. 4.3 is just a punch "under the belt" (if you say, 5 points is the belt). I love musical performances, breakdance makes me turn, RAMO makes me want to launch a piece ... come on, it's a classic !!!
