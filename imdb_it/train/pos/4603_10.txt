There is a detail, which is not very common for Jackie Chan's films, but which is present here. It has a very hard and serious atmosphere, while funny elements are also present. Jackie is threatening and psychotic here. He is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights (in a typical relaxed pattern), but it is he who can go and start the turmoil. His way of hitting that evil in glasses is incredible. Whenever "crack!" Passes. I also really like the scene when Jackie goes to the pub and defeats the villains who confronted his girlfriend. It is one of the best blitzkriegs on the screen. Moreover, the whole scene is shot with the background of an action figure painted on the wall (it also looks like a "rabochiy" poster of our Soviet era) and some lines in Russian on the left (I noticed this quite by accident) . It sounds fantastic (and nostalgic for the Russian people). I also like when glasses break in movies. Here's a lot of this stuff. It is rather surprising to watch the characters fall / jump / run / ride through all types of panels. <br /> <br /> All three films are fantastic. I was getting ready to see the quality slide down, but I saw a perfect trilogy with incredible sensations and acrobatics (and not only the character of Jackie Chan appears in all three films - it's also excellent and maintains continuity). > <br /> I would like to describe each film in a few words: No.1 - excellent (in all aspects - it's a compelling story from start to finish) and fun (many scenes are ridiculous); No.2 - raging (Jackie is really * beep * off here) and painful (Jackie gets tortured); No. 3 - Incredible (the woman who fights alongside Jackie is incredible) and stormy (should I mention a lot of guns and explosions?). <br /> <br /> As for the rest - a lot has been mentioned by others. <br /> <br /> It is a trilogy that can be watched over and over again (at least by me). His place is in the top 10 of the action / comedy jewels. Finally it was released in Russia on DVD (the second film has the best options - Chinese / Russian soundtracks and English / Russian subtitles). <br /> <br /> Solid 10 out of 10. Thank you for your attention.
