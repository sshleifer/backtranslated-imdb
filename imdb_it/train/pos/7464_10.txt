It made me think for days after seeing it. This is the mark of a great film for me. Eyes Wide Shut had the same effect on me. I'm tired of these people who need these happy Hollywood endings. I'm thinking of seeing him again tonight to better understand the plot - but regardless, the film's emotional messages have been totally felt.
