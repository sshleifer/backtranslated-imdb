I didn't know what except, so I think it was much better not to have gone too far. Don't get me wrong it's not a bad short film. Tess Nanavati is a relatively new director and writer, so I think she deserves a lot of compliments for making this film. You can say that it was an act of love for her. The acting (outside of Dominic) is a bit rough and the quality of the film is not great, but for a low budget film it is good. There have been moments when the plot has become complicated and there are parts that drag on, although I don't think that this will greatly affect the understanding of the film. If you love Dominic Monaghan as much as I do, I say we do it. The gag reel was fun, I won't ruin it, but there is a particular scene that makes it worthwhile to buy the DVD just to see it over and over again. If you like the movie, take a look at The Pink Mirror, a film also made by Jagged Edge. I know that Dominic fans will appreciate this little corner of paradise.
