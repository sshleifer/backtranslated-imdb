From the writer of "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" and "Hush .. Hush, Sweet Charlotte," this tail of the sixties horror cycle has some eerie and campy fun. Micheál Macliammóir does a bit of Victor Buono, but too often the film comes dangerously close to a bad musical ... there is a particularly horrible recital for children halfway. Debbie steals, tangos and tricks on Harlow, while Winters religious fanatic has a lesbian side for her. Agnes Moorehead presents herself as an evangelist. Weaver has nothing to do and also has to pay a gigolo to dance with Debbie.
