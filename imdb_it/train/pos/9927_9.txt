Domino is a great film. It's about a young woman who calls Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) who becomes a bounty hunter because of his boredom with his lifestyle. He joins with two fellow hunters (Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez) and the adventures begin. The script is good. Very realistic and realistic with the tone of the film. The only problem I had with this film is that it focuses on the different things they do instead of the Domino character. <br /> <br /> Even with that, Kiera Knightley gives a fierce performance. Show the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance. Mickey Rourke follows his Oscar-winning performance to "Sin City" with another tough performance. Edgar Ramirez doesn't really do anything except speak Spanish from time to time and fix Kiera. Delroy Lindoi offers a good support performance. Mo'Nique was herself, although she surprised me in a particular scene. Lucy Liu has a great feeling with Kiera Knightley in her scenes with her. <br /> <br /> But the best thing about the film is the direction. Tony Scott's frenetic style brings the film to life. Cinematography is among the best I've ever seen. It takes a normal film and puts the acid. All blacks are blacker, whites are brighter and have a sort of green glow. Action scenes are hilarious. <br /> <br /> OVERALL: If you like Sin City & Man on Fire, you'll like Domino.
