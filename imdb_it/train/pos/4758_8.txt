After an anonymous phone call on a spacecraft that would have crashed into a frozen forest, two policemen found evidence that the event actually happened and apparently a Martian had left the place. They drive to the nearby Hi-Way Caf√© and find a stationary bus and seven passengers waiting for the re-opening of a snowy bridge. However the driver says he only had six passengers when he parked the bus. As they question the travelers, strange things happen in the dining room, with the lights on and off and the turntable turns on and off. When the passengers are released and the bus follows its journey, a passenger returns to the restaurant and reveals a plot of invasion of the Earth. <br /> <br /> "Will the real Martian get up please?" is one of the best episodes of this great series. The intriguing plot has witty and witty dialogues, funny characters and situations and a surprising and totally unexpected plot point at the end. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Marciano" ("The Martian")
