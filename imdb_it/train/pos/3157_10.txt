"That '70s Show" is definitely the most entertaining show currently on TV. I started watching it about two and a half years ago, and as soon as I saw it I could tell it was a great show. I like all the characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. Even Leo was a fantastic character while he was there, I really hope he comes back because he's hilarious. It's classic when Fez says "son of a bitch!", And when Kelso screams "burn!", That always makes me laugh. They are both great characters and always have something fun to say. Jackie is hot is just another reason to watch the show; she started to look really cute but, dammit, somewhere in season 5-6, she really got really sexy. I've seen most of the episodes more than once, some like 10 times, and it's still fun. This is one of the few shows that I can watch over and over again and still laugh as much as I did the first time I saw it. The cast is classic; almost all are fun, where with many shows there are only a few funny characters. I will be sad to see this show finish next year, but it will be shown as one of the best shows ever.
