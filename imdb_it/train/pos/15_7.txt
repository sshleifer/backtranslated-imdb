I imagine that if a film has magic, I don't need it to be fluid or continuous. It can skip basic information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. The magic in this film: the scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, however it does not detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the most difficult to solve. Both characters are smart. Yet Stanley can't understand enough to work because he can't read; he can't read because he had too many adventures in his childhood. Iris, although well educated, has not had enough adventures and therefore cannot understand how to overcome the U-turn of life. In both their flaws and strengths, the characters complement each other. It can be a bit difficult to accept that an Iris will finish working in a factory year after year, or that a Stanley has never hidden his illiteracy enough to work in construction or in some other more lucrative job. And while these "mysteries" are explained throughout history, their unfolding seems a little forced. I assume no one had time to rethink the script. Even so, is it a good movie ?? just imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on the screen if someone had done it!
