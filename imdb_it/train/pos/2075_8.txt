To say that a film is depressing is not necessarily a bad thing. I am very willing to watch a depressing movie if there is a point to be made and this certainly has one. It is the often heartbreaking story of a Chinese man and his family who experience many years of both discomfort and abundance. BUT, I must warn you that this could only be about the most depressing film that will come out of Hollywood in the 1930s - because peasant life in China was hard to say the least. Get ready to look at the segments of famine, death and disease. <br /> <br /> The only negative aspect, except for the persistent tone of unhappiness, is that the protagonist is played by Paul Muni. While he was a man of exceptional talent, it is a pity that Hollywood has always cast people of European descent to play Asian roles during this era. If you're paying attention, it's pretty obvious that Muni is wrong for the part.
