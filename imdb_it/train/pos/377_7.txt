Steven Spielberg's kind and softly spoken drama was his first real adventure in this genre. A departure from his normal adventure / fantasy, he paved the way for his success in 1993, "Schindler's List". Based on Alice Walder's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, the story is about a young girl's arranged marriage to a brutal and angry peasant and to her painful separation from her beloved younger sister Nettie. While the plot - about compassion, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it loses its way through the blame of Menno Meyjes' continuity and script. "The Color Purple" is sometimes difficult to follow and on one or more occasions it tends to be a little uneven over time. This lack of scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail apparently present in the Miss Walker novel. A pity that the master Spielberg has not been able to identify and correct these problems, since most of the show is a wonderful example of his feat as a director. <br /> <br /> Performances are strong everywhere, with Whoopi Goldberg making a debut - which he never equaled in terms of acting - like the broken-hearted Celie who wants to be loved. Danny Glover offers solid support, although his "Moses" was a turning point for him in "Places in the heart". The extraordinary demonstration comes from the unnamed Oprah Winfrey in the role of Miss Sophia, the black woman fighting with a single mind, whose spirit is crushed by a terrible accident involving a paternal bourgeois woman. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong. <br /> <br /> Quincy Jones (co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall) wrote a wonderfully melodic soundtrack and also provided some original blues for the occasion. The editing of Michael Kahn is a sound as always, while the director of photography Allen Daviau shows his skillful ability to capture a glorious scenario of the South. <br /> <br /> This true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to the eyes , it is only unfortunately we have been left with so many unanswered questions. <br /> <br /> Wednesday, January 15, 1997 - Video
