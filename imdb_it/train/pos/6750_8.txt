This is a very well done film, meticulously directed and with an excellent acting of characters that is sometimes deeply moving - for example the scene with the faithful but not sophisticated policeman and his wife. The plot is elaborated in a convincing and exciting way. The gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero. It has been made clear that the policemen are just as ugly and ready as the characters of the underworld. <br /> <br /> A couple of small reservations: I found the slightly unilateral ending as it celebrates the successful integration of the hero into the structure of the police and justice system, which collapses the ambiguity of the police characters been maintained until that time. I also found the female protagonist a bit weak: little more than a catalyst for the hero's salvation, all she seems to be doing is crying and fainting while the tough ones face off.
