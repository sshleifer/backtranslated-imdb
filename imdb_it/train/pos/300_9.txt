With various Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered around the cast and crew "Everyone laughed" is a family affair. If you add the fact that B. Gazzara and Miss A. Hepburn had a brief but passionate report in a previous photo, it looks almost like a private film made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of an audience more wide is only an accessory consideration. If all this fills you with gratified gratitude, you will be pleased to know that Mr. Bogdanovich sails well of that particular danger and offers a sweet and rather innocent "I love NY" paean which is also an altar in which we can worship the ethereal beauty of deceased Miss Hepburn. Make no mistake, this is his picture. Mr. Gazzara grants it to her in a very showy way in all their scenes together. The plot - an investigative agency is too personally involved in the affairs of its customers - is of minimal importance, it is the performance of the two protagonists that dominates the film. Bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors, from "Goals" onwards. There is a glow on each of his films that only special artists can convince from an inanimate piece of optical equipment. from this love. Further insights into his work can be obtained by reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors, mainly "Who the hell's in it?", Recently remainder in UK bookstores. The soundtrack of "Tutti Ridevano" varies from the 1947 concert in New York Town Hall by Louis Armstrong to Sinatra, passing through Country to Latin, as eclectic as the city it portrays. The image of Mr B's "Golden Boy" was certainly tarnished, because such is the nature of the cinematographic activity, but it is equally certain that one day it will be restored, and when that day comes "Everyone laughed" will be recognized for the great job it is.
