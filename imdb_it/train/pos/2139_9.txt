I approached this film with low expectations but I was pleasantly surprised. He is very well done and he claps his hands on the ballroom films of recent years, especially "Strictly Ballroom". While the music is beautiful and the dance is colorful, for me the film is not about dancing. It is the very Japanese institution that gives male employees long journeys to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families. Here we have the man with the complete family and the great mortgage and the passion for life. He is attracted by the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio that passes during his travels and this leads him to try ballroom dancing. Even the Japanese is the fact that the lascivious motives that started his new passion are made clear but somehow accepted, at least in the end, by the family and the public. Attitudes towards ballroom dancing, as shown in the film, are decidedly non-Western, although discipline and music are clearly cultural imports into Japan. The cultural contrasts are so intriguing. Even without the cultural insights, the color, the dance and the enthusiasm of the players make this a fun movie to watch.
