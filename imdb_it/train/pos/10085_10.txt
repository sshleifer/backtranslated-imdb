I just watched this movie today with my children (son, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the 3rd Annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival. After the film, the children of the audience were able to ask questions to the director, Tian-Ming Wu. He (through a translator) told several stories about his life and the making of the film. <br /> <br /> Apart from bribes, both my children really enjoyed this movie. Of course, I had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter, but most of the film is visually self-explanatory. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything, but the conclusion is that this movie is MUCH better than 95% of Hollywood shit (especially children's movies) out there. <br /> <br /> Cheers. <br /> <br /> ps There is a king of "real" / original masks that can / could make 12 masks simultaneously. The actor in the film trained and learned to do up to 4 masks at a time (so they cut and switched to 4 new masks).
