Really, I think this film is more an example of an easy goal than a really bad movie. In fact, the film is very well done in many ways and is very funny. <br /> <br /> Yes, the script is a bit convoluted, but this is the genre. The film has a noir atmosphere centered around a femme fatale. Just like all the old classic noir, this one also has a script that twists you around, so that you don't always know how to make sense at the beginning, and it can be a little too long if you think too deeply and try to put everyone the pieces together. This is the kind. In general, the script has enough surprises and turns to make the observer guess and, in turn, surprised, without abandoning the viewer. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is also an easy target. The truth is that she looks great and speaks her two-way dialogue so that it becomes something mysterious, sexy and fun. <br /> <br /> Management is more than passable, because let's face it - do you have to keep an audience interested in "did you do it or not?" application for two hours. In addition to an extravagant screenplay and an entertaining performance by Stone, this is effectively done through the direction of creating a noir atmosphere that is both obscure and very strict and modern at the same time, with straight industrial lines that go together with Stone's sexy curves. The frame is always beautiful - press pause anywhere and there is something interesting for the eyes. <br /> <br /> The film is also based on things that were gimmicks in the first movie and turns them into something a little more real, especially sex. "Katherine Tramell is bisexual ... how shocking!" it is treated more concretely here, and typically, the sexuality of the film is used to obtain better results. It is still titillating, but not so readily made for the value of shock and buzz as it did in the first. I won't say it's not a bit of a trick yet because, let's face it, this movie should be fun. <br /> <br /> And a funny movie is. It could be an easy goal, but if you look at it for what it is: a grandfather, femme fatale guided, twisted, sexy, done or not-she-she-dunnit, you are destined to enjoy it (no pun intended).
