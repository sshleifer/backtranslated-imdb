I saw it for the first time in a long time - I had forgotten both the imagination of the images and the wit of the film. However, I hadn't forgotten the opening scenes that are (with the scene at the Waterloo Bridge Candlelight Club) one of the most romantic ever. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in politics or history will love the film's references in a superficial way - anyone interested in romance will be moved by Hunter-Niven, and anyone who loves visual images will appreciate the depiction of the afterlife. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie remains "Odd Man Out" made at the same time - but this is superb. <br /> <br />
