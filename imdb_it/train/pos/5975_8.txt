Every film critic and film head hated this film, but I liked it. I saw this as a child on TV somewhere and I was amazed by the scene in which Sammi takes the stage and plays Trick or Treat by Fastway. <br /> <br /> The film itself was typical of the 1980s, a boy being bullied and enlisting the supernatural help to defeat the bullies but he goes far and must be destroyed. <br /> <br /> Melrose Place Matt chooses Skippy from Family Ties, so Skippy gets a Tony Fields record from Gene Simmons to comfort him and all hell breaks lose, the strong point is where Tony sings (syncs with the lips) and dance to a metal song before the shy one hits the fan. <br /> <br /> There were many mistakes and things but the music and the overall picture was enough to keep my fists pumping 8 out of 10
