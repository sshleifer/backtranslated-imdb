Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper can still travel the world with their smiles. The combined talent of these two wonderful stars makes this combination reunion / newstart movie work. Watch it and look forward to hitting sixty! Maria challenges the youth-oriented society with wit and charm. A touch of drama adds 2000 realism. A sequel of television series would widen the new characters and offer us the chance to see Lou Grant, Phyllis, Sue Ann, Murray and Georgette!
