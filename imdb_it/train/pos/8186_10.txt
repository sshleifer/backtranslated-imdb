I love the Satan Pit !!! David Tennant is a great actor and also Billie Piper !!! Who else loves Will Thorp in pieces ??? It's so cute, isn't it? I hated the pieces he had been possessed by the devil and where he had been told to "go to hell", as Rose called it so bluntly. Mind you, it was pretty funny when he said: "Rose, do us a favor, do you want to? Shut up!" Mr. Jefferson was so brave, wasn't he? Dying to save others. I really felt sorry for Toby (Will Thorp) when he got out of possession for the second time because he was so scared. I was like "Oh my God if I were Rose, I'd be so scared for him." And when she hugged him I was like "grrrrrr, it's mine! Hands out!" but I thought it was really sweet. And the doctor ... well, I thought he'd tell Ida "tell Rose that I love her" but he didn't. Oh good.
