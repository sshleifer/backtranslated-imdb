For those interested in knowing exactly how humanity was enclosed in large red pods that make me want pomegranate, there is the duo of the "Second Renaissance" short films. I'm not exactly sure why they are divided into two parts, especially since they are credited as one in the DVD (and are these shorts displayed on any other format except the DVD?), But they are well informed even if they have some gaps. <br /> <br /> What makes this first part really important, from the second part and the rest of the animations, is the parallelism that shows between the robot revolt and civil rights. The graphic tributes to slavery, fascism, concentration camps and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to the Million Man March and to the complex of God of humanity. In fact, "God" is never referenced by these shorts, instead replaced by "the personal image of Man". <br /> <br /> As for the short films in the collection, "The Second Renaissance: Part I" is by far the most effective in bringing out emotions. It is a painful and disturbing vision of humanity's potential to become "the architect of its own destruction". Some may be turned off by some of the concepts in this brief tear directly from previously established science fiction literature, but then again, this is basically what most of the Matrix series did, and was a driving force behind its success . > <br /> --PolarisDiB
