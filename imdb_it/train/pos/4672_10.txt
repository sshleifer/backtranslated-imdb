I saw Brother's Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and I loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are as big as father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen from words in Alaska to his family in Brooklyn. He shows up there because his brother is dead, and he takes a journey to slowly repair his extraneous relations with his brother's wife and son and his father who never forgave him for being the black sheep of the family. History takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to better understand the complexity of their lives. In addition, images from the woodworking industry and the Brooklyn background set the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.
