Ironically for a drama not available on film or video for so long, ARMS AND THE MAN has remained fairly constantly available on stage over the years since its debut in 1894 - largely because it has aged so well as a solid satire on the nature of heroism and business of war. Whenever the world sinks into conflict, ARMS AND THE MAN seems to rise as ever more relevant and relevant. <br /> <br /> This is the comedy that Oscar Strauss has converted (leaving most of Shaw's best ideas) into the successful operetta, THE CHOCOLATE SOLDIER (when Hollywood came to * this, * they left out the latest vestige of Shaw rather than paying him for the rights - he was, by then, an Oscar winner in his true right). While the best of Shaw has always been his ideas and his dialogue, rather than his bare plots, in WEAPONS AND MAN, the plot sparkles and the owner handles happy ends for all concerned. <br /> <br /> The young Raina (Helena Bonham Carter), the daughter of an officer and the richest man in her city, is promised in marriage to a Bulgarian cavalry officer and everything seems fine until a mercenary Swiss inept (Pip Torrens) on the other side climbs on his drain pipe running away from the battle in which his army was directed. As usual in a Shaw satire, nothing is as it appears and the conventions of society are standing on their head in the light of simple - and not so simple reason. There are no "good guys" or "bad guys", just people of a variety of classes who manage to cope with the best of their wits - just like life just better - and of course with Shaw, intelligence is finely refined by all interested parties. <br /> <br /> The first film version (of 1932) (from Shaw's own script) of this more traditional and traditionally fun of Shaw's scene satire, and one of the first to make a real success in this part of the 'Atlantic, has long been among the missing. Shaw did not sell the screen rights to his plays - he only licensed them for 5 years, and it appeared that with a rapidly evolving sound technology that made the 1932 films primitive only a few years later, Shaw did not renew the license to show it. As a result, we are immensely in the BBC's debt for having finally released their 1987 broadcast version in a DVD box with nine other sparkling games. (Somewhat sadly, PYGMALION, which many consider to be the best of Shaw, is less well on this set in a production with Lynn Redgrave and James Villiers.) <br /> <br /> Even as a couple, as it is in his DVD, with the least suggestive act, A MAN OF DESTINY, ARMS AND THE MAN is a real treasure. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter has moved on, having had a crush on television roles like this, in an important film career this will bring many viewers to this first role. They should not be disappointed, because Mrs Carter performs in line with the stratified innocence that the public expects from her, but under the somewhat pedestrian direction of James Cellan Jones (and despite the uniformly beautiful and well-observed physical production) of the BBC), the mischievous focus of the role (and its outrage at being undervalued in the last act) is only inclined to about 80% of its potential. <br /> <br /> Much the same can be said of the true star of the piece, Pip Torrens, as Bluntschli "Switzer". It is a beautiful and captivating performance, but it is not suited to the physical comedy implicit in the youth scene in which the young soldier can barely stay awake despite his mortal danger. <br /> <br /> Despite these reservations, this is a solid production of a wonderful game transferred to the small screen with aplomb. Deserves to be seen widely and, ideally, to push an even more lively remake of the big screen with the style and joy of the recent Wilde's AN IDEAL HUSBAND remake. Virtually * any * WEAPONS AND MAN must be appreciated, and with much luck we may even be able to see the original 1932 version. 'Up to one or the other surface, this production will appeal to anyone who loves good Shaw.
