This film is available from David Shepard and Kino in the movie Hollywood premiere there was Fort Lee, NJ, although it is a shortened version with only the "behind the scenes" sections. I'm not sure that Blackhawk Films only had a print movie of these parts, or they changed the other scenes. The original version of Blackhawk was rhythmic A Movie Romance. The full functionality survives, but the preprint for this version had a decomposition of nitrates, and a couple of sections looked bad, so that may be why the version of Blackhawk has been modified. <br /> <br /> Directed by Maurice Tourneur, the film has Tourneur playing himself, or more likely a caricature of himself. Probably even director Emile Chautard and future director Joseph von Sternberg can be spotted. <br /> <br /> Country lass Mary (Doris Kenyon) craves a romantic man to wipe her out. He dreams of a troubadour who is courting her, but is constantly interrupted by the only local boy available, Johnny Applebloom. <br /> <br /> Meanw hile, a film company from New York (actually New Jersey) is shooting a western in the countryside. Mary sees an Indian (in full headgear) and raises an alarm - ruining a scene that the film company is filming. She is immediately attracted to the movie star Kenneth Driscoll (Robert Warwick). He encourages her to leave her home and tries to become an actress in the big city. <br /> <br /> When he arrives in the studio, he discovers that everything about movies is fake. Doors and walls are just apartments that are hastily assembled for the set. Even that lanky walk of the western hero or the happy leap of heroin are also acting. The sets are on a large revolving stage, so the angle of the sun can even be manipulated. The studio's black assistant signs all the "autographed" photos of the movie stars. The signs on the wall say "Positively No Smoking", but everyone smokes anyway. Even the film's titles (which are well illustrated) emphasize all that is false in the life of the cinema. <br /> <br /> The movie star Driscoll is equally disenchanted with the buzz of everyday film production. He temporarily splits up with his girlfriend Vivian (June Elvidge) to follow this "exciting" country girl. His plans are dashed when Mary's screen test is a stinker. We do not see the film itself, but only the painful reactions of the public to it. <br /> <br /> Mary is devastated, but does not want to admit to everyone at home that it was a failure, so she continues to see Driscoll and we had lunch with him in the studio cafeteria along with other extras dressed as policemen, soldiers , cowboy, etc. <br /> <br /> Mary decides to stay with Driscoll. At a party with their "friends" films, he agrees to marry him even though there is not much love between them. Surprisingly, his mother appears, with a cake in particular for Mary's birthday. This causes Mary to reevaluate her future. <br /> <br /> This film has all sorts of fascinating scenes from studios, movie sets, dressing rooms, editing rooms, etc. If you've always wondered what was going on behind the scenes where a silent film was shot, this movie peeps backstage.
