A serious comedy. The film version produced by Ross Hunter of the French comedy "Les Joies de la famille" (later Americanized as "A very rich woman") is luxurious, well conceived, sometimes funny ... and unfortunately timeless. A wealthy widow from California, who seems to be losing her money, is led by her two greedy and grown daughters, both of whom fear that Mama Rosie carelessly spends their inheritance. The whole question of a vital but aged woman sent to a nursing home against her will, and having to prove herself sane in an audition, is a touching material for a comedy (and to her credit, the director David Lowell Rich does not overload the image with gag crass or obvious feeling). Part of the humor is a bit generic and doesn't work, yet Rosalind Russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario and never hits a false note. Sandra Dee is also as good as Rosalind's niece, and James Farentino is very charming as a young lawyer. The film has so much to say about the importance of our elders and the ways in which they choose to spend their remaining time, rather than the seriousness of the "Rosie!" You lose almost in the haste of a happy ending. The image leaves you smiling, and at the same time you wonder how many old women there are who have never been so lucky. *** from ****
