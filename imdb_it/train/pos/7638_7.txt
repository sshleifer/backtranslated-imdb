Larry Burrows has the distinct feeling that something is missing. Since he lost a crucial baseball shot at school that cost the championship, he was convinced that his life would have been better if he had made that shot. Then one night his car breaks down again. Walking into the nearest bar to wait for the tow truck, Larry succeeds bartender Mike, who without Larry's knowledge is about to change his life forever ....... <br /> <br /> The premise of life alternative in the cinema is certainly not a novelty, it extends to characters of the caliber of It's A Wonderful Life and shows no signs of abating with the very recent Sandler vehicle which was Click. It is a genus that has produced very mixed results. In 1990 this production led by James Belushi, rarely mentioned when the subject arises, seems to have been largely forgotten. Which is a shame as it exudes charm and is not short in the humor department. We know we are taken to his last message, but in the end it is a fun and entertaining way to lead. The film also serves to notice what a good comedian James Belushi was. I mean if his kicking cunning style and exasperated larking isn't your thing ,? then it's likely you'll still avoid this movie. But for fans of Red Heat, K-9 and Taking Care of Business, Mr. Destiny is on your way. Along the way are Linda Hamilton, Michael Caine, Jon Lovitz, Hart Bochner, Jay O. Sanders, Rene Russo and Courteney Cox. <br /> <br /> Destiny, pure fun for the escape with a kicker of a message in his heart. 7/10
