ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the Ramones. I was too young during the mid-70s of the band to be very aware of them, even though I had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time. I finally saw RNRHS on television one afternoon in the mid-1980s when I was about fifteen and I laughed all the time. (Isn't it the dream of all high school kids to destroy his school and blow it up, all set to a soundtrack?) I recorded a subsequent airing of the movie a year or two later and kept watching the Ramones concert sequences and again, thinking "Dude, these guys kick ass! I have to take a look at some of their albums!" The rest is history. Twenty years, thirteen LPs / tapes / CDs Ramones, and three Ramones shows later, they are still one of my favorite bands ever and the RNRHS still makes me break every time I watch it. Now that Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny have left us (R.I.P. all) at least we have this movie and tons of great music to remember them.
