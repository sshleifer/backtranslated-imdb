The delivery of some very humorous rude lines by Pierce Brosnan alone is worth the admission price. He plays a sort of "psycho James Bond twin brother", undoubtedly separated at birth. As an intense killer, his character is very sexual but also better, very funny. Add the cute and likeable American "guy next door", Greg Kinnear, to set the contrast: the myriad of places, bright colors and witty humor offer great fun. Hope Davis is considered the "gem of a wife". But the focus of the film is on the two boys, a new "strange couple", and this is the part that works very well. Have a nice (probably R-rated) laugh, and look for places where the story goes a little deeper.
