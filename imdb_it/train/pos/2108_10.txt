A warm, sweet and extraordinarily fascinating film about two antagonistic workers in the same store (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) who are pursuing a love story by e-mail without either of them knowing. The key to the success of this film is that Ernst Lubitsch is not absent in any sentimental sirocco and invites his actors to give low-profile shows, without frills. As a result, you fall in love with almost all of them. <br /> <br /> There is a strong background of melancholy that runs through this film that I enjoyed. Loneliness is one of the main themes, most obviously represented by the character of the owner and manager of the store, beautifully played by Frank Morgan. He discovers that he was cuckolded by his wife and realizes that the successful life he has created for himself is not enough to prevent him from feeling alone when he does not have a partner to share it. This makes the romantic love story between Stewart and Sullavan even more moving, because both are trying to reach this invisible other, which everyone thinks of as a soul mate before they even meet. Obviously we know that in the end everything will be fine, but the film does not make you forget the sad feeling that they would feel if they discovered that reality is not up to the imagination. <br /> <br /> Lubitsch fills his film with a cast cracker that has loads of chemistry. The small group of store employees refers to itself throughout the film as a small family, and that's exactly how we feel. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful unsung novel. <br /> <br /> Grade: A +
