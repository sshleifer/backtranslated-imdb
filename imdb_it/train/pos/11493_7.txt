The Unborn is a pretty good low-budget horror film that exploits fears related to pregnancy. He is very well played by the always good Brooke Adams and the brave b-movie James Karen, although the supporting cast is quite average for a b-grader. The music, by Gary Numan of all people, is also good. Henry Dominic's script is smart enough for this sort of thing, even if there's a hint of misogyny about it. The management of Rodman Fender is simply adequate, and there are some unnecessary economic scares. If you are a fan of Adams, whose career in cinema is not at all as illustrious as it should be, take a look; she is great, as always.
