This is a movie that will take time to get out of your head once you've seen it. The dialogues are almost perfect, which was predictable as it was adapted from a play. Actors are simply giving their best, the story is simple and attractive. 88 minutes of pure happiness! <br /> <br /> Yvan Attal is absolutely credible in his role, Sandrine Kiberlain is still the beautiful blonde (but not so stupid) who offers so much pleasure to the eyes as to the ears, Jean-Paul Rouve provides an excellent approximation of the total jerk (and proud to be such), and Marina Fois is the stupid friend who is always crazy when you expect less. <br /> <br /> Thumbs up at Bernard Rapp and collaborators to adapt this excellent game, and all the best for future productions! <br /> <br /> I wish there were more in today's production. If you liked it, you'll probably also like: "Un air de famille" and "Cuisine et dependances". Both were written and played by the Bacri / Jaoui couple.
