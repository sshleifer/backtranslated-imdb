Has there ever been a more fascinating film than this? One of the reasons why everything works so well is that the group of actors really seems to interact and have an effect on each other's lives. The focus of all this is the "love story" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and cannot get along face to face, but who connect completely anonymously as pen pals. But there are also supporting characters and, unlike many romantic comedies (including "You've Got Mail", the recent "Shop" update) are not just mounted to support the two leads and their needs. Each becomes an intricate part of Ernst Lubitsch's rich tapestry of charm. One of the most moving scenes in the history of cinema takes place when the almost tragic Frank Morgan searches casually and humbly for someone to dine with. A must see! **** outside ****
