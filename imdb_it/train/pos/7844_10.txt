I love this show, it's like reading a book and every chapter leaves you wanting more. It makes you think about what will happen in the next episode, and the struggle to try to keep their friendship over the years. After each episode ends, it leaves a sweet bitter taste in your mouth knowing that: One - The show was good, you can't wait for the next episode and it really makes you think about what really happens to friends during their twenties. And two: the fact that the show was "paused" and we will not see the show finish in its entirety. Fox obviously doesn't know what they did, they say they are losing spectators in the 18-49 category, clearly they don't know what people want to see if they get rid of a good show like "Reunion". However, I have a question I would like to raise. If they had to bring the show back and went on for another season, how would it have worked since each episode was done over the course of a year and the story is based on what happens over twenty years? Your answers are welcome. Bring Reunion back! Bring Reunion back!
