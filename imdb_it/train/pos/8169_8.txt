This is a bloody and rather convincing disaster. Corbin Bernson is very much in command of this film with his elegant portrait of the maniac of the homonymous tampered control. Linda Hoffman plays the wife who cheats and she is very easy on the eyes - unfortunately for her, the little "tryst" with the boy from the pool brings severe punishment in a way that the good doctor knows best - shame about that beautiful smile! The last half hour of the film is dedicated to the character of Bernson who loses her completely and the spotlight falls on a young actress named Virginya Keehne. A very talented artist, he attracts the limelight from the moment the brackets come off. Beautiful legs, too!
