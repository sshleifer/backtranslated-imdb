this was a fantastic episode. I saw a clip from it on YouTube, and I swore it should never show on TV, I'd like to stick to the set to watch. I ended up watching him with a friend of mine, who seems to be gay, and we both cried at the end. this was a really well written and sincere episode of forbidden love between two policemen who, in my opinion, were really (in Coop's words) "the lucky ones". they are episodes like this that make Cold Case one of the most captivating and beloved television works on CBS. I look forward to more episodes and a repeat of "Forever Blue" because I will always watch it again and again.
