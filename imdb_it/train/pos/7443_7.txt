An old saying says "If you think you have problems, visit a hospital". This has been updated in recent years for "If you think you have problems, watch a TV talk show ... especially Jerry Springer!" This movie is one of those that is so bad, it's good! That's why I gave it a seven: it's all right, but not great. It's a great way to waste 95 minutes, just as the daily talk show is advertised as "an hour of your life that never comes back!" All the familiar themes are here ... unfaithful husbands / boyfriends, the most extravagant audience on television, the women who flash Jerry, etc. The shocker was watching Molly Hagan, who normally plays sweet characters ("Seinfeld" and "Herman's Head") playing a trailer-trash mom and Jaime Pressly ("My Name Is Earl") as his equally trash daughter, performing sexual favors practically for every man they came in contact with. The men (including the staff producer) were presented as wolves par excellence who deserved what they had. I don't want to ruin or reveal everything, but the film sounds like the daily show. Here in Phoenix, it is shown back-to-back for two hours each morning and, afterwards, everything else seems to pale. Again, I give this movie a seven ... it's good but not great. Jerry Springer is best taken in small doses of an hour.
