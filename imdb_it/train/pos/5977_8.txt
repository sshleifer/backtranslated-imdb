The adolescent Eddie spends his life being bullied and humiliated because of his obsession with heavy metal music. One day he discovers that his hero Sammi Curr died, presumably burned by the establishment that wanted to end his music. But Eddie has his latest album, never released, and when he plays it he starts receiving messages telling him how to deal with his tormentors. In a short time Sammi revealed that he intends to return to life in the local Halloween party to get revenge on the city that once mocked him. <br /> <br /> Full of humor and jokes, this is a very funny movie. Sammi himself is a bad film of original horror, playing on the obsessions of the "evils of rock music" of the 80s. Worth watching.
