We witnessed this in my lecture on women's health problems to highlight how women are treated less than men in many societies, and I absolutely loved this movie. I'm going to try to make a copy of it myself. The story is very touching and I would recommend it to anyone. I'm a fan of different cultures and this film was just what I needed. This is a film for the whole family, despite its evaluation. This is a film that I will show to my children. The professor in our class wanted to say that the film was mainly also to educate women, but this film was more than that. It is one of those films that will remain forever in my mind and will be a favorite.
