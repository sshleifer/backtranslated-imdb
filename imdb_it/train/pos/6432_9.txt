"Perfect Alibi" is a fun and very pleasant mysterious thriller thanks to a clever script and the steady hand of the writer / director Kevin Meyer. The film begins methodically and accumulates as the clues begin to reveal that nothing is what it seems to be. Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo are fantastic as they team up to unravel the mystery, reminding me of Nick and Nora Charles, of the "Thin Man" movies. Kathleen Quinlan is excellent as Alex McArthur's tormented wife and the roles of the characters, played by veteran actors Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey and Estelle Harris are well made and offer many light moments at the right time. There's even a cameo by Rex Linn. In all, I seemed to read a good book by the fire.
