there should be a sub-genre in the western called "Robert Mitchum Western". Mitchum's brilliant, idiosyncratic and usually underrated westerns import his noir character to engrave some characteristic and obscure sketches, and bring a worldly elegance more familiar from Sam Peckinpah's films. 'Man with the gun' is one of his best. Directed by Richard Wilson, protected by Orson Welles, it is a naked and monochromatic beauty, full of chilling shapes and terrifying bursts of wild violence, while Mitchum comes to tame a city terrorized by a monopolist with a private army. Mitchum's regression from a calm foreigner to a deranged killer, with a series of dark emotions in the middle, is a marvel of physical and expressive acting.
