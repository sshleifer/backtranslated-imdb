First of all, I've never been afraid of this underestimated gem as a kid ("Little Mermaid" on the other hand ...). As the title says, this was one of my favorite childhood films that I still love as a teenager. It's a beautiful bittersweet movie about a misfit German shepherd named Charlie (fantasticaly voiced by Burt Reynolds) who is killed by his crime boss / partner (it's the name ha, ha is Carface). Charlie is sent directly to heaven by default because "all dogs go to heaven because unlike people, dogs are naturally good, loyal and kind". Chalie is sent back to Earth because she has finished her life watch, where she gets even more involved with her best friend, Itchy and a small orphan, Anne-Marie. I've always seen him as a child and I still look at him sometimes. Anyway, it's a beautiful bittersweet movie like I said before that could only leave a tear in your eyes ...
