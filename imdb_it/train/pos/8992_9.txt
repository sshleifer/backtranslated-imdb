A really interesting film. A must for any snobby music. You don't really need to know bands to enjoy the movie. Before the film, I only listened to two Dandy Warhols songs. The only thing required is an open mind. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the Brian Jonestown massacre. Dandy Warhols have a role in the film, like the "rival band", but they are the second violin of the BJM. The Dandy Warhols don't have an important role in the film, as I originally imagined, but once again, they didn't have the element of excitement and unpredictability of the BJM. You can't help but be fascinated by the band and its very charismatic frontman, Anton Newcombe. In itself, it is a discerning film and a study of the music industry. Watch this movie and have fun.
