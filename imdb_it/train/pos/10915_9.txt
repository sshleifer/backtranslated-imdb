The RKO studios have decided to borrow both William Powell of MGM and Jean Arthur of Columbia, for one of their most important efforts to gain the popularity of The Thin Man. They succeeded to some extent. <br /> <br /> Many people forget that in addition to Nick Charles, in addition to first, Bill Powell also starred in some Philo Vance films in the lead role. So at that point it was pretty well set in the role. Dr. Bradford is not making as many liquid lunches as Nick Charles, but the basic Nick blas√© is still there. One difference is that while Nick Charles has married a heiress, Dr. Bradford works to live as a doctor. This helps in his choice of detective and indeed he does it in this film. <br /> <br /> He has two murders to resolve. A jockey falls on a horse that enters the embassy of a large race and dies for no apparent reason. The coach suspects something on foot, but is expelled by the more conventional method of a bullet. This after he came to ask Bill Powell for help. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy was a more stable influence on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur was. Arthur portrays him as a more dazed girl than Loy. But it works here and she and Powell have good chemistry. <br /> <br /> The ever-reliable James Gleason is the police inspector in the role of Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton. All they needed was Auction and maybe Eric Blore as Powell's butler was testing that part. <br /> <br /> If Powell and Arthur had been signed in this study, we could have seen a lot of Bradford films.
