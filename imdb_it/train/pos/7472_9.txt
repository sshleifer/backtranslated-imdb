I really enjoyed this movie. I read some of the other comments, and although I have compassion on those who did not understand it, I agree with some of the criticisms. Which, strangely, makes me even more like this movie. I agree to have a rather nice cast to redo an intelligent film for the general public, yet it has so many levels and is still good to see. I also love films like this that cause so many debates, theories, possible conclusions and hidden subtext. Congratulations Mr. Crowe, certainly in my Top Ten. <br /> <br /> P.S. I saw this when it first came out while I was backpacking in Mexico, it was late at night and I had to go back to my hotel and I had a great trip in paranoia! Where does the dream end and the true beginning?
