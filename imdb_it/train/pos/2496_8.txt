No rubbish - it's not even close to trash. Isn't it an original? this is the last thing that could be said of "2.4 children". Beautiful? certainly not! Although it was a bit of an unusual series for the BBC, he was fun, funny and witty. I particularly liked Belinda Lang and John Pickard - which I think is wonderfully preformed. Gari olsen was also very good, as were all the other cast members ... I am never entirely new because he was boxed up to read here today on the death of Gary Olsen at a relatively young age. I would like them to do more of this kind of comedies, many more (and show them here in Israel).
