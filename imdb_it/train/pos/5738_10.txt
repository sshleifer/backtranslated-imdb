I just bought and watched the DVD of this movie. The DVD transfer is from last year 2001. This 1988 movie is really a great little movie. Neglected by most people. I saw him in the theater in 1988 and I've loved him ever since. I love the opening blow in Pittsburgh (not from Baltimore, as another user commented). It makes Pittsburgh look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And I have to say that Pitts tour on the garbage truck with Nicky is very interesting and interesting! Tom Hulce, as everyone else has said, offers an extraordinary and wonderful performance. The DVD is a good transfer, without extras, but in widescreen format. I recommend it to those who love the film.
