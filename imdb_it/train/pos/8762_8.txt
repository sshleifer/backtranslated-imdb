"What would you do?" is a question that will remain in your mind for weeks after looking at the Brokedown palace. You may also be wondering if Alice (Danes) is telling the truth or not - a problem that remains unresolved, and rightly so. This is a particularly well acted and well turned film. Although it is slow at times, its rhythm reflects the plot - but much of the film will make you stand on the edge of your seat; wanting to know what happens next. The ending will also leave you imagined in the role of the protagonists, who are brilliantly played by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. Bill Pullman's performance is also commendable.
