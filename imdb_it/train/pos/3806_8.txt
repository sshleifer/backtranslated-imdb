This film took my breath away in some places, I just loved it! <br /> <br /> I admit that the character dialogues and the plot could have been a little better, but hey, this is just a simple (short) story about a couple of guys trying to kill a dragon, not there is more to it! <br /> <br /> The general design, the atmosphere, the beautiful landscapes ... it's all simply magical! <br /> <br /> They put a lot of love into this movie. The characters' drawings were fantastic and fun. A little Tim Burton-ish if you like. I can recommend this film to anyone interested in great design, displayed in a simple but beautiful story.
