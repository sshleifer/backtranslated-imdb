This tends to be denied by many Kurosawa critics and fans, but I thought it was wonderful. It is a multi-character studio with episodes of the poorest people in Tokyo, living in a city literally made of garbage. Although it resembles a newly bombed atom bomb, the film has a kind of serene beauty thanks to the glorious use of Technicolor. The title derives from the sound of the young madman driving an imaginary cart through the slum. All the characters were wonderful and all the stories were compelling, but perhaps the most tragic concerns of the man and his young son living in an abandoned car. When they are not looking for food, they spend their free time using their imagination to build their dream home. An exciting and beautiful film.
