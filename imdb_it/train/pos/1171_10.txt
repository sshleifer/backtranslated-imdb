I found this episode one of the most fun I've seen in a long time. The creators of South Park have made the best parody of a Romero movie I've ever seen. They really touched on Romero's social comment that he made with each of his films. I'd like to know what George Romero's opinion is on this episode, I'm sure it was purely positive! Keep his true vision for his zombies epic completely intact! Most of the parody faces the pure gore without making the viewer think as Romero tries to do with his films. I think that if there were a zombie outbreak we could actually worry about our property values ​​before our lives, as shown in this episode!
