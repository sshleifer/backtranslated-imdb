It is an embezzler, Peter Ustinov, who infiltrates a British company, Texa-Conn or something like that, posing as a computer wizard and a security expert. He secretly learns to hack into the computer, while collecting the admiration of his boss, Karl Malden, the enmity of his office rival, Bob Newhart, and the love of his inept secretary, Maggie Smith. <br /> <br /> Some of the corporate details were a bit obscure for these non-business-oriented eyes, but they are quite credible and I got the general idea. Ustinov, the peculato Peter, founds fake companies in Paris, Rome and Stuttgart, and uses the Texa-Conn computer to send all types of money to these ersatz. The foreign companies, of course, are none other than himself, Ustinov, and the addresses are an abandoned loft of artists in Paris, a barber in Rome and a bakery in Germany. He simply visits them to collect the checks he sent himself. <br /> <br /> I didn't think I would have liked for the first few minutes because it seemed pretty slow. I was expecting something with a faster pace and more indignation, along the lines of "The Pink Panther" or "The Lavender Hill Gang". But this film creeps into your graces when you come to appreciate the sober humor in the plot, in the characterizations and in the dialogue. <br /> <br /> It would probably be a bad idea to give too many relatively thin gags but here are some examples of the more obvious. <br /> <br /> Ustinov to Secretary Smith: "Let me have the resources of these companies". Smith: "Activities? What are they?" Ustinov: "Small female donkeys". Now, nothing is made of this little exchange. There is a brief interruption and no delay for any laughter, which is appropriate because a person's reaction is more likely to be a smile than a laugh. <br /> <br /> Ustinov looks for that poor loft in Paris. It is covered with cobwebs. The bricks are scattered and a couple of the former occupant's paintings have been left behind. The owner does not speak English and Ustinov does not know French. Ustinov points to a child's painting of a naked woman and giggles, "Ah, a fam fye-tal, eh?" Even the landlord giggles, he replies: "Vous le prenez pour une anee?" Ustinov: "Oh - ANNIE, so it's his name!" Owner: "Oui?" Ustinov: "Entente Cordial!" (Mes amis, if I was wrong those sexes, je m'excuse.) Bob Newhart as Willard Gnatpole (!) He has hair for Maggie Smith and should take her home but tells her he is taking "the scenic route". There is an immediate sequence of suggestive road signs. "Caution." "Pitch." "Give Way." "Yield." End with the imperious "STOP / CHILDREN". There is another montage when Ustinov's scheme is being discovered by the board of directors: fuzzy roofs, police cars, a farewell hug from Maggie, ending with a sign: PRISON, Wormwood Scrubs. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe one more. I still can't get over Malden as head, declaring decisively: "I never agonize decisions", then swallowing a handful of pills and washing them down with a glass of water. <br /> <br /> Acting is unquestionably good. For example, it is the best role of Bob Newhart. Not that he had so many, and not that his range was not limited, but it is perfect in this part. Obviously the soundtrack of Laurie Johnson made a great effort. He seems to have written a short flute concert. Ustinov's passion is music and his establishments abroad are guided by false names like Claude Debussy and Giacconino Rossini. The false president of Stuttgart is someone named Schmidt, and is an anomalous clinker. Maggi Smith is pretty, sexy, bourgeois, and turns out to be not as stupid as she seems. <br /> <br /> Delicious, in its quiet way, but don't expect the comic fireworks.
