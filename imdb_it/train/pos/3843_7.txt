The first time I saw this film in the theater of a foreign film festival, I thought it was intriguing, fascinating, the sensitive bi-sexual artist. So very European, very Dutch! Recently I rented it for a second viewing and I could hardly laugh at the overworked subject of the mad writer with a persecution complex of religious-sexual orientation. To grab! This guy is a freeloader, who lives by society. I suspect the real reason he's having these fantastic nightmares about the "spiderwoman" is that his guilt complex starts after the year ignoring his mother's advice to get in the car (and in bed) with strangers! Not only is he making scandalous sums of loot (probably tax-free) to make up stories (lying guilty journey), but it's too cheap to pay a haircut, so he drags the beauty salon owner. Then he has the courage to complain about the bill! But I also suspect that the world has changed a lot since this film was made. On a serious note it was fun to see some of the footage of Jan de Bont and one of Paul Verhoeven's early films. Hmmm, maybe the world hasn't changed so much after all?
