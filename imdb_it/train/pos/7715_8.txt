First of all, consider that this film is almost fifty years old! Still, it still stands as one of the great movies of all time. I wonder how many celluloid productions to throw away today will still be discussed in 2050? <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but fairly solid and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day. I can still remember the first time I saw this, as a child, when the monster enters the force field that protects the ship and you have to see its pattern for the first (and only) time. It made me tremble with fear, I can tell you. It looks dated today, but still quite effective. <br /> <br /> The tiger scenes show their age now. You can see the outline in which the tiger was moldy in the Altaira shots, but they are only visible. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the effect the creature makes its way through the doors of Krell is wonderfully done. <br /> <br /> It is also incredible to see Leslie Nielsen (better remembered for the films of Airplane and Naked Gun) as a young man, but still mature. He was 30 when this movie came out! Almost 80 now! <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie that will surely continue to be a favorite of the years to come. Timeless.
