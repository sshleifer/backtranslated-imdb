If you've seen this movie, you've been to Puerto Rico. I have lived in Puerto Rico all my life, and I must shamefully admit that we (PR) live a real chaos right now, the drug is the main reason for the shootings and murders we have almost every day. These people will shoot anyone, anytime, anywhere, and many innocent lives have been lost because of this. We no longer feel safe, and in addition to this, our so-called "justice" is no longer driven by truth and fairness, but by money, influence and power. "Ladrones y Mentirosos" is based on real and deplorable facts and describes the three main problems of Puerto Rico: the drug-related murders, the money and the power that manipulate our courtrooms, and innocent people and corrupt and even dying children because of this. Ricardo and his wife Poli, with their realistic plot and their award-winning direction (**), had the courage to present all this as badly as it is: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and welcoming country that lives a nightmare that doesn't seems to end !!! ** They recently won the "Copper Wing Award" for Best Director at the World Cinema Competition at the 2006 Phoenix Film Festival.
