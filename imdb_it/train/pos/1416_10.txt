The EARTH is a must see for children and adults. My son had a great time watching all these funny birds and ice bears. We can learn a lot from this film and we should be proud of our great treasure on earth. There are some animals in danger of disappearing. Exactly that problem should prevent all the authorities of our planet. <br /> <br /> This documentary offers many exceptional images that I have never seen before. So it is well accompanied by a heavenly music. The director did a great job here that gets the maximum respect. Nothing can stop me and my family from speeding up the EARTH. I really hope that things will create a following.
