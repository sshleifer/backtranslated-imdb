This film documents a transformative experience for a group of young men, and the experience of watching it is in itself transformative for the viewer. Few films also aspire to this level of transcendence, and I can't think of any other film - documentary or drama - that makes it. There is no other film in which I laughed so much and cried so much. Yes, it concerns DMD and accessible travel; on these issues alone, it is a worthy undertaking, but it is more. It's about friendship. It is about life itself, living every day that you are alive. And it's a great, fun, adventurous narrative. This is why God created cinema! Watch this movie !!!
