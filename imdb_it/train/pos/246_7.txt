How could I miss the chance to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I couldn't and so, I rented this movie mess. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of Ned Kelly and was surprised by what I discovered about the legend of this young man. I was also surprised by how mediocre this film was. Perhaps the fact that it was very, very late and at the end of a 4-hour film marathon or perhaps because it was a bit slow, I found this story difficult to follow. Not because the plot is complicated, but because it is slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting and dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Although I will dwell on recommending this as a must see, it is a great story of Australian history (considering how young the country is, this is very rare and should be appreciated) and the film has some good sequences of actions. <br /> <br /> 6/10 to see it for historical value .... (yes right ... and this is the only reason to see it ...;))
