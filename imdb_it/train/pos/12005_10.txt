This film was the best film I've ever seen. Being SUG, I highly recommend this film because you can better understand the life of Joseph Smith. Although the film was not made with highly acclaimed actors, it is an extraordinary film that can change lives and can be appreciated and appreciated by all. I saw this film with my family and I can testify that we all had a change of heart. This film allows people to truly understand how hard life has been for the prophet and how much tribulation he has had to face. After watching this movie, there was not a single dry eye in the entire room. Everyone was touched by what they saw and I haven't been the same since I saw it. I highly recommend this movie for everyone.
