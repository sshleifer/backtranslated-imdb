I only make an excuse for this film: there are many, many, very large wide-angle close-ups, and if they irritate you beyond endurance, quite right. They drove ME for the first ten minutes or so. But then I made a kind of truce with the terrible cinematography; and long before the end of the film, I had stopped worrying. This is a comedy too rich to be destroyed so easily. It's funny, it's funny, the comic distribution of EVERYTHING the cast is flawless, and as much as Usher writes his characters through a cool, fish-eye lens - he might not be very interested in them - he can present them warmly. "Mystery Men" is, in fact, not only more fun, not only smarter, but also deeper, than anyone seems to have given credit for. The jokes in the Austin Powers movies, for example, in addition to being less fun than jokes here, are also much more mushy. The satire of "Mysteries of Men" bites when there is something that is worth biting and gnawing gently when it is not there. He doesn't just tease an old thing. This is why, contrary to what some have said (I have to consider them as non-observers), ideas never end. <br /> <br /> The "super" heroes are an attractive group. Of course, they are second-rate, but they are not simply second-rate. The Blue Rajah, for example, does nothing but lay cutlery on people, and is not so good at it. On the other hand, he isn't comically bad either. It is better in its limited field than most people, and practices diligently. He's not a fool, which makes him a much more fun character than he was. If Superman is Christ in a cloak, the Mysterious Men are all the minor demigods from the feet of Mount Olympus, to the Cape. Much more fun; also much more appealing.
