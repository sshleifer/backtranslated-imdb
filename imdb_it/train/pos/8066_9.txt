One of John Ford's best films, "The Informer", presents no great scenery of the American West. Instead the intense drama Ford was known for its shows on the no less rugged terrain of the face of British actor Victor McLaglen. The former boxer, who once confronts Joe Louis in the ring, delivers an Oscar-winning portrait of the disgraced IRA soldier, Gypo Nolan, in the worst night of his life. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple: In 1922 Dublin, a hungry and humiliated man who was kicked out of the IRA for not being able to kill a cold-blooded informant, becomes an informant himself. For 20 pounds he betrays a friend to "The Tans" and for the rest of the night he drinks and donates his blood money in rapidly alternating spasms of guilt, denial, self-pity and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his Actions. <br /> <br /> It is the remarkable complexity given to the apparently simple Gypo character that is the most impressive result of the film. In most films a clumsy Gypo model would have been chosen as heavy, would have had at most two or three lines and would have been quickly eliminated so that the hero and villain could have their showdown. In "The Informer" Gypo himself is both a hero and a villain, while the showdown is in his inner turmoil, each part of which is explicitly shared with the public. <br /> <br /> Because Liam O'Flaherty's novel had previously been filmed in 1929, RKO gave Ford a very modest budget. The director and his associates, particularly cinematographer Joseph H. August, have turned this to their advantage in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself. In addition to McLaglen's "The Informer" Oscar, he also won John Ford, the first along with victories for best screenplay and best soundtrack.
