An excellent film with great performances by Zack and Lochley. Much to their displeasure (and mine) Garibaldi arrived at the station. (With all due respect to Jerry Doyle, but in seasons 4 and 5 I lost sympathy for the character.) It doesn't take much to start criticizing Zack (whom I love most about the show on the show) and take charge. I'm sure Zack could have made it. The plot of Soulhunter is fascinating, especially if you believe in heaven as Zack does. Humor integrates it well. 10/10
