The name of Hayao Miyazaki has become important with Spitied Away, however what is often overlooked are the director's first films. Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel or George Lucas directed THX 1138? I remember seeing fragments of this film - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in the late 1980s and what struck me was the visual rigor of design and animation. So when I found a copy in a store known for Â£ 9 I couldn't resist but buy it. The strange thing is that the last 45 minutes of the film do not correspond to my memory (memory is fun that way). <br /> <br /> Watching this film now with all the acquired knowledge of artists' portfolios is as very similar to Jean 'Moebius' Giraud, some of the works of art are. I can only assume some influence here. <br /> <br /> When Pazu captures a girl who falls (Sheeta), her adventure really begins - the search for Laputa - a reference to the neglected part of Gulliver by Gulliver. With healthy references to Jules Verne is a basic film against bad pursuit with the final part with the heroes who end up on Laputa. <br /> <br /> This is the strongest part in my memory: the "pastoral" The ecological aspect of Laputa is back to nature: the multitude of mossy robots under the giant tree. This is, in my opinion, the highlight of the film: the views of the Laputa surface, as opposed to the mechanized subsoil. <br /> <br /> Although this is the dichotomy of this film, showing that even technology cannot overcome nature - the irony of the last robot that takes care of the garden and the animals. The ending of the movie Silent Running is almost exactly the same. <br /> <br /> It's incredibly elegant, I wouldn't say "shiny" - very nice and organic and a huge amount of detail in buildings, airships and the design and appearance of it all. <br /> <br /> Myazaki is a true master of this type of Japanese anime. Buy this movie and make it a treasure.
