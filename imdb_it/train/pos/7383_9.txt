An extremely tense thriller set in the urban chaos of São Paulo, the biggest and ugliest third world nightmare in Brazilian urbanism. To make it easy for anyone who is curious about this intriguing and really well made film, he has the grit of the Mexican feature "Amores Perros" with a character not too far from Max Cady, of both Cape Fears, even if this is not at all a movie about a psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in a construction company pay the assassin Anisio (Miklos) off their third partner (and holder of majority shares) in the said construction company. The murder is blamed on the city, but things are starting to look really dark when the witty and charismatic nightmare Anisio decides he wants to get around the increasingly nervous partners of crime, not only by encroaching but, above all, by deconstructing the severe social codes that form the Brazilian company. Anisio transforms poverty into an attitude and wants to enter. The look is almost entirely hand-held, grainy, his exceptional performances, especially as an actor (and member of the classic Brazilian pop band "Titãs"), Paulo Miklos, dazzles and baffles the viewer with his sympathetic social terror. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie at the Brasília film Fest in November 2001. Since then it has gone very well at Sundance and Berlin. Kleber Mendonça Filho
