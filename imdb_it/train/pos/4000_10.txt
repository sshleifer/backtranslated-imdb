Wow. I saw this last night and I'm still recovering from how good it was. Each character seemed so real (although most of them were mean, selfish, a bit of a hole) and the bizarre story - the middle-aged widow starts fucking her daughter's boyfriend - felt absolutely convincing. The best performances in the round, but those of Anne Reid and Daniel Craig of our friends in the North (the latter who looks like the next David Thewlis). <br /> <br /> And director Roger Michell? This is as far from Notting Hill as it can be. Thank God. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie !!!
