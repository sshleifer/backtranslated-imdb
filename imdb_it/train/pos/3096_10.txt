Six degrees made me mad. I couldn't wait for it to arrive and I was disappointed when Men in Trees replaced its place over time. I thought it was just a break and I would be back in early 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised that it ended. We could refer to characters who have had real problems. We talked about each episode and we had our favorite characters. There was nobody on the show that I didn't like and I felt that acting was superb. I always like to see recorded programs in cities where local areas can be identified. I for one would like to protest the cancellation of this show and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance. Give it a good time, don't move it from this day to that day and advertise it so people know it's active.
