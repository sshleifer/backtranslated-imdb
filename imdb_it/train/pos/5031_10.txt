This film was beautifully designed! There are no flaws. Not in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. The script is an invitation to a complex game in which the participants find themselves in a simple mission. <br /> <br /> Paxton is at his best in this role. His ways, the infections used in the tones of his voice are without errors. Every shot meticulously done! The surprises occur one after the other when the film exceeds its first hour. This may not be the best image of the year, but it is a gem that has been very well polished. It is not for the simple mind.
