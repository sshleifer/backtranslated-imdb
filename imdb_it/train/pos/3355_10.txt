May 1938. Hitler in Italy. Preparations for the historic appointment with Mussolini. Emotions, tensions and forms of self-assertion. an empty city, a housewife and a journalist. The meeting of two different worlds. Refuge for a mother with a sad life. Short fill for a classic victim. A story of solitude and silence. About the shape of the corners of life and desire as a form of combat. The great character - a book given to him in a spring afternoon. This film is a poem, notable for art to describe the nuances of common solitude. A plea for an ineffable relationship with reality. And with your inner world. The images of Il Duce, the clumsiness of Antonietta, the patience and delicate tension of Gabriele, the art of the director to give the meaning of the script to two great actors make this film sublime, a foretaste of subtle delicacy, a wonderful film on the hypocrisy and arbitrary verdict, on the essence of life and the repulsion of all tyranny. Loren and Mastroianni are the masters of a magnificent intelligent acting. A clear masterpiece.
