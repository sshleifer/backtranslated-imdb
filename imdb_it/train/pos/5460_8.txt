And what men want is her ... well, you know. Alfred E. Green's Baby Face (1933) is a film with a high sexual content. For a movie of that era, anyway. This was one of the last pre movies. - Code that they were made. Barbara Stanwyck plays a very sexy performance like Lily. Other actors in this film include George Brent (Courtland Trenholm), Donald Cook (Ned Stevens), Alphonse Ethier (Adolf Cragg), Henry Kolker (JP Carter), Margaret Lindsay (Ann Carter) and Theresa Harris (Chico). Young John Wayne is played by Jimmy McCoy Jr. This film is a brave topic and does it well. Baby Face is a historically significant film and therefore good to see.
