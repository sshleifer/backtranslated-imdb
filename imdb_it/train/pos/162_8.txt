For a "budgetless" movie this thing breaks. I don't know if America will like it, but we were laughing all the way. Some really fun funny things. Really not Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Actors and music shook. The machines and the gags and even the least things on our faces made us collapse. Whooo Whooo! <br /> <br /> I've seen some of the actors before, but never in something like that, one or two of them I think I've seen them in commercials or something somewhere. Basically it's rocking! Fortunately I could see a copy of a friend of one of the actors.
