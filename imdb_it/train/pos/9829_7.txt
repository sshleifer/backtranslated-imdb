This movie is fantastic on so many levels ... and none of them is the level on which it was thought to be fantastic. <br /> <br /> Just remember this: when you watch Shaun of the Dead and other recent zombie movies ... be they good or bad ... THIS is the formula they are using. This is what makes zombie movies so fantastic. <br /> <br /> And what makes BETTER is that the story behind the movie is great. A simple web search will give you everything you need to know. <br /> <br /> All in all, it does not linger. There is never a point where you think of yourself "come on, get along" ... it moves quickly and bends well. This is the sporting and little Italian number of zombie gestures. <br /> <br /> So horrible, it's wonderful! If your tongue spends a great deal of time on your cheek ... rent it, buy it, love it. <br /> <br /> Like a great note: if you are watching it on DVD, you will notice that there are sound effects during the menu screen, under the musical score ... Well ... it's because the music it was removed directly from the trailer ... which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists and that is long enough to do the cycle.
