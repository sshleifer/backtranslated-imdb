The cast was good, and I thought it was a good performance by Christopher Lloyd, which I like in previous films. The film was a great family film, nothing that would have made you worry about showing it to children, a good storyline, lots of laughter, carefree and fun. If you want to entertain children without getting bored to tears, this fits the project. Nice kid, and not difficult for a parent to watch, either.
