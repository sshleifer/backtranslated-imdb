Because a series of films too stupid, boring, crappy like "Star Wars" really makes a difference, and a truly incredible film like this is completely unknown ... it's beyond me ... This film will really open your eyes dark, disturbing , sad and scary world we live in ... <br /> <br /> Unlike the boring "Elephant", this movie is not one of those movies "just a typical day until someone pulls the trigger" .. this film focuses more on what happens AFTER the event ... <br /> <br /> Deana, played by the excellent and very talented Erika Christensen, is a healthy and happy student, a student with great friends and a great life ... until ... she is injured on the day of the shooting, being hit in the head. Fortunately she is not killed, but she is seriously injured and must be in the hospital for a while, causing her to have a lot of emotional pain, in addition to her body ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Alicia, also played by the charming and talented Busy Phillips, she's a bad, cold, rebellious, anti-social goth girl who doesn't have a single positive trait about her ... and she's unharmed when shooting occurs ... because it turns out she was FRIENDS with the shooter and knew he would do what he did ... that leads her to be taken to the police station and questions are asked. When she refuses to tell the police if she knew the shot would happen, they come constantly at her house trying to convince her to say something ... and she still doesn't do it, so the principal of the school makes her attend the funeral of one of the dead students, and after she leaves ... the principal decides that is enough and forces her to go and visit Deana all hospital .. Obviously she refuses this too, but the principal says that if Alicia doesn't do this, the cops will keep trying to convince her to say something ... and so she actually goes to see her ... <br /> < br /> The only one traumatized, and both physically and emotionally wounded Deana is more than happy for someone to visit her, but of course Alicia is everything but is happy to see her .. Deana tries to give her a friendly welcome, but of course Alicia answers with nothing but harsh and offensive comments and a harsh statement about how she's just here because she's forced, and she's not going to be friendly with her at all. But sooner or later, that intention will change ... (and that's all I will say :) This is truly one of the most moving films of all time, as well as one of the most obscure and disturbing .. Actually, I think I would be this with "American History X" at the same time disturbing and moving ... <br /> <br /> ATTENTION: watch this movie at your own risk !! Contains VERY scenes and graphic images! EXCELLENT movie and criminally undervalued! I'm so ashamed of being practically the only one to know!
