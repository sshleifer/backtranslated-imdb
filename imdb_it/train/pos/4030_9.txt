This film was absolutely wonderful. The time and culture of the pre-partition have been beautifully recreated. Urmila gave another brilliant performance. What I really admire about this film is that it does not resort to the Pakistani beating that is spreading in films like Gadar and LOC. With the partition as a background, the film does not address political issues or focuses on violence or what is right and wrong. The film always focuses on the tragic story of Urmila's life. His fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai has been well represented. The film actually shows how people, both Hindu and Muslim, suffered from this partition. The theme that there is only one religion is really prevalent in this film.
