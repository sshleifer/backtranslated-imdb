I saw this movie at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and it was completely wiped out. The structure and execution of the film were fantastic ... I know I won't, but it really deserves an Oscar nod. Cal and Andre were as phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates. Yes, the film is very controversial and I can see a lot of people who have a lot of problems with it, as it deals with shooting at school and in particular makes you identify with the killers. However, despite its harsh and sharp arguments, Zero Day deserves to be seen. I can't wait for it to come out on video, so I can buy it - it's very, very good. Very powerful and intense ... the final shooting sequence leaves you speechless because it's almost too realistic. Their uncertainty, the "recordings", the filming and the panic of the students, totally indescribable. I really hope he gets the attention he deserves. It's done in the same format as The Blair Witch Project, a portable camera, made to look like a real home video documentary film - but God is INFINITELY better. Very impressive, hat off to everyone involved. If you have the chance that you should really see it.
