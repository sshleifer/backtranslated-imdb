Tom Hanks like you've never seen him before. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, "The angel of death". He is a hit man for his surrogate father John Rooney (Paul Newman), an elderly Irish mafia boss. Sullivan's young son (Tyler Hoechlin) is witness to what his father does for a living and both are soon on the road for seven weeks robbing banks to avenge the murder of Sullivan's wife and another son. Join Jude Law as a reporter / photographer willing to kill Sullivan himself for the chance to add photos of dead mobsters to his collection. Shot beautifully capturing the drama of life in the 1930s. Sometimes the rhythm rises, but then a burst of graphic violence sustains the story. Director Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty, responsibility, betrayal and the bond of a reserved man and his young son. Other important members of the cast are: Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks proves excellent again in a memorable film. Make room for some Oscars!
