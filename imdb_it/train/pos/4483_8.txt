Everything should be a musical comedy. Gene Kelly (like Joe Brady) doesn't miss a pass, and Frank Sinatra (like Clarence Doolittle) doesn't miss a note. The scenes with them together are very good, showing how much talent can add to a somewhat erratic plot. "The Fall in Love Too Easily" by Sinatra is an indication of its future and better future. Kelly's "Mexican Hat Dance" with a young Mexican girl is delicious. Kelly certainly deserved his nomination as best actor. And there's a lot of really fun lines, like, "Do you think the navy uses drugs?"; "Do you think someone sings a sailor to sleep?"; and, "We had a small problem, we caught a small child." A really nice film, the right thing to shake off the dust of a just ended second world war.
