One of the most sensible comedies to hit Hindi cinema screens. A remake of the 80s Priyadarshans Malayalam hit Boeing Boeing, which in turn was a remake of the 1960s Hollywoon of the same name, Garam Masala raising the standard of comedies in Hindi cinema. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar has once again proved that she is one of the best super stars of Hindi cinema who can do comedy. He combined well with the new piece John Abraham. However John still remains in the shadows of Akshays and fails to rise to the occasion. <br /> <br /> The new girls are nice and do their roles justice. <br /> <br /> A must watch watch comedy. Leave your brains alone and laugh for 2 hours !!!! After all the laughter is the best medicine! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!
