Considering that it was made on a low budget, THE DAY TIME ENDED manages to make the most of its budget with some amazing special effects. <br /> <br /> The story involves a family that is about to enter its solar world -powered home in an isolated part of the Mojave desert in southwestern California, only to find it trashed - by vandal bikers, they think. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) started seeing mysterious things - a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, etc. And only recently, the light of an explosion of a trinar star has made auroras extremely unusual in the desert skies. So the family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, comes face to face with strange alien forces that have inserted them in a temporal and spatial detachment. <br /> <br /> Mixing elements of 2001: AN ODYSSEY OF THE SPACE AND CLOSED MEETINGS OF THE THIRD GENDER, THE DAY WITH FINISHED TIME, despite its obvious defects and its irregular acting, remains interesting thanks to the superb work of the special effects by David Allen. The desert setting is very appropriate for the close encounters of this film; and while the film cannot really be compared to the films of Kubrick or Spielberg, THE DAY TIME ENDED is much better than many other 2001 / CLOSE ENCOUNTERS knock-offs. I give credit to director John 'Bud' Cardos, whose 1977 thriller KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS was an interesting forerunner of ARACHNOPHOBIA, at least for having tried, and on this basis I gave THE DAY TIME ENDED a 7 out of 10.
