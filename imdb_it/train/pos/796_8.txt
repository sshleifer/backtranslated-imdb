Thomas Capano was not the boss of Anne Marie, Tom Carper, he was the Governor. This is why the feds were involved, he called Clinton and asked him to involve the feds in the case. At the time I lived outside of Philadelphia, so the case was headline news every day. I also read Ann Rule's book and saw the "City Confidential" segment on A & E. Tom Capano was a megalomaniac (sp.), A super controller and a monster. He said he loved Ann Marie, but all he wanted was someone he could control. When she didn't want to let him do it, he killed her, the last form of control. I think it's a waste of money that is still alive.
