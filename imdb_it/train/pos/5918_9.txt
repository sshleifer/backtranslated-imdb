One of the most interesting films to be classified as "blaxploitation", Bakshi's "Coonskin" is a rich text full of wonderful insights. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who also appear in the film. The racist images can often be disturbing, but the message of the film was so powerful that the NAACP gave it a support (but only reluctantly). I strongly recommend this film to anyone interested in a film examining the pervasive atmosphere of racism that Bakshi attempts to deconstruct. Wonderful stuff
