This was a great film that had many hidden problems. He faced issues of rascism and class. But he also had a message of knowledge of yourself and taking responsibility for yourself. This film was very deep and gave you the message of you and only you can control your destiny. He has also shown that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way you will ever fit into society. What others think of you is not important. I think this film did a great job showing it. The actors that I think were able to convey each character wonderfully. I just thought it was amazing how deep this movie was. With a simple look you would not see how deep the film is, but at a further glance you see the underlying meaning of the film.
