This is easily the most underrated movie of the Brooks cannon. Of course, it's defective. It does not give a realistic view of the homeless (unlike, for example, how citizen Kane gave a realistic view of the lounge singers, or Titanic gave a realistic view of IDIOTA Italians). Many of the bars fall flat. However, this film is very lovable in a sense in which many comedies are not, and getting inspiration from a story about some of the most traditionally insulted society members is really impressive. It's not the Fisher King, but it's not even crap. My only complaint is that Brooks should have chosen someone else in the head (I love Mel as a director and screenwriter, not so much as a protagonist).
