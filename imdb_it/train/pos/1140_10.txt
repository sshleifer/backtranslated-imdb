I've been a fan of this film for years and years. Since Teri Hatchers is at the forefront, I had to take the film off the shelf and watch it. Why didn't the people in 1991 see how beautiful this film is beyond me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are beyond fabulous. Although I have never seen daytime soap operas, this film kills me every time I look at it. Acting is second to none for comedy and writing is so clever. I highly recommend looking at it if you haven't already. You'll see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher and Carrie Fisher ... to name a few ... they all give great performances.
