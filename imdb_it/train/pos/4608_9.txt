Jackie Chan is considered by many fans of cinema and martial arts as one of the greatest action stars that has ever graced the silver screen and Police Story has cemented his reputation as a probable successor to the great Bruce Lee. If Enter The Dragon has laid bare the so-called benchmark of Lee's greatness in the 1970s, then the same can be said about Police Story and Jackie Chan in the 80s. <br /> <br /> Forget the Rush Hour trilogy, or one of his efforts in the United States - the only film that characterizes Chan's excellence, not to mention the fact that he started his role as a tall and overwhelming kung-fu talisman, just as his film career is was this, Police Story, the first in a series of films by successful policemen, set in the mainland, today's Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> I have seen many of his efforts - likewise the American Rush Hour, Rumble in the Bronx, The Medalian and The Tuxedo to name and frankly many of them become insignificant compared to Police Story. In those films, we saw a less "stupid" version of Jackie, who didn't have the opportunity to make the most of his fighting skills, not to mention the combat sequences that weren't as good as those in which Drunken Master , Police Story to name. <br /> <br /> The stunts in this film are extraordinary and are the best in any action movie. The mall scene is literally one of a kind and must be seen to be believed: the flying glass fragments, Chan who is left dangling off the bus only by his walking stick while a madman frantically drives through the streets of the city, and Chan is successfully making use of all kinds of inanimate objects and pointing devices as weapons to fight the bad guys with. <br /> <br /> Considering that it is known to hurt and break every bone in his body and get into trouble, Jackie's perseverance in showing her versatility as a stuntman himself by not relying on one, is a bit of a testament to his reputation as a kung fu expert. Especially because it has the bruises to show for this. Thus, he proved not to be a one-trick pony when it comes to inventing and inventing different and intelligent moves. <br /> <br /> In terms of history, there is not much to discuss but what is lacking in narrative, it compensates for its end-to-end action and fights sequences. As for dialogue, well it's not really a huge aspect of the film, which is why most of the fans of Jackie and martial arts films are more interested in action, as opposed to history. <br /> <br /> Unlike saying Matrix, there are no wires or CGIs, nor any form of computer trick involved. What you see is what you get- and what you get with Police Story is a great epic of Jackie Chan, full of action and pulsating stunts. It's better than Rumble In The Bronx, Rush Hour and all its other American efforts. /> <br /> Police Story is an excellent film and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who is a novice fan of Jackie Chan, but you are not sure which one you should look at first.
