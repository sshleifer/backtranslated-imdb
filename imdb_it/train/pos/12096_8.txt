I've seen this movie a number of times and found it very good. This film is also known as "Castle Of Terror", "Coffin Of Terror" and "Dance Macabre". Barbara Steele, is her usual scary beauty / self. George Riviere, the male lead, does a good job with his role. The whole film is dripping with atmosphere, and there is a lot of tension everywhere. The camera angles are good and the acting, for the most part, is not bad. This film is suitable for a rainy day or evening. I have the uncut version of the DVD, which is far superior to the modified TV version. Grab some popcorn, turn off the lights, relax and enjoy. John R. Tracy
