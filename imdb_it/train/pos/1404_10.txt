HOLLOW MAN is one of the best horror films of the last ten years. The secondary plot is original and the main plot is even better. The special effects are brilliant and perhaps the best I've ever seen in a horror movie. Kevin Bacon demonstrates once again that he is able to handle any role that happens to him. <br /> <br /> Claude Rains shocked the world with THE INVISIBLE MAN in 1933, well now, Kevin Bacon shocked * us * with HOLLOW MAN. One of the most thrilling horror films ever. The action is intense and the chills are real. Actually you might find yourself jumping if you look at it in the dark on a stormy night. The supporting cast includes Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joey Slotnick, Greg Grunberg and Mary Randle. All of them do an exceptional job. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- <br /> <br /> Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team discovered the secret to making someone invisible. After animal tests, they go on to tests on humans. But someone has to be the topic. Volenteering, Caine has become invisible. But when his team is unable to return to visibility, Caine has gone mad about his condition while seeking his revenge ... * fine spoiler * <br /> <br /> The film has created memorable shocks is destined to become a classic for the next century. Becoming the basis for a playful parody in SCARY MOVIE 2, this movie grabs you by the throat and never gives up. The first 45 minutes are slow, develop the characters and show how their experiments work. The second part is exciting and engaging for most action and horror fans. Think of DEEP BLUE SEA. So change the sharks into a crazy invisible man. And then change the water to fire and explosions. A rebound of a movie about murder sharks. Interesting ... HOLLOW MAN gets 5/5.
