Surprised to see the rather low score for this film. I just saw this movie for the first time in 10 years, and I was reminded of it because I like it. <br /> <br /> Come back with me, kids, at a time when Michael Keaton was a normal level comedian, and you might find some joy in this movie. It's a kind comedy - the kind that Ron Howard specializes in - but if that's your case, you should check it out. Keaton's low-key charm is perfect for this project. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" is a little dated, because it takes place in the last phase of the pre-global economic world, when it still mattered what country in which a company is based. That said, it offers laughter and a lesson on how people can learn from each other, with great benefits. <br /> <br /> You could watch this movie and enjoy it without remembering one of them the scene in particular you liked a lot, but it is because the whole movie provides a slow but constant stream of laughter. It is like an I.V. drip. And I say this in a positive sense.
