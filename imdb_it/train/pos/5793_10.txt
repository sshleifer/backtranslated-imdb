Michael Jackson's Moonwalker is a real adventure film for the whole family! <br /> <br /> Before the real story of the film begins, we receive a performance from the Bad Tour (Man In The Mirror), and a great film kicks off. After that we get a sort of collage of Michael carrier, as it was until Moonwalker came out in 1988. After some music videos too (Speed ​​Demon, Leave Me Alone, etc.) the story begins. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically that Michael and his 3 friends (who are children) are chased by the villain of the story "Mr. Big" because they discovered his evil plans to entangle drugs all over the world . During the chase we see fantastic segments, fx. The video of Michaels for Smooth Criminal, which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences, etc. But then one of the boys is kidnapped by Mr. Big, and Michael will keep her to save her before she becomes a drug addict. <br /> <br /> During the film we see special effects not only surprising for the standards of those days, but also impressive today. For example, see Michael addressing a robot / spaceship to protect his friends! It's so beautiful! <br /> <br /> The film ends with a performance of Come Together (later published in the HIStory Michaels double album), and leave the film with a magical feeling. Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to all families who want to spend a nice evening with candy and popcorn in front of the TV. And now some parents might stand up and say, "But Michael Jackson is a supposed child rapist!" Yes, it really is, but come on, we all know it's not true! Wait and see ..
