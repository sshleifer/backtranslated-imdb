Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors of the time, made films full of beautiful scenes, delicate love and respect for all that is precious in life. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, if people were to hear about him, they associate the name of Marischka with the trilogy SISSI (1955,1956,1957). However, he made other excellent films such as DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and certainly this, MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN showing the young years of Queen Victoria. Although this is a slightly different theme from the SISSI films, I don't see many differences between this film and SISSI. They are surprisingly similar. <br /> <br /> The film is almost identical. Style, music, photography. In fact, the crew is almost the same. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! <br /> <br /> The cast ... Romy Schneider is one of the first major roles. It was a nice introduction to her role as Sissi as this film was made a year before the first part of the Austrian Empress trilogy. It is also a film in which Romy plays with his mother, Magda Schneider. But Ernst Marischka was not the first director who chose Romy to play with his mother. Romy's debut, WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN (1953) was also his performance with his mother. Therefore, there were some rumors that Romy started his Austrian career on the basis of his mother's fame. In fact, there is some truth in it. <br /> <br /> Once again, as in SISSI, this film shows love very gently. Victoria meets Prince Albert at a small inn in Dover. Their sympathy is based on pure exaltation in dance and sweet smiles. And now...? How would it be shown? Only sex ... But is that the only thing love is based on? <br /> <br /> I am grateful to Ernst Marischka for these films. They had a soul and a message. Some people might call them kitsch, but I'll never stop admiring these films. They are impressive !!! UNFORTUNATELY, HIGHLY BELOW!
