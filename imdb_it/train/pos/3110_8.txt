The third and final part of the Bourne trilogy (duh), is a bit lacking in the history department, but covers it with extended action scenes! In particular, Twi takes some of the running time and improves this movie. <br /> <br /> The director and star (Damon) agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part, because the end of the second film was quite ... advanced from the point of view of the plot. How did they make it? The action scenes, for once, but they also did something else, which I can't reveal, because that would be a spoiler. But if you watch the movie, you'll notice it! Strangely, I read that this adaptation of the Bourne books is the least accurate of all three films ... if that means anything to you: o)
