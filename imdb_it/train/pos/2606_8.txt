Perhaps some people might consider it a slow movie. However, it is precisely this "slow combustion" that allows the viewer to be deeply influenced. Like that wonderful first scene: first, we can hear the voices; therefore, we are authorized to see the characters; finally, the camera slowly moves back and to the side and we see another character, a young man sitting there, apparently without even listening to the conversation or, at least, not very careful. The fact that this young man is the protagonist is the film's strategy: to allow the character to develop and be determined by the environment that surrounds him, but without stressing the points more than necessary. People come and go, they flow in and out of his life. Although most of the film follows him (and most of the supporting characters are seen only next to him, defined based on the relationship maintained with him), we are led to believe that we are objective, the director's touch is so subtle .
