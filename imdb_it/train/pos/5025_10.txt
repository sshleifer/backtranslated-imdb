Friend, some of you must get cold. This film was an artistic genius. Instead of looking for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality, why can't you understand that it is a work of fiction? A story. Entertainment, for God's sake (it's not a pun). It seems to me that too many people here are trying to be film critics - and they're not doing well. I am so impressed with the film and the work of Bill Paxton as director, that I will contact him personally to tell him. You know, if you weren't trying to analyze the possibility of the plot, you could enjoy the movie. I and all my friends did it!
