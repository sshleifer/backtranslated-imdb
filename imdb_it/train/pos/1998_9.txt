In Cinema Retro magazine n. 2, Mark Lester's voice is revealed to have been nicknamed by a 20-year-old woman, Kathe Green. Although Leste was considered perfect for the title role, director Carol Reed was not at all satisfied with her singing abilities. The secret was revealed in a 2004 UK documentary entitled "Oliver! After They Were Famous". Greene was paid Â£ 400 for his work and had to agree to keep his participation secret, as did Mark Lester. They kept their word and revealed this fact only as part of the TV show decades after the film was released. For the record, Mark Lester has retired from acting and is a practicing osteopath in England.
