Piece of subtle art. Perhaps a masterpiece. Undoubtedly a special story about the ambiguity of existence. Kafka-style tale of the impossibility of winning or surviving in a perennial and strange world. Life is, in this film, only an adaptation exercise. Lecture on limits and original sin, on the fragility of innocence and on the error of its ways. <br /> <br /> Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Images of the Evidence and the same ambiguous woman. And Europe is the symbol of the basic crisis that has many aspects like the chimeric wars or the incautious search for truth / essence / golden age. Methaphor or parable, the film is a story of disappointed evolution. War, peace, business or lies are just details of jelly time. Hypocrisy is a mask. Love: a convention. The method of sacrifice to hope to understand a painful reality.
