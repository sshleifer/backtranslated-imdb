I rented it for my son who recently found interest in 9/11. He was a kindergarten at the time and had no idea what was going on. I liked the way it was said as a "documentary". If there was a film I would recommend to see on 9/11, this would be THE! Usually you see a movie with well-known actors. This film had no one known. Also, see a 9/11 film, hear about a firefighter or two who lose their lives by saving people. I didn't think this had any of this! I only rented this movie and would definitely consider it added to my collection! Really well done! My heart goes to the survivors and families of the 9/11 victims!
