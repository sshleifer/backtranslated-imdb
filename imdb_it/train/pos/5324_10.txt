Having just watched this movie from a 1998 showing the VH-1 again, I just had to comment. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie on TV, it was 1981, and I remember I was recording it from my mother's betamax. He ended up recording in black and white for some reason, which gave him an appearance that I liked. <br /> <br /> I very distinctly remember the film that begins with the song "My Bonnie", as a panoramic camera on a Liverpool scene. I also remember the opening scene in which Paolo mentions some girls and says: "Look, talent!" So it was with great irritation that I inserted in my version registered in 1998 and "remembered" that the film opens with "She Loves You" instead of "My Bonnie". When you see how slowly the camera rotates with the speed of the music, you can see that "She Loves You" doesn't fit. Also, in this "later" version when Paul sees the girls, he says "Look, GIRLS!" .. and somehow remembering the previous version, even that word didn't seem to fit. Because they felt that they had to Americanize this film for the American public is beyond me. Personally, if I watch a film about a British band, I want all British colloquialisms and they are part of their way of speaking, mannerisms, etc. <br /> <br /> Another irritation was how "Choppy" the editing was for television. Immediately after Stu was defeated, for example, the film is reduced to a commercial: many of them. Yes, I know it depends on the network, but it actually ruins the effect of a movie to make it apart, as we all know. What some people may find insignificant in terms of dialogue (and therefore modification) may actually explain how a given action or scene follows. <br /> <br /> My point is, the "best" version of this film was probably the previous version I recorded since 1981, which happened to include the "Shake, Rattle & Roll" scene that the my 1998 version did not have. I began to assume that there had to be two different versions for television, and a look at the "alternative versions" link about this film showed me that I was right. The fact that the American version has shorter / cut scenes / dialogues / dialogues and / or is a huge disappointment for me and something worth mentioning if you worry about these things. Imo, the best solution is to try to get a European version of this film, if possible, and (probably even less possible), a new version. Unfortunately, I had to discard my old European version of betamax because I didn't know how to convert it. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I found this film as one of the best films regarding the story behind the "birth of the Beatles". Being well aware of the fact that artistic and creative license is often used in movies and on TV when portraying events in history, I left no discrepancy in my enjoyment of the film. Sure, you see the Beatles singing songs at the Cavern that made me ask, "They even wrote that back then ?? I don't think so," but, however, I thought it was a great movie and the performances, wonderful. <br /> <br /> The real point of reference for me, in fact, was the actor who played John, Stephen MacKenna. I almost fell in love with him. His appearance, his manner, his personality and his spoken voice seemed to be well chosen. It seemed like a young John for me to do a double-take towards the end of the film when the Beatles are seen performing on Ed Sullivan for the first time. Actually I found myself wondering if it was or wasn't a real footage of the Beatles, until I saw the other actors in the scene. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a dead and accurate story of the life and beginnings of the Beatles, you cannot have better than "The Beatles Anthology", as it was "written" by the boys themselves. However, if you are looking for a fun snapshot of their pre-Beatlemania days leading up to their arrival in America and leave your critical anal ratings at the door, you can't go wrong with the "Birth of the Beatles" - a MUST for every fan of "Real" or random Beatles.
