While I loved this movie, the trailers that circulated on the internet the year before they reached the theaters have a bit high expectations. <br /> <br /> I own the DVD, so don't get me wrong, I'm not saying don't watch it or buy it! It's just that I still think that the first scene was the best, and nothing in the whole movie has ever passed it.
