"Heartland" is a wonderful representation of how it really was to live at the border. The hard work and individual strength needed to survive the adversity of the climate and the lack of medical care merge with the camaraderie and the interdependence of the settlers. The drama was particularly significant because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose descendants still live there. It was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people. No one was charming or seemed to have just spent a session with the make-up or costumes department. Conchatta Ferrell is simply wonderful. She is an example of the strong and persevering people who came to Wyoming in the early 20th century and do not let adversity hinder their new life in a new land.
