I saw this movie about twenty years ago in the late show. I still vividly remember the film, in particular the Robert Taylor exhibition. I always thought that Taylor was underestimated as an actor, since many critics considered him a solid, almost boring type of man, and women simply loved watching his movies because of his appearance. This film, however, showed what an interesting actor it could be. He didn't have enough roles like this during his long career. This is his best performance. It is totally credible in a truly evil role. From what I read, he was a very hard-working and easy guy in real life and he never fought enough for this kind of role. Basically he would simply have done what MGM gave him. This film shows that he could handle more diverse and difficult roles. The other thing I remember from this movie is how annoying was the character of Lloyd Nolan. Nolan was a great actor, but this character really irritated me. The last scene of the film has remained with me for all these years. This film is definitely worth a visit.
