For someone who remembers Jane in the Daily Mirror comic, seeing this movie is an exercise in nostalgia. In that context it is wonderful, but the younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy floppy and would not notice that the actors are cartoon characters. Even the plot is a little lackluster for today's audience, but it reflects very well the ingenuity of the 40s and 50s. Jane, you must remember, was part of the fantasy of escaping the war years, created to increase the morale of the troops. He gave the strip strip double meaning. <br /> <br /> History has something in common with the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. The theme would have been familiar to readers of that era, a group of runaway Nazis foiled by some equally clumsy Englishmen, and set in the African jungle, of course. <br /> <br /> For Jane fans, a must see. For the rest of you, a damp squib. <br /> <br />
