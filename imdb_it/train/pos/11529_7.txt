As a biographical film, "The Lady With Red Hair" (the story of how the director / producer / playwright David Belasco transformed the infamous divorce from Leslie Carter into an international star) is certainly not in a league with the other film Warner's biographical similar vintage, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (what is it?), but "Lady" is a fun movie in its own right - And shares some traits in common with Cagney's classic. <br /> <br /> Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The lady with red hair" matches the taste of old-fashioned show-business. (Among other things, both films feature delightful playroom theater sequences and the inevitable backstage scenes and theatrical directors' offices.) Also, in "Lady" as in Cohan's biopic, the supporting cast is composed of family members and beloved protagonists of the period, they all do the kind of high-level work we remember them for. <br /> <br /> Do I have to add that, still as "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The Lady With Red Hair" does not let the truth interfere in telling a good story? But, even as "Dandy", "Lady" succeeds - gloriously! - to convey the essence of his personality as a great protagonist of the giant show-business hero. Everyone knows that Cagney has limited Cohan forever in his brilliant and affectionate portrait in "Yankee Doodle Dandy" - but few viewers realize that Claude Rains did a similar service for David Belasco in "The Lady With Red Hair" - and the he did with a wit that is almost equivalent to Cagney's. <br /> <br /> Rains-as-Belasco perfectly captures that legendary showman's galvanic personality in all its oversized glory. Rains offers an incredibly pleasant, superbly observed and extraordinarily realistic performance, like the Broadway man once called "The Wizard". Watching Claude Rains in action (looking at every scene as if he was having a great time!) In "The Lady With Red Hair" is seeing David Belasco leap to life on the film as if he could not wait to shake things on the main stem again one time. <br /> <br />
