I love this movie. It's extravagant, funny, violent, surreal, played by madmen, and certainly not the usual comedy. <br /> <br /> If you don't find the movie funny, I suppose it's not just for your taste, so this is hard to write for a review. <br /> <br /> For reference, some other comedies I love are The Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride and Zoolander (which only took me the second time). There are others, but my taste is certainly for the unusual, and I am willing to accept that most people do not tend to like this kind of thing. I do not apologize for having an unusual sense of humor - at least I have one. <br /> <br /> The scenes and characters of this particular film are well put together, the verbal humor is exhilarating, the situations are intriguing, the acting is very good (as one would expect from the cast), even if the Recitative requests made by the cast from the script are not particularly high. The global package makes entertainment fun, entertaining, watchable but violent.
