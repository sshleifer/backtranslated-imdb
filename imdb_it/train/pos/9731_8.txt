Sidney Young (Pegg) moves from England to New York to work for the popular Sharpe's magazine in hopes of living his dream lifestyle but struggling to make a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Based on Toby Young's book on survival in American Affairs, this comic drama has received conflicting opinions. Labeled as incoherently amusing but with the charm of the actors, like losing friends it seemed like running to the pond to fish from the pond to make fun of another cultural comedy, but it's not. <br /> <br /> This 2008 the image works because of its actors and the simple but acute story. We start in the past, then in the present and we are working forward to see how Young has left his mark in one of the best American magazines. <br /> <br /> Pegg (Hot Fuzz) is too nice for words. Whether it's hitting the zombies with a cricket bat or showing his partner the nature of the law, the British actor brings a charm and a carefree feeling to every scene. Here, when the script is good but far from its own standards, it brings a great deal of energy to the image and only he deserves to be looked at. His antics with "Babe 3" are unforgivable, simply breathtaking things like his exuberant dance, but show her off beautifully. <br /> <br /> Ponti and Anderson are right to portray the stereotypical magazine garments in which Dunst gracefully fits for the confused love interest. Megan Fox, who stole Transformers, reminds everyone that she can act here with a funny hyperbole of a stereotyped movie star. The fact that her character Sophie Myles is acting in a photo of Mother Teresa is as ridiculous as the antics of her character in the pool. To emphasize the point there is a dog, and Pegg completes this in a true Brit-style comedy, with a small twist. <br /> <br /> Although it is a British film, there is an adaptation of the American lifestyle for Young as he tries to adapt and we can see the different approaches to tell stories. Young people want real dirt to be in contrast with American professionalism. The inclusion of modern tabloid stars will soon make this film dated, but the concept of exploitation of movie stars gives this advantage. <br /> <br /> The first image of Weide is not perfect. There are drops in concentration while the plot becomes too soap-in with a strange obvious turn and there are too many characters to be needed. Even physical comedy can be exaggerated. As a side note, the bloopers on the DVD are among the best you can ever see, which are almost half an hour long. <br /> <br /> This dramatic comedy again features Simon Pegg in brilliant form and with the collective approach to storytelling and acute comedy, it is worth looking at.
