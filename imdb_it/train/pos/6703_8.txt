Recently my children started watching replicas of this show - both the first episodes of N and later ones of ABC Family - and they love it. (I was not aware that the show lasted until the first or second season) I am curious to know what pushed all the changes in the cast - I saw them described as "highly publicized", yet half an hour of research efforts on the web they have revealed nothing but endless comments on how the first episodes were much better than the subsequent episodes. (Personally, I don't see many differences - the scripts and themes remain largely the same - but they lose some great people along the way) My daughter put the DVDs on her wish list, so maybe the land of special features and comments will shed light on all this. I also hope they have done some self-referential humor on the changes - like on "Boy Meets World" where they leave their little sister for a whole season or so, and when a different actor shows to play it, they ask her where she has been and says "upstairs", or when the first geek of the "Minkus" series shows up for his high school diploma, they ask him where he was and he says "down there", indicating the part of the class that was never shown near the camera, before saying "Hey, Mr. Turner, wait!" and run away from the screen (Mr. Turner is another character who left) Oh well - maybe there will be a real Hollywood story about this or something? I was just happy to see Aunt Hilda show up for the finale - it's always been one of my favorites - it's too bad that it couldn't have been a more engaging cast meeting. (Zelda's candle didn't cut it for me)
