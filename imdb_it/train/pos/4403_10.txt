Ride with the Devil, like Ang Lee's later Brokeback Mountain, is a film of aesthetic and historical importance. Film lovers should see it at least twice as its artistic nuance is worthy of being understood. <br /> <br /> A perfect piece of art, surprising depth of humanity. I don't really remember another war movie, it will capture you, it will change your current conception of history and politics, it will restore your faith in humanity. After seeing so many killings, so much suffering, you don't feel numb, instead you treasure the bond between human beings more. The performances of the actors infest your heart, the music guides your mind. Some shots, are not just some images, they transcend themselves, becoming the see the soul. This is the true meaning of the film to be an art genre. <br /> <br /> A film like this doesn't need long comments or reviews, everything it says alone. Ovation to the cast which includes Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, the director of photography and the composer of beautiful and lyrical music, what a result!
