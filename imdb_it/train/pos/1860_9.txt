I went to see Antone Fisher not knowing what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. Derek Luke's acting work was exceptional and the plot was excellent. Obviously Denzel Washington did his usual good job both acting and directing. It makes you understand that people with mental problems can be helped and this film is a perfect example of this. Don't miss this.
