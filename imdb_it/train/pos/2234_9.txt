While the "special effects" and technical attributes of this film may indeed be ridiculous for some, I have never been able to delete the images that this film affects on my young and impressionable mind when I first saw it at about 8 years old. The story of the survival of this girl and the trials she endured remained with me all these years, and I thought back to more than one occasion about how the girl managed to get out of situations that went far beyond what I saw. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is a true story, and the fact that I was only a child when I first saw it could be the reason behind my high evaluation of this film. Every time this film was aired on television in the 70s and 80s I would be nailed to television, drinking in every scene with an interest that I can't explain. I suppose looking at this for the first time as an adult (and with a tired view of the world) might not be so pleasant for some. I actually did everything to get a copy so I could show this film to my son. <br /> <br /> This, like many other films, is not for everyone. If you are struck by extraordinary stories of human survival, they are partial to Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or the Amazon, so I think you will like this film as much as I have enjoyed over the last 30 years.
