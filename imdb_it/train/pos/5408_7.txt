Out of these Pokemon movies (which are in order of the best or not for me): Pokemon The first movie, Pokemon 4Ever, Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon 200 and Pokemon: Entei and the Unknown, this is probably the most related to the environment, probably the most beautiful and the most calming. Whether these are good points for you or not, "Pokemon 4Ever" has still entertained many. <br /> <br /> In addition to the three points discussed above, this pokemon movie includes good humor and good CGI (as well as anime). The theme of the film's journey through time is represented in a good way and Team Rocket (solo / junk comics) ends up with pretty good gags and end up being more main characters than helpers. <br /> <br /> Defects are, as always, quite unnecessary violence and action and the villain is rather uninteresting, even more so than some villain of Pokemon movies. <br /> <br /> A strange pokemon is tracked down by a pokemon hunter in a forest. A little boy tries to save the pokemon and takes it somewhere ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Ash, Brock and Misty are entering a large forest ... <br /> <br /> Curious ? See the rest ... <br /> <br /> Good for all Pokemon fans and "American" anime movie fans, have fun with "Pokemon 4Ever"! :-)
