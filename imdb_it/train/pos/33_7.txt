This interesting Yellow promotes a typical but thrilling storyline and a really sadistic killer who obviously loves to hunt his victims before killing them in a bloody way. <br /> <br /> Directed by Emilio P. Miraglia who, a year earlier, also did the interesting "The night that Evelyn Usci della Tomba" (see also my comment on that), the film begins a little 'slow, but all in all, no time is wasted with sub-plots or unnecessary sequences. /> <br /> This film is a German-Italian co-production, but was released in Germany only in videos in a 15-minute cropped version of the plot under the stupid "Horror House" title. At least the murder scenes, which will satisfy all the gorehounds, are completely intact, and the viewer still has the murderer's motive at the end. But the Italian version that contains the whole movie is still the one to look for, of course. <br /> <br /> A convincing Yellow with mandatory twists and red herring, "The Red Lady Kills Seven Times" is highly recommended on Yellow fans and slightly higher than the aforementioned Miraglia thriller.
