I think if you were to ask many JWs if they expect a miracle cure because of their faith, you will find that they do not. I know I don't know. What you will find instead is that they believe in the promises that Christ made of a resurrection. So even if the worst were to happen and we die while holding onto our integrity, Jehovah can, and will correct this. <br /> <br /> It really comes to a simple question: Is God real to you or is it all just make people believe? If he is real, and you trust him, you will follow his directions regardless of the short-term result. <br /> <br /> I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. One in my family was horrified when he saw the words "NO BLOOD" written in large letters on my chart. I reasoned with her that if I were in a position that only a blood transfusion would have saved my life, would it be a good time to make the only one who could bring me back to life when the time came? He didn't understand - God is not real enough for her. Sin. I wish I could have the comfort of a strong faith.
