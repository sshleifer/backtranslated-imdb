This is what I'm talking about. Finally, a low-budget horror release that exploits its limitations to its advantage. Wendigo, although occasionally imperfect, is a triumph of imagination. Of course, he leans heavily on EVIL DEAD style camera movements for his mood, but it's still a damn 99% better view than the video slag. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple: a family takes a vacation in a remote cabin and they are threatened by a particularly distraught hunter. But director Larry Fessenden really knows how to create suspense and add layers of disturbing creepiness through the use of the legendary Wendigo. It's true? Is it all in the boy's imagination? Is it an externalization of the child's emotional state? <br /> <br /> Some have criticized the fact that the film is unsatisfactory because it is left to you to decide. Don't be put off by insignificant nonsense. A film that makes you think is not to be avoided. It is one to rejoice.
