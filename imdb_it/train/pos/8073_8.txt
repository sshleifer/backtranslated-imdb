A brilliant portrait of a traitor (Victor McLaglen in the Oscar performance) who is haunted by his own conscience. McLaglen plays a IRA rouge who betrays his leader to get a reward during Sinn Fein Rebellion in Ireland. The scenes that show fighting and mob actions are very realistic, focusing on desperation within individuals. The lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford superbly creates a murky and tense atmosphere, enhanced by the misty and filthy representation of the Irish landscape. Max Steiner's dramatic soundtrack adds to the cinematic pleasure. Oscar winner also for best screenplay, nominated for best film. This is one of the Hollywood classics.
