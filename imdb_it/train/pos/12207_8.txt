After all, don't you go to an Orson Welles movie to see a simple and simple plot and a browning of the image of a happy star ?? <br /> <br /> go see theatrically intensified characters stuck in conflict against colorful and unusual settings, enlightened and marked with imagination, photographed with courage, and all strewn with unexpected details of surprise that a wiser and more boring director would he have avoided or not thought in the first place ?? <br /> <br /> As usual, in addition to directing, Welles wrote the script and also played the hero ?? a young Irish sailor who had knocked on the world and seen his evil, but still retained his lucid confidence in the goodness of others? Unfortunately for him, did he put this trust in Rita Hayworth, whose handsome and beautiful appearance hid a dark past and killer inclinations for the future ?? Was she married without love, with a helpless and paralyzed lawyer, behaved like an evil lizard by the brilliant Everett Sloane ?? <br /> <br /> There is a youthful romanticism that underlies everything, and this quality came into exuberance in "The Lady from Shanghai". Before the inevitable happened, did Welles run away ?? to a final triangular clash in a hall of mirrors, which has become one of the classic scenes of post-war cinema? <br /> <br /> Welles has not missed the opportunity for the whole film to contrast the words and actions with visual details that have enriched the plot and increased the atmosphere ?? Did his camera almost seem to caress Rita Hayworth as the sun played with her hair and long limbs while playfully teasing the young sailor in his canvas?
