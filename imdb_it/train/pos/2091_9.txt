What Irving Thalberg did in making this film today would never be attempted again. Make a Chinese story with Western players even if they are the likes of Paul Muni, Luise Rainer, Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly among others. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's also because the story was written by a westerner, Pearl Buck who got a Pulitzer prize for his novel in 1932. Ms. Buck, daughter of Chinese missionaries, probably approached China to the conscience of America of any other person. Not the political struggles of China, but the lives and labors of every day that we find in The Good Earth. Unfortunately later, Pearl Buck became an apologist for Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang China in all its virtues and excesses. The rest of his literary production never equaled The Good Earth. <br /> <br /> In The Sundowners there is a nice description of Peter Ustinov's confrontation between China and Australia. When he asked for the difference, Ustinov said that China was very large and very full and Australia was very large and very empty. This is what you see in The Good Earth, very large and very full of people, more than you can sometimes handle. <br /> <br /> The Good Earth tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni) as a young man who buys a wife from a large house where she was a slave. The O-Lan woman (Luise Rainer) brings him two children and sees him go through all the good times and the evil they have, the drought, the famine, the revolution and a plague of climatic locusts. <br /> <br /> Luise Rainer won the second of two consecutive Oscars to portray O-Lan. He may have established some kind of record as it must be the Oscar performance of the best players with the least number of dialogues. Everything he does is practically done with facial expressions, his performance could be on a silent film with very minimal subtitles. I think only John Mills in Ryan's Daughter had fewer words and played a mentally retarded man. <br /> <br /> Muni is not always grateful for how supportive he is in that culture dominated by men. Rainer helps on the field, bears and raises children, does housework. When Muni becomes a man of property he takes a second Chinese trophy wife who causes him a lot of pain. Still Rainer stoically endures everything. Still Muni is not a bad man and it is a tribute to the film and to his acting and to the writing of Buck that you don't hate him and the cultural gap is filled. <br /> <br /> Now we have a group of oriental musicians who make more than just a Kung Fu movie. I am surprised that The Good Earth of all the films has not been redone at this point. I bet the Chinese government could also let some American companies do it in a real place. <br /> <br /> Until then we have this great classic to appreciate and entertain.
