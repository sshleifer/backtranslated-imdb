I would have given this otherwise exceptional series to 10 votes if Claudia Black had not continued us! His inclusion as silly "Vela" brought the series to my mind. Taking her regularly as usual, including Ben Browder to replace RDA, was a mistake. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately we were simply recovering from the loss of "Jack" and we didn't really need this great series turned into new episodes of 'Farscape'. <br /> <br /> I was a big fan of the "Stargate" movie and when the series was first announced I had reservations about whether it could match the movie, but after watching the first episode I have to admit that I am been hooked. I've always been waiting for new episodes with great anticipation
