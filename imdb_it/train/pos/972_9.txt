Wow! So much fun! Probably a little too much for normal American kids, and it's really a stretch to call it a children's movie, this movie reminded me of quite a bit of Time Bandits - a lot of Terry Gilliam to the end. While the general narrative is practically direct, Miike still throws MANY surreal moments and Bunuel. The entire first act violently juxtaposes the normal family life of the main child / hero from one scene to another, with the spirit world and the evil of what follows. And while the ending has a somewhat ambiguous aspect that is common in Miike's work, the layers of meaning and metaphor, especially the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly, are pretty damn moving. Like a maniac and fancifully funny like other great Miike films, only in place of torture and gore, he gives us an endless quantity of monsters and yokai drawn from Japanese folklore creatively conceived through CG and puppets wrapped in a multi-faceted and imaginative adventure. F'n rad, and one of Miike's best!
