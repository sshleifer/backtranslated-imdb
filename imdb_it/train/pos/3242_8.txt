I saw this movie with my father. I had to be quite young, around 3pm. It was a movie on Star Movies one afternoon. The film began a little vaguely, but it could be said that those thieves were gathering for a score. It really got a rhythm after the first half hour. <br /> <br /> All the actors are fantastic, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I think it's the ensemble, they sound so good together. I can watch this movie at any time. I think it's the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very strange score. The jokes are not trivial but they are thin and extreme at the same time that make them so funny. <br /> <br /> A perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.
