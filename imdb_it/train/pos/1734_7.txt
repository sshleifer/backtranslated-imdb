I just saw this movie for the first time and enjoyed it. His dance was a lot of fun. I read somewhere that he got the part in this movie because he could dance. The scenery was also fantastic. Yvonne is such a talented and beautiful woman. We laughed at the stupid kissing scenes, but that's the beauty of the old movies! I grew up with her on The Munsters and I enjoy watching her in her previous films. They may not be all the best out there, but it's still worth watching to see them play and sing. I'm slowly buying all his films and watching them as I receive them. I have a large collection of his memorabilia.
