Damon Runyon's world of Times Square, New York, before his Disneyfication, is the basis for this musical. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, a man who knew the movies, directed this nostalgic tribute to the "crossroads of the world" that shows us that lower New York of the past. Frank Loesser's music sounds great. We watch a magnificent cast of characters typical of the area. People on the margins of society tended to gravitate towards that area because of the lights, the action, the possibilities in that part of the city. This weak point of the city has materialized in street life that was so intense. <br /> <br /> Some of the songs from the original production were not included in the film. We don't know if that makes sense, but it's not unusual for a Hollywood musical to change and change what worked on stage. That original cast included the wonderful Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye, and we wonder about the decision not to let Robert Alda, Sam Levene, Isabel Bigley repeat their original roles. These were distinct actors who could have made an extraordinary contribution. <br /> <br /> The film, visually, is surprising. The look closely follows the fashions of the times. As for the casting of Marlon Brando, otherwise not known for his singing skills, Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons, seem to work in the film. Sky Masterson is, after all, a man's man, who would look a little sissy if he presented a different "look". Frank Sinatra is as good as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons, like Sarah Brown, does a good job playing the woman of the Salvation Army who suddenly finds satisfaction with the same type of man she is trying to save. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is a delight. He never ceases to amaze as Miss Adelaide, a woman with a heart of gold who is Nathan Detroit's love interest. Mrs. Blaine makes a fantastic impression as the show girl who is wiser than she lets out. Stubby Kaye does a wonderful job taking up his Nicely Nicely Johnson. <br /> <br /> The wonderful production owes a lot to the talented Abe Burrows, who made the adaptation to the screen. Irene Sharaff's costumes set the tone.
