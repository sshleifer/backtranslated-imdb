Sandler is fantastic again ... I've already become a Sandler fan. This film is Sandler's saddest story. His expression is fantastic. I cried more looking at Click but there are some similar points. Considering the value of the family before losing it and being able to say "I love you" are some of the most impressive truths in life ... It's tough, it's real ... and actually there is a reality that owns this success, Binder. I don't think another director could give these emotions this way. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also incredible ... Cheadle is one of my Crash favorites. Don't expect to laugh or a very positive atmosphere ... If you're ready to face the reality of life, don't miss this movie.
