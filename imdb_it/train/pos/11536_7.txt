It's hard to watch this movie without thinking ahead of the TV show that it would become, especially if, like me, you liked the TV show more. But there's a lot to be said for the source. <br /> <br /> Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) is one of the best journalists in New York who lives in an eight-room apartment alone, the victim of a divorce and his stubborn mentality. Join his friend Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon), who needs a place to live after his wife throws him out for his stubborn neatnik mentality. The result is a train accident and one of the most beloved film adaptations of a theatrical performance by Neil Simon. <br /> <br /> The first thing is the first: I love that apartment! Poker table, novelty dartboard, baggy photos of baseball players, empty spirits and beer containers, even a couple of Roman columns. It is a place where men can be boys. Simon and director Gene Saks do a great job opening the single set of the stage, Oscar's living room, shifting the action in the bedrooms and kitchen and giving the growing tension between Oscar and Felix more corners to bounce off. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of Neal Hefti has been heard on the TV show, but it has never been as orchestrated as it is here, in different arrangements that make the on-screen action rise every time it is played. The real work of locations and the night shots of Manhattan give the film a common energy to the films shot in that place and at that time ("Buddwing", "The world of Henry Orient", "Midnight Cowboy", "Candidate for manchuria "," Rosemary's Baby "etc.) <br /> <br /> Are Lemmon and Matthau too heavy for Tony Randall and Jack Klugman? To be honest, the film is meant to be a more serious affair, addressing the uncommon condition of middle-aged divorce and the frustration inherent in not being able to make a relationship work. Simon has more in mind than joining Felix and Oscar in a "Password" game or a battle of wits with Howard Cosell. But I don't know ... <br /> <br /> Both Lemmon and Matthau were fantastic comedians. I like to look especially in the middle of this film as I often do in their separate films, but I never understood why they were considered as great comic team. Here, in their most appreciated partnership, they seem to play in two different films; Lemmon in a dramatic comedy and Matthau in a farce. Matthau is great at the beginning, he fascinates us with his teddy bear behavior around the poker table, but towards the end of the film he has a turn very similar to that of Jack Torrance in "The Shining", reacting to Felix who cleans his apartment and serves tasty food for his friends in a way that totally disrupts the delicate balance of guilt. <br /> <br /> While the ending bothers me, the part that many see as the most irritating, the beginning, works well as I see it. Watching Felix stumble in an attempt to kill himself is not a great comedy, no, but it is a good way to get into a great play, to put some pain into real life before bringing warmth and laughter. (Plus it has some great shots of the most mushy parts of the city.) In the middle of the film, this scene would have been a miscalculation, but it works as a way to establish Felix's torment and a sense of clear relief to come when we see Oscar and his poker friends fighting and feuding. <br /> <br /> That's where Simon's jokes are so great. They are the underlying strength of the film. He gets the jokes exactly in the right and real way, and still makes it fun. "I don't mind you talking, Felix, you have things to say, what scares me is that I'm starting to listen." The TV show showed how wrong it is to assume that the film is always better, in fact the TV show has made a good point of "taking" anything, but the film creates a solid base and is a joy in its own right.
