In the first episode of Friends, broadcast on September 22nd 1994 "The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate" there is a song that plays while Rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show, the line that reads is "If you ever need keep ".... does anyone know the artist who sings or the title of the song? It looks like it's a great song ... I'd like to have a copy. Thanks for your assistance. I'm looking for the album / cd so I can buy it. <br /> <br /> I have the shows that are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again. It seemed to be credible ... thanks for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years.
