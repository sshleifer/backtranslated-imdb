Clair Denis again revisits his theme of extraneous fathers, men who follow their happiness in a determined way, regardless of the emotional toll on their family, but while Nénette and Boni of the previous film live in a narrow world of Marseille, our examination of Louis Trebor in The Intruder takes us from a remote location along the Franco-Swiss border to the middle of the world, in Korea and Tahiti. Again the film starts in mid-rocket, with Louis, in his sixties, facing a heart in difficulty as he tries to maintain a high level of physical fitness. We learn that Louis is no stranger to violence because his cabin is the place where smuggling and gunfire occur regularly. Louis sleeps with a large knife under his pillow with nearby rifles. Denis is in no hurry to carry out the action, and we must patiently build our understanding of Louis from his daily activities and from the few people he has to deal with along the border including a son, Sidney (Grégoire Colin, almost unrecognizable with long hair and a tuft of mustaches) that rejects him as a "madman": shown as a dedicated two-man father. There are many short scenes that, although seemingly unrelated, give an impression of Louis and his environment. The work with Godard's camera is exhilarating here. The dominant metaphor is Louis's heart transplant for which he goes to Korea and then to Tahiti to look for another son, not found, and where Louis's new heart rejects him just as Sidney rejected the old. We are used to short scenes from Denis's movie that are inexplicable: Nénette straddling Boni who nourishes with a spoon; a flicker fired by Boni's father and then the shortest of Boni's images with a gunshot wound to his head; a scene of Louis in a morgue with a corpse with a transplant scar but Sidney's body. The implication of the last two is a rejection, real or imaginary, from a father who kills something indefinable in a child.
