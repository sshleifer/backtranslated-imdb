An American in Paris is a showcase of Gene Kelly. See how Gene sings, recites and dances through Paris in any number of situations. Some purely majestic, others pure corn. One can imagine how Kelly was doing while making this film just a year before "Singin 'In The Rain". He is certainly one of the greatest of all time. It is interesting to observe the parallels between the two films, especially in Kelly's characters, the only main difference being that one is based in Paris, the other in LA <br /> <br /> Some have said that Leslie's acting Caron was less than pure. Perhaps Cyd Charisse, originally intended for the role could have done better, yet Caron is quite credible in the role and has a chemistry with Kelly. Oscar Levant's brief role in this film gave him just what he needed, someone who doesn't look like Gene Kelly. Filling every man's role is not an easy task, yet Levant did it with the whole class of any other protagonist. <br /> <br /> The choreography of singing and dancing are all perfection. Even the extended ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film than the one without. Seeing that there really wasn't much time to make such a loving relationship credible, Minnelli used this sequence to make it look like I'd spent four hours with them. Ingenious! <br /> <br /> I should classify this movie with Singin as it is very similar in story and song. Singin 'could barely make a nod thanks to Debbie Reynolds' exhilarating performance. <br /> <br /> Full recommendation. <br /> <br /> 8/10 stars.
