"Journey of Hope" tells of a poor Turkish family and their odyssey of hope that plunges into desperation towards Switzerland in search of prosperity. Although this Oscar-winning film is pretty well done, it lacks substance and has many non-plausibility. Much of the film's 1.7 hour run time is on the bus, getting off the bus, getting on the boat, getting off the boat, getting into the van, getting off the van, etc.; time that could have been better spent or omitted completely. The story has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who are aware of the common crime of trafficking in illegal immigrants. A useful and reasonably fun but overrated watch.
