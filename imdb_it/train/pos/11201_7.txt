Surprisingly a good initial effort by Alfred Hitchcock. One of the few original screenplays written by Hitchcock himself, this film shows a remarkable narrative structure. Start with an exciting boxing match in which the "One Round" carnival champion Jack loses for a challenger from the audience that appears to be a professional boxer. The film then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between Jack, his girlfriend and the professional boxer. The rest of the film is a dramatic build-up for the revenge between the two men, this time for the heavyweight crown. Even in this first film, Hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and elf placement. An armband purchased for the girl from the boxer continues to appear throughout the film as a symbol of her infidelity. The only major detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927. The end result, therefore, ends up being somewhat anti-dilatory. But history is what transports this film.
