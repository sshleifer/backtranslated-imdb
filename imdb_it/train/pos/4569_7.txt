DANIEL DAY-LEWIS does a remarkable job interpreting Christy Brown, the artist who grew up with cerebral palsy, but managed to have a productive life, to successfully face her handicap and become a respected artist and writer. <br /> <br /> The film, however, is very difficult to review - or even to watch. Fortunately, I had the function of captioning to capture every word spoken that would have been impossible if I saw the film in a theater. While respecting it as a courageous work that addresses difficult issues, I cannot say that it is the kind of film I would like to see more than once. <br /> <br /> However, my attention was held by the narrative device, a flashback framed by the present, in which we see Christy being honored for his results before seeing the flashback of his youth and his difficulties in communicating with those around him, who certainly gave him loving care. <DANIEL DAY-LEWIS certainly is noteworthy as the tormented man who falls in love with a therapist (FIONA SHAW), much for his mother's fear that when love is not returned his heart will be broken. There is a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love with her before the others and then goes into a frenzied rage after drinking too much. <br /> <br /> BRENDA FRICKER does a brilliant job as the mother who takes care of him, his father and a brood of brothers as he struggles to keep a roof over their heads until Day-Lewis begins to have success with his work. He composes the performance of Day-Lewis as a loving mother and shares many moving moments with him. <br /> <br /> Richly detailed story of a family that stayed together in the most unusual circumstances with attention to the details of the period in each frame of the film. Both Fricker and Day-Lewis won the Oscars, but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also excellent. O'Conor is Christy as a boy and McAnally is the father who spends too much time at the local pub, but loves the boy. <br /> <br /> In summary: Elmer Bernstein's music is another factor. It's worth it, but it's definitely not a movie for everyone.
