This film is the best movie to watch to hear comics. The sets, costumes and color are so vivid that it's like entering a comic. This is the film I think when the Mob is mentioned, the seeds, the hats and the attitudes. <br /> <br /> Hoffman gives comic relief as Mumbles and you can't help but feel sorry for Madonna as she tries and fails, to win Tracy. This film contains all the classic clich√©s of the crowd: burying people in the concrete, blowing up people's cars, tying up the good guy and trying to blow up his girlfriends' house. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic in absolute sense of the word, even the angels of the cameras shout the comics. It's so nice to be able to go back to an older movie and see that someone knew how a comic would be made in a movie after seeing mistakes like Spawn and Hulk. <br /> <br /> !!! YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM !!!!
