Sometimes it's hard to tell why exactly one movie is so effective. From the first moment I came across "The Stone Boy", something told me it would be a great movie. Nevertheless, it seemed very unlikely to me that I ever had the opportunity to see it alone. Then one day, looking through the online catalog of my local library, I saw that they had recently bought the DVD release of this film. For which I am extremely happy, because cinematography is of an extraordinary depth and quality that an old VHS copy was never able to replicate. <br /> <br /> And speaking of cinematography, I must identify it to the fullest the most surprising aspect of this film. As a photographer who almost pursues the exact visual style portrayed in "The Stone Boy", I firmly believe that a great filmmaker can almost bring a movie with him. Here, he has a great help from an extremely talented cast and a director who perfectly understands what history needs. But having Juan Ruiz Anch√≠a behind the camera virtually makes every scene something beautiful. And you can hardly ever say it. Most movies would never expect such a thing. Scenes after scene capture some details, a bit of visual magic that takes your breath away. <br /> <br /> The director, Christopher Cain, has had a long and interesting career. As far as I can gather, this film is not very representative of this. But sometimes, to capture a director near the start of his career, before all the big budgets and loss of concentration, there is a real subtle magic to be found. Cain takes a step back in this film, lets things happen with a life of their own and then later on. Just like in the early John Sayles films, the characters are given space to breathe, time to talk. Secondary stories happen because they do it, and that's what life is like. Cain shows a painful understanding of human nature in this film. The couple recites a lot of this story together. <br /> <br /> When people talk, when they exist in this film, they do it as real people, not held back by the fact that they're playing characters. The screenplay by Gina Berriault allows immensely talented and respected actors such as Wilford Brimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Frederic Forrest to simply pass the time existing. If the things they have to say are minor or of profound significance, it all comes down to the weight of pure reality. <br /> <br /> When you look at the actors involved, or the great James Horner soundtrack, it seems strange that such a film is almost forgotten. Perhaps much of what makes "The Stone Boy" what it was the period of time in which it was made. There is this hangover feeling of the 70s in this image that deeply reminds me of my childhood. People talk about the 80s in terms of modern styles and music, but it's not the 80s where I lived or remember. The appearance of the images, the discreet and obscure quality of the acting, and the overall result should end up under the skin of any person who grew up in or near this time in North America. I see myself in this. I see how I saw the world. And a film like "The Stone Boy" sees the world as it really is. <br /> <br /> For more of this feeling, please see: <br /> <br /> The Black Stallion (1979), Never Cry Wolf (1983), Tender Mercies (1983), Testament (1983) , Places in the Heart (1984), Matewan (1987), High Tide (1987), Driving Miss Daisy (1989), The Secret Garden (1993), The Secret of Roan Inish (1994), Wendy and Lucy (2008)
