I just saw this movie again after thirty-seven years. I was eleven years old and took this movie to South Beach in the long Cinema Theater on Washington Avenue. In 1969, I thought of Where it's At! it was a great movie. Now, however, after almost forty years, it is not as beautiful as before. Times have changed, and this film is now an old rethink of the war between the generations. However, it has captured a place in time that is just a memory. It's really interesting to see fashions mod, old Vegas, a thin Don Rickles, chain smoke and a hip opening song. The acting was decent, the script a bit old-fashioned, but the memories were still fresh. Where it is, it may not be the right place for you, but for me it was still a pleasant and fun journey into memory.
