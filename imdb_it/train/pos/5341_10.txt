CAROL'S JOURNEY is a pleasure to look at for many reasons. The acting of Clara Lago is simply incredible for someone so young, and is one of those special actors who can say a lot with facial expressions. The director Imanol Urbibe presents a tight and controlled film without any interruption in the continuity, thus pushing the plot at a steady pace with just enough suspense to keep wondering what the nest scene will bring. The screenplay by Angel Garcia Roldan is the narrative at its best, which, apparently, if the main purpose for the films, after all. The plot is unpredictable, yet events as they unravel are completely logical. Perhaps the best feature of this film is to tell a story of the Spanish civil war that struck people. It was an important event of the 20th century, but almost no American knows it. In fact, in 40 years of university teaching, I did an average of one student per semester who had heard of it, let alone anyone who could say something exhaustive about it - and the overwhelming number of students were scholars of merit, each of which he speaks to the enormous amount of censorship in American education. So, in a sense, this film is a good way to start a study of that event, bearing in mind that when you drag a thread of history, a great deal of history is unraveled. The appreciation of this film is, therefore, in direct relation with the quantity of knowledge. To see this film as another film of his age is completely missed the film. The index of the left elbow considers seven aspects of the film: acting, production sets, character development, plot, dialogue, film continuity and artistic ability, on a scale of 10 for very good, 5 for the medium and 1 for need of Help. CAROL'S JOURNEY is above average on all fronts, with the exception of dialogue rated as average. The LEI average for this film is 9.3, with a score of 10 when compared to the IMDb scale. I highly recommend this film for all ages.
