How can a film be both controversial and kind? This he does with an almost perfect structure. No one wants their daughters to be athletes. Apparently most cultures do not want their daughters to have small breasts too. Here we see a group of superb actors that we have never heard of before portraying people from different cultures who live quite monotonous lives until their daughters want to, and have the potential to become professional footballers. The structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful. There is no condescension. Both cultures are considered modern and valid. (And yes, both are also stupid). The only flaw: the Hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of relatives but not a child among them.
