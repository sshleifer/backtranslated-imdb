Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is New York's oldest floating craps game manager and needs $ 1000 to secure a new position. Confident of his chances, he bets on the highest roller of the city, Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), who cannot court the mysterious missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons). 'Guys and Dolls (1955)' is a great musical because it cleverly mixes the contrasting styles of film and stage. During a dazzling opening sequence, crowds of pedestrians move in rhythm, stopping and starting as if responding to behind-the-scenes signals. Even the movements on foot are stylized and angular, halfway between a walk and a dance. Mankiewicz's New York City is a sparkling burst of art deco colors and movements, a fantasy world so far from reality that even the business of gambling and criminal crime seems perfectly brilliant. <br /> <br /> As I write this review, I have just received the news that Jean Simmons is dead, at 80 years old. This, incredibly, was the first time I saw her in a movie, yet she dazzled me from the beginning. Her Sarah, idealistic and sexually repressed, comes out of her shell following an alcohol binge in Havana, letting slip a version adorably playful of "If I Were A Bell". Although both Simmons and Brando were non-singers, producer Sam Goldwyn decided not to dub his own voice, claiming that "maybe you don't sound so good, but at least it's you". Despite Goldwyn's ease, both couples are right to carry entire musical numbers. Simmons suggests the same childish vivacity that Audrey Hepburn could have brought to the role, and Brando exudes so much confidence and charisma that it doesn't matter that her sung voice isn't right there.
