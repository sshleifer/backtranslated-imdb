When Braveheart came out for the first time, I was fascinated and was openly one of the most rabid fans in the film. When Rob Roy came out, I was intrigued and even though I liked the movie, I didn't think it was a great movie. However, over time, my appreciation for Rob Roy has grown and my enthusiasm for Braveheart has decreased. Braveheart is great entertainment, of course, but there are also flaws. The most significant, in my opinion, is the unflattering portrait of Robert the Bruce, who was undoubtedly the greatest king of Scotland. Another is the historical inaccuracy of the film, which tarnishes the film in proportion to the many historical distortions. I think I'm also annoyed by the fact that it was in this film, seen only (at least by me) in retrospect, that the beginnings of Mel Gibson's egomania can be clearly seen for the first time. In contrast, Rob Roy grew up with me over the years. Partly because it largely avoids the faults I feel most sorry about in Braveheart. But also because Rob Roy is like a good wine, becoming more mature and complex with every vision.
