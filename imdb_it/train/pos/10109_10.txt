Govind Nihalani's directorial adventure of Vijay Tendulkar's novel is brilliant. Om Puri plays a Velankar inspector who is forced to protect the underworld don rama shetty, brilliantly interpreted by sadahiv amrapurkar. This is the most discussed film by Govind Nihlan. This is a very good and classic movie. Smita Patil plays the female lead alongside Om Puri. Naseeruddin Shah is brilliant in a cameo role. Although Sadashiv Amrapurkar has only 4 scenes in the film, it dominates the film. This was the debut of Sadashiv Amrapurkars.Om Puri won a national award for this film as best actor. Winner of the Filmfare award for best film, history, supporting actor (Sadashiv Amrapurkar).
