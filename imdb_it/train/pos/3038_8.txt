Because Douglas MacArthur struck more lives for the better than any other unelected American president, he deserved a better film biography. Not that Universal's "MacArthur" is bad. It is not all that it should have been. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the potential was there. From the very first episode of "Star Trek" "The Corbomite Maneuver" (1966) to the recent HBO films "Something the Lord Made" (2OO4) and "Warm Springs" (2OO5), director Joseph Sargent has emerged as one of the most directors expressively human in the film, a man capable of subtly modeling the emotional nuances of the actors' performances, and of bringing the audience exactly where he wants them to go. The producer, Frank McCarthy, also gave us "Patton" (197O), the legendary Jerry Goldsmith made both films, and Universal widely publicized the fact that the film was "four years of preparation and production". And yet, for all this, "MacArthur" is perfectly adequate and not much more. <br /> <br /> The film begins in early 1942, just before the besieged general was ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy) ?? to escape from the Philippines to avoid capture by the Japanese. Thus, this film omits: <br /> <br /> · The birth of MacArthur in 188O in an Arkansas border barracks still subject to attacks by members of Native American tribes, thus establishing that his extraordinary life extended from distance from arches and arrows to thermonuclear weapons; <br /> <br /> · his graduation from West Point ?? first in a class of 95, <br /> <br /> · as he joined his famous father, General Arthur MacArthur (who had earned the medal of honor at Missionary Ridge in the civil war) on assignments in Japan, China and, above all, in the Philippines; <br /> <br /> · his heroic deeds in the 1914 excursion to Vera Cruz; <br /> <br /> · how he jumped on the trenches of the First World War as a mountain goat, often wounded, and promoted with a blinding speed to the brigadier general; <br /> <br /> · his post-war service as a younger and more progressive commander of West Point; <br /> <br /> · his participation in Billy Mitchell's court martial in 1924; <br /> <br /> · his Bonus Marchers course in 1932; <br /> <br /> · his efforts to support an army sadly under-financed as chief of staff in the early nineteenth century; <br /> <br /> · his retirement from the US Army to become Field Marshal (!) of the Philippine Army; <br /> <br /> and the reactivation of its commission by FDR just before the outbreak of the Second World War. <br /> <br /> All this is omitted in favor of prolonged shooting of MacArthur trying to fight seasickness while being evacuated from the PT boat ?? therefore, we know that "General Mac" is a legend, but not because; nor can we appreciate why the accusations of cowardice have been so fierce to "Dugout Doug" and so blatantly unfounded. <br /> <br /> The rest of his career is currently simple: his "Hit 'em hopping island where it is not" campaign, the fulfillment of his commitment to the Filipinos ?? "I will return!", Its crowning achievement, the victory of peace in post-war Japan, then the difference of opinion with President Harry Truman (a real madman Ed Fiandre) on the conduct of the Korean conflict which resulted in his total dismissal and finally his proclamation to Congress that "old soldiers simply vanish", after which he did just that. All fairly historically accurate, and all presented with a deliberate lack of comment. <br /> <br /> Sargent and the producers move away almost painfully from updating the historical record with their own approval or disapproval: If MacArthur's actions seem noble, they are presented as such; if they appear self-centered or explosive, let these concepts be recorded without comment. Since Joe Sargent is quite adept at subtly manipulating the reactions of his audience once again, see Warm Springs, this refusal to offer a comment appears rather deliberate. Historically, this can be commendable, but it almost defeats the spectator's efforts to place this extraordinary man in every kind of rational perspective. <br /> <br /> And finally, there is a sort of "cheap fact" to feel at the film, just as there is "Midway", published around the same time. Both films have been relegated to "television" directors - Sargent in this case, Jack Smight in "Midway" and both look for TV. Even the perfectly functional march by Jerry Goldsmith lacks the subtle undertones and the magnitude of his "Patton" theme - just another way in which a man larger than life is memorized by a very common film. <br /> <br /> There was vanity and pettiness in this man, unquestionably; there was also greatness and love or hate it, we must recognize the fact that MacArthur did what no military commander had done before: he won the peace. <br /> <br /> In the end, "MacArthur" ?? like so many cinematographic biographies? it is a good place to start researching this extraordinary man, but a poor place to end it.
