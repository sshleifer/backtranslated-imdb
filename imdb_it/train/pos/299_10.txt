Peter Bogdonavich has made a handful of really great films, and THEY ALL RIDEI is one of his best. The cast couldn't be better equipped to play this light but slightly bittersweet comedy. Interestingly enough, the witty and light touch that Bogdonavich uses so effortlessly gives the film a rather disarming emotional core. Fresh and immediate, the film begins with absolutely no explanation. There is no music for the soundtrack for us. We meet the characters in action and, while Bogdonavich slips through the streets of New York, the film takes place effortlessly. Robby Muller's camera captures everything with a sober simplicity that seems accidental, but it certainly isn't. The cast is exceptional. Anyway, a classic.
