Not really a big box office project, but I was pleasantly surprised <br /> with this movie. James "I did some things to Farrah Fawcett" Orr <br /> <br /> co-wrote and directed this film about a normal ordinary guy named Larry Burrows who thinks his life would be <br /> < br /> incredibly different if you hit a homerun in a key baseball game <br /> <br /> when you were 15 years old. But thanks to the mysterious and magical bartender <br /> <br /> Mike, Larry gets his wish, but soon realizes that his new life <br /> <br /> isn't exactly what he hoped it would be. <br /> <br /> I must say that this film really impressed me. The critics made them <br /> <br /> mixed, and I must say that the concept is really interesting and <br /> <br /> pulled out well. Yes, it's a small standard, but it packs enough <br /> <br /> fun, dramatic moments and excellent acting to make it really <br /> good. James Belushi (I think) was a worthy Oscar for his role. Jon <br /> <br /> Lovitz is perfect, and Linda Hamilton and Renee Russo shine their roles in <br /> <br />. Michael Caine is perfect as a bartender. It is <br /> <br /> just a good movie with a good lesson. If you've never seen it, I strongly suggest you check
