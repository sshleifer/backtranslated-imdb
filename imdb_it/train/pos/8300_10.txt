Unsurprisingly, Busey subsequently developed a tumor in the sinus cavity, this film is also a difficult decision, but one I fully enjoyed. The first 5 minutes are the most carefree 5 minutes of each film; boring, bad dialect, and then, with a Spiderman position, Busey screams the worst line of all the movies ever created ... "your worst nightmare, butthorn!" I coughed a little of my eggnog laughing so hard. That line resonates so well, that it even surpasses the infamous "hi Freeze, I'm Batman" line by Clooney. Other classic moments are constantly upset by Busey for the people who remind him that he killed his former CIA partner ... who did it by accidentally shooting him in the chest (all made possible by a super slow motion flashback sequence that makes the dry paint looks exciting). There is an ashtray for the nostrils, fists in the face, and a "it wasn't my fault and you know it!" Well, the movie shows him the lack of the villain and the hitting his friend, so ... Other screaming moments must be his ex-girlfriend who drops a grenade to the ground to allow her escape - a plan that challenges all logic , physics and absurdity. And finally, when McBain jumps out of the Thunderblast during an intense guerrilla war and starts running and thwarts a small object, I'm almost wet. Some of Busey's best works by far, the rent or purchase today "butthorn!" My vote is a perfect 10 (on the meter poo that is).
