I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky movies. If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory had been given the task of producing such a film, it may have been this, apart from the lack of a high-level international cast. This is one of those movies that you watch alone in a dark evening with a pizza and some popcorn, and you don't even bother doing the dishes until morning because you just want to hide under the covers. Good for director Herbert Wise, scriptwriters Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale, Jon Bunker's best production project, Art Direction by John Ralph and an excellent cast to make me shiver and feel so isolated even if I live in one of the most populated cities in the world at the beginning of the 21st century. I gave a "9" on "10" because with the limits of production and television budget, they really brought out a great show.
