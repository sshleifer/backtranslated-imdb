I spent the last week watching John Cassavetes' films - starting with "a woman under the influence" and ending with "the opening night". I am completely and completely wiped out, particularly by these two films. from the first minute to the last in "opening night" I was completely and completely absorbed. I only lived it on some occasions, but the feeling that this film was perfect lasted about two thirds until the end of the titles. all of this film, from the way it was shot, the incredible performance of Gena Rowlands, the end credits, the opening, the music, the plot, the sense of depth, the rhythm, the tenderness, the originality , the characters, the clever little moments .... for me, it is truly sublime. I could not agree more with the previous comment about bringing it to a desert island because the depth of this film is something to see. if you are unlucky enough to have a fire at home, I guarantee that instead of making a last ditch attempt to save that supply of money under your bed, instead, you will have to save your copy of this film.
