The Tattooed Stranger was another of the rare B films that BBC2 has shown during the Christmas / New Year period 2005-2006. See also They Live By Night and The Brighton Strangler. <br /> <br /> In this, a man walking with his dog in Central Park meets an abandoned car and discovers a dead woman inside. They shot her and the police tried to identify her with just a tattoo as the main clue. After being identified, the murderer is discovered and shot at the shooting at the end. <br /> <br /> Most of this film was shot on location in and around New York, so we can see some areas of the city we usually don't see, especially secondary roads. <br /> <br /> In the cast there are almost all the unknowns, with John Miles getting the highest billing. <br /> <br /> The Tattooed Stranger is worth finding. Excellent but rather obscure. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
