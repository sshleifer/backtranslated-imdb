This film takes you to another time when there was a different rhythm in everyday life. We have an idea of ​​how families faced the war and how quickly we sent young people to fight. A very moving look to the past and a reminder that war victims do not only occur on the front. <br /> <br /> Fortunately many of us have never had to go through what our great-grandparents, grandparents or parents went through during a war. This film, I think, is a small thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks incredibly young Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe is absolutely charming and Australian as can be. It is certainly worth listening to him play "High Flight" and it makes me wonder what he could get with Shakespeare.
