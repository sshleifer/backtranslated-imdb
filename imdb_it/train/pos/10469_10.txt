I remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared in 1993. At the time I was 8 years old, and now at 22 I find it strange to have seen this cult show from start to finish and look back. The 90s are all of a sudden it seems so far away, that great decade. Anyway, I always watched MonsterVision, because I'm a big fan of monster movies and horror movies. It was like the 90's version of the Chiller Theater. If MST3K can get DVDs because not the Joe Bob show, at least MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. A lot of comments and information from Joe Bob on the films were simply hilarious. Most of the films shown on the show were Grade B or C, but also featured many A-house films such as the Hammer films from England which are first-rate and many with the majesty of Ray Harryhausen's stop motion. Many have been fun movies that you wouldn't see anywhere else like in Japanese science fiction movies, and of course, Godzilla that is familiar to almost everyone and independent films like Metal Storm and Motel Hell. With the new decade of film preservation and more independent directors, I think MonsterVision would be a good show for IFC, as they have already had success with the IFC House Show fashion show. I'm sure this show will be resumed for reasons of nostalgia one day, I guess I'll have to wait and see. Until then "this is the great television"!
