A meteor descends from the sky and awakens a plesiosaur that used to terrorize the area around Lake Crater long ago. While the monster eats the locals, try to find the way to kill the monster. <br /> <br /> Recent attempts to send old horror and science fiction films like Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass are somewhat unwillingly when you make films like Crater Lake Monster available for screening. It's the kind of movie that those movies fake and just send this is the real deal. It's all that movie that tries to be alone with the tongue in its mouth and that's a lot more fun for that. This is a real drive-in movie that had the unfortunate luck of coming just when Star Wars changed the way we look at special effects. The monster, a mix of stop motion and a life-size head, is a charming and fascinating little beast. Filmmakers ruin the audience with frequent blows of the monster and its chaos. Of course it's clear that it's all fake, but isn't it a film about the suspension of disbelief? Actually, I think he's a really cool monster who has this. <br /> <br /> I like this movie on a low budget record in a way. If you want a real authentic guide in the monster movie, look no further. This would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar lake monster films (Boggy Creek etc.)
