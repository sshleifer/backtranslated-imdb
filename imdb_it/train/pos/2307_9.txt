I must say that this film is truly incredible and moving. Reese Witherspoon is so charming and Jason London is not so bad! it's so sweet to watch Dani fall in love and break my heart while at the same time warming my heart as I watch Court fall in love with Maureen. however it is even sweeter to observe how much Dani cares. I have to admit even if in a certain sense I wanted it to fall for Dani at the end. it's so nice to watch her fall for him, I didn't want her to break her heart so hard. but the biggest tragedy I've ever seen happened in this film. watching him die made me cry for a whole day. I could not believe it. however never a more loving relationship was shown in a film then Maureen and Dani. they can really overcome anything. I'm giving this movie a 9 because I didn't want Court to die but it was still one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen.
