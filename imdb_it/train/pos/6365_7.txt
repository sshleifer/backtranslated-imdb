This highly derivative movie will be fun for the many who haven't seen some of the darker anime movies. I loved it, especially after the rather flat opening minutes of the museum (although the pre-title sequence is a lot of fun and includes some of the best animation pieces). James Garner in the role of Commander and Leonard Nimoy in the role of King give impressive performances.
