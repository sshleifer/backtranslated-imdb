The Three Stooges has always been one of the many actors I loved. I love practically all the short films they made. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the short films are hilarious and act in many other great actors and actresses that many of them were in many short films! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the greatest actors of all time and is the funniest comic team of all time! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges shorts with hemp is none other than Careful Husbands! All in this short are the beautiful Christine McIntyre, Dee Green, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, Lu Leonard, Maxine Gates and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre offer great performances here! There are so many fun parts here. This is a hilarious brief. There is another similar to Three Stooges short like this called Brideless Groom and I recommend both!
