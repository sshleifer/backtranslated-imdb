maybe I identify myself with this film, because I live in New York and I suffer from bad insomnia, but whatever it is, I have to commend the director in a fantastic job. do what you did without a budget ... wow, that's all i can say. really, really good. as if no money had been spent on this film, it still upset me. I suggest checking it if you can. excellent direction, fantastic soundtrack and, of course, a script that will make you beat your ass. Watch it.
