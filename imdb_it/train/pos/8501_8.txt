I think it's a great example of the differences between two cultures. It would be a great film to show in a sociology class. I thought it was pretty funny and I have to say that I suck for this "leave the band together and do the work" plot device. It seems that many people do not realize that this film is not just a comedy. It also has some dramatic elements and I think they are well founded. Overall, I give it a solid 8.
