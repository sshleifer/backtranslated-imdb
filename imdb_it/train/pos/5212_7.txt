STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> A notoriously bad actor, with his looks (now faded) rather that a strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always occupied a rather curious position in the American Hollywood scene, always a sure bet in the role of male protagonist that still holds a remarkable presence today. But nowadays it seems to have settled more in this kind of direct DVD / limited release roles and as such maybe it seems to be more stable in his forte now. <br /> <br /> You have to draw on some stern issues here like the brave filmmaker Earl Babbage, one of these workers assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in an area of ​​the United States, who along with his new protégé Allison Allthrop Danes) must lead to his latest case, digging into the abduction of a young woman while trying to forgive herself for a case that had failed years ago. <br /> <br /> This is a certain dip in the darker side of humanity, trampling material not for the picky or for those who seek light for visualization. And as such it is a rather strong film, compelling, not forced and not limited by the direct budget to the DVD. The only thing that really manages to pull it back is the extremely agitated, fast camera sequences used in the most dramatic moments that seem a bit trivial after a while. But it is still one of the most solid materials I've seen in Gere, inexorably becoming more obscure and out of reach as it continues. ***
