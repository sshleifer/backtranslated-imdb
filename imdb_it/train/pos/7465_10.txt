Warning: contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie and you're going to do it, just stop reading here and take my word for it. You have to see this movie. I've seen it four times so far and haven't yet decided what exactly happens in the movie. This is all I will say because if you have not seen this movie, then stop reading now. <br /> <br /> If you are still reading, I will ask you some questions and maybe if someone has answers you can write to me and let me know what you think. <br /> <br /> I remember my level 11 English teacher quite well. His name was Mr. Krisak. For me, he was wise beyond his years and always had this tortuous way of teaching you things that you might not like too much. If we do not like Shakespeare, he has transformed history into a modern love story with modern language, so that we can understand it. Our class room was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book in our spare time. This was his indelible way of marking something in our spongy minds. <br /> <br /> I begin this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man, because he once gave us an assignment that was firmly impressed in my mind, like the phone number of a long lost friend time, and in the end it made sense to me after seeing The Matrix. Now, if I didn't know, I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher Mr. Krisak. But giving them the benefit of the doubt, we will assume that it was not him. But that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable. <br /> <br /> He asked us to prove to him and ourselves that they were real. Show me how you can say you're real. This has prompted the class to spit out all the usual ideas that I'm sure you can imagine. Everything from pain, to the sense of touch, to the sense of loss, to the sense of hunger, was transmitted to our teacher to show him that we were real. After every scenario we gave him, he would come back with the only answer that would have left us speechless. <br /> <br /> "What if you're nothing but someone else's dream?" <br /> <br /> And if you were someone else's dream? What a messy question it is. This was a question / scenario posed to us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the Internet and the rapid advancement of computers. How much could it seem then? But if you look at today's technology, you wonder now, what were you doing in someone else's dream. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant but surreal film this year, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive explored similar areas. But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other film can hope to do. In short, this is a film that literally (if you leave it) will blow you away from all the possibilities that surround you. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, hot shot, virtuoso, full of himself a publisher and owner of several magazines. He inherited this from his father and although he has talent and common sense, his board of directors, the seven dwarfs, thinks he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel they have done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each of them believes should go to them. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film we meet one of David's wonderful toys, Julie Gianni, played with pernicious but bizarre perfection by Cameron Diaz. David and Julie play a good game, both claim to be there just to use each other and are not interested in a monogamous and committed relationship. This is the kind of relationship commensurate with the other factions of David that he had in his first sexual life. And even if both talk about a good game, we can say that only one is really telling the truth. <br /> <br /> Then we meet Brian Shelby, played with a stroke of genius by Kevin Smith's good friend Jason Lee. Brian is writing a book that David is about to publish but they are also very good friends. This is something that David has very little in his life and you can feel a real mutual care at the beginning of the film. Brian has a famous line that he keeps telling David again and again. And this is "the dessert is not so sweet without the bitter". He keeps telling him that one day he will find true love and not just this status as a part-time lover that seems to perpetrate with all the floozies that live in his bed for a night or two. <br /> <br /> At David's huge birthday party, (so big that Steven Spielberg wishes him a happy birthday), Brian enters with his date, Sofia Sorrano, obviously played by Penelope Cruz with what must be this year's best performance by an actress. This is a hit by invitation only and initially David and Sofia seem curious about each other. And in the typical fashion of David, despite his best friend being there, he begins to flirt with Sofia. To complicate matters, Julie shows up without an invitation and starts spying on David. David then spends the night with Sofia, but they only talk and draw each other's caricatures. There is no handkerchief The next day, while David is leaving Sofia's apartment, he is greeted by Julie, who offers him a lift and from there ....... well, I think we have all seen the advertisements. <br /> <br /> This is all I will really say about the plot, because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is the fuzzy perception. We are presented with a character played by Kurt Russel and some other shady characters who all play a role in this labyrinth like haze. There is a subtext of death and possible panacea as a panacea that may or may not be able to create the possibility of an eternal life. This is just one of the intriguing possibilities offered by the film, but it doesn't end there. <br /> <br /> As many films seem to thrive today, this film has a secret. Sixth Sense may have started this craze, but look further back and you can perhaps thank Angel Heart for starting the mania. Regardless of how it originated, Vanilla Sky has one of her sneaky puppets. And what makes this fun so funny is that the movie gives you many obvious clues along the way, but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the glove of truth and the lies you've just put in place. I've seen this movie four times and each time it's because I want to see if there's anything more I can collect, something more that I can understand. Being able to work your mind in the theater, making it capable of opening up to new possibilities is something rare in a film. The whole surrogate, the so-called "best pictures of the year" were good but nothing spectacular. They lack substance. A Beautiful Mind was intriguing but flat, The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but not uniform. Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you wanting more, but it guarantees your satisfaction, because the film and those that made it important. I know this film has received mixed reviews, but I think those who don't like it don't understand it at all. <br /> <br /> Here's how the film should be made. This is what a movie should do for you. It should make you feel something. Most of the other films this year have been just blanks. This is not. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 The best film of the year. I'd like to see this film as the best film and I'd like to see Cruz as best actress, Diaz as best support, Cruise as best actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe for the best supporting actor. Cameron Crowe should also be there. None of this can happen, and it's a shame. This is a movie not to be missed. <br /> <br /> And, ultimately, I'm pretty sure Mr. Krisak would like this movie and maybe this is the only movie that can answer your question. Can you prove that you are real? Or are we just someone's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted for the amusement of someone else? This is a film that generates more questions than answers. And I'm sure it's okay with him. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes
