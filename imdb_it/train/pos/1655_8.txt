Mendez and Marichal have provided us with a serious, convincing and painful analysis of the social, spiritual, economic and political crisis that 108 years of colonialism have generated in Puerto Rico. A beautiful island with the most hospitable people I met and still because our nation refuses to face its imperial responsibilities, Puerto Ricans are allowed to dry up and die. <br /> <br /> The spiritual crisis that the colonial situation in Puerto Rico has created, if undermining families, and the basic institutions that support any society. Corruption is rampant to the extent that people do not pay taxes (which led to a fiscal crisis for this nation) and a sense of cynicism and distrust permeate the island's culture. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a concession has allowed this painful yet powerful film to be produced. <br /> <br /> To see. . .
