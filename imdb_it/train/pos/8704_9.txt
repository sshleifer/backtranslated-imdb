There's a lot of crap coming out of Hollywood lately. <br /> <br /> A friend, he sends me movies from time to time, like a surprise, it's great. <br /> <br /> I turned it on and couldn't stop watching, it's a drama, but with a strange twist. Imagine if Romeo, like in Shakepeare, had a super power. It is sad and poetic at the same time. Hollywood should take note of the new Russian cinema, they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and CGIs. It takes a simple basic premise and tells a story, without a show. This is very similar to an Asian movie with a dark Russian touch. Of course, it's not perfect, but it never is. You know what power is, but it is never explained or fully realized until the end. Become secondary to the emotion of the story. I don't want to see a remake, it's too good as it is, the Hollywood system, as usual, would ruin it. Acting is first rate all around. Directing and working with the camera are way above most of the crap out there. Congratulations to everyone involved and I will turn many people into this independent film. A +++++ <br /> <br /> If you can find it, look at it.
