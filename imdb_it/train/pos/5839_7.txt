The last (I think) of the films The Boys made with Hal Roach, this is also the last really funny movie they made, before going to the 20th century fox, who has so famous their talent. Even if there are weak moments - the "lung tester" activity, for example, is a bit, ah ... exaggerated (but worth having, just to see "Dr." Jimmy Finlayson) - but in the All in all this film is a good summary of what the kids brought to the screen. Richard Cramer (uncredited) has appeared in other L & H films, and here he is pleasantly threatening the condemned Nick Granger. The scene where the kids have to eat their synthetic meal ("It looks good, smells good and probably tastes good. Eat it") is one of my favorite moments in the opera. Stan and Ollie will always be nice companions in the lives of their millions of devoted fans.
