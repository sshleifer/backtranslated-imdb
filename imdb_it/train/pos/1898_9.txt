The father of Who's alcoholic drummer, Keith Moon, was named Arthur. I found many similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in this film. Liza Minelli, who usually OVERATTS, did a good job at this, and was able to turn her cheeks to Dudley Moore at every turn. Yes, I agree, Sir John absolutely stole every scene. It was a very "different" movie that allowed the viewer to take a look at another life. We often try to capture a replica of this film on satellite. God rests Dudley Moore; this was such a nice movie. Much satire and thumbs down for the rich and snobbish / rich. The close friendship between Moore and Sir John is rather endearing.
