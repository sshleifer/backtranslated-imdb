As a horse lover you can only enjoy this film. There are few films that show riding like this. I'd like to know if Brian is his guide in the film. He would also like to know if he likes horses. Brian has been in many movies where he has driven. Where did you learn to drive? The only part that is difficult for me is that the driving scenes are always completely inclined, as if a horse could run forever in full steam. Camera work is top notch and captures horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on top of a horse. It would be very interesting to know how they went to launch this film to find all the excellent riders on horseback.
