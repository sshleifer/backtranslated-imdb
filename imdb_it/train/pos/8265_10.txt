The name of this film alone made me want to see what it was, so I recorded this film during the early hours of the AM. If you've ever wanted to see what the miners had to face during the first few days and actually see a dramatic scene when the mine crumbles on men. This film clearly wants to show that Germany and France can work together and be friends after the First World War and how the Germans came to the aid of French miners for the disbelief of French citizens. The actors were all exceptional, with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a kid working in the mine. There is an old retired miner who works to go down the mine with the ladder when the elevator breaks. If you are a true fan of cinema, this is a film not to be missed.
