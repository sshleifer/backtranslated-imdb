Holes, originally a novel by Louis Sachar, was successfully transformed into a fun and well-made film. With Sigourney Weaver in the role of guardian, Shia Labeouf as Stanley and Khleo Thomas as Zero, the roles were very well thought out and the actors played their roles well. <br /> <br /> The film had woven plots that all brought to the end. The main plot concerns Stanley Yelnats and his punishment to spend a year and a half at Camp Greenlake. The second story is about Sam and Kate Barlow. This plot deals with racism and is the deepest plot of the film. The third concerns Elya Yelnats and Madame Zeroni, who explains the 100-year curse of the Yelnats family. In my opinion, these stories were very well intertwined. <br /> <br /> Contrary to many people's beliefs, I think it is not necessary to have read the book to understand the film. The film is reasonably easy to understand. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film was well done, particularly Shia Labeouf (Stanley), Khleo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (the director) and Jon Voight (Mr Sir). The other members of the D-Tent, Jake Smith (Squid), Max Kasch (Zig-Zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (Armpit) and Brenden Jefferson (X-Ray), have improved the film's comic relief. However, the best parts were with Zero and Stanley, who made a great team together. <br /> <br /> Although Holes is a Disney film, it deals with some serious issues such as racism, shootings and violence. The dramatization of the film at some points is very well done. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to people of all ages, whether they have read the book or not. You shouldn't lose it.
