A time of punishment for prisoners comes forward to provide the Cold Case unit with information on the murder of a policeman, committed years before. The murder of Sean Cooper, a good policeman, was never resolved. Of course, detectives believe that the new evidence will help them put together all the pieces of the puzzle that have frustrated their colleagues. <br /> <br /> In flashbacks we are taken to the baptism of the child of James Bruno. Sean and Jimmy were partners. There is tension as Sean, who is the godfather, arrives disheveled and late for the ritual. Eileen Bruno doesn't seem to be happy to be there. The true mystery is revealed by her. He surprised Sean, who was drinking with Jimmy in the back yard, kissing her husband, and even more shocking, Jimmy replied willingly. <br /> <br /> Somehow the partners become the center of the gossip at the station. Sean did not become attached to his superior because he discovered the involvement of a criminal in his area who controlled the drug business. Sean realizes that this man is inside with the man on drugs, because he always makes an excuse to free the foam bags from Sean and Jimmy in the station all the time. The pressure is too strong on Jimmy. Sean is at ease in his homosexuality and wants to be honest about it. Cooper's father wants nothing to do with a homosexual son. Even his superior McCree wants him out of his jurisdiction, but the case is complicated because Cooper comes from a long line of Irish men serving in the police force. Sean is killed because of his homosexual condition, and for having known too much of his peers' involvement in taking dirty money. <br /> <br /> Tom Petit wrote this honest portrait of the life of a police officer in the closet and of his secret I love another cop. We thought it was a sincere account of a serious issue that nobody was talking about back then. Sometimes the people involved in the show, in fear of reprisals from sponsors or networks, don't dare to present these real situations. Jeannot Szwarc, shows a sensitive approach to this thorny problem, which is addressed without the sensationalism that the case could have been shown with a different team. <br /> <br /> There is a rare appearance of Chad Everett as the old Jimmy Bruno. His grip is right on the target with a touch of sentimentality that doesn't get out of hand. Shane Johnson makes an excellent contribution to the show as Sean Cooper. The cast is wonderful and includes good performances all around under the direction of Mr. Szwarc. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Nick Vera, approaches his neighbor, the mother of the basketball player that the detective took his ball away. Nick is heading for love with the woman!
