This film is a real gem. The arc of the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are nice and clearly designed, their motives are completely credible. The dialogue is fresh, and really so real. The situations are unique for the characters and not entirely trivial or trivial. Until the climax, that is. Then it is as if the film had come out of the tracks a little and became a bit crappy and unbelievable. But I don't want to discourage people from watching this movie. The first 3/4 of this is truly remarkable. I gave an 8. There are some notable performances here. Watch this movie.
