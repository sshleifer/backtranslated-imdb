The title is onomatopoeic, the sound of a tram swinging on the tracks. It is metaphorical for everything that people living in the landfill cannot have. The misery of these people is illustrated by the tram that represents the relatively intractable rich life of the middle class. The pathos of the boy and his beloved father, unfortunately sadly crazy, is very touching. This was Kurosawa's first color film and uses wonderfully shocking colors, colors seen only in dreams. The film is surreal and surpasses in beauty. Compassion for humanity is the underlying strength, but as always, Kurosawa is focused on capturing the beauty of the film. It is a masterpiece of a movie genius.
