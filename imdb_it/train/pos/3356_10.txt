Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I watched together "We had loved each other so much" on a summer night: we liked it, but we didn't love it as we liked "A special day". I think Ettore Scola is rather underrated: we often forget to remember him, perhaps because his latest films have been disappointing. And so, last night, my mother and I sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, directing, cinematography, score and production design were sober and precise, but the thing I liked best was the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. Both are excellent actors and play the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antoinette is a housewife: married to a fascist fanatic, she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families. Gabriele is simply an anti-fascist. They spend a special day together, that special day in 1938, when Hitler came to Rome to visit Mussolini. I don't want to ruin the plot anymore: go find this movie!
