I have to admit that the only reason I bought this film is because I'm a big fan of Gackt and a * huge * Hyde fan. I was expecting a good movie with a lot of shots that were, say, pleasing to the female eye, but a somewhat poor story. I mean, the synopsis really looked out there. And now that I've just finished watching it, I feel the need to tell the world its splendor! Hyde and Gackt have both performed heartbreaking, and my eyes are still warm from the crying that lasted throughout the last half of the movie. Get sucked into history, and really feel for the characters at the end. The element of vampirism - which I adore, but it is very easy to exaggerate or ruin a film with - is subtly mixed in the plot to make it something simply exotic, normal to this setting, rather than a random addition not necessary to the story. I classified it at 9 out of 10 at the beginning ... and then I went back and tried to think of why I wasn't giving the last point. I came with nothing. So it's ten out of ten. After all, I'm not that critical: the fact that I'm bothering to write a review means I really hate the movie or really love it. You can tell which way I'm working with Moon Child.
