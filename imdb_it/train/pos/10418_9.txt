The story of the Baghdad thief (as it was once written) attracted filmmakers from Raoul Walsh in 1924, with Douglas Fairbanks in the first, silent title of "Thief of Baghdad", to less impressive and more recent attempts. The best, however, remains the 1940 version which for its time was a magical and surprising panoply of high-quality special effects. These effects still work well. <br /> <br /> No less than six directors are listed for the technicolor film starring Sabu as the thief, Abu, John Justin as the dreamy lover in love, Ahmad and June Duprez as the beautiful princess Ahmad sought chased by the evil vizier, Jaffar, played by a Conrad Veidt sinister. The giant genius is cleverly interpreted by Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> Ahmad is treacherously deposed by Jaffar and, when he is later arrested by that traitor snake, he and the boy, Abu, suffer clearly incapacitated fates. Ahmad is blinded and Abu becomes a lovable bastard. Their adventures through fun Hollywood sunsets are fun but the special effects make this movie work. <br /> <br /> Two men were responsible for everything, from a magical flying carpet to the gigantic genius sticking out of a bottle with a tornado-like black vortex: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard, incidentally, made special effects for the 1961 film version. Both men had long and distinguished careers in technical witchcraft.) Duprez is extraordinarily beautiful while a serious actor is little in demand. Justin's Ahmad projects a romantic but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses. Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and is very good. For a film intended for children and adults there is a good dose of violence but blood without blood. However, I don't think anyone below eight should see "Thief of Bagdad". <br /> <br /> This film makes periodic appearances on TV, but today my teenage son and I saw him in a theater with quite a few young people present. It was nice to see children with computers in a wealthy community responding with applause and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them. <br /> <br /> "Thief of Bagdad" is a classic pre-war Hollywood classic in which strong production values ​​often translated into attractive and important lasting releases. This is one of the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
