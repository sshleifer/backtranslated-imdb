Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a culture fanatic whose previous films have highlighted the artistic excesses of the sixties and the empty ivory of the eighties. With "The Notorious Bettie Page" indicates his gaze fixed on the America of the Fifties, a cloaked era of moral justice by Joe McCarthy, while living the beginning of a sexual awakening that would lead to free love in the following decade. Harron and his co-writer Guinevere Turner are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol. This is a film on the underground icon of an era and how its pure shameless sexuality has revealed both predatory instincts and impure thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a naked body. If the details of Bettie's life were all worried about the film, then why finish it before its most tragic period is about to begin. Clearly, Harron is more interested in America's attitude towards the sexual images of then and now. Together with an intrepid performance as protagonist of Gretchen Mol and the incredibly suggestive cinematography of W. Mott Hupfel III, he achieves this goal admirably, keeping a mirror of the past while allowing the public to examine their "enlightened" attitudes of the 21st century against called pornography. While America suffocates under a new conservatism, this is a film more necessary than ever.
