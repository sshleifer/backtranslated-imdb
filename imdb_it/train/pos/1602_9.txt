I bought the video quite late in my collecting and probably would have saved a lot of money if I had bought it before. Invariably replaces anything else on those nights of "Cosmo's moon". Cher and Olympia certainly deserve their awards, but this is really an impeccable performance together with a superb script. What? Don't you know what a "Cosmo moon" is?
