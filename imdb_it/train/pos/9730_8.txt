Reviews from British newspapers seem to have focused on the fact that reviewers tend to know Toby Young, the journalist whose real-life experience this film is based on. The key word here is "based". How To Lose Friends is a fictional novel. <br /> <br /> Sidney Young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in New York, where he continues to make gaffes after gaffes before Getting It Right and Making It. This involves his exhaustion and the film has some important points to consider on journalistic integrity. However, they are not exaggerated: the main substance remains a comedy focused on the misadventures of Sidney. The script has its cake and it eats it because Sidney is a stupid and well-intentioned buffoon at the same time of being a skilled, moderately hateful writer. This contradiction is never a big problem, because Simon Pegg (like Sidney) projects sympathy too well. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges subtends the editor of Sidney a little too effectively, and Kirsten Dunst is rather anonymous as the final confrontational object of Sidney's affections, regarding Megan Fox (who plays a baby star with an empty head), I can only say this: just say the word, Miss Fox, and I will leave my wife, sell all my things and buy a plane ticket in order to take my place by your side as your consort. Of course, since I'm a fat 56-year-old accountant, you might not find my offer too tempting, but it's still on the table. Considering how short his career has been, you might think it's a bit too early for Megan Fox to take on a role that ruthlessly stands out the kind of actress that could be thought to become: however, she does it gently, with some abilities and extremely sexually. This girl will go far. <br /> <br /> There is support from a number of expert artists - Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from the United Kingdom, Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the United States. <br /> <br /> There are several moments of laughter and I smile almost completely. As always, F-word makes appearances when you don't really need them, even if at least a couple of them are very funny.
