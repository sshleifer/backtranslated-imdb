Well, I come from Bulgaria where it is almost impossible to have a tornado but my imagination tells me it is "very, very scared" !!! This guy (Devon Sawa) did a great job with this movie! I know exactly how old he was, but he didn't behave like a child (WELL DONE)! Now on the tornado - it wasn't very realistic but it scares you! If you want to have fun in front of the television - this is the movie!
