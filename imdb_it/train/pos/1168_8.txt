Tony Arzenta, Sicilian assassin or professional killer, decides to leave the company, and his former employers disagree. In terms of content, this extremely fun action movie doesn't have one; in terms of pure fun, it's fun, it's very melodramatic, violent, rather brutal, car chases are remarkable. "Arzenta" is an unpretentious film, but very nice, much better than the current Hollywood trash that gets the same label. It comes from Delon's rather short flirtation with the Italian B cinema of the '70s. He carefully uses Delon's robust character, belonging to the gallery of bad thugs he did in his youth. <br /> <br /> I really liked the fact that Delon made this film, that he played a role in a good Eurocrime movie. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is very beautiful, with a good introductory song making one feel the taste that the Italians had for the film considered as a synthetic work, in which the musical art has an important part. <br /> <br /> In Tony Arzenta / Big Guns / No Way Out the charming Erika Blanc (31 years old in '73) appears as a nameless prostitute. Meanwhile, Arzenta's girlfriend, Sandra, is played by Carla Gravina (a starlet who practically left the films after '75). <br /> <br /> "Arzenta" Interesting is filmed an ambitious visual conception, some peculiar expressionist corners. The film was directed by the prolific Duccio Tessari, who also made Zorro (Delon's comedy). Without mentioning that these two films, Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zorro, are very different. The first is a bloody melodramatic violent action film - the second is a carefree comedy, more akin to a parody, even if extraordinarily coherent and expertly realized. Duccio Tessari has directed films such as Kiss Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966), Sons of Satan, The Bloodstained Butterfly, Â¡Viva La Muerte ... Yours! , Tough Guys (1974), Safari Express (1976), etc.
