Red Rock West is a perfect example of how good a film can be with virtually no budget. All you need is a smart script, good actors and lots of atmosphere. RRW delivers all this and more. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage plays an ex-marine, wounded in Lebanon, who lost the last 5 dollars after being refused a job in a field due to his ugly knee. Intervenes in the Red Rock and is exchanged by the bartender Wayne (JT Walsh, not just like his most threatening - but still evil) for a Texas hired man. <br /> <br /> He pays him to kill his wife and make it sound like a theft. Only when it arrives, just to check it. She offers him twice to kill Wayne. Cage just wants to get out of the city with his free money and let sparring lovers be. But a series of setbacks and setbacks results in him yo-yoing in and out of Red Rock, back and forth. In the end this leads to a meeting with Lyle of Dallas (an impertinent and somewhat likable Dennis Hopper), the real Texas man who offers to help without knowing he's making the plot more complicated. <br /> <br /> RRW has never had a great version, so most of the public discovered it on video or in cable TV broadcasts. Watching it this way could make it look like a TV movie, but it's bigger than that. The slippery, slowly planned direction, the moody soundtrack and the howling desert wind would all have been made for a great movie in cinemas, but the best you can do these days is to watch the DVD on a big HD TV. <br /> <br /> the only weak point in the movie I can think of is the boring fatal of Lara Flynn Boyle with the bad rocking hairstyle. I certainly wouldn't fall in love with her, but if the character of Nic Cage is supposed to be for militant lesbians, then you'll accept it anyway.
