I saw this movie at the Adelaide Film Festival '07 and was completely intrigued for the whole 106 minutes. I like documentaries, but I often find them dragging them about 25 minutes. Forbidden Lie $ continued to work, never losing my interest. <br /> <br /> The subject of the film is Norma Khoury, a Jordanian woman who found fame and fortune in 2001 with the publication of her book Forbidden Love, a biographical story of guys about a Muslim friend who was murdered by his family to have a relationship with a Christian man. A few years later, however, some journalists began poking history, leading the public to believe it was a fraud. The film covers this quickly but completely at the beginning, and from there we spend most of our time in the company of Norma as she tries to convince us that her novel is more than a fiction. <br /> <br /> Director Anna Broinowski has found a truly fascinating woman to study and conducts endless interviews with Khoury as she searches for the truth. As always in life, the truth is not so easy to find. Norma fears for her life, worried about the violent backlash on the unpleasant portrait of her novels painted by Jordanian Muslims. She refuses to go back to Jordan and show us the facts. However, Broinowski is not discouraged and slowly puts the pieces together in front of us. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredible look in the mind of a scammer. Of course, what we find doesn't make much sense and is extremely difficult to follow, and in the end we don't know whether to believe Norma or not. She is a rather unfair woman trying to survive, or a fantastic spinster. The plot of lies, truths and half truths through which the film rotates is brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film uses many interviews and even dramatizations to tell its story, and Broinowski uses these dramatizations to show us why people like Norma can exist: we want to be scammed. We go to the movies every day and we allow ourselves to believe that what is happening on the screen is real. It might just be me reading things a little too much, it didn't come out in Q&A with Brionowski after the movie, but that's what I took off. <br /> <br /> This is a great Australian film, and must receive an international version, and a hoe of prizes if you ask me. Definitely the best film I saw at AFF07. Go and see it, if you have the chance.
