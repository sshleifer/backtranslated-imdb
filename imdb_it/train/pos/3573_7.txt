this film was almost a great fantasy film. A mixture of shakespeare, pop, jazz and faerie stories. This film was an imaginative touch on the theme of Cinderella. With a strong cast, directed by the perfect performer Kathleen Turner, this film had everything for him. Everything except the production values. I almost never think that a film needs special effects or big budgets, but with a production at the top like this, it came out with the same shabby quality as any other TV movie product. In addition to better cinematography, this film was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
