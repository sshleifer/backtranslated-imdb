... when this film shows so well that they are not really necessary. <br /> <br /> Although a few lines, it was strange to see this film, without subtitles, in an unknown language. A friend of mine sent a VHS, including some sheets with all the lines translated into English. with his translation next to me, I started looking at this story (it's really a story), and from the very first songs of the hissing melody during the opening credits I got stuck. the colors, that minimal acting (well, in most cases), the absurd comedy, the farce, thoughtful, beautiful ... along with some other films (Paris, Texas and Nenette et Boni), this is able to speak to anyone's heart - without words. Whenever you have the chance, look at it. Whatever you do, don't lose. It is an experience to do at least once in your life. Oh, acting is fantastic, the soundtrack is brilliant, the story is simple and told a thousand times before - but rarely (never?) Like this.
