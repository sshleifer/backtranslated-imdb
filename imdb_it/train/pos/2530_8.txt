One of the joys of the collection of the recent Bela Lugosi collection is to see delicious movies like The Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi unite in a film that digs between meteorites and radiation and while science is completely absurd (especially the Karloff photographic technique, as Janos Rukh, used to determine the site of a certain meteorite) and decidedly ridiculous, I I didn't care about the lease because the movie is really nice. The effects are good for the time, the acting is exceptional and the finish is particularly strong. It reminds me of the pulp science fiction comics and the novels of the 40s and 50s, complete with ray guns and ridiculous science. You have to watch this movie!
