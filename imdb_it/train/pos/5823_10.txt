In Micro Phonies, minions are better. In this short the three are handymen working in a recording studio. They end up taking a look at Alice Van Doren (Christine Mcintyre) who sings the voice of spring. The voice is incredible. The curly-haired girl is listened to by Mrs Bixby (Symona Boniface). Moe calls Curly Senior Cucaracha. The three stooges end up going to celebrate where Curly dresses in drag. They play a record of the voices of spring and all is well until Moe destroys the disc on Curly's head. They end up using the lucia sexlet until the baritone recognizes them and disconnects them. Alice Van Doren approaches the boy screaming and hides behind a curtain to help them. Everything is fine until the baritone wonders how Curly is singing without the help of a phonograph who discovers Alice behind the curtain. The three stooges turn out to be frauds but Alice's father discovers his daughter's talent and agrees to become a singer. The minions are thrown out of the room. Excellent.
