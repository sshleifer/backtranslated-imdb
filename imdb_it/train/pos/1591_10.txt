Recently, my mother and I became addicted to this show, laughing out loud! I've only seen 10 episodes and I'm disappointed that I didn't pay attention to this hilarious series before they were deleted! The plot is a lot of fun, the characters have really big personalities (or, not so big, but they're still fun!). Ti TiVO every episode of What I Like About You. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as the whole cast, never bore me while I watch! There is inappropriate language for children and some sexual content, but with a nearby parenting guide, you shouldn't have too many problems. There is a kind of "Friends" relationship that attracts me in this show. I really like.
