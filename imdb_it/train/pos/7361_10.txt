This film will usually rank as the worst film production ever. Never. But in my opinion it is perhaps the most fun. The horrifying director and script make this film priceless. I bought the film while sifting the deal DVDs in my local bookseller. Some friends and I looked at him, assuming he was rather drunk. It soon turned out that this was not a normal film. Instead a precious relic of what will probably be the last James Cahill film. At first we were confused and we were screaming that the DVD player was turned off, but fortunately in our abnormal state nobody could be disturbed. Instead we watched the film all the way. In the end we soon realized that we had found dreams of time-wasters, something that can reasonably be laughed at for hours, while laughing for all the wrong reasons. Soon we showed all our other friends and they agreed too, this was not an abysmal movie job. This was a movie on which you can really get wet. This was a film that everyone can appreciate. This was brilliant.
