OK - regarding the 2 versions of this film. There were two people involved in the decision-making process - John Korty and Bill Couterie (George was just the producer - he had no claims whatsoever in the film - only helped with money) - the "adult" version was made possible by Bill Couterie. John Korty did not like or approve this version (as was done behind him). Thanks to the Ladd films in circulation, they did not advertise this film and threw all their advertising money for "The Right Stuff", hoping it would put them through ... and it wasn't. So this movie never really had a chance. When "Twice" switched to the cable (HBO) - they showed the reels with Bill's version and John threatened to sue if it was shown more (did you notice that the "adult" version hadn't been active for a long time? ). Showtime has the 'clean' version. The version on videotapes and laser disc is the version approved by John (which holds more power than Bill). It's really a pity, as the "adult" version is actually better and makes more sense. But it is VERY doubtful that it will ever be released in that DVD version (or any other format short of bootlegs). I'm sorry to disappoint everyone. I know all this information as I was the president of Twice Upon A Time Fan Club (I still have many elements of the film - used to own a letterbox version of the "adult" version, but it was stolen - just have a partial HBO copy of it now). 8 stars for the "adult" version - 5 for the "clean" version. Any other question, just ask.
