Animation always seems to be marginal. In Japan, this may not be the case, but in Europe and much more in the US the animation has a big "KIDS" tag on it. France is probably one of the most comic-liberal countries, home to the classics like Tin-Tin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon and so on (if you've never read them, it's not too late. They and they don't bring the nerd stigma of DC or Marvel). It seems natural that a film like this appears in France. It adapts to my prejudiced image of the French as art lovers, anti-USA and talented filmmakers. Fortunately, there is also "A dark scanner" out there to suppress this vision - it seems that art is rather international. <br /> <br /> However, as you may have understood, the Renaissance is artistic and French. If you are a normal person you will be scared of it. No need, anyway! Below its cool, elegant, cel-shaded appearance is a good thriller and a good film in general. <br /> <br /> It was one of my fears for this movie. It's so easy to turn spectacular animation into a trick, just like Sony & C: or they're doing with their repercussions on Pixar. I expected a confusing film, sometimes boring and not very engaging, but fortunately I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to have liked neo-noir things anyway, but it was also nice that this level was worth it. NOTE: I saw the French dubbing which was OK as far as I could see. English could be more interesting than that with Craig and everything. <br /> <br /> A final word of praise for the animation. It was amazing. Futuristic, well thought out, beautiful photographic work, intelligent solutions (for example Eyes looked very good, something difficult to do) and so visually amazing it seemed to me to burst "It's so damn awesome!". Besides, I really like the animation and I appreciate the effort that the studio has put down, so my verdict is a bit biased. <br /> <br /> Good film anyway, surely it lives beyond its "trick".
