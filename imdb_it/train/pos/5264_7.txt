A delightful mini-movie, a musical short film based on three of Cole Porter's Broadway comedies. Bob Hope's first credited film is a treat! He plays an American playboy millionaire on vacation in Paris. The film opens with him sitting at an outdoor cafe table that tells his friends about this breathtaking beauty. Suddenly he sees her a few meters away. he is so survivor that his friends tease him and suggest he "show him your bank book". But Hope claims she can win in less than 30 days with "no"! They bet polo ponies on the issue and take all their cash and ID cards. Hope follows her and when I'm alone she unleashes a proposal that she doesn't believe to be sincere until she sings, "Do something for me" by Cole Porter. But she has to leave and he tries to earn money as a tour guide so he can pursue it. But when he sees him showing another girl in the city, disillusioned, he wants to let him fall. He continues to chase her and joins his and his family on a track where he bets his meager earnings in the last race hoping to win enough to impress her. Through a series of events and large numbers of synchronized dance he loses the winning ticket and decides to marry him rich or poor. So the girl, the race and the bet wins and sings two more songs!
