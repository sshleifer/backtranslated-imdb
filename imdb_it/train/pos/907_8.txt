This film is a great attempt at the revival of traditional Indian values ​​that are replaced by Western ones. It is a joint family history that shows all the ethics that each person should follow while communicating with each individual relative. Shahid Kapoor gives a gr88 performance as he is about to bond with Amrita Rao who is also very Desi and she also behaves very well ... The genre of the film is the same as HAHK and these films deserve to be made in India for the revival of old traditional values ​​.. The films do not receive 10 because it is not very good in music, that matters a lot in every film, besides this it is impeccable ....
