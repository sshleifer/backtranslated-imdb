The more I look at Nicholas Cage, the more I appreciate him as an actor. Watching this movie now (in 2005), I can see that it doesn't fit perfectly with the genre of films that came out in the early 90s. I don't think it can be considered a film noir, but sometimes it's rather dark, mainly due to the lighting and the strange personalities of the characters. <br /> <br /> Typical shows by each of the three main actors, who have all done a good job with their roles. I thought, however, that the characters of Hopper and Boyle had not been developed, as it was sometimes difficult to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it. Hopper loves it or hates it like a guy. The plot is really good, and although I found some very unrealistic parts, there were parts where I had to deliver it to the director (ie when he first sees the sheriff). All in all, it's definitely worth watching this movie. *** 1/2
