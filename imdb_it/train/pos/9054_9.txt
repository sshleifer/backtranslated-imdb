"October Sky" is a film that will steal your heart, fill your mind with vivid images and lift your spirit. The story of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first, especially when the film is set in a mining town, where the future is as clear as the coal pieces in the mine. But Homer can't follow in his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of Miss Riley, (a friendly teacher), staff members of his father and his friends, Homer tries to fulfill his dream. <br /> <br /> However, as in any true life story, they are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston lowers us in the coal mines, where we witness the chilling situation of the miners bent under a rock ceiling. With illuminated helmets and bent postures, they resembled alien insectoids rather than humans in darkness. The miners and blackened hacker coughs were a constant reminder of the danger miners faced in their work. Contrary to the dismal load of the mine shaft are the images of Homer's and his friend's rocket launches. Under the blue bowl of the sky, the rockets are positioned on a block and launched into the stratosphere ... And nothing can match the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time. <br /> <br /> Yet what makes the film so appealing is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a classic hardened man ... but he also has a soft side. We see that he loves his son, despite their many arguments. Miss Riley's love and support are also evident. Best of all, the film is uncomfortable. It doesn't bind everything in a nice bow. He cries, he lifts you. It keeps an air of reality, which is important in a film like this. <br /> <br /> This film can be considered a complete job. At first, I was disappointed that the film didn't continue with Homer's life. I didn't want it to end. Then I realized ... it's what makes a good movie to a person. If he did his job, you wouldn't want it to end. And "October Sky" does just that.
