The worst movie of all time? Wow, whoa now. You can not be serious. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's all you expect a film to do to you. I live in Oregon, so I was able to enjoy the beautifully shot family shots of familiar yet incredibly beautiful Smith Rocks in other parts of Central Oregon (and also the sweet cameo of our Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs looking down on Sissy's cradle beginning of the film). Those alone were enough to spur me on to give the film a better score than the average. <br /> <br /> Or ... Maybe it's all about what expectations you have. After reading the book AGES ago, and thinking of myself "goodness, no one could ever make a film from this interesting, bizarre and bizarre book ... especially 20 years later, when mores (MORAY - can't put it in accent online ) have changed "- I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the film for the first time when it came out in 1994 and I liked it even more today looking at it again. <br /> <br /> Sissy was exquisitely cast, and I don't care what you say, I was pleasantly surprised by the performances of Rain Phoenix and John Hurt. I am not a lesbian, nor a bi, nor a trans, but I have met many people who are similar to the people they should portray - and those "real" people acted the same way these actors did. Stilted a little, stage-ey - always a little "on". Gus Van Sant is a strange native Oregon native but with a great job he adapted this crazy book, IMHO.
