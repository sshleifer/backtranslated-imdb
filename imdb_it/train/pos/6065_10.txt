This film is horrible - in an "ugly way it's good". <br /> <br /> The plot is reworked by many other films of this type, which I won't even bother to describe. It is a picture of sword / witchcraft, it has a child who hopes to realize how important it is in this world, it has a "nomad" adventurer, an evil helper / sorcerer, a princess, a hairy creature ... you understand point. <br /> <br /> The first time I took this film was during a very harsh winter. I don't know why I decided to keep watching it for another five minutes before shooting the channel, but when I discovered the Gulfax site, I decided to stay and watch it until the end. <br /> <br /> Gulfax is a white and hairy creature similar to Chewbacca, but not as useful or fun to look at. It looks like someone glued a pile of white carpet and forced the actor to wear it. There are scenes in which it seems that the actor cannot move inside or is almost falling. Although not much in the film, the few scenes are worth it! Watch as he tries to slap Bo Svenson, bringing the Solo-Chewbacca confrontation to an even higher level! <br /> <br /> I bought this movie because of that character, and I still have it somewhere! <br /> <br /> Gulfax might look like sh! t, but he made this movie !!! The only reason I never saw the sequel, or even searched for it, was because of its absence! Perhaps there should be a final film, completing the trilogy, Gulfax will make a much anticipated return!
