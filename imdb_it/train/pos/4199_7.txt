The only thing about this film that bothers me is that the DVD is so expensive. It's too much for my budget right now, or I'd buy it, because the film is a good example of a film noir ... and I like to watch Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> The criterion produces large DVDs, but sometimes the asking price is just a little too much. This is the case of a black and white 80 minute film, good but nothing extraordinary, as far as cinematography is concerned. <br /> <br /> The plot is the story here (as opposed to images, sound actors, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently ends up with espionage microfilm in its possession after stealing the purse of Peters. (say that three times!). Everyone except Peters is a credible character in this film: Widmark, the cops, US agents and the communists and, in particular Ritter as "Moe", an informant. She and Widmark are the protagonists of this film. <br /> <br /> Peters does a decent job of playing cheaply, but loses his credibility at first by "falling in love" with Widmark in the first fight even though he is bad at her. Only in the world of cinema !! Too bad, because that ridiculous love story is part of the story. <br /> <br /> This is an average noir film that means good, but not exceptional and certainly not worth owning at a price of $ 25- $ 35. For that price, you could do a lot better in the market for film noir.
