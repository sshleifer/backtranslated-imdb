Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and, above all, Jeff Fahey, all in one movie. Wow is all I can think of to say about it. These are four of the most undervalued actors in the world of work and work beautifully together. It's like poetry the way they play with each other and exude the natural ability to look like they were the best friends for eons even to shoot the film. <br /> <br /> The film itself is fine and one that can be intense enough to see the first time, and the four stars help the ability to re-watch to a large extent. I can't describe how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey together on the screen, the best moment is when they look at a couple from afar and fill the voices themselves, almost made a tear in my eyes. <br /> <br /> A good movie, a great cast, go and see. Why? Four words, Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino.
