This is not the best Bigfoot ever made, but according to Nature's recent standards it went wrong for films, especially for the Sci-Fi channel, it's quality stuff. He has some action, some humor, decent F / X and Bigfoot. The CG is used, but so are some practical F / Xs, which I like. <br /> <br /> Overall this film deserves a watch if you're a fan of horror / science fiction B and need a solution. It's better than the Sasquatch movie and it's not a sequel, so don't be fooled. <br /> <br /> Acting is better than you can expect to find in a film like this and the direction is more than adequate. Expect a little lul when the characters are "developed", but know that things will take hold. If you are watching a DVD, you can skip a chapter or two.
