A question that must be asked immediately is: would this film have been made if the women in it were not Jacqueline Lee Bouvier's Kennedy Onassis aunt and cousin? <br /> <br /> The answer is: Probably not. /> <br /> Fortunately, they are (or were) the cousin and aunt of Jackie. <br /> <br /> This documentary by the Maysles brothers on the existence (which could hardly be called a life) by Edith B. Beale, Jr. and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (Edie), have the same charm as a disaster rail - you don't want to look but you have to. <br /> <br /> Big Edith and Little Edie live in a once magnificent villa in East Hampton, New York, which is slowly decaying around them. The beautiful gardens have become a jungle. <br /> <br /> Magnificent oil painting leaning against the wall (with cat feces on the floor behind them) and beautiful portraits of them while young women vie for space on the walls next to old magazine covers. <br /> <br /> Living alone together for many years has broken down many barriers between the two women but erected others. <br /> <br /> Clothing seems to be optional. Edie's favorite costume is a pair of shorts with tights pulled over them and pieces of cloth wrapped around her bust and head. <br /> <br /> As Edith says "Edie is still beautiful at 56". And indeed she is. There are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was. <br /> <br /> There is a constant background of sexual tension. <br /> <br /> Their eating habits are (for being polite) strange. Ice cream has spread over crackers. A dinner for Edith's birthday of Wonder Bread sandwiches served in fine porcelain with plastic utensils. <br /> <br /> Time is irrelevant in their world; as Edie says "I have no watches." <br /> <br /> Their relationships with men are really so strange. <br /> <br /> Edie feels as if Edith had hindered her attempts at happiness. He says "If you can't get a man to propose you, you might even die." To which Edith replies "I'll take a dog every day". <br /> <br /> It is obvious that Edith does not see her role in the lack of male company of Edie. At the beginning of the film he says "France has fallen but Edie is not. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said. Both women speak at the same time and constantly contradict each other. /> <Br /> There is a strange relationship with animals throughout the film: Edie feeds raccoons in the attic with Wonder Bread and cat food. Cats (and there are many) are everywhere. <br /> <br /> At one point, Edie states that "The hallmark of aristocracy is responsibility." But they seem unable to take responsibility for themselves. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult film to watch but it's worth it penalty.
