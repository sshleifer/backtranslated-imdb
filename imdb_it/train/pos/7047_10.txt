this film must be seen. the truest image of what happens in the world that I saw from Darwin's nightmare. Go see it! and if you're lucky enough to have it open in your city, make sure you see it on the big screen instead of on the DVD. The writing is clear and the direction is good enough for ideas, even if it is hardly perfect. Joan Cusack is amazing, and the rest of the cast is good too. It's inspiring that John Cusack made this film and, I think, he had to use some of his money to do it. It's a wild and absurd race, obviously done without the resources it needed, but it still succeeds. Jon Stewart, Steven Colbert, SNL, even Bill Maher didn't show the courage to say what this movie says.
