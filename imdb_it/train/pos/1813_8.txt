In my case I liked this movie because when I saw it I found more than I expected. I mean, this is one of the few animated films that made me think about his themes long after I finished. He talks about death, revenge and hell in such a way that he gets you like a punch in the face, even coming to suffer with the sequence of dreams at the center of the film. This is what makes this film so beautiful: the unique ability in Don Bluth (director) to play with people's feelings and make them love or hate a character in a short time. This, and the fact that he has so many beautiful characters like Charlie and Ann-Marie, that in the sad but happy ending you have to say "I have something in my eyes" to hide the others you cried. All I said are just some of the positive points of this film. For the rest, you have to see them alone in an extremely honest film. Don Bluth, thank you.
