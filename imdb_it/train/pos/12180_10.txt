In my opinion, A GUY THING is a funny, witty, sexy, romantic and totally beautiful movie that kids will love too. I thought Jason Lee and Julia Stiles were dazzled by a stunned future groom and his future sexy cousin. If you ask me, they illuminated the screen like magic. You can even hear their chemistry between them. Before concluding, I would like to say that the performances were of a high standard, the management was impeccable, the production design was beautiful, the casting was perfect and the costumes were perfectly designed. In conclusion, to anyone who is a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles, I recommend this movie. You are full of laughter and chills, so go to the video store, rent or buy it, relax with a friend and watch it.
