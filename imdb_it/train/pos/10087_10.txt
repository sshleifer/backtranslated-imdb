Fabulous costumes by Edith Head who painted them on Liz Taylor at her best! <br /> <br /> SFXs are perfect for a film of its age, and the stand-in would actually resemble the actors, even for the body type, a rarity in the films of this vintage. <br /> <br /> A welcoming film, with splendid views - even if demolished to perform scans and scans.
