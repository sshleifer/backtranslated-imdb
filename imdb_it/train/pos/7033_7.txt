First of all, DO NOT call it a remake of the '63 movie. Although this version is more true for theatrical performance, it is extremely long. The casting was good with some exceptions. Chyna Phillips was not a good casting choice. He was almost 30 years old when he shot this film, and it was hard to believe he was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while he gave me a headache. Tyne Daly exaggerates with the part of Mae Peterson. George Wendt was as fun as Harry McAffee, and showed that he could also keep a melody. Like the 1963 film, they cast an unknown factor to play Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch enjoyed his role as Birdie and showed. I also have the soundtrack and I love listening to her singing. So what made this TV rating flop? It was long for one. They added new songs and scenes. Even if some of the new songs were good (like "Let's Settle Down"), was it really necessary? Now don't get me wrong, I liked it, but I'd rather watch the 1963 movie (see my review). This was only the case in which some actors exaggerated the roles, making some changes and, once again, LENGTH. Another thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams. Does a good job with the role and the music. Give her some lyrics and she could sing them. So here is my advice that comes from someone who made a couple of Bye Bye Birdie productions: If you want to watch a fun presentation of the game, watch the 1963 movie. If you want to see a more faithful version of the game, look at the '95 version. Just take it in moderation though. Don't be a hero and try to look at it all at once.
