When you are in a dark or depressed mood, go see this movie. It shows much beauty and joy in a very simple everyday environment, and is very encouraging, particularly from a feminist and humanist perspective. <br /> <br /> When you know both Turkish and Danish or the German language, go watch the movie anyway. Half of the dialogue is Danish in the original, synchronized with the German in the translated version, the other half Turkish, subtitled in Danish or German, respectively. When I saw it in Mannheim, Germany, the reaction of the Turkish-speaking public showed that there must be a lot of humor in the Turkish dialogue, which, puzzled, I mostly missed, being only imperfectly rendered in the subtitles. However, the film is interesting even if you don't know Turkish. <br /> <br /> Aesthetically, the film plays a lot on the subject of speed and slowness. At first glance, there is a lot of body movement as fast as lightning, making it a fast, agitated film. In particular, even though this is a Kung Fu movie, watch out for the racing scenes, beautifully expressing a great deal of emotion. But there are also some very slow and emotionally intense scenes. And above all, the characters develop at a much slower pace than one would expect in a drama about coming of age; however, there is some movement in the characters to: Closely observe bad Omar, whose part and acting I liked very much. <br /> <br /> The contrast of speed and quiet contributes positively to the representation of human anger and dignity - shown immediately, with the same characters, at the same time.
