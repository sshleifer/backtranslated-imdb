To be honest With you I think everything was so good in this movie there should be no reason why he didn't go to the movies, the Deaths in the movie are fantastic The FX's are great when they're used, There are a few boring moments when the la story follows the girl, but all in all it was a very nice film that I hope that one day the props will go well. The first part of the film is probably the reason why he came directly to the video by killing a boy, but after the story is based on a little girl and her mother who came to see the mothers' boyfriend who moved out to try to become a writer. The property he buys is where the witch lives (Tooth Fairy) and those who live in his house or go to his property will be in great danger, I don't want to give anything really just a little information if you wanted to see this movie, then the rent is worth the price
