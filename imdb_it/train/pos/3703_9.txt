Ok, so it's a movie for adults. But it's really done very tastefully. It is obvious that the producers spent a lot of time and money making a class movie. I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful it was. Even the acting was pretty decent. The plot was more solid than most adult movies I've seen. The camera work was above average. It's just a good movie !!
