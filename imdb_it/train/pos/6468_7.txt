This is a pretty OK movie ... yes, some parts are lame and exceptionally convenient, and the movie doesn't really justify the cast of the big stars (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, the actor who really impressed me here was Kay Kay Menon (not to be confused with the singer KK). In the scene where he first meets the character of Amitabh, I thought that a man who can only watch AB, keep watching and not say a word, and still look strong, is definitely a good actor. In fact, he proved himself worthy again to Sarkar, along with AB for the second time. This guy should have more roles, he's brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you have read one of the other reviews here on IMDb, you already know the plot, and I agree that the entry of Akshaye Khanna in Pakistan was a little too easy and the little angle he shared with "what's-her-face" was completely useless. But he's a pretty good actor (as seen in DCH), Sunjay Dutt is good to see, always. and AB ... what can I say. I don't know if I'm his biggest fan in the world, but I know I can definitely compete for the job. <br /> <br /> An interesting watch, considering that it is Bollywood, although a little inspired by the old Hollywood like "The Great Escape" and "Bridge on the Kwai River".
