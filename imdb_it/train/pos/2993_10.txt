Apart from the usual stereotypes of the thirties, Eugene Pallette in the role of bureaucratic police detective, Jack La Rue as the Italian "brown" and, of course, James Lee as "The Chinese cook", this film is THE great mystery of a murder in a locked room. For a film from the early 1930s, this step-by-step "peel the mystery veneer" is similar to the COLUMBO series, except in this film, you don't have the advantage of knowing who the killer was in advance.
