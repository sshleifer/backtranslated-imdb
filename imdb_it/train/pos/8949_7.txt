Vertigo is Stewart's co-star (in his latest role as a romantic star) and Novak elevates this, Stewart's other "Christmas movie" movie, above mid-level entertainment. The chemistry between the two stars makes a moving experience and further revelations can be deduced from the film if witchcraft is seen as a metaphor for private pain that hinders many people's relationships. All in all, a nice diversion with legendary stars, 7/10.
