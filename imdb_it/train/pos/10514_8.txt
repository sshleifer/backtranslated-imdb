Emma is a horribly imperfect film based on the classic novel by Jane Austens. I didn't read the book, so I didn't know much about the plot, and yet I still expected almost the whole plot. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of bad writing or directing. But the film is for some reason very funny and I loved it. Of course there were all the scenes I didn't like but most of them were well acted and fun. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as Emma's heroine. The film is also played by Toni Collette (who agrees but was much better) Ewan Mecgreger (who was even better but is still very good here) Alan Cumming (Who has never really impressed me and is practically the same here) and Jeremy Northam (Who's performance is rather wooden at first glance, but actually quite thin, even if it wasn't what it was needed) There have been much better adaptations of Jane Austen's books, but this is still very funny and it's worth watching.
