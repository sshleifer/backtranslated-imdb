I don't care if you'd like my comment or not, but I think you write that the film isn't good ... you're so obsessed with Hollywood movies that you can't see how good this movie is I'm not a Jay Chou fan but I like his game and not just his ... and maybe you think there is not a great sense in the idea and you might think that it is not so interesting but look deeply there is more than action in the movies rather than the there is more love and passion and tears than the United States in the world and it's good :) really good. And it costs a lot to do it so please don't criticize the filmmakers actors because you don't know how hard they work to be happy in this hour and a half watching them thanks :)
