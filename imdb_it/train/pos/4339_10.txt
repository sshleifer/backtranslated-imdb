This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I feel very touched by the theme that the film intends to convey. A phrase that keeps coming to my mind is that "history repeats itself". Life is what is shown in the film: when people are young, they seem not to understand their parents, their spouses; people have every excuse not to share the most expensive time with their children until too late; people must always work hard to support the whole family, but they are simply susceptible to neglecting the subtle feeling of their partners; people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives; people can always be forgiven if their hearts are full of love for their loved ones; nothing is more important than people who share the blood relationship in this world, and it is never too late to talk to their parents about what they feel deep in their heart so that they can better understand each other, so that when life has to end one day, people should not feel sorry or sorry since they kept their words and there is always hope --- a new life. The actors and actresses are fantastic. They understood the director's intention perfectly. The fascination of the film lies, for me, in the effect of bringing to the public a skillful and splendid fusion of applause and tears.
