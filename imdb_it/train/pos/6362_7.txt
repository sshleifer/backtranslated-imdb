Assuming you've seen some "Speed ​​Racers", but I've never really looked at it and I've seen other shows too, some of these characters dressed as birds flying over a ship called Phoenix and another one circling a spaceship which looked like a giant ocean ship and flew backwards at times for some reason and was really dark and hard to understand for someone who was maybe five. This however I watched almost every episode and the beauty for me at that time was that this show had a certain resolution. It's actually over, the bad guys did unlike almost all American cartoons where nothing really concludes as the last episode of the Transformation of a generation that ended with Galvatron and this new bad oath to get the Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons with the guys never Making it home, with GI Joe with Cobra still out there ready to try again and so on and so on. This ended and he introduced a rather cold robot that got new weapons as the show progressed, at first it was a bit bland because it couldn't fly and only had a few really fantastic weapons. As he went on he got a cold punch like the one used by Android 16 against Cell in Dragonball Z, then that weapon evolved to include razors that were fired. So the big robot even has wings to fly and others have been incorporated into the wings. He would also take a couple of allies in a female robot and a pretty funny one called Bobo in America. The villains were not only Dr. Hell, but a really strange person who was half man half woman and a guy with a flying head. Interesting show and it was nice to see a conclusion.
