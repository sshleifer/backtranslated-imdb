"The Classic War of the Worlds" by Timothy Hines is a very funny film that obviously strives for a long time to faithfully recreate the classic H.Goods book. Mr. Hines succeeds. Me and those who saw his film with me, I appreciated the fact that it wasn't the usual and predictable Hollywood fare coming out every year, eg. Spielberg's version with Tom Cruise who had only the slightest resemblance to the book. Obviously, everyone is looking for different things in a movie. Whoever imagines himself as an amateur "critic" only tries to criticize everything he can. Others consider a film to be more important, like being entertained, which is why most people never agree with the "critics". We liked the effort that Mr. Hines showed to be faithful to the classic novel by H.G. Wells and we found it very funny. This has made it easy to overlook what the "critics" perceive as its flaws.
