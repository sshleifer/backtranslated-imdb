I really liked the pilot, it was great as I hoped it would be, if not better. Patrick Warburton was a revolt, although at first I thought I would not be able to support his character. He and Megyn Price had little chemistry, but we hope that with the passing of the season they will feel more comfortable with each other. It must have been strange for Megyn to move from being the star of his latest show ["Grounded For Life"] to being a co-star. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson look really new to the entire Sitcom scene, but I think they will improve over time. The character of David Spade, to my surprise, was not the main focus of this pilot. The way he delivers his lines is so different from anyone else I've ever seen on TV, but I think it's just his style. It works for him. <br /> <br /> I think couples, or even singles, will be able to relate to all the doubts and struggles and be uncertain about your decisions, which this show is about. All the situations in which the characters are inserted seem real, not covered with sugar like most shows. <br /> <br /> I hope that all the actors that CBS give them a chance. This show has the potential to be one of the best series, if only given the chance and the time.
