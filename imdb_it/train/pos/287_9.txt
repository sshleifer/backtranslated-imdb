We loved the movie. I am a mother for two little men. I like having a film that can look with them where men have integrity and character. Moveis where money is not the most important thing. And families are forever and love means more than words. <br /> <br /> I wish we had seen more of the Davis family. But most of all I liked it, it left me with the same feeling that others did "please don't be finished". We both want the actors not to change. The new actors were a good substitute. <br /> <br /> Even my 9-year-old son loved this movie. he asked me to go and buy them all. He's a film critic, so for him to say this tells me something. The family should see this move buy it for friends. Helps to report a time of values. We will read the books now that we are hooked. I really hope to see more. Be blessed by moving happily
