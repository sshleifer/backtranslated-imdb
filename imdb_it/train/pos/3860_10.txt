In the Netherlands a gay writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) lectures. She stays one night with a beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and has sex with her (imagining that he is a boy). He plans to leave the next day, but takes a look at Christine's hunky boyfriend Herman (Thom Hoffman), and decides to stop by to try it. Then things get weird. <br /> <br /> A large X-branded art house in the United States in 1983. Why was X classified? Let's see ... there is strangulation, complete male and female frontal nudity, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people, a gay sex scene in a crypt ... and it's all a comedy !!!!! Paul Verhoeven did this after "Spetters". "Spetters" has been attacked by critics for its extreme sexual sequences and reported as garbage. Thus, Verhoeven filled this film with a very clear symbolism thinking that the critics would have thought it was an art and praised it. He was right! Critics adored the film not realizing that Verhoeven was playing a big joke on them. Still, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> It is beautifully filmed by Jan de Bont (now a director himself) and there is so much symbolism and obvious "hidden" levels in the dialogue that you never get bored. All the acting is great - Krabbe plays an absolutely despicable character but (somehow) makes you cheer for him; Soutendijk is simply amazing to look at and plays his part perfectly - the little smile he gives when Gerard agrees to be with her is chilling; Hoffman is extremely handsome with a large body - he deserves the credit for doing the church sequence and going with Krabbe in the crypt. <br /> <br /> This is not for people who are easily offended or weak at heart, but if you like extreme movies that playfully challenge you (like me) this is for you! At 10 all the way.
