This film is visually stunning. Who cares if he can act or not. Each scene is a work of art composed and captured by John Derek. Places, sets and costumes work perfectly to convey what you find in a love story composed of beauty, youth and wealth. Somehow I'd like to see this movie as a tribute to the story of John and Bo Derek. And ... this comment would not be complete without mentioning the role of Anthony Quinn as father, mentor, lover and his portrait of a man, of men, lost in a bygone era when men were men. There are some of us who find value in strength and direction wrapped in a trust that contributes to a sense of security, containment and security. Yes, men don't do that anymore! But then how many times do you find women made like Bo Derek.
