I voted very well for acting, not for the content. He still gives me the chills after reading the book, then watching the movie. Two former sheriffs are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from one of the well-known cons while in prison. During the race, the tension begins to rise, while the film's soundtrack adds to the general anticipation. After the killers have finished work on the farm, the next day the remains of the family are found by the daughter's friend. The cold scream, while the scene overlaps the phone with the cut rope, made me really cool the blood and made me shudder. That the murderers have met their just fate is a small comfort for this doomed family. Robert Blake was excellent in his portrait of Perry Smith. The book was also very well written by Truman Capote.
