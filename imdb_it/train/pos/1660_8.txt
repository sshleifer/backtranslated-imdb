I'm passionate about art, I like all art, I like paintings, sculptures, etc. This film shows him, so I really like it, shows how a woman wants to paint anything on art, especially on naked bodies, but she can't do it because of her severe family (father), at the beginning of the film she painted herself , but he wanted a man for his paintings, but his family did not allow her to paint naked men because he is against morale. Even so Artemisia could paint her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked. He falls in love with his art teacher and it seems that even the art teacher is absolutely in love with her, so in the end he sacrifices his freedom for her by lying. He said he raped her, but it wasn't true. Artemisia fell in love with him, but if she says she will suffer a lot, because in the process in which Artemisia, her father and the art teacher were, someone was hurting her artistic hands to tell the truth. I think this is a great film about art and an artistic love, it's worth watching. Valentina Cervi is fantastic like Artemisia, she behaves very well, I also like her performance in "The portrait of a woman" like Pansy Osmond. 8.5 / 10
