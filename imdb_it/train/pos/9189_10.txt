I would like to start by saying that after seeing this episode for the first time on DVD at 10, P.M. one night, I couldn't fall asleep until 3:00 AM <br /> <br /> This short review might contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I am a longtime fan of The Sopranos and I can safely say that this is the best episode I've ever seen. I'm not saying that everyone should feel this way, but I do. This episode is identical to the weekend I spent with my family, looking at my father, in a coma in intensive care before he passed. <br /> <br /> The episode begins with Tony in an alternate reality: he is a salesman who is the identity was mistaken for that of a man named Kevin Finnerty. <br /> <br /> By the time ten minutes had passed, I knew that Tony was dreaming, or I was watching some other show. It wasn't like the normal Sopranos and I loved it. <br /> <br /> Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony (or "Kevin") looks into the sky at a "helicopter reflector" and we see through it the goad, a doctor with a flashlight. We see it only for a moment and the sequence takes place until we return to real life in a situation similar to the one I just mentioned. <br /> <br /> Tony came out of the coma for just a moment. His boys take A.J. home and Carmella, overwhelmed by stress, break down the corridor: an emblematic moment in the episode. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the episode, we separate ourselves from the real world: the family deals with the potential negative outcome of this coma, and Tony's alternative reality, which is in parallel with what happens in his mind and in the real world that surrounds it. <br /> <br /> Then comes the stellar point in the episode: after AJ finishes telling his mother that he is a failed school, he enters and sees Meadow sitting next to Anthony. <br /> <br /> He approaches Tony, and pronounces the best part of the episode: "Anthony, can you hear us?" In Tony's world, he enters a dark hotel room and turns on a light. He takes off his shoes and goes to the phone. He tries to call, but he can't - like he's trying to say something to Carmella, but he couldn't physically take him to do it. Not yet. <br /> <br /> He sits down and looks out of his window. A sparkling light that recurred during the episode now seems to call it from the other side of the city. <br /> <br /> "When it's cold I'd like to die" by Moby fits perfectly with these latest images and helps create an exciting roller coaster of an episode. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: watch the next episode. Find out what light is. It's wonderful.
