The penultimate collaboration between director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart (excluding the few days Mann worked on Night Passage before separating himself from the star in far from friendly circumstances), The Far Country belies his traditional look to offer another portrait of a bitter man dragged unwillingly to his own redemption, fighting every step of the way. This time he is a cattle driver whose response to labor problems - challenging annoying poachers to a gunfight at the end of the path - causes his cattle to be confiscated by the undisputed judge of John McIntire of the law and order school Roy Bean. Taking them back and taking them across the Canadian border, he soon finds himself unintentionally involved in the growing conflict between the seekers and the judge while he cheats them or kills them from their claims ... <br /> <br /> While it is not the big surprise in Stewart turns towards the end, he is a surprisingly insecure critic along the way, even using his desire to be left alone to excuse not to warn a group of seekers of an imminent avalanche when he gets the chance because it's not his problem. For most of the film there is really only a breadth of hair between him and McIntire, something the judge immediately recognizes, enjoying the company of a kindred spirit even while he is genuinely planning to lynch him. In many ways, the citizens who put their trust in him probably also recognize him - despite their appeals to his better and buried nature, there is a tacit recognition that the only person who can resist the judge is almost a person bad as he is. <br /> <br /> As usual with Mann there is an exceptional use of places in the high countryside, even if for once the final showdown takes place on flat ground, and the film is almost perfectly launched with the strong support of Walter Brennan, Harry Morgan and Ruth Roman (although Corinne Calvert's young romantic interest goes towards the irritating). Unfortunately, the great cinematography of the Canadian Rockies has received few favors from a decidedly average DVD transfer, with only the theatrical trailer as an extra.
