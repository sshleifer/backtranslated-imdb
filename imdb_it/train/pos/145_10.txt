Sequel to "The Kingdom" is more bloody and even more twisted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and couldn't sit for all 5 and a half hours) but I liked what I saw. Ghosts, blood, murders, poisonings, mutated children, voodoo ... this has it all! If you have a strong stomach and you like strange movies, this is for you. <br /> <br /> Also, you don't have to see Part 1 to understand this ... you'll find out! <Br /> <br /> Does anyone know if Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting in these marathon movies in a theater is tiring. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there probably won't be a "Kingdom 3" - Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after it was shot. But you never know!
