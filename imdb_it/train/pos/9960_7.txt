I noticed that this film was being ruined long before it arrived in theaters and I didn't even have great hopes. I thought it was another kind of "You Got Served" movie with some nice dance moves and horrible acting. I was at the theater and I decided between this and Meet the Spartan and I chose this one. To my surprise, the acting was not bad at all and the film was actually quite good. The fact that he has a lower rating than You Got Served is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the garbage posted here, I suggest you go see a matinee of this movie so you don't spend too much. I think you will be pleasantly surprised at how much everyone has been wrong about it. When it comes to dance films, this is definitely one of the best with a far greater acting than many others. Go see the movie and judge yourself. We hope the score will increase after it is released on DVD and more people check the film instead of judging it based on the comments before the film was released. <br /> <br /> modification The film is approaching its correct evaluation. More than 1000 people gave a vote of 9, a little too high, but at least it helps to compensate for the ridiculous votes of 1.
