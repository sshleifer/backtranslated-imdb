Report of the Toronto Film Festival 2005 It is official; "Takashi Miike" was hit. <br /> <br /> The midnight annual screening of the new movie "Takashi Miike", "The Big Spook War" or "The Great Yokai War" or "Yôkai daisensô". Call it what you want, this is a fan race. <br /> <br /> Colin Geddes, the fearless programmer stated that this film was originally aimed at children in Japan. Think of "The Lord of the Rings" or "Infinite History" for Japan. After the screening, I can understand where they were going, but damn it, after all, is "Takashi Miike". He directed the film '01 "Ichi the Killer" when it was screened at the festival. And no, that wasn't just a marketing ploy. <br /> <br /> Graphic summary: A boy with a troubled family life becomes "chosen" and stumbles in the middle of a Great Spirit war, where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions during his journey. <br /> <br /> This is not really for children, well, not "too" young. You certainly see them scared to death with some of these spirits (even the friendly ones) on display. This is unlike anything I've seen before in a movie theater. A natural fantasy, a very funny (but obscure) material. You don't get bored you can guarantee it. Will it ever hit North America? Doubtful. <br /> <br /> My vote = B
