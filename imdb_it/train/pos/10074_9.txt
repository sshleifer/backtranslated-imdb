quotation from Nicolas Martin (nicmart) from Houston, TX: "Fine film, but" reformatted for TV "DVD, April 8th 2002 - This is a fascinating and emotional film, on the other hand, the DVD I bought was" reformatted "fit your TV" to the Columbia Tristar plates. There is no excuse not to provide the movie in widescreen format, except that Hollywood treats all movies like disposable junk that it is so used to producing. What a shame. "<Br /> <br /> What a shame (criminal!) Really. However, there is another version out though. See here for details http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare2 /kingofmasks.htm <br /> <br /> Wonderful performances by the two main actors (The King and Doggie) BTW.
