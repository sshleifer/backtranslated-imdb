When the plague broke out in New Orleans, it was Richard Widmark who came to the rescue in "Panic in the Streets", one of the less celebrated films of the great Elia Kazan. Kazan keeps the pace lively, and there are many wonderful touches - the scenes between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays his wife and the scene in the police station show family life and working life and the reports of average citizens, which is in sharp in contrast to the lives and relationships of the slums, played by a menacing Jack Palance, his weak man yes, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook and Louis Charles. There are also some interesting visual elements - Palance has a couple of scenes with actors that seem to come to their knees in height. <br /> <br /> The acting is wonderful and the dialogue strong if the story is not enough to the management and the performances. It has some questionable aspects that will be easily identified by the viewer. Apart from that, it's worth seeing. Kazan was a masterful director.
