I personally looked at this to see the footage from the 60s and 70s. It was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially began to become pop culture and an eventual intransigent force in life. Interviews with classic rock stars are titillating and fun. You feel like you're in a secret and nodding your head at the same time ... because it's so beautiful and familiar. I loved it, all the segments from the 60s - today. I highly recommend it for all aspects, including rock music, the hipper movement, politics and good history. I select the box that says it contains a spoiler, just because I have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this sense, since I discussed what's in all 4 segments, so I just wanted to be safe .
