A wonderful film by Powell and Pressburger, which I now want to explore more. The film is about what we perceive as real and real, and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from each other. Beautifully filmed and acted, although David Niven does not appear to be 27, as his character states. Funny to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This film made me think, as I watched it, and later.
