This is definitely one of Jet's best efforts. Few actors are able to interpret the stoic as Jet Li can do. The action is rapid and the special effects are strengthened for intensity purposes. As a result, Americans could take a little surprise. A little suspension of disbelief does a lot for a Jet Li movie. I feel it is an excellent introduction to the work of Jet and I look forward to more masterpieces (in particular Fist of Legend) that make it enter the US market. A good mix of firearms and physical conflicts will satisfy most action flick enthusiasts.
