When I first saw this film in the 80s, I was in my middle teenager and a little reluctant to see it since I considered myself an adult and out of the age of "Sesame Street / Muppets". I honestly can't remember if I liked it at that moment or not. However, somewhere in the university I watched this movie again, and ended up going (and staying) in my personal Best Films Ever collection. <br /> <br /> This movie is loaded with humor that goes well beyond what one would have expected from the Muppets. I mean, obviously the Muppets have always appealed to adults and children because there is a humor oriented towards both generations. But come on ... Janice is accidentally heard telling someone "I don't take my clothes off for anyone, even if it's artistic" ... there is a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with Kermit the Frog then the father does not want to hear it ... Gonzo saves a chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp?) and then says "I think we are engaged now" ... these and many other moments in the film made me roll. Add to this very clever dialogue, the clever New York / Broadway "wink wink" humor, the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really funny songs that don't come close to the "kind of kid's cheese" ... this movie is a masterpiece! I don't throw "10" on a regular basis ... but this deserves it. More than 20 years later, this film holds up totally, perhaps even more. The Muppets have never been and never will be, so funny, intelligent and simply brilliant as this film was and is. --- Q
