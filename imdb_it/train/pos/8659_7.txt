In a sense, this film reminded me of "Jumping Jack Flash". Remember Whoopi Goldberg at the shredder? Whoopi zoned tranquilizers? Whoopi as Blind Lemon and imitating Mick Jagger? Great moments captured on the film for sure, but the film still sucks, right? That's how I feel about "Rich In Love". A man hears his wife singing for the first time. Post-coitus teenagers talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney eats ice cream from the bucket and, in another scene, has a delicious waking moment about his absent wife. Alfre Woodard adds another colorful character to his acting wardrobe. But there's only the whisper of a plot here and you can't wait for it to move. Only when the Go-Go-Go 'Goes by Charlotte Caffey Le Grazie reveal a great pop song, the photo wakes up ... and then it's over! <br /> <br /> This photo is the equivalent of a lazy summer day in the deep South American.
