<br /> <br /> Have you ever felt like you were being watched, like someone checking you every move you make? Well, remember that before you decide to break the law, the FBI will always be there. At least this is the feeling one feels after witnessing the drama of the gripping but slightly sweet crime, The Story of the FBI. It traces the organization's roots from a small office to one of the most modern structures in the world (in 1959), telling the story through the eyes of one of its agents, Chip Hardesty (James Stewart). <br /> <br /> Chip had been with the FBI since day one, and he willingly puts his work above anything else in the world, even occasionally in his family. The FBI Story traces his life by describing what he does as an agent, and how being affects his personal life. The film does a spectacular job in showing what kind of cases the FBI handles and how they handle them. The public will see Chip stop the Ku Klux Klan riots, go undercover to solve an indigenous murder / real estate scandal, flee fugitives, save hostages and help fight in World War II. He also helped bring communist spies to justice. <br /> <br /> Stewart, in a vaguely complex performance, is stellar (as always) as the slightly neurotic agent who loves his job perhaps a little too much. One of the best parts of this film is that we can see the inner workings of both Chip's family life and his work. We witness him suffering from the death of his best friend and then of his son. We also observe that his wife had a miscarriage and that her marriage had a hard time. Almost all his personal problems are caused by love for his work. Vera Miles gives a surprise performance, but it is very convincing, however. She was never a brilliant actress, but there was always something very attractive and fascinating about her. Well, maybe it's just me? Unfortunately, none of the other performances deserves to be mentioned, but the story that attracts attention has managed to keep me extremely interested. <br /> <br /> The filmmaking of this film was impressive, especially the scenes in the jungles of South America. The colors all had a texture that really created the atmosphere of the film. Perhaps the most beautiful part of this film was the fabulous direction of Mervyn Leroy. Every scene was so fluid that they just came together to tell a brilliant story. It's packed with ingenious shots, some with a Hitchcock touch. <br /> <br /> All in all, The FBI Story is a spectacular but neglected film. At intervals of two and a half hours some spectators may be intimidated, but if you have the chance I suggest you skip this. I liked the spectacular show by Jimmy Stewart and the captivating story.
