I was particularly pleased that in this film Otello himself had dark skin and Desdemona had no blonde hair as almost always. The cast also played very well and I liked the script by faithfully following the original Shakespeare text. But I must say that some scenes have been interpreted too erotically for a character like Desdemona. I always thought it was very modest, and that's why it's not quite right to show it to bed with Cassio - even if it was happening only in Othello's imagination. At first, I was a little surprised even though a love scene between Othello and Desdemona had been shown so openly. But overall, I liked the film and in particular Desdemona who was crying in the scene of death.
