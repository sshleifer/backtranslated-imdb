Well, I would consider Police Story one of the best Jackie Chan movies. The plot, the fight scenes and the stunt works are excellent. In this film, Jackie himself acted as a police officer named Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions) who successfully arrested a crime lord. After the crime lord was released for lack of evidence, he framed Chan for killing a police officer. Because of this, he became wanted by the police. Later, Salina (Brigitte Lin), who was the secretary of the crime lord, went to a shopping center and started stealing the evidence of the crime of the crime lord from her computer and preparing to pass it to Chan. However, the crime lord knew that Salina had unloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her. Later, Chan appeared in the scenes and began to fight all the henchmen, defeating them one by one. In the last scene, Chan was seen punching the crime lord. Finally, this is the best action movie and comedy. Everyone should watch it Highly recommended.
