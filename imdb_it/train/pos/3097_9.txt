This show was fabulous. It was intricate and well written and all the characters were nice without being horribly sweet. Even Jonathan Cake, the boyfriend who loved to be crazy, was nice. Since our radio waves are full of crap like American Idol and Dancing with the Stars, it was nice to see a drama that wasn't too soap opera. It was always interesting to see how each character would be connected to the next circumstance. It is really annoying that we finally get a show that makes you think a little and throws it out because of a mysterious number that most of us don't even pay attention to. Some of us are not sheep. This show will be lost perhaps not by many people but by some quite faithful fans.
