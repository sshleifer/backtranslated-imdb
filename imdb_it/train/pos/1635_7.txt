in my high school days in Salina, Kansas, they shot something called "The Brave Young Men Of Weinberg" locally, and the film crews were pretty important for weeks. in the end, we learned that the film was "Up The Academy", and was a bit ummm, "lower brow" than it was led to believe. <br /> <br /> I had to see it, since I was there, and the local audience seemed less than happy with the screening. I was 17 and I thought it was a rather artless attempt in a kind of comedy "The animal house", up to the farts. <br /> <br /> I have watched it many times since then, and my opinion has softened a little. it's stupid, but sometimes it captures a bit of the humor of the "crazy" magazine, at least like most of the "Mad TV". Ron Liebman might hate it, but it's almost perfect and unforgettable. As for me, my favorite moment would have been a short scene on Santa Fe Avenue, where I had parked my car while I was buying guitar strings. Too bad the short appearance of my Pinto usually seems to be cut for TV. I haven't seen the new DVD, but if my old pinto is visible, they have a sale.
