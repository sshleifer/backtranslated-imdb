I had the TV for a white noise mate and I heard "$ 400 for a fully furnished apartment". So I came across the TV room expecting another movie from the 70s and got much more. Fortunately, I was able to rewind at the beginning (buffer DVR) and press the record button to watch it entirely. (Cinemax not cut and in HD no less!) Apart from some holes in history and improbable intermittent dialogues / events, this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch. Quite creepy and progressive at times: the character of Beverly D'Angelo masturbates in front of Alison Parker, cleverly played by Cristina Raines, Parker stabbed, very crudely, her father, an explicit menage of a trios scene. (Don't let the children watch) The film is COMPLETELY '70s full of bad clothes (polyester clothes and slimy ascots) and decorations, bad hair, over inflated music, and a familiar-looking cinematography. The cast is excellent, take a second on the home page of this film to take a look. It was a surprise to see Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young. Sylvia Miles - always wonderfully creepy! TO ENJOY!
