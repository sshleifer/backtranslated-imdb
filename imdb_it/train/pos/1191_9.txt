Robert Taylor as the crazy buffalo hunter Charlie Gilson is the main character of this film. At first I thought that Charlie would end up redeeming himself as John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart in The Naked Spur. But as the film goes on, Gilson continues to do other atrocities until he realizes that there is no hope for him. Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffalo will soon disappear and he will feel disgusted by the act of killing. Gilson is a natural killer who makes no distinction between animals or humans. Debra Paget as the Indian girl is a surprising character considering the self-imposed censorship of that time. Stay with Gilson in total resignation, even if she hates him. The last scene of a frozen Gilson is unforgettable.
