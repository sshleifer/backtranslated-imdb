Those who engage with the camera at the beginning of the century must have understood some of its potential very soon. This is a good story about a type of playboy who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the soul is its double and must face it frequently, tearing its life to pieces. There are some wonderful scenes with people that fade away and, of course, the scenes when the two are on stage at the same time. The central part is a bit boring, but Faustian history is always in the minds of the viewer. One thing I must mention is the general antipathy of people in the film. Moreover, they have practically avoided any action that would have at least given some life to the thing. I was first informed of this film about 25 years ago and finally I was able to see it. I was not disappointed.
