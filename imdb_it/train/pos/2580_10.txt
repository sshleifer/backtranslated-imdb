I say that the domino principle is a vastly undervalued film. anyone who has had time to investigate our contemporary history of conspiracies; jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace and indeed many others can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino the principle really knew what he was talking about. Perhaps Tucker could be Lee Harvey Oswald or James Rayman or sirhan Sirhan or Arthur Brremer maybe even John Hinkley or Timothy McEigh. To name a few. The conspiracy scenario involving spies, big business and political murders is not really a fiction, but a sinister part of our complicated existential history. Help us, but the domino principle is more a fact than a fantasy. If this causes a small loss of sleep, perhaps you should not trust my word, investigate for yourself.
