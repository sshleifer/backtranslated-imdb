I just finished watching this movie, which really upset me. I have also been to South Africa twice, at a time when this film is set. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a blow, and the opening scenes tend to "set the scene". The slow but steady increase in the pace barely allows for a break, and there are certainly few light moments. <br /> <br /> He will never be able to see Nigel Hawthorne again. He came across a very twisted individual and I found myself no longer enjoying him every time he appeared. <br /> <br /> Totally agree with the articulate and well thought-out comments of Steve-thomp.
