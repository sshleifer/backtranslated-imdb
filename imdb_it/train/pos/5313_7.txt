Since I'm not a fan of almost every John Waters post "Desperate Living", I got passionate about "Pecker". After emerging from the underground, Waters produced trashy versions of his previous works ("Cry Baby", "Polyester", Hairspray ") which for diehard fans seemed and tasted like watered liquor." Pecker ", who does not attempt to regurgitate the first successes, is a light, quiet and humble commentary on the whims of celebrity and the pretentiousness of the art world. Waters clearly knows this subject well because he has also exhibited and sold (at ridiculous prices) some of the most amateur pop art ever created that you can't imagine being able to give away if it wasn't emblazoned with the name of Waters. Edward Furlong looks good as "Pecker" and Waters' non-histrionic style is his comfortable with the subject.
