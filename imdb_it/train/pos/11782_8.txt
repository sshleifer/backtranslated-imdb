I don't know if this contains spoilers or not, but I don't want to risk being blacklisted until the year 3462. <br /> <br /> I do not at all agree with the comments of the spectators who described * Guns, Germs and Steel * as "politically correct" and "neomarxist". They could not have seen the same series of * I *. <br /> <br /> The series * I * has seen the history of European colonization in the Americas and southern Africa without any particular inaccuracies. I didn't see anything in the series that portrayed Europeans as bad people who turned out to be lucky, although Europeans * often * were lucky - and there's nothing wrong with luck. Nor have I seen native peoples portrayed as poor little innocent things. If nothing else, the Inca was rather arrogant, as would be expected of any leader when it comes to foreigners, if his country was not conquered by any other world power. <br /> <br /> I have seen absolutely nothing that can be interpreted as Marxist or neomarxist, except for the most incredibly elastic imagination. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, many African peoples * have * an integrated immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that Europeans are lacking. At the time when they were at the peak of their successes, the Aztec, Mayan and Inca * civilizations were * as advanced as any other in the world - and equally rich; sometimes more. The Aboriginal American and Khoi-San * populations were * decimated by smallpox and other diseases introduced by Europeans; just like the European settlers were decimated by tropical diseases like malaria. (NOTE: The Khoi-San peoples are completely different from all other peoples of sub-Saharan Africa.) <br /> <br /> So, I don't see how some of the other commentators complain. The only thing * that * I can find to complain about is that the series doesn't tell me anything I didn't know when I finished the seventh year. There is really nothing new in terms of historical information in this film. However, it presents some beautiful dramatizations of events, such as the conquest of the Incas; the production values ​​are very high; and fills some holes here and there that have not been covered in the class of social studies of the sixth hour of Mrs. Gruber at the Middle School of Milan. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy this, assuming you have had a decent primary and / or secondary education, you will not learn anything new, but you will have a pleasant and enjoyable time to review what you have already learned ( or that you should have learned) when you have attended high school.
