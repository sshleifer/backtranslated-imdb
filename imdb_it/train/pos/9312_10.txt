I really like watching this movie because of all the scary scenes of birds of prey. I like birds of prey because they are scary. My favorite parts are those in which the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the Friday 13th movie with the girl eating the banana. <br /> <br /> I really like watching a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a bit fake, but that's okay because once in the movie you don't even notice what's going on and I think it has good ending even if i don't understand what's happening on my first visions of couple i understood it over time and this is the important part. The other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you look at them for the first time. <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE BEST FILM.
