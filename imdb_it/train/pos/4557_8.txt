I thought Hugh O'Conor was as stunning as the young Christy Brown, and really deserved more recognition for his role. I couldn't believe how well the part played. Obviously Daniel Day-Lewis was also brilliant. My favorite scene is where the boys play soccer and Christy uses her head to stop the goals and then takes the penalty! Incredible performances of the two Christys (and others as well).
