Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait, I happily switched to the channel by showing this at the beginning. Pachelbel's first Canon brought a lump in my throat, then the sight of a Tiger Moth (which my grandfather, my father and I all flew) produced a slight moisture around my eyes and then Crowe's name has completely taken. I was entranced by this film, Crowe's performance (again), the topic (and yes, what a debt we owe), how the various topics, the flight sequences were addressed and treated (my father also flew Avro Ansons ), history - and, as another participant pointed out, Crowe's High Flight acting. I don't want to ruin the film for anyone, but, separated from my 4,000-odd-mile wife, as a former army officer who has been deployed in a couple of wars and as a private pilot, I admit I cry heartily a few times. Buy it, rent it, download it, send it, borrow it or steal it - but look at it. <br /> <br /> PS Have I spied a Bristol Blenheim (in yellow training colors) on the ground? It looked like a twin-engine aircraft with a twin-.303 Brownings in a dorsal turret.
