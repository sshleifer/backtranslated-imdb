After seeing and loving Greg Lombardo's most recent film "Knots" (he also co-wrote and directed this film), I decided to take a look at his previous works, and this film was worth the rent and the rent. Macbeth in Manhattan has a funny face, an excellent interpretation of Shakespeare's favorite, updated and moved to New York. I was impressed by the intelligence and intelligence underlying the script and I was impressed by the way the production plot in the film mirrors the storyline of the game itself - and very cleverly. The trials and tribulations of life in Manhattan have compared many of Shakespeare's works, and Central Park has rarely been better used than in the woods around Macbeth Castle. Mr. Lombardo obviously has a place in his heart for the stories of New York and New York (Knots is a sexy and entertaining comedy of about sixty New Yorkers set mainly in a charming Brooklyn neighborhood, with offices in Manhattan and a downtown loft in good measure) and spent considerable time around Shakespeare's plays. The film is well structured and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama at the heart of Macbeth. It reminded me of "Looking for Richard" by Al Pacino - another wonderful Shakespeare "acting in a film". I highly recommend visiting Macbeth in Manhattan.
