When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was drawn into this film, my expectations of watching the whole movie were low. The only reasons I gave a chance were the magnificent Julie Walters and a friend's recommendation. <br /> <br /> What I thought would be a broad type of "Mrs. Doubtfire" farce turned out to be a discerning comedy. Pasdar is completely believable and empathetic as the ambitious businessman who needs to free the feminine side of his being by disguising himself on occasions. It transmits these needs to the public in an absolutely credible way. Julie Walters is magnificent, like her habit, like the landlady who teaches him unconditional love.
