I must say that when "Pushing Daisies" came out, I was immediately captivated by the fairytale setting of such sadness. The narrator made a cake out of the whole ordeal making death look like a routine like, well, Ned (Lee Pace) baking cakes. And what brought them back to life was just as routine. <br /> <br /> The trio of Ned, Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) and Charlotte "Chuck" Charles (Anna Friel), as well as sometimes sidekick Olive Snook (Kristin Chenoweth, who made the musical Wicked such a pleasure) made for fantastic dialogue and stupidity. It certainly deserves the title of comedy / drama (romantic). <br /> <br /> Ned and Chuck are made for a shy couple who are not yet ready for the love that is still exploring their feelings even if they cannot touch it: an obstacle that does not seem to be really an obstacle with help like gloves, cellophane and extravagant hours around the apartment. But despite the embarrassment presented as they work their feelings around a strange secret that only a few know, they still manage to show their chemistry on the screen in moving scenes like when Ned gives Chuck the hives. Olive's presence, however, makes some break-out-in-song moments in the cake shop and unexpected complications for the couple. <br /> <br /> The second season has dropped dramatically, putting a brake on a show that had real potential. In some of the episodes, the plot was rushed and awkward, making you ask "what just happened?" both in the general plot of the dead person of the week and in the prevalent plot. The addition of Chuck's father plus two half-brothers for Ned did not help, and at least one of the plots seemed almost recycled (the "Comfort Food" episode did not seem like the "Bitter Sweets" episode in the fact that the dead person of the week died in food?). Some moving moments (the hives) were used to advance the relationship between Chuck and Ned, but each time they approached, the writers decided to launch another wrench rather than let the relationship develop (Oliver returns from the monastery, Chuck's dead father comes back to life and doesn't come back, get the photo). <br /> <br /> Too bad it didn't work, but the concept was good and seemed surreal in a good way, just enough Pleasant color / happy smiley and implausible scenarios to remind you that it's not "Dead Like Me". Then again, it's in "Pushing Daisies time", according to creator Bryan Fuller, so it makes it plausible again. <br /> <br /> It should last longer, but at this point it's just a melancholy thought. Congratulations to any new show try to replace this short-lived gem.
