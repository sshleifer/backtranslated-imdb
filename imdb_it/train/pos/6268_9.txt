Carter Wong plays a noble hero in search of a healing book that takes him in search of maximum revenge! The pace is good in this film and there are many fight scenes to keep the film going. Flying guillotines seem evil and the main villain has no problem using them. Although the story is not strong, the action is fun and takes you to the end (which I felt might have had a sequel). <br /> <br /> Campy and dark, this is great or skool kung fu !!
