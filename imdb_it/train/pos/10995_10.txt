I saw this movie at the theater when it first came out a few years ago and I really enjoyed it. But I still wanted to see it again this year to see if it's still good compared to the movies coming out now, and I want to say it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life !!!!!!!!! !!!! <br /> <br /> What you need to know is that you don't have to miss a minute of this movie, if you don't follow the action completely you will lose yourself and you won't understand the end. <br /> <br /> The end is what makes this movie so beautiful, you can't wait for it. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the producer!
