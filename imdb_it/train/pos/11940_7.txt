Like a baseball hard, this film is contrary to what I expect in a sports movie: authentic looking sports action, believable characters and an original storyline. While "Angels in the Outfield" fails miserably in the first category, it succeeds splendidly in the last two. "Angels" interweaves the story of Roger and J.P., two adopted sons of Anaheim in love with baseball, but in search of a family, with that of the woebegone angels franchise, which struggles to attract fans and win games. Driven by his dead father's promise to be a family only when the Angels win the pennant, Roger asks for heavenly help, and gets it in the form of spirits who abide in the diamond, determined to reverse the downward spiral of the franchise. And when the short-running manager George Knox (played by Danny Glover) starts to believe in what Roger sees, the team suddenly hopes to change season - and Roger and JP find something to believe. Glover in particular gives a nice performance, and even Tony Danza, who plays a washed pitcher, does well, although he clearly has a ZERO idea of ​​how to quit the windup!
