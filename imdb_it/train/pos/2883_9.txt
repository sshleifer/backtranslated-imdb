"Cinderella" is a film about a girl whose mother died and her father remarried. Once her father died, Cinderella's stepmother became very mean to her and made her do all the housework around the house, like cleaning up her two bad stepsisters. One day the king sent a message to all the single women to participate in the Royal Ball in honor of his son, to find a wife. Certainly, Cinderella didn't leave, but her stepsisters did. Cinderella was very upset and thought that there was no way she could attend the Royal Ball until her fairy godmother appeared. So he did some magic and made Cinderella a beautiful woman, but he had to come back at midnight because that's where the magic changes. While at the Royal Ball, Cinderella loses track of time and the clock marks midnight, so she runs out of the building and loses her glass slipper. So the king orders the duke to find the women wearing the shoe. The duke searched every house, but in the end he found the women he belonged to, Cinderella. <br /> <br /> Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske directed one of the best Disney animated films in 1950. This film is a magical fairy tale. At the beginning of the film Cinderella was a servant of her family and had no one to love her, but with a little magic her whole life changed and she finally found love. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing about "Cinderella" is the music. When Cinderella's fairy godmother appeared doing her magic, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a kid, it was one of my favorite songs to sing in my house, so I'll never forget it. I also loved the part when Cinderella and the Prince sang the song So This Is Love while they danced because they realized they were in love. Overall, this film was my favorite movie when I was little, because every child wants to live a fairytale life.
