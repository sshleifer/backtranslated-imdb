EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is without a doubt the funniest stand-up concert film I've ever seen. Most stand-up acts usually have periods of calm at some point, but not these people. For 90 minutes there is not a moment that is not fun apart. From the moment Eddie makes an exhilarating impression of Mr.T, the laughter is relentless. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was done in 1983, and Eddie didn't do anything as fun. It's amazing that the man who wrote this phenomenal show, wrote a movie called HARLEM NIGHTS that wasn't funny at all. <br /> <br /> Eddie, if you're out there, please go back and do a movie concert along the lines of DELIRIOUS. Believe me, your fans will love you for it. And I think you know it.
