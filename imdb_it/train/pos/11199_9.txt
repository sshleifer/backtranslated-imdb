Sometimes I get tired of reading reviews of some of Hitchcock's lesser-known films, because almost everyone starts with someone who says this movie is badly neglected or it's a hidden gem from Hitchcock or a real Hitchcock or some other generic if only - people - look - this - they - want - see - what - this - is - a - big - Hitchcock - movie - only - how - a lot - how - Vertigo - North - of - Northwest - Psycho - Rear - Window - etc. So, having said that, I would just like to say that if - only - people - would look - this - they - would see - that - this - is - a - big - Hitchcock - movie - just - how - a lot - like - Vertigo - North - by - Northwest - Psycho - Rear - Window - etc. <br /> <br /> Now, it could be a bit of an overcoming, The Ring is not even a fantasy game in the same league as all those movies mentioned above, but compared to the other films that Hitchcock did between the late 20s and early 30s, I really think that t The Ring is one of the best films photographed and performed by almost everyone. As a nearly brand new director, there are some amazing dream sequences and brilliant editing segments that show why Hitchcock was arousing so much attention early in his career. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film begins, among other things, the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus (and I use the idiot definitively, as Stephen King often does) with eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of non-whites with a more elegant appearance. I suppose this only shows how incredibly different circles and people were then, but I think it's one of the most shocking sequences of any Hitchcock movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to shoot down any man in a round, but when he meets his game, it is against a man who challenges his authority not only in the ring, but also in the ring around his wife's finger. Thus began a fun challenge, if not very tense, for a woman's love, which seems to float from one man to another without effort and without thoughts. <br /> <br /> (spoiler) There is, for example, a scene in which her husband looks at her from above as she is left at home late at night and, shortly before entering the building, she is taken back to car for a kiss. This kiss is never explained, and there is also the fact that, even at the end when he shows himself to be faithful to his husband, or at least he finally chooses him, they look into each other's eyes but in reality they don't kiss. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly well photographed, even more than many films that Hitch published in the following years. There is also a performance by Gordon Harker in the role of the One Round Jack coach who, in his expressionistic expression of stone, reminds me quite often of the brilliant Buster Keaton. Hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous, but this is a good example of his early work.
