Ah, a sailor musical by Kelly / Sinatra. So familiar, right? Yes, but that's not what you usually hear about. This is the city. But if you move, you could learn something. Ok, probably not. However, Anchors Aweigh tells the story of two sailors leaving for three or four days. Joe is the "Sea Wolf" and Clarence, the bookish type, begs Joe to give him a "lady". Now, after they have been collected from the money, they receive little Donald at home. That's where they meet Susie, that temptress, that jezebel. Just kidding! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he thinks he does. Is he right? Or is he a moron? Or is he simply misled by the company? Check out all this and more when you look at {trumpet fanfare} ANCHORS AWEIGH! <br /> <br /> P.S. If you want to see Kathryn Grayson being anything but sweet, try Kiss Me Kate (1953).
