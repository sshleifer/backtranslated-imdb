A new side of Victoria and Albert's story is animated by director Jean-Marc Valle. The superficial thought of most of the people of Queen Victoria is that of the woman who ruled for several decades and lived her life in mourning. Emily Blunt is more than capable in the title role, as she offers the public a different perspective. She portrays Victoria in her youth, ascension to the throne and early years. Blunt's Victoria both fresh and sober throughout the film. His strongest scenes are with Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All the actors behave well, including Miranda Richardson in what could be a role to throw away. <br /> <br /> Although this is not a story of dramatic strings and instructive moments of "acting", the story is still interesting enough to make it worth seeing. There are some historical freedoms that have been taken from the script, the film tries to remain faithful to the relationship between Victoria and Albert and to the social and real structure of the period. The scenery and costumes are exceptional. <br /> <br /> This film will be most appreciated by those who are attracted by history, vintage dramas, Blunt and other actors. I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> Vote: A
