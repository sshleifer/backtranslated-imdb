I'm sure many people already know the story - the miser Ebenezer Scrooge receives a visit from three spirits (the Ghosts of Christmas past, present and yet to come) that highlight parts of his life in the hope of saving his soul and changing his ways. Dickens' classic story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become the favorite of the favorite holidays. <br /> <br /> While I grew up watching the 1951 version with Alastair Sims, and I think it's the definitive Scrooge, I was impressed by this version, which was released when I was in high school. George C. Scott plays a convincing and bad Ebenozer Scrooge, and the actors who play ghosts are pretty scary and threatening. David Warner is also a good Bob Cratchit. <br /> <br /> This version is beautifully filmed and uses more modern shooting styles (for the 80s) that make it more appealing to my children than the 1951 black and white version. <br /> <br /> This is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one I look at almost every year at some point in the Christmas season.
