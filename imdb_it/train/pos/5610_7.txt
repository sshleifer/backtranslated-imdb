Roman Polanski masterfully directs this sort of variation on the same theme as Repulsion. I can't imagine that an honest film-goer won't be able to recognize the good director of Le Locataire, however both parts of the diptych may not be entirely satisfactory for most people, including myself. <br /> <br /> Polanski is very good at making us feel the inner torture of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire), starting with a certain lack of self-confidence soon to gradually turn into psychological distress which eventually blooms into an irreversible physical malaise. The travail shared by the characters and the audience is very different from the fear and tension of horror films, since there is no tangible supernatural element. While horror films allow a sort of catharsis (be it cheap or more elaborate) Polanski tortures us sadistically and, if in his last work the dark humor is permanent, we are mostly nervous about our places. <br /> <br /> Suspense, horror, all this is a matter of playing with the expectations of the public (alternatively deceiving and fulfilling them), not literally with people's nerves. In my book Rosemary's Baby is a much bigger result because pure paranoia and simple rationality are in constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange apartment, while we are forced to identify ourselves with a single character. Moreover, if the fantasy elements are all in the mind of the hero, the situation is very uncomfortable since we, the spectators, are forced to judge him, rejecting him while we were masterfully attracted ("painting") to be him.
