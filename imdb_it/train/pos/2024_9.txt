I loved this mini series. Tara Fitzgerald did an incredible job playing Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman who hides, with her young son, from a mysterious past. Like an anglophile who loves novels ... this film was just my cup of tea and I would recommend it to anyone trying to escape to nineteenth-century England for a few hours. I must also say that Toby Stephens portraying the magnificent Gilbert Markham is reason enough to watch this wonderful production.
