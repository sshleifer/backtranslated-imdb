I watched this movie I didn't expect much and didn't know much about it. I loved it. A very good and tight storyline, an intriguing hook in the shape of the ugly, fat, deaf girl and the ex-convict, and a rhythm that kept things flowing without being hasty. <br /> <br /> A much, much better film by the same director De battre mon coeur s'est arreté, which was boring and incredible. <br /> <br /> The only thing that didn't work was that the apparently ugly and fat girl was neither ugly nor fat: solid, certainly, and far from the conventionally beautiful, but with so much character on her face that he took possession of the screen every time he wore it. Superb. I wish she was in other movies, and better than she is in general. I saw a little bit of Gilles' Wife and a bit of The Mustache, and both looked crappy, and I saw all the De battre mon coeur s'est arreté, and this is certainly rubbish. It looks like some are coming out, so I'll keep my fingers crossed.
