It starts slowly, showing the sad lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, but don't give up this. Not much happens, but time passes exquisitely, and there are numerous clever jokes (my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm, which I find exhilarating). The film is wonderfully romantic in many ways, the scenery is beautiful (like Polly Walker), and the resolutions in the film are very satisfying. <br /> <br /> The film takes a couple of liberties with the film book, the biggest being with the Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester business, but I actually preferred the film version of this (it could be more sentimental, but I felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story, and in any case I like the feeling when it is well done). <br /> <br /> An excellent film, especially as a movie for appointments during bad weather.
