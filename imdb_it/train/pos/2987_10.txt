This is the whimper that the Beaches never were. As much as I wanted to love the beaches, it always seemed too rushed for me to "hear" (its soundtrack is still one of my favorite albums). Stella, on the other hand, moves at a slower pace (and sometimes too slow) and even if she is a bit manipulative in her story which induces tears on a self-sacrificing mother, it works because Bette and the rest of the cast they turn into great shows. 10/10
