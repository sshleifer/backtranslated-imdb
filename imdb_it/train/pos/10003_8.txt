This is not the typical Mel Brooks movie. It was a lot less crap than most of his films and actually had a plot that followed. Leslie Ann Warren made the film, she is a fantastic and underrated actress. There were some moments that could have been enriched a little more, and some scenes that probably could have been cut to make the room for it, but all in all, this is worth the price to rent and see it. The acting was good overall, Brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking directly to the public. Once again, Warren was the best actor in the film, but "Fume" and "Sailor" both played their parts well.
