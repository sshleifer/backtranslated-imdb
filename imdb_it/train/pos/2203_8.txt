I also loved this series when I was a child. In 1952 I was 5 and my family always watched this show. My favorite character was the one played by Marion Lorne as a rather stuttering, clumsy and very lovable "aunt" type person. I can still remember his "ubba bubba um um" comments as if he were trying to say something important. And then when she came back and played Aunt Clara in Bewitched it was an exceptional casting! <br /> <br /> It was the first time I remember seeing Walter Matthau, whose career I followed as a fan for many years. <br /> <br /> I have a question if anyone can verify: was the title or the music of the credits is the "Swedish Rhapsody" by Hugo Alfven? Every time I hear him play in my classic radio station here in southern California, he brings back memories of the image of Mr. Peepers walking away with his back to the camera. I'm not even sure if this image in my mind is correct.
