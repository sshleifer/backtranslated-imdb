I can't believe that this movie currently has a score of 6.9. In any case, this film was probably one of the most touching films of Indian films I've ever seen. It was really nice to see a film showing traditional family cinema. As for the story, I thought it was nice that it was shahid kapur about a marriage combined with amrita rao. He's kind of a lucky guy, while Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle, but the only problem is that her cousin doesn't seem to have as much attention as her aunt does. Amrita with passion. This upsets Amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her. It was also very moving to see that even though Amrita's family was not as rich, perhaps only the middle class for the lower class, while the Shahid family was rather high class, they still treated their family with respect and did not even ask for put them down hit a nerve with me. This is because I have seen people being very rude to people who are not so good at thinking that they are inferior to their standards which I think is very superficial. This film showed that Shahid's family was willing to look at the great values ​​that Amrita had been brought up to and turned a blind eye to the fact that she was not a wealthy bourgeois business or anything. All in all this film deserved an 8/10. I wish more and more of these films were made.
