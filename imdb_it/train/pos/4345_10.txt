No wonder this film won 4 prices, it's a film that sticks to any soul, it's not a wonder why Paul Reiser took 20 years to surrender and talk to Peter Falk about his idea. I can understand every part of it, this is a movie that will make you cry just a tear, or thousands. <br /> <br /> Story: 10/10 When Sam Kleinman receives a letter from his wife about her letting him find something else that his son and he take out on a trip to find her, and while they do they find something lost, friendship, family and mutual affection. At first you know what's going to happen, but no one, apart from the story, is not so easy to understand from beginning to end, it's a transition between a father and his son, and a husband and his wife. It is no wonder that Paul Reiser spent 20 years writing this beautiful love story / comedy. <br /> <br /> Actors: 10/10 Well, you can't say anything other than what I'm about to say, hey is with Peter Falk in it, it's a legend everything he does in movies is magical, when you use Peter Falk in a love / comedy story what do you think you have? A perfect result, it's no wonder this film is perfect and has won many prices. Since his son Paul Reiser does an excellent job, even if he is not a great actor, this does not mean that in reality this did not work. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser play the perfect Father and Son, the rest of the cast is good enough but you don't see them that much, just say they do what they have to make it shine even more. <br /> <br /> Music: 10/10 It doesn't always work when you use music sometimes it's not good but it's not the thing in this film, the music is perfect in tune, makes the film even more compelling. This part of the film will shine like the other parts, a fantastic soundtrack for a Romance / Comedy for sure. <br /> <br /> In general: 10/10 There are so many movies on Romance / Comedy tapes, DVDs, Blu-ray and what not, but this film is one of the special ones. it doesn't happen every day that you can create a story like this, it takes years to think about it and the fact is that in reality what it takes to make it, a big piece that should be bought and kept in the human soul, to see it when it becomes old and you see it with your father in old age, I think this film will shine like no one else ever made.
