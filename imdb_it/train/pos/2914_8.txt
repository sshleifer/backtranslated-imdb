Not many Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) films have been made, but this is one of them and it's pretty damn good. Just a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place in NAS Lakehurst's marine blimp operations (as NAS Tustin). Wallace Beery plays a nice but elderly Trumpet head of Munchausen, an enlisted pilot whose stories are so high that they become so frequent that nobody really believes him. Half the fun is approaching the end of the film when events begin to show that most of his most extravagant stories are true. <br /> <br /> Set during World War II, the main plot revolves around a Trumpet bachelor who courts a local widow only to end up having a father-son relationship with the widowed paralyzed son, Jess. Having said that he would never have walked without crutches from doctors, the Trumpet chief pulls some ropes and a surgeon on board the Navy helps restore the boy's paralyzed leg. Jess then joins the Navy to become a flight officer, flying airships to Lakehurst and facing a new set of challenges. <br /> <br /> A very well done film, even if not without a clear Hollywood dialogue that the technical consultants slipped past and Beery's apparent inability to march in step. Otherwise, this film gets good marks for technical precision and offers a rare glimpse into the LTA operations of the Navy. The cash register scene, an exchange between Trumpet and Jess's future love interest, Cathy, is a blast.
