Arthur is a middle-aged "boy" who drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he hears and says whatever comes to mind. He likes to brag about his riches and knows he is a spoiled brat. He spends money on people he doesn't know and finds it fun. Arthur must marry a high-class girl to inherit a great fortune, but falls in love with a poor maid Liza Minnelli (she looks really weird). <br /> <br /> This is a damn funny movie. I saw this movie because a famous Indian film "Sharabee" is based on the character of Arthur. Although "Sharabee" is definitely inspired by "Arthur", I think they are two different films. 'Arthur' is just fun. It's very trivial sometimes. There are so many fantastic liners in the film. It is not a riot of laughter but it has fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fiance's father and continues to talk about "moose". Duddley Moore certainly has comedy times. He is very good at words and body language. I loved the scene where he talks to a couple sitting in a hotel in a "small" town and continues to talk with husband and wife in two different directions. John Gielgud got an Oscar for this film. I don't know that actor. I don't think he did a great job, but it could be if I watched more of his work than I could agree in the future. The film has some flat but not very long patches. I can't wait to watch the sequel.
