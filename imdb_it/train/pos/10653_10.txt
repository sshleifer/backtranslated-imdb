I know it's fashionable to hate this movie now. I have seen hundreds of ghost movies including the original Haunting of 1963 and most of Hammer's films. This film is not limited and does not tolerate at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it. Yet many viewers can take out-of-control movies like Scream because knife killers are easier to believe for most people than demons or ghosts. In reality this film had many fantastic scenes and the special effects and performances were fantastic. I've seen it 15 times and it gets better every time. The director of this film has made numerous interesting and elegant films and has not sought the kind of realism of the sixth sense. The Haunting lets go and it's certainly not boring. Perhaps this film could attract more John Carpenter fans but more of a traditional storyline. Even the old Haunting was a good 1963 film. It was even scarier. See both and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.
