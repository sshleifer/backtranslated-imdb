A very funny, very imaginative and filmic fairy tale, all in one, Stardust tells the story of a young man who lives outside a fantasy world who goes there to recover some of a fallen star only to discover that the star is alive, young and beautiful. A kingdom whose king is about to die said that the king unleashed a competition among his many children to see who can recover a ruby ​​before being king, while a trio of witches wants the star to trim itself and use it to keep them young. These three threads of the plot are woven together in a complex way throughout the film, mixed with good acting, dazzling special effects and a solid feeling and humor. Stardust is a fun movie and has some fun performances by the likes of Claire Danes as the star (I could fix it for a while) to Michelle Pfeiffer (I could look at her with even more magical powers) playing the horrible witch to Robert Deniro who perfectly interprets a fashionable air pirate. Charlie Cox as the protagonist Tristan is affable and credible and we get a great job from a group of kids who play children like kings who constantly and constantly try to kill each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng and Ruppert Everett interpret their roles well both in life and in death (also loved this whole thread). Peter O'Toole plays the dying assassin dad and looks at the funny man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the whole film in his five minutes (nice feet). But the real power in the film is the novel by Neil Gaiman and the script based on his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works.
