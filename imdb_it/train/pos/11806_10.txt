Everything was better in the past days. Even children's television. And Fraggle Rock proves my point quite easily. At the time of writing this comment I am fourteen, but even in my teenage years I cannot resist the charm of Fraggle Rock. For those of you who have really lived under a rock (haha!), Fraggle Rock speaks of a horde of playful and stupid creatures called Fraggles that live - incredibly - in a rock. But they are not the only creatures. The rock is inhabited by many other species such as the industrious Doozers and countless living plants. Outside the rock, on the one hand, the inventor-scientist Doc and his dog Sprocket (who later befriends Gobo Fraggle) live, on the other side a family of Gorg-presumed sovereigns of the Universe. The five main Gobos of Fraggles (fearless leader), Mokey (arty and peaceful), Wembley (undecided and Gobo's friend), Boober (a pessimistic domestic god) and Red (he loves everything related to sport and the general grit) make each episode take in some strange situations and at the same time sing and dance their worries. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock is definitely a family show - plots can have intricate details that children might not follow well, but the song - dance and dance routines will hold their attention. The characters are strong and funny, their credible conflicts and their thrilling adventures. The Gorgs are scary, Doc and Sprocket light up, the uncle Traveling Matt is hilarious (the postcard segments are very '80s!) And the final episode, Change of Address, really touching. Let's go back to Fraggle Rock!
