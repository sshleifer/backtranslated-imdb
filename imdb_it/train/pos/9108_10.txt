A true story of a true revolution, April 25th; a revolution against a repressive regime of 41 years, which was imposing a colonial war on its military, to maintain an empire (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cabo Verde, S. Tom√© and Principe, the first and last of the great colonial empire of Europe) of 600 years, since the conquest of Ceuta is beginning in 1415; an army revolution for the people and for a democratic Portugal; the most surprising fact in this revolution is that there were no people killed (except those who died in the hands of PIDE, the state political police, during a brutal firearm against an unarmed crowd protesting in front of its headquarters in the day of the revolution, on 25 April 1974, he has the show in the film). And he has all the revolutions his heroes, one of which was Captain Salgueiro Maia, a soldier returned from the war, whose convictions along with the rest of the army, was that they were fighting (since 1961) a hopeless war, and that sometimes a soldier must disobey his country.
