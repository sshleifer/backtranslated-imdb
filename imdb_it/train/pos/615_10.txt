This is the epitome of the fairy tale! The bad guys are completely evil and the heroes are pleasantly refreshing. Danes, Deniro and Pfieffer are wonderful as is the new actor who plays the role of Tristan. Extraordinary shows, delicious, fun and dramatic magic, and a perfect fairy tale ending make this film absolutely fabulous! I'm not so sure that all the content is appropriate for younger children, but for a larger audience there are lots of hilarious subtleties! The previews do not do justice to this movie! My fiance and I were rather skeptical, but we were so excited that we took the opportunity for this film, which I can only hope to assure anyone on the fence of this film to try it!
