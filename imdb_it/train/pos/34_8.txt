What a funny movie! If you are a fan of Yellow, Red Queen Kills 7 Times is a real winner. To begin with, it's hard to go wrong with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Yellow. Both are wonderful - especially the innocent Bouchet with his eyes wide open like the woman guilty of guilt who fears for his life. The killing scenes in Red Queen Kills 7 Times are particularly beautiful and contain enough blood to make the fans happy. One of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really starts the film. The killer, The Red Queen, is one of the most amazing and interesting killers I've ever seen in an Italian film. The sets and fashions of the 70s are wonderful. In fact, all the images are interesting with the laughing Red Queen crossing the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film. The twisted plot has kept my interest all the time. Finally, the soundtrack by Bruno Nicolai could be the best that the composer has ever listened to. The main theme is so memorable that I haven't been able to get it out of my mind for two days. <br /> <br /> The only two problems I have with Red Queen Kills 7 Times come at the end of the film. First of all, the person responsible for the murders is too easy to identify. If you have seen more than one pair of Yellows, you will have no problem determining who is behind the killings. Secondly, the ending feels a little too rushed and, therefore, is a bit confusing. I'm definitely not one who needs every point of the plot, but I admit I can't explain everything. A second vision could clarify this.
