This is a great Spanish film, but I am worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the Spanish Civil War was or when it was fought. Being a history teacher, I had a big advantage, but I could easily see how the film could be confused until you put all the pieces together. I doubt this would be a big concern in Spain where this film was made, but for other viewers it could be a bit confusing until later in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with 12-year-old Carol and her mother who returns to her mother's hometown. It's been years and you gather that they are coming to Spain from New York City. Despite the oddity, Carol speaks fairly good Spanish and much of the film is about how she fits. Regarding why she and her mother are alone, I will now scatter it for those who do not understand the fact that Carol's father is fighting in the war on the side of the Republicans (who eventually lost in this bloody conflict). <br /> <br /> The film gets an exceptional score for its beautiful work with the camera and music. The rather slow and rambling rhythm is not bad as long as you are someone who can accept films in this way. I have seen many other Spanish films about this war and this compares quite well to them - not better or worse - just a fair slice of life films on those who have fallen behind as well as a good aging film. /> <br /> PS - If you don't know which way it is, the Republicans were mostly socialists, supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico, as well as volunteers from many countries (including the United States). The nationalists were led by Franco and helped by Portugal and the fascist states of Germany and Italy.
