Super Mario 64 is without doubt the biggest game ever created. It's so addictive that you can play for hours and hours without stopping for a break. I beat the game 4 times, but I never got all 120 stars ... (I got 111) ... but I hope to reach them at the end. Although I didn't officially play this game until I was seven, I enjoyed watching my sisters play it. Now I am 13 years old and still playing, erasing the games and starting over. <br /> <br /> The graphics are incredible for a game of the first N64. The gameplay is compelling. The controls are fantastic. The levels are difficult, but not impossible. Bowser's fights are challenging. <br /> <br /> I'd like to tell you more, but why don't you take it for yourself? Put away X-BOX 360, PS3 and Wii and go find yourself a Nintendo 64 and play this fantastic, wonderful game.
