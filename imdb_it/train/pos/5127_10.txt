Okay, so I've already come a long way from Houston, but every time I see this movie, I find myself dreaming of a little cowgirl for a day riding the bull by Gilley. (It burned before I drank.) <br /> <br /> If you grew up in eastern Texas, then you know that this film is an accurate representation of contemporary life at that time. If you didn't trust me and watch the movie. Or you will join the many who love him (and at the same time strangely rejected), or at least, you can make fun of the red hills. (There is a lot of material for fun.) This film does not try to be P.C. (what was in the 80s) or hiding the white garbage item and is honest about the time and place. <br /> <br /> I have to be a 10 for me!
