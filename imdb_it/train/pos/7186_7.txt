There have been many Zorro films made over the decades, but it's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least viewed. <br /> <br /> Zorro's Legion Lotta is a little different from Zorro's other films. First of all, it's a serial Republic in 12 chapters. And this time, Zorro is not played by a studio star like Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas, but instead as an actor like Reed Hadley. While Hadley does not have such a strong presence on the proceedings as the others, he does an adequate job, helped by the fact that he is not the only hero here; as the title suggests, it has a fighting legion to call back. <br /> <br /> Another big difference is that the setting is not California. The story takes place here in central Mexico in 1824, where a man posing as a living god incites the Indian indigenous population and a band of outlaws to help him in his plan to overthrow the newly established Mexican Republic. Something, Zorro and a handful of followers plan to do everything they can to stop. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, there is at least an incredibly exciting moment per episode, from a twang bow sound effects to ridiculous acting. But overall, this represents one of the best serial of the Republic of all time, and probably the best of Zorro. <br /> <br /> The plot is stronger than most magazines and never becomes unintelligible or tortuous. action - fans of Indiana Jones films will see MANY bits borrowed from this serial.
