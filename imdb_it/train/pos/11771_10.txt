Great entertainment from start to finish. Wonderful shows of Belushi, Beach, Dalton and Railsback. Some twists and lots of action scenes. The film was made for me! Funny lines in the script, good music. Dalton as the hard sheriff and Railsback as "redneck-villain". I have to recommend this movie to every action-adventure fan! 10/10
