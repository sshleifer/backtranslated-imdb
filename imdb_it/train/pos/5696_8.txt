What do you do with a 14-inch dog porn star who has been involved in drugs and murders and then died of AIDS? Make a movie, of course. The probable reason why it was not presented previously is the fact that Eddie Nash would have interfered in his production. So it is no coincidence that the film was released shortly after Nash was sent to prison. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is its fast pace. No time wasted on useless crap. And why should it be? There is too much good material here to request opaque fill scenes. The cast is good. Kilmer was mediocre in a series of films, so here was finally a role quite suitable for him. Bosworth is cute so the way he acts (it's solid) is irrelevant, and McDermott, who is otherwise rather boring, is pretty good, largely because he wears so many facial hairs that I didn't recognize him at first . (I wish they would do it to Cruise in every movie, so I shouldn't have looked at his stupid face.) I didn't absolutely recognize Christina Applegate, and I wouldn't have known she was in it, if I hadn't seen her name in the credits. . Kudrow is fascinating as always, a little unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (Btw, "Friends" is the worst TV sitcom of all time.) The only casting choices that were questionable were a first close cameo by Carrie Fischer and the totally absurd inclusion of the 90s idiot Janeane Garofalo. You thought I would also include Paris Hilton, right? No, I think Hilton is the ideal choice in her 10 second appearance as a dumb bitch. Why does the film speak of decadence, among other things ?? and on a porn actor ?? she fits perfectly.
