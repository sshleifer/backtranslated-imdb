I doubt that much of this film is based on a true story. At first it says based on a true story, a kind of. I bet the only truth is that there was a former bounty hunter model called Domino. <br /> <br /> Anyway, start with Domino talking to Lucy Liu, who works for the FBI. Domino is questioned about what he knows about a $ 10 million theft. Through flashbacks, we see Domino as a child, then as a model, and interested in being a bounty hunter. In practice he tells 2 other bounty hunters, Ed and Choco. They let her enter the group. It is hard, can use any type of weapon and will use its good looks if necessary. <br /> <br /> They are involved in a scam that Clarmont, a bailsman, is going on. Along the way, the group starts a reality show, and this is where Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green come into play. They are a bit like the hosts and have to be really eager to appear in this. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was funny and had some laughs. The assembly didn't bother me. There is also a lot of violence, mainly using guns and blood. It may have been a little shorter. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: good enough to look at.
