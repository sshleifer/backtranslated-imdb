This is great! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have teamed up to create a powerful and very influential film. This is the true story of the first US Navy diver and the obstacles he faced to get his certification from a racist diver. Along the way, he must also face the old bigotry of all his classmates, none of whom want him in their class. They leave the barracks when it arrives. In the end, he gets the certification and continues to have a great career as a diver on the US Navy. Watch this! It's a great story of courage and honor. As the story unfolds, we can see racism slowly dissipating and everyone begins to respect men one at a time.
