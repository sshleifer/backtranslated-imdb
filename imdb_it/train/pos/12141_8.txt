Of the three remakes of the W. Somerset Maughan novel, this is the best, and not particularly because what John Cromwell brought to the film. The film deserves a visit due to the break with the performance of Bette Davis, who like Mildred Rogers showed the film industry to be a star. Finally, his fight with Jack Warner and his studio paid off. <br /> <br /> The film is dominated by Mildred from the beginning. We realize from the beginning that Mildred is not interested in Philip and never will. He does not hide his contempt for this kind soul who has fallen in love with the wrong woman. He will be humiliated again by Mildred, and again, since he does nothing for what he really is. <br /> <br /> Poor Philip Carey, besides being a handicap, is a weak man. When she tries to hold on to Mildred, she rejects him. It is when Mildred comes back to him, when he is fragile and defeated, that he gets the chance, overcoming his addiction to this terrible woman who has stolen his will and his manhood. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis gives a fantastic portrait of Mildred. This was one of her best roles and she got away with it. His disgust with the Philip type is clear from the beginning of their relationship. When she tells him that he washes his mouth after he kisses her, it's one of the most powerful moments in the film. Leslie Howard underperformed Philip and made him look even weaker than he. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen, are seen in minor roles. <br /> <br /> This is the Bette Davis show, and don't forget it!
