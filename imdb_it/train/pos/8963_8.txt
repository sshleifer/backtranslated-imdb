The success of John Van Druten Broadway is brought to the screen with a maximum of stellar power in this romantic fantasy about a modern witch who seduces a successful publisher in Manhattan. James Stewart could get the maximum billing, but it is Kim Novak who steals the show as one of the most fascinating witches who has ever cast a spell on the movie screen. Head coupling is, in effect, one of the few weaknesses of the film: the gray-haired Stewart seems a bit old for the role, and while it's easy to see why she falls in love with Novak, it's a little harder to understand what do you find attractive about him, since they seem to disagree with temperament and vision. (It is one of the funny beliefs of history that witches and sorcerers are portrayed as beatnik and bohemian in Greenwich Village.) Strangely, the combination Stewart-Novak would generate much more warmth in "Vertigo", published the same year as this film, but then "Vertigo" has a story of compelling suspense, and the benefit of directing by Alfred Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> The film's comic moments are mostly provided by the star support cast, including a young Jack Lemmon (like Kim's wizard brother), Elsa Lanchester (their ditzy aunt), and Ernie Kovacs (!) As a confused writer. Hermione Gingold even appears in a hilarious cameo as a kind of Great Witch. There is a lot to appreciate in this film - wit, romance and a great cast - that is, if you can perhaps look away from the charming Miss Novak. I've seen the movie a half dozen times and never can.
