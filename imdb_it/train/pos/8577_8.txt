I think Hollow Point is a fun movie with some good moments that I've never seen before in action movies. Well, both Tia Carrere and Thomas Ian Griffith are not very good at acting, but Tia Carrere is a pretty and good-looking girl, isn't she? But Donald Sutherland is superb in his crazy gangster role.
