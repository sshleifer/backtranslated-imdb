This film, recently voted as a public favorite at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival, is inspiring and moving. A famous conductor, forced to retire due to illness, returns to the small village of his birth to become the leader of the church choir, and finally finds fulfillment in his music. Drawing on Swedish traits to keep things inside and the insular character of a small Swedish village, this film develops each of its characters well. superbly directed, recited and sung, he brought tears to many eyes and smiled at all. We hope he will find the distribution in the United States. <br /> <br /> If you can, watch it!
