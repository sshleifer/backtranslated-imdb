This is a film that the mainstream market will probably never be able to access as it doesn't exactly give the observer easy to watch. The story of the tormented Spike and his friend Heaton isn't exactly a Friday night movie, but it has its unique side and I found out it was fun. There are moments of genius as the film was shot on such a low budget, like when Spike inhales the aerosol. However, I didn't really understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton and to be honest he made me spend most of the film trying to solve it. And I didn't like the fact that most of the film is spent with two friends talking and not much "action". It is a small film that is complex to look at and this is what makes it attractive.
