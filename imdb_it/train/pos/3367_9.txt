This film has a fantastic acting, a fantastic photograph and a very strong plot that really makes you think about who you are, how you define yourself, how you adapt, whether you agree to play a role or get rid of ... There are already excellent comments on these aspects. I want to comment on the film's formal setting. Basically, it's two people on a roof. There is unity of space and time, with 2 protagonists, and the radio that acts as a choir. Many directors have transformed Greek tragedies into films, many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a Greek tragedy, but no director, in my opinion, has succeeded equally as Ettore Scola in approaching the purity and strength of the great Greek tragedies both in plot and in the formal setting. A masterpiece.
