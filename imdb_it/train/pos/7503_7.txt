The film was ok, quite funny. The cast was pretty good, and I according to what the comment before me mentioned - Glenn Quinn was great and he alone is reason enough to watch this movie. He played the "evil" egoist and the band manager brilliantly! <br /> <br /> There are a lot of songs played by "Beyond Gravity" in this film, but this is not really a surprise considering the film is a VH1 production. However, if soft rock / pop music is not appreciated by anyone, you could also project those scenes forward. <br /> <br /> The plot of a band trying to get to the top of LA but having to overcome many obstacles on the road are not too original, but rather fun, with some surprising plot that turns here and there.
