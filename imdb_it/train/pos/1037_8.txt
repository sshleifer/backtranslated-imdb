"A malefactor is often a man who has left something ruined, not always the one who did something." - Emperor Marcus Aurelius <br /> <br /> The DVD release of "Watch on the Rhine" could not have come at a better time Restore for us a great Lillian Hellman show adapted to the screen by Dashiell Hammett (l audio scholar of Bernard F. Dick, a scholar of Hellman, affirms his paternity). It features a subtle performance by Bette Davis, who took on a subdued secondary role long after she became the queen of the workhorse in the Warner Bros. lot. It is equally significant, reminds us that the Second World War had a purpose. Of course, you say, as if we needed it. We listened to Cary Grant acting in "Destination Tokyo" (1943) about Japanese boys and their Bushido knives. We saw the boots trampling the living hills in "The Sound of Music" (1965). We did a tour in England, without stopping, occupied by Germany in "It Happened Here" (1966). And yet, to say it, we still need the message to spread. <br /> <br /> I have an 81-year-old friend who regularly curses Franklin Roosevelt. He believes that FDR has conniving the United States in a foreign struggle that we did not need, thus causing the death of his favorite cousin. He is encouraged in his demonization of allied leaders and the trivialization of the Second War by Patrick Buchanan. <br /> <br /> The political editorialist has just released a large heavy book with detailed research that claims that Adolf Hitler would not have posed further threats in Poland, Europe, or the world if only the Third Reich had been delivered to the Free City of Gdansk in 1939. Buchanan argues that if those Polish egoists had not confronted the Nazis, foolishly drawing from Britain and frugal altruistic France, no war would have engulfed the West. He believes that without the rigors of Total War, no one in Germany would have built gas chambers to provide a final solution to the Jewish problem. <br /> <br /> Some commentators on this site feel that "Watch" is lowered under the weight of stale propaganda. Could be. However, neither my friend nor Pat Buchanan seem to have understood the point of the film: some people hurt and kill to grab the land, property and freedom of other people; these people dominated the Axis Powers and "enough" did not appear in their vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas deserved the Oscar he won. He and Bette Davis put a compelling passion into their portraits of refugees fighting the oppressors. They give an emotional punch to the intellectual case to get out of the margins, to actively confront torturers and murderers. Bernard Dick notes that Hellman has not bothered Lukas as a person since he remained apolitical. Obviously, as a Hungarian, he had seen the bloody "dictatorship of the proletariat" of Bela Kun replace an outmoded empire and then fall into the right-wing tyranny of Admiral Horthy. <br /> <br /> In a wonderful added cameo role for Hammett's drama, Henry Daniell sardonically describes a Wehrmacht officer in the class who disdains the brown shirts he serves. His Phili von Ramme would undoubtedly be with Field Marshal Rommel in 1944 during the July 20 plot against Hitler. In April 1940, however, he pragmatically promoted the Nazi cause, although he insulted Herr Blecher "the Butcher" and despised the Romanian aristocrat Teck de Brancovis for trying to spread information about an underground leader. <br /> <br /> Teck, a poor and a possible cuckold, cash wishes and a visa to return to Europe where he can take back the shreds of a life that had been canceled with the Great Empire War and the major economic Depression world. He has no political conviction, no scruples about trading a freedom fighter for his tomorrow. George Coulouris, a graduate of the Mercury Theater, gives this exhausted cynicism the cynicism of the Old World a thread of desperate threat. <br /> <br /> Lucille Watson gives compelling vitality to the mistress of the man who grabs her, an overbearing elderly girl who knows her mind and takes it - but who doesn't adequately appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home who controls. She and her pale son linked to the office belong to the American version of the privileged type of von Ramme and de Brancovis. However, this family has not seen ruin and will never do it. They are people paid by money who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it. <br /> <br /> This mother and her son could easily make choices that reflect the lament for National Socialism and fascism that flourishes today in my friend and pundit Buchanan. "Watch on the Rhine" has an aspect of the cured period. His dialogue reflects his erudite origins on the stage rather than seeming fresh from the streets. Yet the Hellman and Hammett movie has a gut-based power. The public still needs to hear and listen to its call to arms against the unstoppable marchers.
