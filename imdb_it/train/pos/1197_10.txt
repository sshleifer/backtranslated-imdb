I just saw this movie, by mistake. What a little gem. This film made in 1956 seems, and seems, a film of the seventies. And it is actually better, more sober and correct than, say, Blue Soldier. Environmental and anthropological subtitles are ahead of their time. Minimized cinematography is superb and terribly realistic. Much more than Dances with Wolves, The Last Hunt manages to convey the appearance of the "murderous" buffaloes of the late 1800s. Probably because those in the film were real death camps. The film was shot during legal forestry and directed buffalo killing, so the animals you see were actually shot, the bones are real. In conclusion, an undervalued western masterpiece, superbly performed, directed and filmed.
