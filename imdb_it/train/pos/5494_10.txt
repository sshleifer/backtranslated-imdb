With partial reconstruction and direct shooting, the filmmakers made a formidably clear documentary about a coup against President Chavez in Venezuela, organized by a foreign secret service and fully supported by the rich Venezuelan minority, the political opposition, the Church (cynical laughing cardinal) and the US government. It was another chapter in the history of US foreign policy, which Steven Kinzer called "overthrow" or "sow democracy in the American style". In reality, this intervention in support of foreigners was not only a coup against President Chavez, but also against the democratic majority that elected him. <br /> <br /> That this is a brilliant documentary is strongly confirmed by violent reactions for and against it on the Internet. As St. Augustine said: "Men love the truth when it bathes them in its light; they hate it when it turns out to be wrong." <br /> <br /> This film is a must see for all those who want to understand the world in we live in.
