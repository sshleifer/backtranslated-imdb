"Girlfight" follows a project that hosts the New York high school girl from a sense of futility in the amateur boxing world where she finds self-worth, purpose and much more. Although the film is not about boxing, boxing is all about the film. So much so that you can almost smell the sweat. Technically and artistically a good shot with a sense of honesty and reality about it, "Girlfight" is not a girl's movie and no "Rocky". It is, rather, a very human drama that even spectators who do not know boxing will be able to connect.
