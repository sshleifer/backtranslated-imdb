A patchwork on 911. The 11 stories of 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (the first, for example), sometimes they said to the Americans "we had more deaths than you and you supported the killers", sometimes really strange (but highly symbolic and interesting). I really loved Claude Lelouch (personal live of a couple in New York, showing that our daily "problems" are not important), Shoei Imamura (bizarre, strongly anti-war in general) and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny, typical African optimism despite the terrible daily suffering), and Youssef Chahine (Egyptian intellectual, in favor of peace, with moral difficulties to accept US policy towards the Arab countries) I am really happy to see that many Americans liked this film. It shows that we (or they, are still Belgian, but have been living in Texas for 12 years) are still interested in other cultures and able to question the past and present actions of our government, as we should do in a democracy.
