Wow, I loved this movie. It may not have had the funding and publicity that the latest Hollywood hits have taken, but it contains twice the emotional blow. The story revolves around this Utah family and is the link between the people in the family who provide the film with his fist. The main protagonist (Giovanni Ribisi) plays his part very well, at no time does he let you believe he is acting in all his feelings. It's his brother (Elias Koteas) who stole the show for me though. When the two were in scenes together they delimited their lines from each other, giving fantastic performances. Great cast, great movie.
