This movie is great fun. I advise you to watch it by yourself and then watch it again with your friends. I did last night and it was fascinating how much Norma Khouri could attract everyone in her world! I felt a little strange watching my friends go through the same roller coaster I did the first time. But everyone thanked me and loved the movie. You know it's a great movie if you spend 2 hours after the movie talks about the movie! <br /> <br /> I once saw a crook almost on Nora Khouri's level, but not near the ring of the same size. He tricked very naive and rich people into my old Berkeley CA A.A. group where everyone trusts everyone else. He would "sponsor" only people who seemed to be doing very well. Who knew he would steal more than 100k (in 1987 when it was real money) after being in the city for only 1 month. His victims were as fragile as they were in their first month or week of being sober. He was evil with a big laugh and a big smile on his face. <br /> <br /> The crime reported above is nothing compared to what Norma Khouri did to her old neighbor. But I don't want to give anything. <br /> <br /> I found it one night on a late-night TV channel, "Showtim", I think. This is always a great experience for movie fans to be totally fooled into seeing something and having their minds blown away. Just drag your friends to see this and tell them nothing. It's a very funny film, it moves quickly and it never bores you. <br /> <br /> This should be an international classic for all time. I believe that all the great films eventually reach the top. The weather will be very good with this film. I'm just sorry no one has heard of it yet, in a way that makes surprises even better. <br /> <br /> The director and editor were fantastic. They deserved to win the best documentary. <br /> <br /> JUST WATCH THIS FILM!
