I like Peter Sellers, most of the time. I had never seen him portray high-class English until this film. He pulls it pretty well, even if the mix shows pieces by Inspector Clouseau. It doesn't get interesting until Goldie Hawn arrives. <br /> <br /> I never expected young Hawn to offer such solid performances. His times were great and his expressions were priceless. The way she alternately shoots the lascivious character of Sellers and seduces him is beautiful to look at. Verbal shootings like the ones I rarely saw in a film of the time. <br /> <br /> The last thirty minutes of the film fall horizontally. It is worth disappointing only to see the first sixties. Hawn is naked for a few glorious seconds at the beginning. Have fun...
