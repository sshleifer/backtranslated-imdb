This film is one of my favorites. It is difficult to explain why. Maybe it's the innocence of Corin Nemec and his awkwardness paired with the audacity of Cheryl Pollak, but it certainly has something to do with the soundtrack. Furthermore, some characters have small lines or movements or funny moments in themselves. Finally, the story is the one that always draws my heart, and the last scene is so bittersweet. All in all, I love this movie; It's perfect for a sticky and sentimental night for girls.
