enjoyed the film and the efficient Confucian criminal drama, the old order survives the threat posed by a greedy, brash young man, undoubtedly representative of modern society. I thought the final scene was strange and I couldn't understand if we had believed that the great D was punished for being greedy or that he had been part of the plan for a long time. I loved the scene and for once in a Chinese film, violence was not a choreographed martial arts party. The thing that always makes me enjoy Hong Kong films is that the main influence that the British seem to have had is to introduce "yes sir" and "excuse" in the local language and its entertainment that, long after, I am still.
