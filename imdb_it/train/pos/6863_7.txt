A great suspense film with excellent slow camera work that adds to the drama makes this a pleasure to watch and have fun. The director Brian de Palma makes a super-imitation Hitchcock (many call it "ripoff") with this movie and the widescreen DVD 2.35: 1 is a must to fully appreciate the camera's work (and several scenes with people hiding on each side that are lost on tapes formatted for TV). <br /> <br /> The negative aspect of the film, at least for anyone with a sort of moral standard, is the general lack of treachery of all the characters, including the policeman played by a pre-NYPD Dennis Franz (who has hair here!). <br /> <br /> The opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long scene by Angie Dickinson that is quite explicit, even 25 years after its release. The film contains several erotic scenes like Dickinson (if she's really close-up) and Nancy Allen isn't afraid to show their bodies. <br /> <br /> There is not much dialogue in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz comes into the picture after the murder. The first 36 minutes are exciting and even if it's clear who the killer is, it's still very nice and fun to look at all the way through, especially for males who observe naked women.
