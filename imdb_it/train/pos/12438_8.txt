The film was a long-awaited release, which was a bit disappointing due to the expectations I had set. When I look at it again, I have to say that it's actually quite OK. First of all it is very faithful to the original story (obviously not completely) and it is like that done just to keep the right to the film. The story of modesty as a child is shown and is true to the original. Acting is perhaps not the best and the plot is a bit thin, but when compared to the 1966 film Vitti it is better just because it is not trying to be a musical. I would generally recommend it only to Modesty Blaise fans or someone who captures it on TV.
