Artemisia Gentileschi, the daughter of Orazio Gentileschi, showed an initial promise as a painter. Taught by her father, Artemisia was born at a time when talented women denied the right to have their work seen alongside the art created by men. His tragic life is told in this biographical film directed and co-written by Agnes Merlik. <br /> <br /> After reading the novel "The Passion of Artemisia" by Susan Vreeland, she made us investigate more about this woman's life, her work and her legacy. We also read "Artemisia Gentileschi" by Mary Garrard, which should be a book to read absolutely by all art lovers. <br /> <br /> "Artemisia" presents the fictional facts we have read about showing the early life of the young woman she begins to paint. It was clearly influenced by the work of his father, by Caravaggio, Agostino Tassi and other Florentine painters of that period. His relationship and love affair with Tassi is the basis of the film. Artemisia, unfortunately, could not go as far as she could because of prejudice against women in the arts. She did not help nor did she cause a scandal in which she is accused of being raped by Tassi. He had to go to Rome to distance himself from that unfortunate time of his life. <br /> <br /> Valentina Cervi makes a beautiful Artemisia. It is a wonderful creature that has awakened passion in men. Michel Serrault plays Horatio, his father. Miki Maojlovic is seen as Tassi, the man who wanted Artemisia, but ended up in prison. Emmanuelle Devos appears for a moment. <br /> <br /> The film has a glossy finish that Benoit Delhomme's photographic work captures in all its glory. The scenic locations of the film give an idea of ​​what inspired that school of painting to be shown in their canvases. Krishna Levy's music serves well what we see. Agnes Merlik directed with a confident hand showing her own visual style.
