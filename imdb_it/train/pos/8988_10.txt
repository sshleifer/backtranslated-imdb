To suggest Anton Newcombe of Brian's Jonestown massacre could also use some therapy. In Dig! who won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, we watch him and his band self-sabotage for seven years, while former friends and contemporaries The Dandy Warhols rise to a comparative magnitude (a mobile ad, anyway). <br /> <br /> What elevates Dig! above his contemporaries the immense almost biblical tragedy is played out: an honestly depressed treaty on art against trade and compromise. Despite all his "look at me, I'm a damn genius" attitude, Newcombe turns out to be a particularly gifted, yet immensely troubled musician - much more talented than his rival, Dandy's Courtney Taylor who narrates the picture. If Newcombe is Dennis Hopper, Taylor Fonda by Peter. <br /> <br /> Even sadder, Taylor seems to realize it, as his snappy, self-contempt of voice over shows: he knows his band won the battle - but at what cost? In truth, they ran out of sales, made Indie-Lite discs, kept their teeth clean and clean, and probably combed their hair twice before going to sleep, resulting in record contracts and a great tour bus. And throwing away all credibility in the process. Newcombe, on the other hand, lives in the dirt, is constantly arrested, beats the band members on stage, kicks someone in the head and can see Dig! be transported by the police, having lost the right to see his son. <br /> <br /> Two of the best films on the rock subculture were directed by women: The Decline Of Western Civilization by Penelope Spheeris and this ?? an instant classic the moment it was released.
