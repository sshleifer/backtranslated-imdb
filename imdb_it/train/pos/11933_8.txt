I think this is a nice family film. There are lots of hilarious scenes and exciting moments throughout the film. The actors are fantastic and the effects are well executed everywhere. Danny Glover plays George Knox, who runs the terrible 'The Angels' baseball team and is great throughout the film. Fantastic are also the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is as good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are fantastic in this first-rate Disney movie. A touching and touching film that everyone should appreciate.
