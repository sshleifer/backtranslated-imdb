Good history and excellent animation. The influence of Frazetta and Bakshi is obvious, and this is a good thing. Anyone who loves Conan the barbarian or the Dungeons and Dragons game should enjoy it. The battle between good and evil is clear even though it may seem that sometimes our hero is neutral. Most often in fantasy movies the Elves are usually portrayed with white skin and blond hair and goblins and orcs with dark hair and skin. Anyone familiar with the work of Frazetta, Bakshi or even Tolkien knows that they are not racists. Everyone who loves fantasy movies should like this movie. It is not for small children due to violence and sexual allusions. The casting was well done and the scenes and music are of the highest quality. I hope someone soon puts this gem on DVD. I consider myself lucky to have a VHS copy in good condition.
