I read a lot of commits when it was in theaters and everyone was bad ... I think you have to be a certain kind of person to enjoy these movies. If you are not a person who appreciated the Waltons or Little House ... U will not understand or appreciate these films ... <br /> <br /> Now on Loves Abiding Joy ... I knew HIM was bad news from l beginning of the film .... I wish he would have shown more than the end instead of just letting you think. This film has a lot to do with Jeff ... it's been 6 years, so you know he'll be interested in Girls. <br /> <br /> I mean that so far I have enjoyed all 4 movies. ... He wasn't crazy about books ... I can't wait for the next movie to come. The way Clark talks to you will lead you every time. I'd like to see Jan Jones make an appearance ... Maybe a family reunion or something.
