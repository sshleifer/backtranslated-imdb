I really enjoyed this movie. The humor was a little absent at times, but I liked how the story moved between dramatic and serious throughout the film. This is the only second film in which I have seen Verdone recite (the other was 'Un sacco bello'), and I can understand why the Italians find it boring, but he thinks he played the role of the loving father well. <br /> <br /> My only disadvantage with this film is that I knew it took place in Italy - somewhere in the center or in the south, I assume, but I felt that there was no representation of a place. This film could have taken place in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Dehli ... I always think it's important for movies to have a place to give viewers something to relate to. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian movies, then I think you'll like it. It is not a Fellini or a Rossellini - it is not realism or neorealism. It's a comic story with important moments that could really happen to any of us.
