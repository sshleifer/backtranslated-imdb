This movie gave me nightmares for months and I'm 17 years old. This is the scariest movie ever made! It is not an exaggeration !! I saw this movie at school in English lessons and nobody else was scared and this surprised me. After reading other reviews I'm glad I'm not the only person to find it so scary !!
