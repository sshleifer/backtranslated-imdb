We eliminate any discussion of the use of non-Asian actors who play Asian roles. The film is 67 years old. In 1937 the studio leaders believed that any actor could / should be able to play any role. The actors were under contract and didn't always have a choice as to what role they played. End of the story. <br /> <br /> This is a great epic story of love, individual rights, class and man / woman issues. The focus of the film are the two brilliant interpretations of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. <br /> <br /> Muni plays Wang, a Chinese peasant, about to take a wife (Rainer). From the beginning, he treats her with respect, at a time when women were considered little more than hired. Without giving too much of the film, they go through the ups and downs of all relationships, and even if the story could take place between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the story and many of their feelings seem believable . > <br /> Besides the fact that the film is about 5-10 minutes longer than it should be, and the representations of Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly are typical cartoon characters from the 1930s, this is a movie really wonderful that, unfortunately, has become a victim of political correctness. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
