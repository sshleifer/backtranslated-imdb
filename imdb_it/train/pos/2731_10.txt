Sorry, I don't have much time to write. I'm not a psychologist, but I've known one for 25 years. He said that Scott Wilson played a sociopath (without conscience) extraordinarily well. I agree! He also said that Robert Blake painted a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but could not control himself superbly. I agree! What a chilling and terrible film. I have seen over 2000 movies and would rank it among the top 100. My longtime friend regularly deals with clients like these. My only criticism was the narration of the sermon at the end of the film. Many people grow up in non-ideal circumstances, but only one in a million will behave as these two losers did.
