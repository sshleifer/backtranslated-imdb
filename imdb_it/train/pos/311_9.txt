I thought Rachel York was fantastic as "Lucy". I saw her in "Kiss Me, Kate" and "Victor / Victoria", and in each of these performances she developed very different and very real characterizations. She is a chameleon who can play (and sing) anything! <br /> <br /> I am very surprised how many negative reviews appear here regarding Rachel's performance in "Lucy". Even some bona fide television and entertainment critics seem to have lost the meaning of his portrait. So many people have focused on the fact that Rachel doesn't really look like Lucy. My answer is "So what?" I wasn't looking for a superficial representation of Lucy. I wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown. And Rachel has certainly given us this, in great depth. I also didn't want to see someone simply "do" Lucy's classic routines. So I was very happy with the decision of the producers and the director to have Rachel Lucy perform during the rehearsals for the most memorable of these skits: Vitameatavegamin and The Candy Factory. (It seems that some of the reviewers didn't realize that these two scenes were meant to be sequences of tests and not real scenes). This approach, I thought, gave an innovative twist to the sketches that many of us know by heart. I also thought that Rachel was extraordinarily cool and funny in these scenes. And he absolutely nailed the routines that were re-created - especially the professor and the trampling of grapes. There was a moment in the Grape scene where the corner of Rachel's mouth had the exact little shot I remember having Lucy. I couldn't believe he was able to capture it - and so naturally. <br /> <br /> I wonder if many of the people who criticized the performance expected to see the Lucille Ball from "I Love Lucy" throughout the entire movie. After all, those of us who came to know her only through TV would have had no idea what Lucy really was in her early years in film. I think Rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant. He planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge, given the right set of circumstances. Lucy did not fit the style of the old study system. In his frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era, he kept repressing what would be his last gifts. <br /> <br /> I believe that Rachel skillfully captured comedy, drama, wit, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sensuality, self-absorption, l infantilism and stoicism merge into a single complex American icon. And he did it with an absolutely captivating genuineness and freshness. "Lucy" was a turning point for Rachel York. I hope that in the future it will bring a large number of important roles. I also hope you bring her an Emmy.
