This wonderfully elaborate, sweet production has carved deep into my bitter sweet. The irreverent students, the exasperated life of the bus driver and the personalities of the teachers present a subliminal debate while the story reveals. The adult characters all look familiar, my teachers, my bus driver, each of their opinions so plausible and well known. When a key incident occurs on the bus, we are sent on a circuit of points of view. All the while the babble of adolescent energy is kept under control by the organizers of the journey. Mr. Harvey is experiencing a lot of pain everywhere. It reminds me of the teachers damaged by the war that I didn't understand when I was an irreverent student. <br /> <br /> The producers and producers of Rhidian Brook deserve much praise for this well-formed British film. The pristine acting, the appropriate scenes should be widely available but it does not seem to have been given the right opportunity.
