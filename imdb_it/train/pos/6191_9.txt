It seems that Hal Hartley's films are pretty much with most of the audience. This film will be no exception to this rule. Fay Grim is a 1998 sequel to Henry Foole by Hartley. The focus this time on Henry's ex-wife (played to perfection by the ever-welcome Parker Posey), who is haunted by CIA critics on Henry's unpublished book on all his shady deals. Meanwhile, Fay ends up in an odyssey, dealing with international spies, etc. The film gets a little bogged down in the second half. If you've been a Hal Hartley fan in the past, this is one not to be missed. For novice novice Hartley who has only heard about his filmmaking technique, you may want to check out his previous films before tackling this (especially if you haven't seen "Henry" yet). I admired the work of the camera, which sometimes reminded me of some of Man Ray's first photographs.
