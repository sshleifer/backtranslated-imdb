I loved this movie when I was a kid. I cried every time I looked at him. It wasn't strange for me. I'm totally identified with the characters. I'd like to see it again (and I hope I'm not disappointed!). Pufnstuf rocks !!!! I was really drawn to the fantasy world. And for me the film was soo. I wonder if I've ever seen the series and confused them? The acting that I thought was strong. I loved Jack Wilde. He was so dreamer with a 10-year-old boy (when I first saw the film, not in 1970. I can still remember the characters vividly. The flute was totally credible and I can still 'hear' the bad woods.) Witchy was scary - I wouldn't want to cross her path.
