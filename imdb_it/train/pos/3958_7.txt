Moe and Larry are newly married, having married Shemp's demanding sisters. In her music studio, Shemp learns that she will inherit a fortune if she marries someone! <br /> <br /> "Husbands Beware" is a 1947 remake of "Brideless Groom", considered by many to be one of Stooge's best films with Shemp. The remake contains most of the movie from that movie. The new scenes, shot on May 17, 1955, include the plot of Moe and Larry marrying the sisters of Shemp, along with their cooking of a turkey bedridden with turpentine! Some scenes were added at the end of the film (a double was used for Dee Green, if you blink you will miss the appearance of the double.) <br /> <br /> "The careful husbands" would have done for a good film with only the plot to marry the sisters. Budget considerations, combined with fewer bookings for two-roll plays, have influenced the decision to use older movies. <br /> <br /> Although the Stooges had still produced completely new films, most of their 1955-56 publications were made of old films with some new scenes launched. "Careful Husbands", while one of these hybrids, is watchable and fun; we can see most of "Brideless Groom" again, and the new scenes are fun enough to take the viewer through the film. This film is one of Stooge's last comedies with new footage of Shemp, and was released six weeks after his death. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
