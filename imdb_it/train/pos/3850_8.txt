This is the last Dutch-language film that Paul Verhoeven made before moving on to Hollywood films "Basic Instinct", "Robocop" and "Total Recall", among others. Prepare the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider that catches its prey in its web before meeting Gerard Reve, a boring self-centered writer with a morbid fantasy. Gerard was invited to be a guest speaker at a meeting of the Literary Club in the city by the sea, about an hour from Amsterdam. Verhoeven shows us how Gerard's imagination distorts reality. Asked if the writers are a little close to madness, he admits when he reads the newspaper "and says" boom ", I read" doom ", when he says" flood ", I read" blood "when he says" red "I see" dead. '"When he tells a story enough times he begins to believe it;" I lie the truth. "Accept an offer to be the guest during the night of the treasurer of the Club, an owner of a wealthy salon. While he knows her and discovers that her husband is dead, he begins to imagine being "a black widow". Is this perhaps his touch of reality or is he a murderer? This is a psychological drama and in telling which of these old films have remained etched in my memory, I realized that "It's my favorite genre. Looking at his body of work, it also seems to be Paul Verhoeven's, and he's a master at making us question our understanding of reality. It's a nice change of pace from the usual Hollywood fare." I saw it in 1983 and it's a "stuck" movie.
