I can't believe ten years have passed since this show first appeared on TV and delighted the audience with its unique blend of comedy and horror. This is the show that gave birth to much of modern British humor: the home of the terrible Dr. Terrible; Darkplace by Garth Marenghi; The Mighty Boosh; Tobacco. Many have imitated the style of this show, and I do not deny that some have exceeded its quality. But Jermy Dyson deserves to be remembered for starting the trend, with actors Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith. <br /> <br /> Together they created Royston Vasey, a small sinister town in the idyllic English countryside, where unsuspecting tourists and passers-by come across an obsessive couple who wants to keep the city local and free from strangers; where the unemployed are abused and insulted at the employment center; where a farmer uses real people as scarecrows; where a veterinarian kills all the animals he tries to cure; where a gypsy circus kidnaps people; and where the butcher adds something secret but irresistible to food to attract people. <br /> <br /> This is just a breath of what the viewer can find in The League of Gentlemen. Alone, the three actors give birth to dozens and dozens of unique characters. The make-up and the prostheses are so good that I actually thought I'd see more actors than they were. But it is also a great acting: the way in which their voices and their body movement change, they really become other people. <br /> <br /> Most of the lines start with something ordinary, from real life, and then explode into something disturbing, sometimes tormenting. Sometimes it's pure horror without a set up, like in the character of Papa Lazarou. Imagine a terrifying circus make-up owner who breaks into someone's home and kidnaps women to become his wives. No explanation provided. It's disturbing. Then there are the numerous references to horror films: Se7en, The Silence of the Lambs, Nosferatu, The Exorcist, etc. <br /> <br /> Horror fans will love it, comedy fans will love it. As every traveler who enters knows, there is a sign that says "Welcome to Royston Vasey: you will never leave". Any spectator who will give a chance to this show will agree. Once you discover The League of Gentlemen, you will never want anything else, you will never forget it.
