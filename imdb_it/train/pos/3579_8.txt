The Stone Boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s. Considering how many famous people or who will soon become famous in the film, one wonders how it could have been overlooked. This is a slow, moody but moving account of a tragedy that affects a family of farmers. The film is more or less an indictment of the stoic values ​​of the Midwest and the suppression of emotions. The film will not be to everyone's taste, but anyone who can appreciate the real human drama should like it. <br /> <br /> In the first moments of the film, we see two brothers leaving early in the morning to take peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if they are lucky. As he climbs through a barbed wire fence, the gun unloads accidentally and the smaller boy fatally shoots his older brother. Apparently, these kids have never taken a course on hunter safety. The way two men correctly cross a fence like this with a gun would be the following: the first man climbs. The second man then passes the gun through the fence. The first man then lowers the gun and helps the other to overcome the barrier. At no time should a man have his hands on both the gun and the fence. <br /> <br /> However, once his brother was killed, Arnold aged 12 regressed in his world. He didn't even ask for help after his brother was hit. He simply goes ahead and takes the peas and tells his family about the incident later. At no time during the funeral or investigation did Arnold seem to show any regret or regret. His family seems to avoid it. Maybe I'm even mad at him for killing his brother. A horrible uncle played by Frederick Forrest is externally angry with Arnold, although the death of his older brother allows him to hit the boy's girlfriend. Arnold's parents don't seem to understand how to deal with their child. They really don't even try to talk to him. The only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is interpreted with Wilford Brimley's typical grandfather skills. After a while, Arnold also moves with the old timer. <br /> <br /> Nothing seems to open Arnold until he embarks on a bizarre trip to Reno Nevada to inexplicably look at his uncle's ex-wife. Once he meets her, he begins to emerge from his shell after apologizing to her for breaking his marriage, starting all the family turmoil with the accident. From here on, the film becomes a rapid study of reconciliation and awakening. <br /> <br /> Acting is obsessively distant in most cases. Robert Duvall and Glenn Close are the perfect parents of the farm. Forrest is good, but maybe he tries too hard to channel the performance of Paul Newman in Hud. Photography is also exceptional. If you like moody photos of ordinary people, this could be for you. Some may even be asked to bring some fabrics. 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The hound.
