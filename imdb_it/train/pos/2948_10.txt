It should be against the law not to try this extremely entertaining stand show with Eddie Murphy. I've never seen anything like it. <br /> <br /> Murphy goes on for almost 70 minutes on cocks, cunts, tits and insults, so many famous people including his "family". Among the people who understand him from Murphy are: Elvis, Mr.T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I've never seriously laughed so much about anything my whole life. I mean, when a person doesn't know who Mr. T is, but keeps laughing so much about Murphy as Mr. T, there's something about it. At the time I saw the show I couldn't remember who Mr. T. was, but he kept laughing. Now I know who he is and that makes it so much more fun. Because that's what Eddie does - he manages to make those impressions so beautiful that it doesn't matter who the hell he's trying to do, it's still hilarious. And what's more, we learn that Murphy is actually a very good singer. Please watch it ..
