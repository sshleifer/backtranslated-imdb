Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of narration, but it is often compared to Walt Disney. This is simply unfair, because it becomes evident when watching the films of Miyazaki who is the superior artist. He really has an exciting talent for both adults and children, and Laputa is truly a fantastic ride. <br /> <br /> But where can I begin to describe a film so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works never ceased to amaze me. Laputa is a large adventure and I wonder how a film can be so rich in detail and imagination. Ask yourself this question: if you are a child who dreams of such a great and magical adventure, what would it be like? The answer would be to tie you in some place and look at Laputa, because it is really a childhood fantasy that becomes reality. Every minute of the film is rich and compelling ... from the train chase to the incredible aerial sequences ... and to the wonderful view of the floating castle itself. Not to mention the excellent score of Joe Hisaishi! Everything you want from an adventure film is here.
