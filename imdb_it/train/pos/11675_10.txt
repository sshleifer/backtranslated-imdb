I always follow the Dakar, so when my husband bought the home of Charlie's "Race to Dakar" DVDs, I couldn't wait to see it! Of course we had seen the transmission of the race when the actual race was in progress, but this never gives the background and the specific teams. <br /> <br /> If you have watched Long Way Round, you will not be surprised by the language that frankly I find more amusing than offensive. <br /> <br /> I think the only thing that bothered me about the DVD was Charlie's hair, but he had drawn it before the Dakar so my female cleaning need was appeased; although with LWR, the preparation was as interesting as the competition itself. I almost cried when Charlie broke his hand, and he started for every bruise he suffered during training ... and of course the death of Andy Caldicott ... it was a scary tragedy, but then every year there is it is something. <br /> <br /> Russ drives me crazy, even if his attitude has improved a thousand times by the cynical argument that he was in LWR. It's nice to see him get along so well now with Charlie. <br /> <br /> What I learned from this odyssey was: 1. never let Scorpion prepare your vehicle for ANYTHING! - They had months to prepare for the X5, and the day before the team left for Lisbon, Scorpion had only done half the things that needed to be done, and the vehicle was a pain for the whole race; 2. Dakar organizers have to do a lot more work in their driver / driver recovery plan - leaving Matt (and presumably a large number of other drivers / drivers out to dry the way they did was nothing short of a culprit negligence; 3. Charlie has a captivating enthusiasm for the "hard and tough" adventure, but he needs to be very busy for real as he would like, and finally, 4. Charlie and Ewan are planning another of these poses that it's called Long Way Down in 2007, and I can't wait to put it in my hands !: D If you love bicycles and / or nice guys who are rehearsing, you have to watch it, I guarantee you love it. It's very funny. /> <br /> In conclusion, to Simon Pavey - you ladies are a hero, I was so impressed by your way of "silent creator" and by the fact that you actually finished ..... simply unbelievable considering how much a race monumentally difficult it is, and to Charlie, Matt and the rest of the team - top marks for doing it. To think that a relatively green team could have achieved so much is truly admirable. You are all wonderful.
