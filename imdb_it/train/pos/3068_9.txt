I gather from the reading of the previous comments that this film went directly to the cable. Well, I paid to see it in a theater, and I'm glad I did because it was visually amazing. Most of the settings seem to have been made in the early 1960s (except for the shrink office, which was dated in a different way), and if you leave out the Neve Campbell sequences, the whole film has a faded atmosphere early 60s. And the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating. For a first-time director whose background, I believe, is writing, has a big eye. Within the first ten minutes I felt that the plot lacked plausibility, so I simply suspended my disbelief and went ahead for the trip. In terms of acting and representing father-son relationships, mother-son, husband-wife, parent-child, the film was a success. William H. Macy, a pleasure to watch, seems to fill the void left by the late Tony Perkins, if this and Magnolia are an indication. Tracey Ullman as the neglected wife was quite moving for me. It was a three dimensional representation of a character too often seen by society as two-dimensional. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portraits. The representation of the parents (Bain / Sutherland) reminded me, in an indirect way, of the BUFFALO '66 by Vincent Gallo, even if a little attenuated! I would definitely pay the money to see a second film by this director. He has the self-discipline of a director of yellow movies in the 50s (something that P.T. Anderon will never have!), Yet he has a visual style and a way of attracting actors.
