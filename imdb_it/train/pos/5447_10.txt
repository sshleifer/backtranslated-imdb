The rules of personal taste when talking about films like this precious jewel. In the late eighties, the early eighties, I discovered this film, like many released in that period, "Night Patrol" "Bad Manners" or even "King Frat", the works of art and banners on the back of covers tempted and teased of course. Being of an age, films like the one I have already mentioned, as well as things like "Screwballs" and many others, captured the imagination, and fortunately many years later I still remember some with affection and some with contempt of the many films that help keep my love for this kind of parodies or pastiche. <br /> <br /> Made many years after the enormous success of "Animal House" and after seeing how it had gone down over the years, I now know that there would have been no way this film would ever have eclipsed the box office dollars as mentioned above, nor would it have remained in memory, much like that of National Lampoon's Vacation. <br /> <br /> Honestly, not everything that brought the National Lampoon Logo was a wild success, however me Class Reunion remains one of my favorite movies of all time, with instantly recognizable characters, such as the detached Bob Spinnaker interpreted to perfection by Gerrit Graham, so good at "Terrorvision" by Charles Band that he still lingers in the past glories of his youth. Or how about Stephen Furst, who brazenly and shamelessly turns into the fucking crazy drunk sex of Hubert Downs high school. <br /> <br /> Sweet like. Which makes me think. As I have already said, personal taste cannot resist. People can be so cruel, so they will never win any prizes or will be compared to peers in the comedy world. It has some merit. Being one of the first scripts written by John Hughes, he would later continue to make one of my favorites of his work "Weird Science" as well as having a splendid theme title sung by the great Gary US Bonds. <br /> <br /> What else can I say, it's a film just waiting to be rediscovered, over and over again.
