This is one of my favorite movies of all time and, although it may seem too slow for some, it's worth seeing. A corporate lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) is dragged into a case involving aboriginal "citizens", and it is not a common case. OK, one man died but it wasn't exactly a normal murder. There's been more rain than average lately, and the atmosphere of most of the film is a bit claustrophobic and overwhelming. The aborigines hide a secret and refuse to pour the beans. This has a lot to do with white men who make assumptions about aboriginal "cities" versus "tribal", and of course no Abo in the big city would practice in tribal ways. Uh Huh. Chamberlain is having strange dreams and is somehow the key to what is happening, although no matter how many times I have seen this, I cannot understand the exact connection. This is a very disturbing and disturbing film, and is a fine example of Peter Weir's ability to create tension from nothing. The ending is a bit ambiguous, but I take it literally, it's the easiest and scariest way. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.
