What a beautiful British film, a good screaming laugh and the sexy Gary Stretch, and oh, lots of bikes and a beautiful Welsh countryside. <br /> <br /> The members of our ARROWHEAD Bike and Trike Social Club appear to be extra! Hooray !! <br /> <br /> There are some really hilarious pieces, good acting, a good idea. <br /> <br /> I met the director, Jon Ivay, at a screening in Wareham, Dorset. A great man, with his feet on the ground and a good laugh. This film must be supported, as all great British films should be! <br /> <br /> So please go see it if you can, they have a website with the cinemas showing it, so find one near you! <Br /> <br /> I can't wait to get the DVD. Some of our biker friends have already seen the movie two or three times and never get enough of it. <br /> <br /> Amanda
