Christina Raines plays a beautiful model in New York looking for a new apartment and starts to meet strange neighbors and reveals a secret about the building and is slowly turning into a climax at the end of the film. This film has all kinds of graphic elements taken from the Roman Catholic Church against the Devil, from the Door of Hell, from the bizarre rituals, from a growing conspiracy and, finally, from a series of famous talented actors and actresses who flood the film . We have Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slyvia Miles, Beverly DeAngelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum and who can forget John Carradine as an old priest. Many of these actors hinder him - in particular Burgess Meredith who plays a beautiful comic / demented performance like one of the neighbors with a little bird and a cat. Meredith is as memorable as Balsam and Chris Sarandon are. Some of the artists have practically nothing to do like Jose Ferrer in an ungrateful role, even if it is nothing more than a cameo. The Sentinel is a beautiful horror film with many psychological elements and some really terrifying scenes. The final scene is repugnant and yet chilling. I find guilty with some of the free sex and violence in the movie, especially that scene with DeAngelo and Miles. Was it really necessary? I do not think so. Furthermore, the father / daughter material was a bit too much, but overall the film works and has a winning rhythm. The director Michael Winner does a work as a worker and is effective in creating moments of tension and films of fear. Scenes with Carradine are particularly effective.
