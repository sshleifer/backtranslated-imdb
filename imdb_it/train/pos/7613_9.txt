/ The first episode I saw of Lost made me think, I thought about what some people have crashed and chased by a giant monster. But it is not so, it is much more than this, because theirs is not at all a monster and every episode you see of Lost, well, is getting better every time. a deserted island with an underground bunker and above all the connection between the people who crossed each other before they crashed. This is the real secret. <br /> <br /> This set of rules and I'm looking forward to knowing what's going on there I hope they don't air the last 2 episodes in theaters, this series deserves a 9 out of 10
