The film is about Anton Newcombe. The music and careers of the two bands are simply in the background. It is right that Newcombe has the last word on the film, which in this text you can find in the "news" section on the brianjonestownmassacre website. I'd connect it here, but IMDb won't allow it. <br /> <br /> The documentarists are limited by what the camera captures, as well as the need to assemble a cohesive narrative from the somewhat random occasions in which chance has put the camera lens on a line of sight with pertinent relevance. In Dig!, Luck smiled on the Dandy Warhols, capturing their rise to the status of candidates for the idol of pop, while forming mass-produced pop packs for mass consumption, especially "Bohemian Like You", a song which made them famous thanks to a Euro mobile announcement. <br /> <br /> I have not had such luck for the Brian Jonestown massacre. The film captures little of what made the original BJM line exceptional, with the sole exception of a single montage, lasting about a minute, showing Newcombe creating / recording a series of short instrumental parts, insignificant per se, and concludes the sequence with a reproduction of the lush and sparkling sounds that must have been in Newcombe's mind and soul before they could enter the world. <br /> <br /> Three comments accompany the film; one of the directors and two of the band members (the BJM track is composed exclusively of former members and without Newcombe). Both the Warhols and BJM alumni emphasize this assembly sequence as the "best" part of the film, and I agree that, given the film's focus on Anton Newcombe, it is the only part of the film that sheds adequate light on the his gift, and it seems too short to give the right balance to this attempted portrait of "tortured artist". <br /> <br /> The interesting thing about the comments is that, unlike the film, they are recorded in real time - a long shot - that can be more honestly revealing than a documentary that takes shape mainly through editing. <br /> <br /> Dandies do not come out well in their comments. If the world of rock and roll extends the experience of high school life for its inhabitants - as I believe - Dandies are the preppy types of obsession with popularity, those who listen to rock because that's what their peers do, while the The crew of the BJM comes out as semi-rejected and semi-exiled outsiders (for the insiders like the Dandies, the "losers") who are the real rock spirit. Joel Gion of BJM, who talks a lot, nails the message of the film when he says (to paraphrase): "You can't forget that Anton was able to do the only thing he ever said he wanted to do. Great music." br /> <br /> The Dandies, meanwhile, laugh too easily at every extravagant performance during Newcombe's crash (all BJM sequences end here in 1997, before Newcombe leaves heroin). Courtney Taylor-Taylor's consideration of Newcombe's commitment to his vision is summarized as follows: "He is 37 years old and still lives in his car, you can download all his work on his website. He was so tired of being robbed by everyone else is Giving it all away. He could make a tick. "You can practically hear him shake his head in disbelief. <br /> <br /> Movie shortcomings cannot be attributed to filmmakers; rather they are the difficulties of the documentary form and the loss of collaboration on the part of the subject of the film, which makes this portrait of Newcombe so fragmentary. But it's probably the best we will get, outside of his music. <br /> <br /> I only rented a drive, which has the function. Most of the extras are on disc two. Don't rent this, as I put in my order to buy the set.
