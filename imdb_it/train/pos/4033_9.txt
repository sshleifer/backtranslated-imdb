Many of the reviewers have pointed out that Pinjar is different from the run of the Bollywood film mills. While this is true, Bollywood films in general are aimed at a specific audience and should be appreciated for achieving their goals in this regard. <br /> <br /> However, Pinjar is an excellent film for those looking for a change from the normal Bollywood-based film. Set during the period of partition between India and Pakistan, Pinjar focuses on a Punjabi girl who becomes a victim of social and cultural attitudes towards the treatment of women in her time. Paro, the protagonist, is forced to choose between a life with a man who has kidnapped her and the fleeting hope of a life with his family in the Punjab ruled by India. More than a number of Hindus and Muslims, Pinjar faces and defines the role of woman as a daughter, as a wife and as a mother in India and Pakistan in 1947. Unlike typical Bollywood films that are evasive in nature, Pinjar is a film that makes its audience contemplate these problems during and after the film.
