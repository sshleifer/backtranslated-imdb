It is wonderful to see that Shane Meadows is already exercising an international influence - LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT shares many themes with A ROOM FOR ROMEO OTTONE: the vague class identity above work but well below the center, the distraught father, the abandoned urban environment, the sense of adult failure, fascism barely hidden at the base of modern urban life. <br /> <br /> But if Meadows is an expert formalist, Mariage trades in images, and his monochromatic and exquisitely surreal, exquisitely composed frames serve to distance the filthy and rather shabby topic, which, like a path, it turns from high farce to tragedy in seconds. <br /> <br /> There are longueurs and clich√©s, but Poelvoorde is irresistibly mad, an ordinary man with ordinary ambitions, whose attempts to achieve them are often dangerous; while the individual set-pieces - the popcorn / pidgeon explosions; the best sequence of marriages by THE DEAD AND THE DEADLY - manage to wrest the epiphany from despair.
