When I first heard that Hal Hartley was doing a sequel to Henry Fool, I was excited (it was one of my favorites for years now), and then wary when I heard he was dealing with terrorism. Having just seen it, I was surprised to find that it worked, despite being a completely different film than Henry Fool's. Both writing and directing were dead and the acting was superb ... special compliments go to Hartley to reassemble the entire cast, up to Henry's son, who was only four in the original. As I said, however, this film is very different from the first one, but it works: I reconciled with the change of tone and argument due to the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters would have been in very different situations from the first film is finished. In this case, an unexpected adventure ensues ... and this is all I will give away ... not to mention the fact that I will have to see it again to really understand what is happening and who crosses twice who. Although it was certainly one of the best films I've seen for some time, it suffers as many sequels with its final, since it seems that Hartley is planning a third hour and the film leaves you hanged. I will be sure to buy my tickets for part 3 ("Henry Grim"?) In 2017.
