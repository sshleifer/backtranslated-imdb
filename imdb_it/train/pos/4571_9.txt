The most important thing about this film is the brilliant interpretation of Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor in the role of Christy Brown, artist and fighter of the guinea that despite his physical condition has exceeded all the odds. As a person who has worked with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance has been surprisingly convincing. The enormous support that Christy obtained from his family, the low-income working-class Dubliners, encouraged him to do the impossible and this photo brilliantly represented this support he did not read the book, but the dialogues were written wisely to capture Christy Brown's witty arrogant personality. I recommend this film to everyone, especially classic film lovers.
