A beautiful saleswoman in London is wiped out by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and cohabiting with him in her British Ceylon villa. Although based on the book by Robert Standish, this initial arrangement is very reminiscent of Hitchock's "Rebecca", with the protagonist Elizabeth Taylor colliding with the villa's impressive chief of staff and (almost immediately) her own husband, who is still under the thumb of his deceased-but-dominant father. Taylor, a last-minute substitute for a sick Vivien Leigh, looks creamy in her high-fashion wardrobe, and her performance is pretty strong; however, once her husband Peter Finch starts drinking heavily and barking orders at her, one might think that his dedication to him is rather masochistic (this feeling also hinders the ending). Still, the film offers a lot of suspense for soap: romantic drama, a bit of a travel diary, interpretive dance, a stampede of elephants and a cholera epidemic! *** from ****
