I just bought the DVD and I have to say, (after seeing Brazil and Fear a disgust in Las Vegas) Terry does it again. In addition to being a fan of Monty Python's films, the genius of Terry Gilliam continues in this science fiction thriller, which Bruce Willis plays a wonderful role as James Cole, and also (perhaps my favorite character) Brad Pitt who played madness by Jefferey Goines. A must for science fiction fans, or movie fans of any kind, because it includes suspense, drama, action, etc. <br /> <br /> in any way the plot, In the future, 1% of the world population survives a disease destined to wipe out the human race, which was unleashed in the past by "the army of twelve monkeys" . James Cole (Bruce Willis) is postponed to 1996 (which is when the virus is unleashed) to discover the disease, so scientists can find a cure at the time. Before going any further, James Cole lives in an underground society, and animals rule the world on the surface because of the disease that will kill humans. in any case, when he is sent back in time, he is actually sent back in 1990, where he is sent to a psychiatric institution because of his messages to the people of the virus. During his stay he meets Jefferey Goins (Brad Pitt), who is later largely responsible for wiping out the human race. He also meets his psychiatrist ((Madelein Stowe) who eventually allies with Bruce to save the world (since she sees that he is correct in his stories), is sent back and forth from his time to the past and finally sent in 1996 where then interrogates his sanity, but later pulls back to reveal a suspenseful end quarter of the film and later builds up to the rather shocking climax, where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus (not really Brad Pitt) and instead it is shot by the police while the killer leaves.
