As I have noticed with many comments from IMDb, some reviewers seem to demand that every movie they see has intelligent and intelligent plots that wallow in their intelligence. I'm not one of those people. If I watch an action movie, I want to see explosions, shots and heroism. If I watch a play, I want to have tears of laughter in my eyes. You have an idea. So looking at a horror movie, I especially want to be scared. The Grudge is a very scary movie, in both well-executed "jump" scenes, and it's a gruesome image. I've been a fan of horror movies for many years, and I'm talking about masters like Dario Argento, rather than the directors of some of the treadmill teen horror movies that are baked these days. If you want to be scared, watch this movie. Much scarier than the Japanese original "Ring" (which I think is also a great movie).
