Ah, the 70s. A time when he had to be a swinger. To be honest, today is also a good time to be a swinger, but I felt much more audacious. <br /> <br /> Joe Sarno offers a pretty good soft-core movie. In fact, just like today, some of the actors are famous hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors and these films had a plot and character development. <br /> <br /> It's pretty much what you'd expect from a swinger's movie. Two couples with open relationships rekindle the desire to get out of the MILF of one of the women who came for a visit. Not much more. <br /> <br /> Of course, when the MILF is Jennifer Welles, then it's a different story. Not too many 40-somethings seem stripped delicious like Mrs. Welles. It is worth the price alone to see Mrs. Welles looking at herself in the mirror as if she were Aphrodite. It is not a "mother of Stifler". It's much sexier. I also dug Anna from Chris Jordan. Jordan looks and looks a lot like Elaine Joyce who I thought could be her "twin at birth" or even Elaine herself. Anna is always eating, but she must have an incredible metabolism. <br /> <br /> Unlike the soft-core porn of the '90s, the soft porn of the' 70s kept the realism of the hardcore movie (something that the 2000 soft-core brought back on occasion, instead 90s music and orgasms in box) and is here in full force. It is not real but it seems real. <br /> <br /> For those of you who enjoyed Quebec "Deux Femmes En Or" product, you'll like it. Another classic movie only on Drive-In Classics, the best $ 2.50 CAN a month you can spend.
