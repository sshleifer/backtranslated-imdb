Of course, it may not be a classic but it is full of classic lines. One of the few films that my friends and I continually mention and this is fifteen years later (maybe he has been on Cinemax too many times!) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in this film - he can't seem to understand how to play - but he is surrounded by a fantastic cast who knows exactly how to interpret this parody. Looking for a movie to cheer you up? This is, but renting it with friends - it will make it even better.
