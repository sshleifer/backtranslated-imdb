I saw a preview of Freebird on the Isle of Man TT as I had heard about it in a couple of motorcycle magazines. Even though I was mainly for the race, the desire to see Phil Daniels in a motorcycle movie (yes, I love Quadrophenia like everyone else) was enough to get me away from beer and parties. At the end! We made it! we Brits have made a great motorcycle movie (and no it's not like Torque) this is up there with the best of British comedy. Mark my words, this is the best screen interpretation of Phil Daniels and, as far as Geoff Bell is concerned, there is a new British legend that is being felt. I loved Gary Stretch in the fantastic Dead Mans Shoes by Shane Meadows and here he performs in a moving performance that he can proudly add to his growing film reputation. This is a film not only for us Bikers, but I think for everyone (even my girlfriend loved it). I hope he gets the same brilliant response on the mainland he got on the Isle of Man. I'm not going to go into the details of certain classic scenes that this movie has, (watch out for the store), because it would ruin the fun, but I'd say, go to see, have fun and have one of the best nights in the cinema you've had in an instant. I really think this could be a cult classic. As they were saying at the TT ... C'mon Mon Freebird!
