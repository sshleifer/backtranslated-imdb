"Slaughter High" is a totally ridiculous slash movie about a high school nerd Marty, who is always teased by some pranksters. The joke goes wrong and ends up being burned wildly. Five years later his tormentors attend a meeting - only ten of them of course, and low and see Marty killing them one after another. British actress Caroline Munro ("Maniac") leads the cast as the heroine (who dies anyway!). The acting is completely horrible, there is also no suspense at all. Many grotesque death scenes to satisfy the blood freaks: a man's stomach explodes, another female victim literally gets an acid bath, a couple having sex in bed gets electrocuted, a boy is crushed by a tractor, a girl he is drowned, and a doctor receives a hyperdermal needle in his eyes. The killer wears a decent and rather gruesome jester mask and the setting (a beautiful old English castle) is really beautiful. However, the end of the dream is completely pathetic. In short, it is true that "Slaughter High" is a piece of trash, but I enjoyed. Only for really bad slasher wristband enthusiasts.
