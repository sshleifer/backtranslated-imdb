"Anything." There is nothing "in room 237. But you have nothing to do", anyway, so stay out, understand, stay out of it ". <br /> <br /> There has never been such a feat of psychological horror how this film reaches. This is the hottest horror film of all and rightly so. Jack nicholson is an exceptional actor and this is one of the greatest interpretations of cinema. in an isolated hotel and deserted for 5 months during the winter. Then the father (Jack) becomes almost possessed by the horrors in the hotel. <br /> <br /> Kubricks direction is nothing less than perfect. thesis, the agony of music, mystical messages and the perplexed plot make this the best horror film ever made. <br /> <br /> In the film there are constant references to danger, death and horror. is used in EVERY scene. Red is intentionally placed by Kubrick? Obviously!. <br /> <br /> This is a definitive classic by Kubrick and this is the third of his films that I gave to 10/10. He is a perfectionist in his direction and you can see it in all his films. He loves to confuse his observers in all his films. <br /> <br /> I will talk about this film for the months to come. It has infinite depth. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is the cornerstone of horror and tension. A masterpiece of terror 10/10
