Telemundo should definitely consider creating a DVD collection of the new Xica! I know a lot of people, including myself, who would like to be able to buy the new Xica! It is a very amusing novel set in Brazil. The costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the city where the novela takes place is beautiful. Xica contains much history from that time period. I would like Telemundo to send it again even if it was 2 am. I highly recommend watching Xica if it is ever shown on Telemundo again. I've already sent Telemundo a million times by e-mail to show the story again, but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears. The only warning about Xica is that it occasionally contains harsh scenes so I would advise children under 14 not to look at Xica. Overall Xica deserves a 10 out of 10!
