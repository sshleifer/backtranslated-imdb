* First, although many say it's the worst in the series, I don't think that's true, considering that this ideally reflects the adolescent mindset of the 21st century. It offers perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remember the good times when you would have enjoyed yourself as the characters. <br /> <br /> * I agree with the fact that it is a teenage movie but shouldn't comedy films be for teenagers? ... the cinemas are above all the place where teenagers can go out; moreover, watching a movie like this during a sleepover or something is very good to have a good time. <br /> <br /> * Many comments on the amount of nudity in this film. Well ... we become real ... doesn't it reflect the thoughts of teenage boys like those in the movie? what would you like to see ... smart books, romantic stuff? it's not at all what it would be in the minds of those guys ... <br /> <br /> * In conclusion, I think that if you are a teenager, you absolutely have to watch the movie, and even if you are a real adult man or woman, you should see it if you still have a teenage mind or you often think about how he was a teenager, or something like that. Thanks for reading!
