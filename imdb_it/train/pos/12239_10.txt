Excellent farce! Which, of course, is all that's meant to be. Fortunately there is neither a social or political message, nor is there the slightest attempt in that direction. Could the plot actually take or have taken place at a particular time or place? Unlikely, because, after all, this is simply, simply, a film, and the films spring from imagination, not reality. The only purpose of this film is to entertain, certainly not to educate, and entertain it does, with reality deliciously and carefree thrown to the wind. I think most would agree that we expect illumination and authenticity from documentaries. But for entertainment I want what is now described as "child's play", which The Mating Game is in effect. For some laughter and a total laugh from time to time, this is a beautiful fantasy.
