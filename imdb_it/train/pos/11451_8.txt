A very engaging documentary about the Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work consists mainly of ephemeral sculptures made of elements of nature. His work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., which is swept away when the tide reaches the beach or the wind blows on the field. Therefore, most of Goldsworthy's works do not last long, except as photos or films of what they were. Now, it can be argued that Goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality or words to that effect, but it is no longer easy to say that what he does is just wonderful art. And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people living in decrepit urban environments, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family-oriented person who he loves nature and lives in a small village in Scotland (obviously, I am sure that these are the same reasons why he was avoided by some people in the art world who found his works soft or superficial).
