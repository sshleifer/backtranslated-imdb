Although it hasn't been seen in too many previous films, you have surely seen the basic themes of the plot in too many films since then. <br /> <br /> Not one of Grant's or Loy's best films, they make an exceptional effort together. After all, with that very good talent and support cast, you know the laughter will be there. <br /> <br /> The film is light, has some dramatic sighting but keeps the plot moving and makes you smile all way through. <br /> <br /> A great example of a classic American film tariff that has stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Definitely Saturday afternoon at a price full of popcorn.
