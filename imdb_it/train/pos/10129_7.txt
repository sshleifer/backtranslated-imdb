And that's how the biggest television comedy started! 12 years have passed since the first episode, but it continued in the same spirit until last season. Because that's where "Friends" is based: in quotes. There are extraordinary situations between six friends who will never leave our hearts: Let's say a big thank you to Rachel, Ross, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe !!! In our first meeting, we see how Rachel throws a boy (in the church, how ... (understand), Monica's search for the "perfect boy" (there is no perfect boy, because all women are obsessed with that ?), and how your marriage can be ruined when your life partner discovers that she is a lesbian, until you meet Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the next few episodes ... ENJOY FRIENDS!
