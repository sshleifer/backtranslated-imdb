The sisters will be published in the hall on March 24 in Sweden. A good opportunity for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. It was presented in GÃ¶teborg together with a retrospective dedicated to Kim Longinotto, "director in focus" of the festival. He gave a very appreciated master class, telling his method as a documentarian and told the public about the special circumstances that led her to shoot nuns twice: the first version was lost forever, so a second shot at the end the film turned out different. A rather terrible problem has happened, in this case, to create the possibility of a very strong film.
