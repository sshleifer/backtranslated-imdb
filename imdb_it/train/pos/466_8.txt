This was an extremely good historical drama. John Turturro is excellent as the tortured genius Luzhin and brilliantly interprets the maniacal charms of the character as his strange dances. Emily Watson looks good in her supporting role as the sensitive lover Natalia. <br /> <br /> The relationship between chess and madness is well explored by Gorris and from the familiar concerns of Nabokov as "eternal innocence" (ie "Lolita") are evident in this film. I think I'm going to read the novel now. It was a touching and tragic ending and it was difficult to keep an eye on. Fantastic movie!
