Set during World War II, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun-filled fantasy adventure for children, with Angela Lansbury in the role of an apprentice witch who, with the help of three displaced children and a 'Professor of Witchcraft', hinders a Nazi invasion. <br /> <br /> Brilliantly creative, with lots of laughter, this film will delight children of all ages with its great characters, its exciting story and its catchy melodies. Lansbury is perfect as an Eglantine, the not-so-perfect witch who accompanies the three children in the adventure of a lifetime, and her three young co-stars (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) are just as impressive as Cock Rascals help fight the ugly Hun. <br /> <br /> The special effects are a little dated, but let's face it, children don't care too much about these things, as long as they are entertained. And entertained, they will be. With some impressive scenes that brilliantly mix the live action and animation with a great effect, and a more genuine cinematic magic than a hundred Harry Potter, it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinema escape. In fact, only a rather elaborate musical number set in Portobello Road reveals the perfection of the film, but with so much more to enjoy, which can easily be forgiven. <br /> <br /> And besides, every film with UK television the legend of Bruce Forsyth as a Flash style flash style is guaranteed by a good grade.
