What can I say, I grew up watching Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Maine Pyar Kiya. Soraj have always been different. Movies are part of our evolutionary lives Soraj creates something that is hard to find. Love and a united family that loves and is great. Vivah is the journey for a couple that is organizing a wedding that turns into organizing and loving marriage. Shahid did a good job. Anupamji as always brilliant. Amrita Rao withdrew in a different way even though I felt that in some way the other didn't fit that role for me. We saw it in Ishk Vishk and Ab ke baras, and Main ho in Na. So abandon a different role that is not intended. She was excellent in Main ho on Na and ishk vishk but it could be that she could have put a little more into the role. However, it is a great work by Barjatya. This film rejuvenates the values ​​we have forgotten. Sweet film of the year. Great music and lyrics. I'm not sure it's a remake but still a brilliant story that is original. Soraj's films have been brilliant to the end, so we always expect something different from him. Great job of the whole cast of crew and all. A nice family film to enjoy with your parents, brothers, friends and lovers. I give it 10 out of 10.
