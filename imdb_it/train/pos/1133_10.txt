This is a delightful film that is so exaggerated that my wife, my daughter, and I found it irresistible. The plot is simply crazy but "sounds real" to the world of soap operas in all its unlikely and impossible scandals. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the performances of Kevin Kline and Sally Field. There is no one better than Kline playing THICKheaded. The really desperate need for attention and affirmation of Field's character - and his almost bipolar swings of humor - played well against the background of the famous (infamous?) Di Field, "You like me!" Exclamation Oscar. People who can catch themselves with such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world. <br /> <br /> I think this is the only film in which I didn't find myself impatient with the characterization of Whoopi Goldberg; I thought it was "apt" in every note that struck. Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty and Elizabeth Shue were also first rate. Just a great movie if you're in the mood to go around and laugh!
