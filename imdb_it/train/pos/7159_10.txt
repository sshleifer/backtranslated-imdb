Louis Sachar's exciting classic for children is about Freddy Krueger's Disney. He has murders, racism, facial disfigurement and killer lizards. <br /> <br /> Strictly traced, it is a multi-layered and interconnected story that crosses history to reveal Stanley's legacy and the secret behind the scenes. It runs from the lush green of Latvia to the pockmarked Green Lake (hint: there is neither the lake nor the green). <br /> <br /> The first success of Disney is to recreate the environments of the novel in such a convincing way - the scenography is superb and without gloss. The other advantage is in the casting. The rising star Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Project Greenlight) may not be the fat boy of the book, but his attitude is right and it is far from the usual clean hero. The rest of the cast is compiled equally well, from Patricia Arquette as the robber of the bank Frontier marbled to Henry Winkler as Stanley's father. The flip side is the soundtrack of pop - pure marketing department - and the feeling has become quite loud at the end.
