A number of posters commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion. This is always a problem with long and complex dramas. Crime is essentially trivial, so profits are always anti-climatic, while a detailed exposition takes away the human drama. The writer used a number of smart devices to try to get around this, but he didn't have all the success. Answers to exactly what happened and why it might have been provided, but in that case they are well buried. The spectator inevitably feels a little cheated. <br /> <br /> But in a way it's not important. The drama never involved crime, or even inquiry, about the impact of events on the lives of those involved; family, investigators, witnesses, the press. And as such it was compelling. Writing was a significant cut over the run of the mill for prime-time drama, and performance evenly. In an ensemble piece it is insidious to focus on individuals, but Penelope Wilton deserves special mention for an extraordinary tour de force as a mother-wife-daughter, and Janet McTeer was in an uncomfortable form like an old tough cop. <Br /> <br /> One of the most interesting aspects of the drama is the management of the race, like the elephant in the room that no one is ready to mention. Thin and powerful stuff.
