There have been many films made by Hollywood during the war years that were designed to support the support of our troops from the public. Seen today, some could dismiss them or consider them simply as propaganda - which are technically, but of a positive nature and destined to unify the nation. This film is a very effective and amusing example of the genre - with a rather realistic script and good production values. Pat O'Brien interprets practically the same character who has played in MANY other films (you know, the hard-talking, the hard-headed but the "smart guy"). Randolph Scott is, as always, competent and fun and the rest of the extras are excellent (look for a young Robert Ryan as one of the bombers in training). While the story is reminiscent of many other films about our drivers and crews, the film is well enough to make it interesting and not too exaggerated. Which, perhaps, except for the end - where the film is a bit exaggerated but also VERY satisfying. About the only serious downside, and this is especially for nitpickers, is that some of the images are a little poorly integrated into the film and "crazy" like me who are both history teachers and airplane lovers will probably notice this - all others will probably not notice.
