The documentary begins in 1986 in New York where black and Hispanic drag queens hold "balls". That's where they dress as they want, put things in front of the public and get voted on. We know many of the members and see how they hold together and support each other. As one man tells another - "You have three blows against you - you are black, gay and a drag queen". These are people who (unfortunately) are not accepted in society - only with balls. There can be anyone and whatever they want and be accepted. Then the film is reduced to three years later (1989) and we see how things have changed (tragically for some). <br /> <br /> It sounds depressing but it is not. Most of the people interviewed are actually very funny and have a lot of humor out of their situations. They are well aware of their position in society and accept with humor, just as they should. We discover that they all live in "houses" managed by various "mothers" and that they help each other. The sense of community in this film is fascinating. <br /> <br /> When this film was released in 1990 it was controversial and was a great success. He won the award for best documentary in numerous festivals, but was never nominated for an Academy Award. Their reason was "Black and Hispanic drag queens are not Academy material". Fascinating isn't it? Homophobia and racism all together. <br /> <br /> Seen today is still a great film - and a period piece. This is no longer the case - the NY they show no longer exists. The balls are still held but not in the spirit we see here. Even dragging has become more "accepted" in society (for better or for worse). And I heard that even the houses have disappeared. Its a bit sad. I'd like to know where these characters are now - I know two deaths from AIDS but I have no idea about the others. And what happened to THAT 13 and 15 years? <br /> <br /> And yet, it is a one-of-a-kind documentary: fascinating, fun and exciting. A must see to the end! A final 10. Where is the DVD ???
