What I expected: a rather disgusting and stereotypical portrait of a crazy sports guy and an equally stereotypical stereotypical portrait of the girl he still likes to suffer while he is the second banana for his overzealous support for his favorite sports team. <br /> <br /> What I got: An impartial story in which both the boy and the girl end up admitting - to themselves and to others - that everyone has passions in their lives and yet everyone can forgive the other to save the love they share. <br /> <br /> It sounds noisy, but with uninterrupted humor and terrific performance this story works! Barrymore is the classic Barrymore: that perfect blend of sweet, strong and adorable. We expect that from you and you delivered. <br /> <br /> But Fallon is the nice surprise in this movie. Take to the role the perfect combination of sports nut combined with appreciation for the normal things in life, such as looking after children and their girlfriend. Fallon offers its lines with subtle perfection. He can be considerate ("You've just crossed the field for me!") And in the same breath be blinded by his love for the Red Sox ("How did the grass feel? A little spongy?") At the same time. The portrait of Fallon "made" the film. We hope this film marks the beginning of a better film career for Fallon, something that goes beyond the sophisticated humor typical of SNL students (ie Will Ferrell). <br /> <br /> In short, a film that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male and female characters who have risen beyond this limitation and have provided unabated humoral lines, most delivered with brilliant Fallon subtlety. <br /> <br /> Hey, I saw it with my wife - not a baseball fan - and she loved it as much as I did. It is neither a "Guy Flick" nor a "Chick Flick". It's a fantastic movie to make people laugh. Go see it!
