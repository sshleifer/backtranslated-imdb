Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) was the last film to present Freddy Krueger as a solo act (not as an entity or co-star). The years of killings hit the city of Springwood. It has reached the point that the small town has become a virtual ghost town. The parents who killed Freddy Krueger many years ago all paid the highest price. Only the mad inhabit the city and the survivors are scattered everywhere. But that doesn't stop Freddy from looking for his final revenge. No matter how they try to stop it, it always comes back for more. But this time he finds out more about his old life. Can children finally stop Freddy forever? What is this secret that is buried in Freddy's twisted mind? to find out you'll have to see Freddy's Dead. the end was originally shot in 3-D. <br /> <br /> An appropriate way to close the franchise. Freddy learns something about himself and his perverse life and he comes out to slam! Lisa Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger are the protagonists of this final episode. Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special appearances. Much better than the previous one but it is full of slightly dated jokes. If you like series then don't miss this. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend this movie to Freddy's fans.
