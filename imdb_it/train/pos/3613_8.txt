When "Girlfight" came out, the reviews praised it, but I couldn't see it. I finally saw it when it was released on video and I understood the positive reviews. <br /> <br /> The film opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto. We are immediately presented to the student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). He has a stupid expression on his face, and any idea about Diana that we could derive from this expression is soon corroborated when he fights. While Diana gets into trouble for this, we meet her father, a full-fledged aggressive guy; clearly we cannot totally blame Diana for her attitude. <br /> <br /> But then the film really takes shape, as a new thought sprouts in Diana's mind: boxing as a way to escape this sad existence. His older brother has already entered boxing, but his father will most likely not approve. Only Diana herself can decide what to do. <br /> <br /> Only the first few minutes alone identified that I was in a not-too-Hollywood movie, but John Sayles' brief appearance in a supporting role stated that. Even before you get to any boxing scene, you feel like they're punching you in the face to see the ugly life that Diana lives. And when they finally get to the main story of the movie, don't go back. <br /> <br /> All in all, I highly recommend this movie. I have to admit that using boxing as a means of showing someone trying to do something about themselves has been a kind of clich√© in the cinema for many years ("Rocky", "Million Dollar Baby"), but I still think they did great job with this one. In reality, this may have taken the genus to its peak. Really good. Too bad that Michelle Rodriguez got spoiled in Hollywood movies after this one.
