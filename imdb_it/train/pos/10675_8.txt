I've always wanted to see this film, being a fan of both Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic secondary plot was a waste of time, but McCallum's talent shines through in this juvie role. Thank God for Turner Classic who aired the show last week. I can imagine that there were many problems with children after the war, especially with the way things were in the 1950s. Some of the guys are a little scary. I certainly wouldn't want to meet them on a well-lit street, let alone on a dark street. There were some good insights about the feelings of a firebug or, as they call it, a firefly.
