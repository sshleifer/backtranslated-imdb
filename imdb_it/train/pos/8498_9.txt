This is a wonderful film with a funny and intelligent story and the dynamics of cultural differences and the recurring theme of what is important in life make this film very little appreciated. Don't let the world's cynics discourage you from seeing this. Keaton has wonderful moments and I wonder the fact that comedy is never appreciated, because actors like Keaton move from humor to serious pieces in an extremely simple way. Great movie all around!
