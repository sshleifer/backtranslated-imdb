I gave this movie 8 out of 10, reserving 10 for example Amadeus and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire recently. This film is close to Slumdog, but it is difficult to judge in this film without understanding the Balkan life, mentality and soul that Kusturica masterfully presents. To understand it, you really have to be one of the Balkans. This is a fantastic film, much better and more contemporary than his previous films, which are boring right now, I think Kusturica is going on with this movie. I like humor (Balkan humor), photography is an art in itself, every scene is artistic to the limit. The plot is probably a fairy tale, don't remember it now, but remember to read to my daughter that she's going to sleep a similar story.
