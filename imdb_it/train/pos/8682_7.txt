I'm sad to say that I don't agree with other people on this episode of Columbo. Death Lends a Hand is frankly a kind of boring Columbo for me. After a few times, I get bored and change channels. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles, but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator for the character of Ray Milland. He hires him to investigate his pretty young wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she has a relationship. In return, the character of Culp blackmails the sulky wife who intends to expose her scheme to her husband ruining her career. Out of anger, Culp kills her by hitting her in the face and placing her body elsewhere. I do not know. Maybe I didn't care about that at all. Of course, Columbo takes it at the end. It's just the question about how.
