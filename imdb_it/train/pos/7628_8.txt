This film is one of those "WOW!" movie. Not because it's the greatest film of all time, but because it surprised me. Not only was it a T.V. movie, but it was on Elvis. I can confidently say how many more imitators than there were, there was only one Elvis, but I can also safely say that Kurt Russel came very close to being the real thing. It was one of the biggest imitations I've ever seen. It made me believe that it really was him. I learned a lot about Elvis's life from watching this movie. And don't say that the TV part of this leaves you speechless - it's actually a really great movie! And Kurt Russel could have been Elvis's twin :)
