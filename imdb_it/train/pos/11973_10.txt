Full House is a wonderful sitcom about a dad, Danny Tanner, whose wife had just died in a car accident. Then Danny asks his brother-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis, and the best friend, Joey Gladstone, to help raise his three girls, Donna Jo 'DJ' Tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michelle Tanner. This is my favorite show of all time and I can watch it all day. And something about Full House always makes me laugh and there are sad parts too. There is never a dull moment in Full House. The main characters are played by Bob Saget (Danny Tanner), John Stamos (Jesse Katsopolis), Dave Coulier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (DJ Tanner), Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie Tanner) and Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen (Michelle Tanner).
