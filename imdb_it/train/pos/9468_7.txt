I saw a special advanced screening of this today. I have to let you know that I'm not a big fan of either Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I really didn't have any expectations. I ended up having a little fun. <br /> <br /> Dan in Real Life is the story of a widower with 3 daughters who goes to spend a weekend with his family. While in a bookstore, he meets the woman of his dreams, only to discover that she is his brother's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> This film is well made - the soundtrack, cinematography and acting are all top notch, especially Steve Carell. My problem was that there seemed to be a lack of character development, especially with the character of Dane Cook. We have never seen the relationship between the characters of Dane and Steve up close, and I felt it could help a little to show Dan's inner conflict in being in love with Dane's girlfriend. In addition to this, Dan in Real Life is definitely a solid and sweet movie, definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we made this year.
