Undoubtedly intended as a totally campy joke, "Full Moon High" portrays the fifties teenager Tony Walker (Adam Arkin) accompanying his father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Of course, Tony gets bitten and grows fur and fangs every time there's a full moon. A particularly interesting aspect of this film is that it cannot grow old as long as it has the curse of the werewolf and that it must fulfill a destiny - even if it takes twenty years. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, the film is simply fun once it starts. Ed McMahon's character is a patriotic right-wing yahoo (he thinks everyone should have listened to Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars's coach / principal is a tense dweeb, and then there's more. One of the most astonishing cast members is Demond Wilson - best remembered as Lamont in "Sanford and Son" - as a bus driver who gets a big surprise. But probably the most fun scene is the change of presidents; then gag with Gerald Ford really summarized it! However, it is a real surprise. Considering that Alan Arkin - who plays a crazy psychiatrist - just won an Oscar on Sunday night and thanked his children, I wonder if he doesn't remember starring with two of them in this film (apart from Adam, his son Anthony has also a small role). Quite funny. Also starring Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> PS: director Larry Cohen is probably the best known for the killer movie "It's Alive".
