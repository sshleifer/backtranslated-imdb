This is what I call a growth film. Each character is different and better at the end - and that's all because a woman knows that the place they have chosen is a "love tank". Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedian, really shines like the woman who produces all these changes. Even the men in this film go from being self-centered to the best men. The book has remained faithful to the novel, which is an advantage in my book, since I am a librarian. The breathtaking scenery and the message of genuine love.
