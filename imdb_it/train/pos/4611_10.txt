Version: Universal DVD version / Hong Kong Legends R4. Cantonese / English subtitles <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, five years ago, the world was obsessed with "The Matrix", and I was perhaps one of the few remaining fifteen-year-olds who still believed it was "Terminator" was better than 'Matrix'. I was just a simple teenager, looking for a good action movie, and then there was a bright light on a TV station I had never seen, a small station known as SBS. One night I noticed in the TV guide that a film starring Jackie Chan - "Police Story" would be released later. Having fifteen years and having only seen "Rumble in the Bronx" and "Rush Hour", I said ... "WOW AWESOME" and sat down to watch it, and kept shouting "WOW AWESOME" as the movie progressed. Two weeks later, after SBS showed the 'Police Story' trilogy, I knew I had found my new favorite actor. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui, a Hong Kong policeman who has a great drug lord, Chu (Yuen Chor). Chu's secretary, Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin), is held by police as a witness against Chu, and Chan is in charge of protecting her. Things are bad - it's terrible - when Chu's case is fired and he decides to want Fong and Chan dead. <br /> <br /> 'Police Story' is one of the greatest action films of all time, and certainly one of my favorite Jackie Film by Chan. Starts strong and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever shot. Everything in the middle is fantastic. However, some of the fun parts may seem a little insignificant to more than a few people ... <br /> <br /> As a story, this is still one of Jackie's best efforts. For an action movie, the story is pretty good, and Jackie is a much better actor in this than in "New Police Story" acting. This is not 'Miracles', but maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> 'Police Story' is one of Jackie's best works. It got me interested in the Jackie Chan films and should provide a good start for all potential Jackie fans. The bad news for anyone seeing this first is that Jackie Chan's films don't get much better - 10/10
