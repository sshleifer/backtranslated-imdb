Gómez Pereira is responsible for some of the most despicable comedies of the last Spanish cinema (just take a look at his curriculum vitae), so I didn't expect much from "Cosas Que Hacen ..." ... In fact I don't know why in the world I decided to watch it. Anyway, I just did ... And what a surprise. It seems that Gómez Pereira is finally mature and now he is able to make a good movie. His latest work is about the mid-life crisis, the disappointing one and the search for a second chance after you've ruined everything. The last half hour of the film (the most dramatic) is the best part, and it's worth watching the movie. We also have Eduard Fernandez who plays the main role, and I still think he is the best actor of his generation (by far). <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
