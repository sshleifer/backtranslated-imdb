This film is a small ray of sunshine in a dark season. A quality better described as simple old cordiality is celebrated. Morgan Freeman plays a character very similar to Freeman himself - a successful actor who pushed 70. He traveled to a small, rather messy grocery store with the intention of looking for a part that could play, like a manager of such a place . Soon the staff and the customers are fascinated, especially the beautiful, if malevolent, young woman (Paz Vega) who presides over the "10 or less cash". <br /> <br /> 10 items or less do not have an important statement to make and do not claim to do so. Freeman and Vega follow as they become friendly, and while the older man offers his advice, in exchange for a ride home - the gofer of the movie company that should take him never shows up and Freeman has forgotten his phone number so he doesn't can ask for help. I had a little case of blues on a gray Sunday afternoon in New York City and this film healed me.
