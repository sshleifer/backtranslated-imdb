Red Eye is not the kind of film that will win the Golden Palm, but Wes Craven has never been that kind of director, however, and his brand is a good indication of what a filmmaker can expect. <Br /> <br /> The fact that Red Eye is a compact and undemanding 94-minute package is part of its appeal and an indication of Craven's ingenuity in producing light, but generally enjoyable, box office tickets. In fact, it's the perfect type of film to show as in-flight entertainment, able to capture attention without posing any intellectual or emotional challenge to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is a rough feel to the plot, vague terrorist motivation subplot and supporting characters, and the main section has a TV movie feel. However, there are certain elements of Hitchcockian's suspense, and echoes of Schumacher's Phone Booth, which in the end is a more sophisticated (and pretentious) game about the very idea of ​​emotional crisis being played suppressed in public. <br /> <br /> For a film that focuses mainly on two people sitting on airline seats, lives or dies on the characters and on the script. The jealous but eloquent Jackson Rippner and Rachel MacAdams, Cillian's ingenious Lisa, are the main reasons why the film is taken out. Not only by making dialogues, but also by giving a sort of Adam's Rib-type dimension to their battle of "male logic" against feminine "sensitivity". <br /> <br /> In the final part of the film Craven gives himself a little Screams as a man-chases-girl-with-knife. The most surprising revelation here is what resembles Brian Cox after the "Just for Men" treatment, his ubiquitous appearance in different films like Super Troopers, The Ring and this makes him the sexegenarian version of Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Short-range fun.
