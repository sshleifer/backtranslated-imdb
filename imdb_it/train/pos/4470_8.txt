Similar to "On the Town", this musical on land sailors is no longer a classic in terms of rhythm and song quality, but has its charm. Kelly has three fabulous dance choreographies: one with Jerry, the cartoon mouse of the "Tom and Jerry" fame, one with a girl and a fantasy sequence in which he is a Spanish lover determined to join his lady on a high balcony. Sinatra, playing the shy and inexperienced companion of Kelly, and Grayson, the woman who serves as a love interest for both men, do most of the singing. Iturbi provides some piano sounds. At almost two and a half hours, it's a bit too long for a light musical but doesn't drag.
