In my opinion, the best film ever. I like it when people ask me what this movie is about. I usually smile and say "life". They shrug their shoulders and will probably never think about it again. The fact that everyone, from every background, can relate to a part of this film makes everything much more surprising. Definitely a must see for everyone.
