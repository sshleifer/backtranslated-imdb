Michael Bowen plays an innocent young man who hitchhikes for a thousand miles to visit the absentee millionaire father (the creepy Ray Wise) on a vast ranch engine and windmill and ends up tangling in the dangerous web of his young, intriguing and seductive stepmother from the 'hell (the exquisite Clare Wren), thus causing problems for the already dysfunctional family. A sharp, elegant and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent directly to VHS and cable TV - where I saw it for the first time. It is beautifully written, acted intelligently and strictly directed by a script that keeps you biting your nails. I can't believe that reviewers who didn't like it have ever seen it. It's a classic not yet discovered.
