There are some comments on this film that say he is a bad and stupid and such an excellent actor as Pierre Fresnay should not have agreed to act in it. <br /> <br /> I think, on the contrary, that, even when the film is strange and has some weaknesses, Pierre Fresnay's performance is so formidable that it converts the film into something excellent. <br /> <br /> Its performance is probably the best in history. <br /> <br /> The film itself has a very controversial scene about the consecration of wine in cabaret. <br /> <br /> For someone who doesn't believe a priest ?? even one defrocked ?? can convert it into the blood of Christ, the scene is perhaps bizarre. But for someone who has grown up in a Catholic context, it is very emotional, even if quite unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The scene of the death of the younger priest is tremendously shocking. But it is very well acted. Pierre Fresnay transforms the crazy act of murder into something understandable in the temporal madness of his character, the tortured morandito who, in this terrible way, returns to his duty.
