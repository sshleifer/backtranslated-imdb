I could not have been more enthusiastic; I was only eight years old in 1983, I was going to see a Star Wars movie at the theater! The best day of my life was about to happen. At that time, my only experience on Star Wars had been some HBO presentations on Star Wars. I had not yet seen The Empire Strikes Back. <br /> <br /> And, boy, I did that day for my less critical eyes. Jabba. Big Rebel spaceships. The emperor. A green blade lightsaber !! Wow! From that magical day, I must have seen this movie hundreds of times. I can't even form an accurate estimate at this point. With those multiple visions, I obviously observed that this film - the real episode III - has its flaws. <br /> <br /> Of course in the context of a Star Wars movie, those "flaws" are more like "oddities". <br /> <br /> Millions had their magic day in 1977 and 1980. In May 1983, I had mine. And this was my Star Wars movie.
