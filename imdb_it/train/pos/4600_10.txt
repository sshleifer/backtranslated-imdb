This is sad this movie is the top should be at least in the 250 best films here. This is still the best action movie ever made. Today's action films are badly made Actors and action directors don't know how to fight and stunts correctly. just some not like doing it mainly from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan. The stunts are so intelligent and wild that I don't think we'll ever see each other. The beginning in which Chan and his team descend from the hill to chase the city up in the hills is simply fantastic. The final combat stunts are for me the best combat stunts ever shot in the cinema. The final stunt that slid down the pole crashed into the glass. Jackie was badly injured.
