I saw "Elephant Walk" for the first time in about 30 years and I was struck by the way the plot is similar to the great "Rebecca". As others have already said, the young sweetness was swept away by the alternately charming and brooding gentleman of the manor, only to discover that his marriage was threatened by the inescapable memory of a relative, greater than life, but profoundly flawed. You have the severe and disapproving servant, a crisis that will bind the couple or separate them irreparably, culminating in the fiery destruction of the sumptuous farm. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, "Elephant Walk" also owes some of its eerie jungle atmosphere to "The Letter", the Bette Davis love triangle set in a rubber plantation in Singapore rather than a plantation of tea from Sri Lanka. <br /> <br /> Maltin from "Elephant Walk" two-star and IMDb readers are not much kinder, but I enjoyed it despite its predictability. Elizabeth Taylor never seemed prettier, and Peter Finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father. Dana Andrews - a favorite in "Laura" and "The best year of our life" - is wasted as a frustrated admirer of Elizabeth. The real star is the bungalow, one of the most beautiful interiors in the history of cinema.
