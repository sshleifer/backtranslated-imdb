Crush offers such a combination of drama, humor and irony that I find the English very well established when it comes to matters of the heart. Mostly known for director John McKay he wrote this wonderful script by three forty year old friends in a small town in England. All three unfortunate professional women with men have formed a night of ritual women gathering with gin, cigarettes and candies the assumption included with endless chatter about their dates of erroneous behavior or the needs of their libido. Andie MacDowell, once again thrown out of the surroundings of the British (which is where I find she oozes the most) is absolutely fascinating as the mistress of a prestigious school that gets involved with a younger man. Small town gossip and jealous friends disapproving (big supporting cast) are in conflict with his relationship. Exposing a series of unfortunate and brutal events and showing us the many difficulties when looking for true happiness. Keep in mind that the main premise of this film is friendship and the ending shows us exactly that. This is the kind of movie you love or hate, and that's why I believe that many mix reviews and not the most successful ones were born when this movie was released. As I'm sure, most are just picking up the movie now. I really enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it to those who love movies like "Love Actually" and "Three Weddings and a funeral". Not to mention the soundtrack is extraordinary, perfectly capturing those crucial moments.
