This film has a lot of raw potential. The script is sharp, the dialogue is (usually) excellent (although it could endure losing the chills), the direction and the cinematography are surprisingly quite good, even if some experiments don't work. The main problem here is David Duchovny. Once a geek boy, always a geek boy; and the sad and simple fact is that he is incapable of interpreting anything except Fox Mulder. Posture, try to be lucid, pose, try to be macho. In the end he tries only too much. He overtakes his character, overcomes his jokes, and is barely outdone in all ways by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, who are each in a class above him in terms of acting ability. Timothy Hutton was (as always) really good. There was a moment or two in which he too dramatized his role, but it could be said that he was having fun with it. He looked at the part, and became the character both physically and atmospheric. Angelina Jolie was also really good. He didn't have a great role; in fact, I thought he could use a much stronger one ... his character wasn't developed enough, although he did extraordinarily well what he had. And the chemistry between her and Hutton was obvious (it happens, maybe that's why Uma left him ...;) All in all, he was rough around the edges, but a solid effort from a good cast and great supporting roles. If David Duchovny hadn't torn his role to pieces, it would have been much better. 7/10.
