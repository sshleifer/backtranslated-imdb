Much has been written about "The House of Games" by Mamet; most is good I decided to revisit the movie to see how it lasted for 17 years and I was surprised how much I enjoyed seeing it again. The success and duration of the film probably have a lot to do with two main ingredients that are always fun on the film; a good story and a good scam. Mamet manages to bring his moodiness and his obvious palate to the film, while scamming us, the audience and the brand simultaneously. Then he explains the art of reproaching only to do it again, etc. All the while building history. "The House of Games", now a freebie on cable, it's worth a look for the first timers and a perfect replica for Mamet fans. (B +)
