This is the best movie ever made. It is a masterpiece that brought me a tear. I will never forget my experience watching it. I don't understand why people don't think like me. The dinosaur turns into a performance reminiscent of De Niro in Raging Bull, Pacino in Scarface and Crowe in Gladiator put together. This should be released on DVDs in Superbit format, so I can fully enjoy it as if it were meant to be enjoyed when they produced it and filmed it. Whoppi Goldberg truly turns into the performance of a life like a tough and gritty cop, who is against her, who will join a hot-shot dinosaur as her partner, so hi-jin follows to say the least. From the way I'm saying the exact opposite of what is true this movie is total rubbish.
