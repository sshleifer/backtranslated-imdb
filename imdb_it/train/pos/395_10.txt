Visually stunning and full of oriental philosophy, this fantastic martial arts fantasy is proposed to you by master director Tsui Hark, the man behind some of the best films produced by Hong Kong cinema. The special effects are beautiful and imaginative. The plot is a bit on the cerebral side, but it is a refreshing change from the films that treat their audience as if they were deficient. If the thought is not your forte, however, this may not be your movie. Maybe you should go see the latest news from the no brain club in Hollywood, but if you're looking for something more, it's where you'll find it.
