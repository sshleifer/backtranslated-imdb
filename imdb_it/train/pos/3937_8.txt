Abe Lincoln's early career is beautifully presented by Ford. Not that anyone alive has seen the footage of the real Lincoln, but Fonda, with a fake nose, is as disturbing as Lincoln, with voice, delivery, walking and other ways - just as Lincoln might imagine. Ford, in the first of three consecutive films that he made with Fonda, is at the top of his form, perfectly evoking 19th-century America. The story focuses on a couple accused of murder that Lincoln defends and court scenes are quite well done. The supporting cast includes many of Ford's regular customers. This was Alice Brady's last film, as she died a few months after its release.
