In Panic In The Streets Richard Widmark plays the US Navy doctor who abruptly interrupted his week with a corpse containing the plague. As the cop Paul Douglas rightly points out that the guy died due to two bullets in his chest. This is not the problem here, the two become partners unwilling to find the killers and anyone else exposed to the disease. <br /> <br /> As has been pointed out by any number of people, for some reason director Elia Kazan has not bothered to throw the smaller parts with someone who looks like Louisiana. Having been to New Orleans, where the story takes place, I can attest to it personally. Richard Widmark and his wife Barbara Bel Geddes can be excused because as a Navy doctor they could be assigned there, but for those who are natives it doesn't work. <br /> <br /> But with the plague out there and the news being kept secret, the New Orleans PD starts a network of criminals from the city's underworld. The dead man came out of a ship from Europe and had connections with the underworld. A wise New Orleans essay played by Jack Palance jumps to a bunch of wrong conclusions and starts harassing a cousin of the dead guy who is starting to show sore symptoms. Palance received rave reviews in the first film in which he received the notice. <br /> <br /> Personally my favorite in this film is Zero Mostel. This happened just before Mostel was on the blacklist and at that time he did the game's specialty, it would have been the tough guys who really are toadies. He plays the same role in Humphrey Bogart's The Enforcer. Unfortunately I can identify with Mostel in that last scene of the chase in which he and Palance are chased by Widmark, Douglas and half of the New Orleans police. Seeing Zero being challenged trying to keep up with Palance was another matter because I'm a bit in the Zero league now in the heft department. <br /> <br /> Kazan kept the action going to a good clip, there is very little down time in this movie. If there was less, it would be an Indiana Jones movie. Panic In The Streets won the Oscar for best original screenplay that year. <br /> <br /> Even Kazan made good use of the New Orleans waterfront and the French quarter. Some of the same types of shots are later used in On the Waterfront. In fact, in "The Streets", Panic In The Streets talks about people who don't scream when they really should be in their own interest. Very similar to On the Waterfront. <br /> <br /> Panic In The Streets is proud of anyone who has been associated with it. Now, because Elia Kazan couldn't get a decent New Orleans that played people in small roles.
