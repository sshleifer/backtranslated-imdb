A suspenseful thriller that looks like Deliverance for setting and setting. There are also some very innovative shooting scenes and good music, although the stupid and sometimes seemingly negligent attitude of one of the characters is not suited to the situation, although this is not a mayor problem. It also asks interesting questions about the justice of revenge and the limits of friendship. <br /> <br />
