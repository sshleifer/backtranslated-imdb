A very nice film with a great background provided by the city of Boston and Fenway Park. As a baseball fan and a fan of light movies, he hit a homerun for me. Lots of laughs and lots of authentic baseball scenes with real baseball players and real references to past Bosox failures. And how fun was it to watch a movie with a baseball theme without having to endure an eccentric, over-the-hill, Kevin Costner who took care of himself in an attempt to make believers out of a critical audience? Jimmy and Drew did a great job as a young couple struck by the love that suffered from "jones" by Jimmy's Bosox. It was a little weird and off the mark, but there are really Sox fans who are so fanatical and live their lives through the fortunes of their beloved team. The film proceeded at a fast pace and the final, though predictable, had the charm and sentimentalism of many other popular films, without being overly pretentious. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the return of Willie Garson to the screen was pleasant. I miss the famous "Stanford Blatch" by Sex & the City. It's always fun, even when it does or says very little. <br /> <br /> So buy two boxed seats, some popcorn and get ready for a fun time. "Fever Pitch" is a winner.
