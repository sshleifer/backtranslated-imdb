The title sequence shows the credits written on a sidewalk wet with rain while people trample; the music is provided by someone who whistles "Street Scene" by Alfred Newman. Then we meet Det. Sgt. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who always wanted to be something his old man wasn't: a guy on the right side of the law. But it's pretty bad for a good guy. After various complaints to his henchmen, his boss, Insp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon) portrays him. Foley tells him he is a good man, but he needs to have his head straight and be more like Det. Lt. Thomas (Karl Malden), who has just been promoted. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill, in a splendidly slimy performance) has an illegal dice game and is trying to make a sucker out of the rich Ted Morrison (Harry Von Zell), which was brought by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his beautiful wife Morgan (Gene Tierney). She understands too late that her husband is using her as bait and Paine hits her when she refuses to play. The chivalrous Morrison intervenes but Paine knocks him out. This seems to be the worst, but later it turns out that the boy is dead; and Paine seems guilty. <br /> <br /> But this will not be Paine's story. Soon Dixon fell in love with Morgan, but not before losing his temper again and committing a terrible action that he tries to hide. Morgan's father, a taxi driver who runs the story (Tom Tully), can take the blow. It's up to Dixon to try to blame Scalise. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger directs a screenplay attributed to Ben Hecht and three others from the novel "Night Cry" by William L. Stuart. This is a solid noir film with excellent performance and all the dark photography and the murky morality we expect from this genre. It supports up to the bright end, which looks like something the studio filmed to appease the censorship. Of course, the classic noir directed by Preminger and starring Andrews and Tierney is "Laura". You'll like this, but you can't lose it.
