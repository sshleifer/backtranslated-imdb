This is Animatrix's second short film, and the first of them is what could be called "artistic". It contains many references, metaphors and symbols in the amount of dense material, in particular with a running time of 9 minutes. I have heard some complaints that this is "anti-human", or tries to direct hatred towards the man, for their "sins against the machine". I don't think it's true; simply use robots to show us, that as human beings we are not particularly willing to accept or be open to people other than us. I would say it does a great job. The plot is good ... it sounds like a historical document, which tells what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy. So it contains clips from fictional news and the like. Vocal recitation is very good, if not much. The animation is pleasant and the use of color, despite the usually realistic design style, makes the task of performing uniform transitions and other surreal images more open. This has several bits of strong violence and disturbing images, as well as a bit of nudity. The disc contains a comment, not in English but with subtitles, and worth listening to / reading. There is also a well-made and informative realization, based on both sides, so I would recommend looking at it after seeing the next one. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates the Matrix universe and / or science fiction in general. 8/10
