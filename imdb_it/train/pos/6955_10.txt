My Super X-Girlfriend is a giant roller coaster ride. The special effects were excellent and the costumes worn by Uma Thurman were hubba buba. Uma Thurman is an underrated comic actress, but has shown everyone to be wrong and nailed her role as a crazy girl. It was simply FABULOUS !!! Even Luke Wilson was as good as average Joe, but he was a brave man working with one of the greatest actresses of all time. The supporting cast was also superb, in particular Anna Faris who was extremely good (Much better than the Scary Movie franchise). <br /> <br /> Ivan Rietman did very well in directing this film because if it wasn't for him and Uma Thurman this movie wouldn't work so well. This film is clearly a 10/10 for the cast (Uma Thurman), is the director, is the script and from its original plot. This film is highly recommended.
