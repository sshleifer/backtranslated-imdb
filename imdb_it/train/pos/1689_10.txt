This movie is for Halloween what the exhilarating "Christmas Story" is for Christmas: both are low budget movies, non-big-name-stars ... and both are two of the biggest and funniest movies available, both seasonal CLASSICS !!! "Spaced Invaders" starts galloping from the start with warmth and humor and an exceptional cast of characters ... all five stupid Martians, Klembecker the real estate agent, Russell the deputy, Vern at the "fuel distribution depot" and many more! You just have to watch this movie to believe it, and, like "Christmas Story", it keeps getting better and better with every vision, and every time you take little fun things !! SAFELY TEN !!!
