I saw this movie for the first time while browsing the movie channels about my DirecTV parents. He was on the Sundance canal and he was just starting. I love music, especially the late 60s and this is what the BJM played (The Dandys is fine). Everything about the Brian Jonestown massacre intrigued me with the music, the personalities of Anton and Joel, the use of illicit drugs. It was fun because while I was watching the scene of the first party when everyone was joking my parents passed by and decided to watch (the expression on their faces was priceless). However this is definitely one of my favorite movies because it introduced me to The Brian Jonestown Massacre, which is now my favorite band of all time. <br /> <br /> just look at it ... seriously
