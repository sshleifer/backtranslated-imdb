Because people complain about this movie and not horrible films like The Godfather. Titanic is the largest film of the 21st century. With great acting, directing, effects, music and in general everything. This film has always been abandoned by everyone because one day someone said he didn't like it anymore so most of the world decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this film, not only is the most award-winning film of all time, the most money ever produced and unfortunately one of the most undervalued films I've ever seen. Apart from that, it really is the best film of all time. The only films that come close to being like the Star Wars trilogy and the Lord of the Rings or something from the masters Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good films and directors, but no one lives up to the masterpiece of James Cameron TITANIC.
