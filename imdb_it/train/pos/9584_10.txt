Yes, this film is the best. I can't recommend it more. Gay or tight is a great document for all those who love cinema. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never banal Great access A film made with passion and interest in the subject. Some of the performances are simply amazing. If you find this film only on VHS, it is still worth watching. Great. 10 out of 10. I saw a part of this document about ten years ago and I didn't understand what I was looking at. The interviews reveal a lot about the ego of artists who are like heavy boxers trying to get out of the ghetto. The director was apparently a first timer, so what a result. Cold. find him
