Centered in the city center and in Detroit's outer skirts, this comedy seemed like a fantastic new comic pair. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is a very funny man, who seems to be a Japanese cop on the trail of a thief of trade secrets, who stole a super 'prototype' turbo charger, reluctantly goes to the United States to follow the thief, to have been ordered by his commander. The character of Pat clashes with the character of 'Jay Leno', a quick talk ', but up to a Detroit-style business cop. However, when they cross paths, Japan's "Ways" meet with Detroit police investigative "Ways". The two stumble and stumble over each other at first, but then develop a "rythym" which turns into an explosive two-layer powerhouse team, which solves the cold case. After fighting a city boss for stolen equipment and closing the case, these two go from despising each other to be friends and work well together. A little worse for wear and needing a prolonged vacation above all, they manage to reach a victorious closure. I rated this at 9. Lewis' direction makes this comedy almost perfect. Fun for all ages. I highly recommend it. (***)
