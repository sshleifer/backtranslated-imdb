Chris and Andre are two ordinary and ordinary teenagers. Misunderstood by some and chosen by others. But together they are and everyone will pay. Together they form "The Army of the Two". They design and plan "Zero Day". That day is when they decide to storm their high school and inevitably kill 14 people in cold blood. Told through the tapes that made "Zero Day", it is hardly a fictionalized account of the Columbine tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Zero Day" is one of those movies that will drive you crazy. The two main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andre Keuck) do such a good job that their characters seem to be almost all boys without rights walking down the street. Their performances were very credible, you liked those kids and that was scary. Shot on video almost totally from the point of view of adolescents, "Zero Day" is very real and authentic, as if you were there. These guys try to rationalize their actions to the viewer and the actors sell it to you. But be warned that it follows the tragedy from beginning to end and the end makes it shocking and uncomfortable for some.
