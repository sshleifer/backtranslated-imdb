Absolute masterpiece of a film! Good night Mr. Tom quickly became one of my favorite movies of all time. No one should lose the vision of this film, it's just too good! Mr. Tom is perfectly played by John Thaw as the stern old man who becomes a sweet paternal figure when William Beech (Nick Robinson) is sent to him by evacuation, almost like "the city mouse and the field mouse". A truly heartbreaking film. The director knew exactly how to turn a book into a movie and did it very well. The film was shot so excellently that the emotions of the characters and what was happening meant that the audience felt a range of emotions, from love to fear, and these emotions could have turned into six-pence. Set in a period of turmoil during World War II, this film also shows the difference between cities and the countryside, they are almost like different countries. An absolute must see, those who do not get lost in a truly amazing and brilliant film.
