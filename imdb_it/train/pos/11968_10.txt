Full House is a great show. I still grew up on it today. I started watching it when I was 8 and now I am 12 and I keep looking at it. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. she's my favorite she had such a sense of humor. in case there are people on this show that are unlikely to watch the show, you should because you hook up. I got passionate after the first show I saw, which was the first episode, in 2002. It's really a good show. I really think this show should go down to many generations in families. and it is also beautiful because it is an appropriate show for all ages. and for all parents, teach children the lessons on how to get on with their lives. nothing terrible happens, like violence or an oath. it's just a great sitcom. I give them 5 stars out of 5. what do you think? OH and the best time to see it is when you're home sick from school or even from the old office. It will make you feel much better. Trust me, I'm barely home but I still know that it will make you feel better. and to all those who think the show is stupid, well, this is a shame for you because you won't go that far in life even if you are happy with your life. you should really look at it and you'll be tied up. I'm just telling you what happened to me and everyone else who started watching this amazing show. Well, I need to go have lunch. remember that you have to start looking at the full house and soon!
