people claim their funny version but they had to reduce it substantially in post production. I've just finished being a professor at UCSD, and honestly it's one of the best classes I've had, it's pretty funny here about what happened to doing the part of the movie because Harry is so animated. Initially I saw "the joy of life" for another class in which Harry made a voice in the film and started watching this film after starting the lesson. Originally, Harry did a bit of performance work, and he's really honest about creating moments that move you, especially when you have to change things until you hit that moment, but it's something you see in this movie.
