Call me a teenager, but I really think this is a great series. If you haven't had a chance to try some episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely watch it. Perhaps more compelling than that of Voyager's Caretaker, which launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, the adventures of Archer are completely different, but strangely familiar ... Even the music is captivating. No real science fiction fan can go without seeing at least one episode of Star Trek - and these bets make the wait worthwhile.
