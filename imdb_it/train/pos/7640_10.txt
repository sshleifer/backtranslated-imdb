Mr. Destiny - 3.5 / 5 Stars <br /> <br /> The theme of "Mr. Destiny" is recycled from many films covering many different years. His theme ranges from recent parodies on such plots (see "Scrooged"), to the same more serious and dramatic notion that worked in "It's a Wonderful Life" and a century earlier in the story of Scrooge told by Charles Dickens in "Un canto Christmas. " "It involves an ungrateful man who is followed on a guided tour of his life and witnesses how his life could have been (or would have been) first hand. <br /> <br /> In most of these types of films l 'guardian angel saves a man from ingratitude and shows him his life in retrospect, or as it could have been, should have been, would have been, in this case we are shown a businessman named Larry (James Belushi), who hates his life Lives with a non-exciting wife (Linda Hamilton) and craves a bigger life with a wider meaning: if only he hit the ball at the state championship in high school years ago, he is convinced that his life would be "She was better. She remembers this seemingly small moment in her life because it had a big impact on her subconscious side, but I doubt an adult man would want a single high school act. However, it works in the film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Larry is coming back to home from work one night, where is a penpusher together with Jon Lovitz, when hello s car breaks down. He wanders into a bar looking for a public phone, and reluctantly decides to tell the bartender (Michael Caine) how his life is going. This is where we see him for the first time when he remembers his baseball game for children. <br /> <br /> The bartender listens and nods, apparently without worrying about any other customer. This is probably due to the fact that the bar, even if old and tattered, seems to have never been occupied by any human being who saved these two men. In fact, Larry even makes a comment about never seeing the bar before. This is more likely for some reason than the public expects before Larry. <br /> <br /> So the bartender, who could also be an angel of God incarnate, just like Clarence, fixes a special drink for Larry, which ends up putting Larry's life backwards, showing him what the his life I was like he had hit home running all those years before. But Larry has no idea of ​​any change at the beginning, just as Jimmy Stewart did not realize that Clarence had canceled his life until he entered the bar and was kicked out. Larry continues to be oblivious to any change until he doesn't go to his house to find a different lawn outside and a big wrestling man who occupies his house. Larry soon discovers that his life would have been very different if he hit the home track. Instead of marrying Linda Hamilton, he married Rene Russo and moved into a large villa with children. He finds out that Jon Lovitz is no longer his friend, but his employee. And the most surprising fact of all is that with his new life, which Larry has always wanted ... he finds himself wishing for his old wife, Linda Hamilton; the proof that sometimes money and a grand and superficial-looking wife do not compensate for everything in a man's life, like an intelligent wife, love and true happiness. Just as "It's a Wonderful Life" showed the public that a man's life is what he does and that every person has an impact on people, "Mr. Destiny" shows us that material wealth is not the same spiritual wealth, a lesson taught us over and over again, but never so soft, forgettable and really sweet as shown in "Mr. Destiny". <br /> <br /> "Mr. Destiny" is never exaggeratingly exhilarating, but it is a sweet and good-natured comedy that never takes itself too seriously. The problem with the whole movie "It's a Wonderful Life", like "The Family Man", is that they try to be influential and memorable like "It's a wonderful life". But there are only so many times that you can rip out a famous movie on your own, and "Mr. Destiny" knows it, and plays right at it. He does not try to be something he is not; rather, it is something that it has not tried to be, and this is obvious to the public. <br /> <br />
