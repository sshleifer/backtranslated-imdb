A true American healthy story about teenagers who are interested in launching their own rocket in a rural mining town in West Virginia after the launch of Sputnik in 1957. Through incredible trials, tribulations and perseverance, they are ultimately able to reach their targets. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal, as group leader, is excellent in the title role. Like her motivating science teacher, Laura Linney is pretty good, but her southern accent is exaggerated. <br /> <br /> There is a supporting performance by Chris Cooper, a principal miner, who wants his son to follow in his footsteps, but gradually comes to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so unusual for our times is that there are no bedroom scenes and no swear words. It is the epitome of an American story that is well done. <br /> <br /> In addition to the science corner, we have the father-son disagreement, football scholarships as a way to escape the coal and the loving spirit of the family. <br /> <br /> Why are images like this no longer recognized at the time of the awards?
