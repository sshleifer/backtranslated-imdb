This film is truly original and casual. It's really hard to find movies like this in a lot of movies now in Hollywood. I really like watching this movie, I bought his DVD on Tuesday this week and watched it 4 times. I love Paz's Spanglish accent, she's really pretty like her. And his acting and Morgan are so funny and natural. <br /> <br /> My cinematographic taste could be very different from the others, but I have to say that I love this film, the simple is the best! <br /> <br /> I learned something more about life from this movie (well, or at least the life of the United States) ... life is really random ... Sometimes, you know someone, they pass by your life and they become your friends by coincidence, and you don't spend so much time with them, maybe just a little, but you have fun with "them" while they and then them and they will never meet again, but the time you are together it's really unforgettable. Keep those moments in your mind as grateful and beautiful memories ... <br /> <br /> This movie could be cheap in the price of production, but its meanings are by no means cheap. I can rarely learn something from movies, but this is an exception.
