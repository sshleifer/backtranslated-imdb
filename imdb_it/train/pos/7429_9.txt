She is such an extraordinary singer, who cares about anything else !!!! That final scene is one of the best moments of all the show biz - no one excluded !! I'm glad he kept the camera on himself for ten minutes - she deserves this iconic status - such is the power of the voice. <br /> <br /> I saw this film for the first time when I was five and this had a huge impact on me. I see it today, and yes, I can see some of the flaws (like Esther who wants to leave the Grammy as her prize was announced). <br /> <br /> But some of the other comments from users are simply false - I mean, where is free nudity? Maybe we have seen different movies ??? <br /> <br /> Streisand's singing ability is monumental and if he has a big ego - well! <br /> <br /> He earned it.
