I saw him with all my family at 9 in 1964 on our black and white TV. I remember that my father observed that "this is how it could have happened - Adam and Eve". I vividly remember the scene in which Adam finds Eve, his eyes were blackened. I asked my father why his eyes were blackened and he said it because he was tired and hungry. Not having seen this episode in 45 years, I still remember it vividly - the TV transmits back and forth with the home planet, bomb scenes that shake the headquarters, with the final scene of the two moving away, Adam carrying his pack and Eve which follows. It may not have been a theatrical work of art, but it certainly left an impression on me all these years.
