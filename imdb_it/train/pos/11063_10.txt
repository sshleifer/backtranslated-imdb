I was very impressed with "Waitress" by Shelley Adrienne (2007). This film only confirms what was clear from that film. Adrienne was a wonderfully talented writer-director, an original and unique artist. She managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a warm, optimistic and humanistic tendency. Ally Sheedy steals this film with an exceptional performance like a woman who has fallen beyond the limit. The male leader Reg Rodgers, who looks like Judd Nelson, is fine. There is also a large cameo by Ben Vereen. The song at the end of the film "The Bastard Song" written by Adrienne may represent her optimistic eulogy: <br /> <br /> "It is a world of suffering, <br /> <br /> In a sea of ​​pain, <br /> <br /> No matter how much sun you bring, <br /> <br /> You're punched by the rain ... <br /> <br /> Don't let the heartless heart beat you down, <br /> <br /> Don't greet the ruthless at your door, <br /> <br /> Don't live among the heartless "
