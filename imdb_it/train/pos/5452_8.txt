A pre-code stunner with Stanwyck who plays a prostitute who sleeps at the top. These pre-code gestures leave everything with nothing left to the imagination. Stanwyck is as exceptional as Lilly the daughter of a speakeasy father / owner who has sold more alcohol to his customers (johns). After the old man dies (good!) Barb heads for the big city for better things. Use his feminine attributes to sleep up to the top. John Wayne makes a poor "cameo" and shows that actors improve with age and an acting teacher. I loved the jokes and the strong lines between the actors. I highly recommend this movie to all movie buffs and to see Stanwyck who is as big and beautiful as Lilly.
