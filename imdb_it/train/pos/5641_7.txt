Yes, the plot is predictable; yes, there are some holes in the plot; yes, it has a quality made for TV; and yes, Britney Spears "wrote" the book with obvious self-promotion. <br /> <br /> But forget everything ... this movie is fun. <br /> <br /> Fun in a After School Special sort of way, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Virginia Madsen as the mother does a great job ... so well that I will start watching for her films. It reminded me of Diane Lane for all the good reasons. <br /> <br /> Even the rest of the cast does a great job. If I were a casting agent, I'd be scouting some of these young actors. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are above normal television standards and the music was really great ... better than many big-budget movies I saw. <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for German noir, this movie is not for you. If you want a safe, fun and undervalued film, this is good. It's one that you could show to your 10 year old daughter but have fun too.
