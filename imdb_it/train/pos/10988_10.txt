Don't read anything about this movie (especially nothing that can contain spoilers). Watch this fantastic film without knowing anything about it and you will have a wonderful experience. If you like to see an intelligent and twisted story: go, get the DVD and you won't be disappointed. "Cypher" is not actually a science fiction film, more a psychological thriller set in the globalized business environment. These are company secrets, how big companies spy on research departments and the methods used by them. The actors make a great performance and the general visual style of the film offers a perfect coolness mode. Cypher is much deeper, more complex and - what is the story and the ending - also much, much more satisfying than the other films by Vincenzo Natali "Cube" and "Nothing". It's actually one of the best movies I've ever seen (and that's something I don't really say about every fifth well-made film). Sorry, I can't tell you more about this movie without risking damaging your experience. Give it a chance. ;-)
