As someone who has lived with cerebral palsey for over forty years, I find this film inspiring. If someone with a CP case as serious as Christie Brown can do so much, then there's no reason why I can't fulfill my dreams. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker both give fantastic performances. <br /> <br />
