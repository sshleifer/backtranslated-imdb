My friend had the idea of ​​watching the LOTR animation after seeing the return of Peter Jackson's king. So in the end I bought it from e-bay, thinking it would suck from the start. Actually, it wasn't as bad as I thought. The animation was good for his time, they used a unique method to merge live action with animation to create some interesting effects, and the guy who made the voice for Frodo looked a bit like Elijah Wood . <br /> <br /> Not the biggest adaptation of a book, but believe me, I've seen a lot worse. Skip a lot of things, since both Fellowships and The Two Towers are packed into a two-hour movie. Surely it is worth looking at a watch, children might like it, but anyway, there is no comparison with Peter Jackson's trilogy.
