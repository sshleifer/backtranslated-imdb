first, I would like to say that, while I know my part about star wars, I am not a fanatic. I don't know how many chromosomes a rat rat has or the extended family of TK427. what I know is this: Star Wars, all the movies (but less so with episode 2), captured something magical. it's hard to say what, which button found and pressed with courage, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. it's an idea. <br /> <br /> How can you ask? I will explain it, the Star Wars touch the most universal of stereotypes, good against evil. he does it so clearly, so profoundly, that literally any person from any background can understand. Episode VI does very well, concluding the epic struggle between a child and the accustomed and manipulated father, yet, with the addition of the prequels, it reveals even more the hinted retrospective story. suddenly, it is Darth Vader at the front and the spectators understand that it is the story of Anakin, not only of Luca. but even before the 1-3, there was an incredible depth in all this. it seemed real, as if a capsule fell from the sky into Lucas's knees, describing in detail a historical account of a very distant galaxy. <br /> <br /> Star Wars is definitely something far above the norm, and I have to admit, every time I see them, especially this one, I feel very small. I feel like I've been pushed into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. I have a tingling sensation when I see them, the feeling that something somehow touched me more than anything physical could ever hope for.
