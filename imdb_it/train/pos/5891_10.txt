THE ITALIAN is an incredibly complete film for its time. Amazing shot, with truly sublime lighting effects, it is an early gem that clearly reveals REGINALD BARKER as a pioneer director of equal level to D.W. GRIFFITH and MAURICE TOURNEUR. The control that Thomas Ince has exercised over production is hard to know, but this film still has extraordinary power. The simple story of an Italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in New York is very moving. The themes of social injustice, revenge and forgiveness are completely current today. The use of close-ups is exceptional and the performance of the GEORGE BEBAN power plant is electrifying. What we need now is a really good print transferred to DVD, so you can really appreciate this first masterpiece of cinema.
