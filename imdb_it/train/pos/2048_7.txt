A brutally depressing script and some beautiful low-key performances by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed and some good shots set in the power of Ohio, this beautiful television movie about the hard times in rust. When the mills close and the trade union work disappears, the workers are threatened by everyone: managers, owners, wives and children. Strauss is absolutely credible in his role, and Pamela Reed is, as always, wonderful. See if you can recognize John Goodman before getting fat. <br /> <br /> The heavy metal score - was someone playing a word game? - is, at times, annoyingly annoying, but Frank Stanley's cinematography is out of the question, particularly the mill scenes.
