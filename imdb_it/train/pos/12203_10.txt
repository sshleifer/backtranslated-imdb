"The Lady From Shanghai" by Orson Welles does not have the brilliant screenplay of "Citizen Kane", eg, But the cinematography of Charles Lawton, Jr., the unforgettable sets (like the scene in the aquarium, the scene at sea with a gorgeous Rita Hayworth with blonde tones singing "Please Do not Love Me" and the incredible climax of the Hall of Mirrors), and the wonderful cast (Everett Sloane in her greatest interpretation, Welles in a beautifully underrated role, the aforementioned Miss Hayworth - Welles' wife at that moment - at its peak - offers a truly memorable movie experience. The bizarre plot of the mysterious murder is fun and compelling, not inscrutable, the viewer is surprised by the twists and the line of closing of Welles is an unpretentious classic. "The Lady From Shanghai" gets four stars from this impartial referee.
