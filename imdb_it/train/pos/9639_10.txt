A very close and acute description of the sparkling and dynamic emotional world of an 18-year-old boy who first experiences his gay love with another boy during a vacation with a part of his family. <br /> <br /> I liked this film because of its extremely clear and surrogate narrative, with all these "close-ups of the sound" and quiet moments that had been filled with intense moods. <br /> <br />
