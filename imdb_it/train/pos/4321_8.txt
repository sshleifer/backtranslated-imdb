I will keep this briefly. I think this is an extraordinary film. I see other reviewers who have commented on the effect that is badly written, badly shot, has a terrible soundtrack and, worse, that is not real in his portrait of life. OK, so it may not be credible enough for its entire length, but this film carries a message of hope that some others seemed to have lost. I hope it's not too late to save people from the terrible things that happen in so many lives. Gangland violence is real, right? That's right, no! This film carries an important social message that the cynics may not like, but which must be praised, rather than disparaged. I have seen this film with great pleasure at least eight times, each time with equal pleasure and each time with the feeling that perhaps the world could be improved and does not go beyond saving (well, at least until 2008). 9 out of 10 from me for this. It is almost perfect in my opinion. JMV
