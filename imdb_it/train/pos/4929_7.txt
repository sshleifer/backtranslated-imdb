I can't really condemn the film because it works. There are enough noir elements to consider it a film noir, but I think it is only in the category. <br /> <br /> There is nothing sinister about this piece, and this is where the noir elements fail. Of course, the disease could be considered to be sinister, but I have difficulty seeing it. The film alludes to a dark side: the Blackie could be human trafficking, the New Orleans police are too eager to arrest a reporter, the specter of the plague hangs over all the people in the film ... but those are really alone tips. <br /> <br /> There is no attempt to question Reed's motives, as in the case of Marlowe or Spade, nor is there any attempt to bring a human side to Blackie, which would still make him more contemptuous if human trafficking was actually played. <br /> <br /> This lack of depth is what ultimately fails. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, the acting is good, the writing and the direction are well done ... but there is nothing to make this a film that you should go back over and over again. It is worth looking at once, maybe twice if you don't remember it from years ago, and then putting it away.
