Many years have passed since I saw it, but I feel obliged to defend this gem against those who have upset it. <br /> <br /> It is interesting and unusual to observe the diversity of opinions here. This is the humor that I suppose. It is subjective. It loads through your funny 60,000-volt bone or leaves you cold and you wonder why you gave it time. <br /> <br /> This show has some of Britain's best comedians put together in a story that is stupid and irreverent and the result is hilarious. Dialogue and visual comedy are wonderfully realized and the two protagonists (Cleese and Lowe) are superb together. This was done for them. <br /> <br /> I can't really say more than beg you to find it and watch it. You will not be disappointed and in a world without refined humor, this is a classic and harmless piece of comic genius.
