There is a good reason why Walter Pidgeon warns Leslie Nielson and his crew from the rescue boat, things he dares not dream of. <br /> <br /> Like Dr. Edward Morbius, Pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier. From that moment he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter, Anna Francis. They are the only humans left on this planet that was once the world of origin of an ancient civilization known as Krell. <br /> <br /> The records deciphered by Pidgeon indicate that Krell arrived at a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin. The machines they left still work. <br /> <br /> Maybe it works too well, as the rescue team members start dying and in a particularly creepy way. <br /> <br /> I see all kinds of speculations about a remake and this is a film not to be redone because it is new as it was in 1956. The terms would change, we would now say warp speed instead of hyper drive, thanks to the popularity lasting Star Trek. We may not see the men in the rescue expedition in a flying saucer like a spaceship. It might seem a lot more like the Starship Enterprise or the 2001 Space Odyssey. It's interesting to watch science fiction films of different generations and see how the concepts of the future change. <br /> <br /> The history of Forbidden Planet is timeless, about mortals trying to play God. <Br /> <br /> You can't write on Forbidden Planet without commenting on Robby the Robot. This mechanical marvel, put together by Pidgeon with the knowledge gained in the study of Krell, was rather affected during the day. He had a new lease of life in the 1960s with the Lost in Space robot character. His scenes with Earl Holliman who plays the cook on the spaceship and his adherence to Earl's request for some domestic spirits are very funny. <br /> <br /> Robby and the other special effects were nominated for an Oscar, but lost the Ten Commandments and the separation of the Red Sea. The misfortune of Forbidden Planet to run into a Hollywood founder like Cecil B. DeMille. <br /> <br /> Classicists will recognize the Forbidden Planet as a futuristic reworking of The Tempest that, thinking about it, may have been Shakespeare's venture into science fiction. <br /> <br /> My favorite in the cast is Warren Stevens, whose sacrifice allows Leslie Nielsen to learn exactly what he has to do. <br /> <br /> Never lose this message whenever it is broadcast.
