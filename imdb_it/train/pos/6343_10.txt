Let me set the scene. It's school holidays and there's absolutely nothing in the cinema. I'm with my friend who decides what to see. We are looking for a movie that is starting soon and "The Grinch" comes out. We buy tickets not knowing what to expect. What we got was a rollercoaster of fun. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey (which I can add is my actor No.1 around the world) was absolutely magnificent as the Grinch in the best film of this Ron Howard (next to Apollo 13). The way this film was made, the scenery, the actors, the stage materials and the music was simply fantastic. He really gave birth to this childhood film. <br /> <br /> History is based on the history of the great. As we all know, the Grinch is a horrible person who can't stand Christmas. He lives high above the whoville and has never mixed well with the people of the city. But a little girl will change The Grinch's look on life and others in a drastic way. <br /> <br /> Cindy Lou Who (played by the adorable new actress Taylor Momsem) meets the Grinch as she finds the kind part of him right away. Try to overcome the barrier and help the Grinch to enter and mingle with the people of the city. <br /> <br /> This whole film is a barrel of laughter for the whole family, for both children and parents. A SOLID 10/10. Well done Jim. <br /> <br />
