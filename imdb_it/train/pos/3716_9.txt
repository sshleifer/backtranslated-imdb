I was treated to a vision of Cracker Bag last night before a preview screening of Disney's Holes. I don't know who decided to show it, but I'm really happy to have done it. Cracker Bag is an absolute gem, a snapshot of Australia in the early 1980s seen through a child's eye. The "conversations" between Eddie and his brother were hilarious and, like the rest of the film, so true to life. Every shot carried a great sense of nostalgia because it reminded me of my childhood (having the same age as the director probably helps a little) and the audio has multiplied the feeling. I just hope I can see Cracker Bag again one day.
