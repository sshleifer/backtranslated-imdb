FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF films. His influence has been felt for over a decade. However, some elements relating to the way in which this entertainment for the big screen was intended for an audience in the mid-fifties that has now passed have dated a lot, and the sometimes slow pace of the film does not help. But the compelling central idea of ​​the story involving the ancient and extinct Krell civilization and the "monsters of id" has not lost its charm and continues to make this film a "must-see" film. What interests me most is the fact that the current DVD of this film is terrible. The film has never been so good in home video and the elements are in desperate need of restoration. I hope it will happen soon and we will get a special edition of this SF classic.
