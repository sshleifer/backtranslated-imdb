Another remake of "Fistful of Dollars", the remake of Sergio Leone "Yojimbo" by Kurosawa (suggested by the novel "Red Harvest"). <br /> <br /> This is strictly a B-Movie; taken like that, it's pretty funny. the direction is clear, the acting full of verve, the limits of his well managed "direct-to-video" photography. <br /> <br /> The weakness of the film is in the disastrous decision to marry the "punch" '/' yojimbo 'plot for a subplot of "Once upon a time the West" by Leone. Although Leone directed both "Fistful" and "West", his motives behind the two films could not be more different. The "Nameless Man" (Eastwood) is a borderline socio-economic path with a weakness for destroyed families. Harmonica (Chaeles Bronson) is obsessed with her own family destroyed and obsessed with revenge. These two characters would not have had much to do with one another. To put them together, "Gun Crazy" must distort the plot and complicate it until we lose track of the story we are following. <br /> <br /> But this is a B-Movie after all, and full of action and nonsense; it's fun at that level, don't expect anything else.
