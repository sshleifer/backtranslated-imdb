I saw the original version in English on the video. The choice of Disney voice actors looks very promising. I can't believe I'm saying it. The story is about a boy who meets a girl with a story that is intertwined with his. The two are thrown into one of the most entertaining and intriguing plots in any animated film. The quality of the animation is excellent! If you've seen Disney's work in Kiki's delivery service, you can see the quality of their production. Almost redeems them for stealing the story of Kimba the white lion. (but not quite!) Finally Miyazaki's films are released correctly! I can't wait to see an uncut English version of Nausicaa!
