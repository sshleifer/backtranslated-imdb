Many of the user comments I've seen on IMDB for this movie don't really do it justice. First of all, let me say that this film should not be taken seriously. It should be a funny, yet stupid film that doesn't require thinking, but just enjoying it. If you watch this film with the intention of seeing a masterpiece both in the cinema and in humor, you will be deeply disappointed. Still, if you just want to watch a goofy movie with some talented actors / actresses, and some good catch phrases, then you'll like it.
