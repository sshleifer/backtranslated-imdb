I really enjoyed this movie! It was so good! This film is told by the parrot, Paulie's point of view. Paulie is given as a present to the little girl Marie. Paulie helps Marie learn to talk and become best friends. But when Paulie tells Marie to fly, he falls and the bird is sent away. This is when the adventure begins. Paulie goes through so much to find his way back to Marie. This film is so sweet, funny, moving, sad and more. When I saw this movie for the first time, it made me cry. The courage of the birds and the need to find his Marie for all that time was so moving. I must say that the ending is so sweet and sad, but you will have to watch it to find out how it goes. In the end, the custodian tries to help him, after listening to his story. Will his wife be long lost or not? Find out when you watch this sweet and exciting movie. Your heart will touch you.
