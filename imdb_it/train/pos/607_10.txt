Maybe I loved this movie so much in part because I felt down in the dumps and it's such a beautiful fairy tale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was perfect. Fantastic story, wonderful effects, excellent acting (especially De Niro, which is fantastic). This film made me happier than it was for a while. <br /> <br /> It is a very funny and intelligent film. The joke in the history of the prince's ferocious reign and the consequences, the way in which the magic and the dozens of small intelligent touches indulge in magic all kept me fascinated. This is much of what makes it so good; it is an elaborate film, full of special effects with more stories than the more fairy-tale films, yet there is incredible attention to small things. <br /> <br /> I feel like I'm going ahead and looking all over again.
