This was undoubtedly the best in the "Dirty Harry" series. From the opening credits, you are overwhelmed by a story of revenge that hits hard and is deeply compelling. Sondra Locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman for revenge. Eastwood has many "separate" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot, but show Harry at his best for nothing bad. Loaded with unforgettable characters in minor roles, this film has a key role and should serve as a standard for detective / action films. This is Harry's only dirty film that is raw and lacks any "fluff". I can see it again and again (ok, not in just one session) because it's a rewarding "out for vendenge" yarn. The pace is fast and many scenes are unforgettable. "Go ahead - Make my day ... Do you feel lucky, Punk? ...." The classic Eastwood as only Eastwood, with its anguished and rubbery expressions, and the whispering and threatening voice can do it.
