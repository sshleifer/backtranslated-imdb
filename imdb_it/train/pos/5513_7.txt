From what I've read, many people have been disappointed with this film, compared to the first part. Initially I understood, but after some reflection I think it is wrong to be. Soderbergh continues his work based on the story of Che's life, which began in the first part. The first part told a story of revolution that moved from unpromising origins to conclusive conclusions. The second part tells a story of a revolution that moves from an unpromising beginning to an unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these two parts of Che's life had completely different results. Bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly simple way. The viewer might feel a lot better going out of the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2, but this is the reality of Che's life and I don't think the director is at fault. The film is far from perfect. It's probably too long. At least in the first part we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas were successful. In Part 2 they can't take a break and we see that their numbers are constantly reduced by death and capture. The capture and death of Che are well managed. The film is greatly improved by the fact that the dialogue is in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is again as excellent as the Argentine charismatic. So, if you've seen Part 1, you'll see a very similar story from a very different story in Part 2.
