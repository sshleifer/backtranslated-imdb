The stoic and laconic soldier Sergeant Todd (an excellent and credible performance of the always reliable Kurt Russell) is dumped on a desolate remote planet after being considered obsolete by the ruthless and arrogant Colonel Mekum (delightfully interpreted by the slimy hilt of Jason Isaacs), which ha Todd and his fellow soldiers have been replaced by a new advanced breed of genetically modified fighters. Todd joins a peaceful community of self-sufficient marginalized and must defend this community when new soldiers arrive for a field exercise. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, who works with an intelligent and provocative script by David Webb Peoples, describes a chilling vision of a cold, harsh and cold future in the near future, maintaining a lively rhythm and a tough and gritty tone. In addition, Anderson handles the turbulent moments of humanity well (Todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously suppressed feelings is genuinely moving) and stages moving action scenes with spooky taste. Russell gives a strong and striking almost pantomime portrait of Todd; transmits many emotions without saying much and instead does most of his acting through body movements and facial expressions. Bang-up claiming Jason Scott Lee's shifts as brutal rival soldier Caine 607, Connie Nielson as compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as the kind Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as the dumb little boy Nathan, Gary Busey as seasoned veteran Captain Church, Michael Chiklis as the jovial Johnny Pig and Brenda Wehle as the sensitive mayor Hawkins. Even better, this film makes a profound and meaningful statement about the spiritual cost of being a ruthless soldier and the importance of intellectual force over physical strength. The refined cinematography of David Tattersall, the extraordinary orchestral soundtrack by Joel McNeely and the first-class special effects further improve the overall quality of this exceptional sci-fi / action hybrid.
