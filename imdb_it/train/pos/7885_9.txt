First of all, I have to start this comment by saying that I am a big fan of the Nightmare on Elm Street. I think it's the biggest horror series ever. For me, Freddy is the black man! Of course, Freddy's Dead, which tried to be the last chapter of that time, is a strange film. It does not have the same atmosphere as the previous films. Freddy has a lot of time on the screen. Some think it does less scary, and I agree. And this is, in my opinion, exactly the point. This film exists so we can get to know Freddy a little better, who he is, who he was, how he became the man who pursued our dreams. For some people, it's a bad thing, it's better if we never know because it's scarier not to know why evil is bad. Obviously those people won't like Rob Zombie's Halloween remake. To really enjoy this, you have to see things differently. This is not a strange boy hiding in the bush of your dream world waiting to scare you to death. This was the first and it was fantastic. Over the years, Freddy has killed more and more people and no one could ever get rid of him forever. Now is the time to learn about the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of Freddy's reign of terror. Besides the story of Freddy's past, I also loved the atmosphere of the film. No more children in Springwood, only crazy adults. The nightmare scenes are all fantastic. The soundtrack is fantastic, especially the opening song "I'm Awake Now" was performed by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, The Final Nightmare is a masterpiece of horror and I can't believe it's so undervalued. Maybe it's misunderstood, or I have different tastes! Anyway, all Freddy fans should watch it. It has a lot of scary moments and also funny moments, and a lot of cameo! Prepare yourself for something different and you may not be disappointed.
