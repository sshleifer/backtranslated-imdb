This is a small decent film made in Michigan, about a boy who is haunted by his past, with his abusive stepfather (Gunnar Hansen) and has grown not so well adapted. In fact, he is absolutely crazy, but try not to be too obvious. He also has an entourage, his little demon and angel who follow him. The demon never says a word, but in reality it must not, and it is Max Schreck, disturbing. Let's just say that the angel makes the wheels turn this way, since Eric is busy doing things that make him feel better, like "freeing" the people he decides to need, mostly beautiful young women. This is a decent portrait of madness, and you're a bit on your own at some point to understand something of what's going on, but overall, I watched this from beginning to end very focused on the film because it definitely kept the my interest. It is a little lacking in some areas but nothing on which I can really point the finger. A decent effort and worth seeing IF you like serial killer movies.
