Great work with Warner Bros played by Errol Flynn in one of his best performances. He is often quoted as his best, and I can't judge until I see his "Dawn Patrol". However, his work on "They Deed With Their Boots On" takes some beating. I'm a big fan of Flynn (he's my favorite actor after James Mason - he helps he's an Australian too) and I think it's just wonderful, a big screen presence and also a great actor. It is the centerpiece of "Gentleman Jim" as the legendary boxer with the fantasy game, but it is also supported by a literal script, warm and fun, and by the direction of Raoul Walsh. Every Walsh movie I saw never loses the rhythm of his rhythm, he was really a born director. Walsh directs the ring scenes beautifully, as he does with the lighter moments and that moving final scene between Ward Bord and Flynn. Add to those great production values ​​(the "Gay Nineties" has never been better!) And an adorable supporting cast and it's almost perfect fun. Alan Hale usually played on Flynn's shoulder, but here is his father, and everything still works. Alexis Smith is Flynn's love interest. The two are hopelessly in love with each other.
