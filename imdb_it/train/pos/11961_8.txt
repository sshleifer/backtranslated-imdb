I thought it was a wonderful way to spend some time on a hot summer weekend, sitting in the air-conditioned theater and watching a carefree comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are funny (even the well-suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize that this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen still has full control of the style that many of us have come to love. <br /> <br /> This was the best I laughed at in one of Woody's comedies for years (dare I say a decade?). Although I was never impressed by Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to soften her "sexy" image and plunged into an average but lively young woman. <br /> <br /> It may not be the crown jewel of his career, but he was more witty than "Devil Wears Prada" and more interesting than "Superman" a great comedy to go see with friends.
