The real story of a group of drug addicts who rob a not-so-honest businessman of drugs, jewelry, guns and money. Some would say that this is the tragic story of America in the 1980s when the maximum of peace and free love of the 1960s had crashed into drugs and AIDS. Honestly, these are just normal people with no purpose in life who sit around the height and decide to rob a ruthless man. What is the second part of their general plan? Once they get his things ... they will sit around and get up. Good plan. Even if you don't know the story, there is no suspense in this film and no surprise. The fact that Cox tries to create a kind of heroes popular with these characters, with festive scenes and a montage of their booty, is weak and offensive. The story was better with a more direct approach. As it is, this is just a sad story of little drug dealers being killed by big drug dealers. The biggest story, in more ways than one, is John Holmes. He is the center of this story anyway. This film should have been all about him, his life. It was the one in wonderland, with the wonders that were about to vanish. <br /> <br /> P.S. Although it's not official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes's life. It's not entirely real, but it's a lot more fun.
