This film is far better than the original The Jerk. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves bizarre humor. We have incorporated almost all the lines of this film into our day talk as we did from Monty Python. <br /> <br /> The card game with the hobos and then with Mr. Suicide. The scene at the table and his disgust with the turtle soup. The original Jerk was too choreographed and staged. While I like Steve Martin, it looked like he was trying to get serious. The Jerk Too is a parody and will be appreciated by anyone. The Jerk Too is suitable for families unlike the original The Jerk.
