I have seen this movie many times and I will never get tired. It is a classic in every sense. The film is hysterically funny and at the same time quite moving. For those of you who are not a fan of "subtitles" or foreign films in general, open your mind. This is a great movie for "the beginner" because the story is so funny. Don't get me wrong, it's 100% Japanese (and that's what makes it work), but everyone will get something out of it (even if it's just a big laugh in one of the main characters called Mr. Aoki - one of the funniest characters I've ever had seen!) <br /> <br /> I can't even think of this movie without smiling !! I love it ... and I think most people will be too.
