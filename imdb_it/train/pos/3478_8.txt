This was actually my favorite Scooby Doo series when I was younger. I thought every episode had an extra touch and that the bad guys had a lot of creative (and also very scary and credible) thoughts. Some of the best episodes were "I Left My Neck in San Francisco", "Twenty Thousand Screams Under The Sea", "The Ghoul, The Bat And The Ugly" and "When You Wish Upon A Star Creature". If you've never seen these episodes, please do it. This series was a bit mixed, although there were other episodes that didn't seem to have the same kind of edge as "Rocky Mountain YIIII!" and "The Ransom Of Scooby Chief". Like the previous series, it was very well put together, an interesting and brilliantly designed plot. As everyone says however, it would have been much better without Scrappy Doo. The character was tiring and distracted by the story being told.
