Wow, I forgot how good this movie was until I stumbled upon it while looking through the garage. It's kind of a strange combination of a Michael Jackson biography, a collection of musical cartoons and a story about a superhero fighting to save some small children. The cartoons are good (especially Speed ​​Demon), but the best part of this film is the superhero segment, in which Michael Jackson turns into a car, a robot and finally a spaceship (and it's as strange as it seems) ). Joe Pesci is hilarious and has enough fantastic images and fantastic music to entertain! <br /> <br /> The real gem is still the incredible "Smooth Criminal" video, which makes the film worthy of being possessed only for that part!
