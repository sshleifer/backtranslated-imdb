The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After an exciting set of two, we get the last bet. Here is my opinion: <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum has it all. We have Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the tails of those who know everything. He ran for too long. This time, it ends. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum has a fantastic plot, fantastic writing, fantastic direction, suspense and some of the best actions of the summer. Matt Damon offers perhaps his best performance to date. He has the conviction and the swelling desire of the ailing assassin. <br /> <br /> There are some clever humor here and some nice suspense. Reactions to certain events will make you laugh (in a good way) or cheer. (or both) I heard lots of smart laughs in the theater and a lot of applause. The public loved it. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum offers everything in a well packaged package. All the goods and then some. This is, in my opinion, the best film of this summer. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: excellent conclusion. The best of the trilogy. This is how summer animated films should be made. I love the Bourne trilogy.
