Deanna Durbin really saved Universal from bankruptcy and allowed him to remain a big studio. By the mid-1930s most of the great directors who had been to Universal like Milestone, Browning and Wyler were gone. Only James Whale remained, but his prestigious horror films were behind him. Deanna and Judy Garland appeared in a short "Every Sunday" and initially Garland was suggested for the role of Penny in "Three Smart Girls". When Garland was unavailable, Universal moved to Durbin. Initially she was definitely a support actor, but her potential was so vivid that the script was rewritten to make her the star. Directed by Henry Koster, the film had a European touch. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a beautiful view of a lake in "Switzerland". The "three smart girls" of the title - three sisters, Joan (Nan Gray), Kay (Barbara Read) and Penny (Deanna Durbin) are browsing with Penny giving her glorious voice to "My Heart is Singing". Not everything is going too well on the home front - their father is planning to remarry a younger woman (Binnie Barnes) so the three girls with the help of their trusted nurse (Lucille Watson) decide to go to New York and reunite with their mother. Lucille Watson is remembered for her role as Robert Taylor's strict mother in "Waterloo Bridge" (1941). <br /> <br /> Donna is a gold digger who, along with her snotty mother (Alice Brady), is determined to marry Judson Craig (Charles Winninger). For someone who has no cinematic experience, Deanna is as wonderful as Penny, a typical eager and enthusiastic girl, and looks like a picture. When he sings "Someone to Care for Me" you will untie his father - what a glorious voice he had. It also has one of the funniest lines in the film. When her father consoles her with "I'll take you to the zoo tomorrow", she replies "Oh, I can see enough monkeys around here" !!! <br /> <br /> With the help of Bill Evans (John King) they decide to take an "account" (Mischa Auer) for the romance of women. They organize to meet in a nightclub but due to a mixture Lord Michael Stuart (Ray Milland) is mistaken for the count and Donna falls for him (she thinks she owns half of Australia !!!) The plan backfires while she falls in love with Kay and Donna want to hasten her marriage with Judson. <br /> <br /> Penny decides to take the situation in hand and runs away. She is taken to the local police station where she captivates the cops with her interpretation of "The Kiss" (she is trying to convince them that she is a young opera singer.) Everything ends happily with her mother (Nella Walker) navigating to the patch things with their dad and meanwhile Donna makes the acquaintance of the count (Mischa Auer) and sets sail in Australia with him. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
