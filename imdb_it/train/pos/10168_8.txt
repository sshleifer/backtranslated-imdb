Watch Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in a movie about a dead girl who haunts her new girlfriend. I'm Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives and the guy who carried the "sex panther colony" to Anchorman. If you expect a Golden Globe nominated film, you have to think about how you watch movies. However, if you are willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie, you are in the right place. The characters are all fun. They work together very well. The real match up is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. It's funny as it was on Friends and she was fun and pretty at the same time. I went with my wife, she enjoyed it and so did I.
