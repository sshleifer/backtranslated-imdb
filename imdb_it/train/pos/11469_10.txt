Everyone knows this "Zero Day" event. What I think this film did is not that Elephant showed us what these guys were like. They showed their life for about a year. Throughout the film we come to appreciate them, to laugh with them even though we know perfectly well what they will do. And that gives me the creeps. Because I felt guilty for being cheered by their comments, and I thought Cal was a sweet boy. Even though I KNOWED what would happen, you know? Even at the end of the film, when they were about to commit suicide and deciding only if they had done it on account 3 or 4, I thought it was funny but I was horrified to see their heads explode. Of course I was. I liked them. They were evil, perhaps, but I felt they were normal boys, who didn't realize it. But I knew they were. <br /> <br /> Here, IMO, the main force of this film. It makes us understand that our friends, relatives or anyone else can plan something crazy and we won't even notice it. This film, however good, made me feel bad. And that's why I can't go to sleep right now. There is still this little feeling in my stomach. Butterflies.
