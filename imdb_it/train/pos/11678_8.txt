Clara Bow (Hula Calhoun) is the daughter of plantation owner Albert Gran (Bill Calhoun), who is mainly interested in playing cards and getting drunk with friends. She is interested in riding in the countryside until the engineer Clive Brook (Anthony Haldane) shows up to build a dam. One of her father's friends, Arlette Marchal (Mrs. Bane), therefore competes for her attention. His wife Maude Truax (Margaret Haldane) shows up for the artificial end. <br /> <br /> Many "pre-coded" elements such as the nudist bathroom. <br /> <br /> Wonderful shooting set in Hawaii.
