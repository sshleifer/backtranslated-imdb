Despite the success in comedy or drama, the Turkish directors fail in the horror-thriller. "Okul-D @ bbe" are good examples for the terrible Turkish horror films. <br /> <br /> But if you look at "Gen" you will understand that it is a strike. The atmosphere of the film is impressive and dark. Even the special features are colorful and not cheap. The soundtracks fit the film, but the script is not entirely perfect and the theme of the film is normal. <br /> <br /> As a result "Gen" does not add any difference to horror films, but it does not disappoint fans of the thriller. In this sense it is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10)
