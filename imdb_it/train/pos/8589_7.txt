I'll be honest, I finally checked this film not because of the stars - even though they were reasonably watchable and compelling, particularly the three protagonists - or even the compelling story of a breach in the presidential secret service (something, I "were informed through the extra on DVD of this show, it has yet to happen. Assuming it's true, it's remarkable!) I understood it because it was direct and has a cameo chosen by none other than Detective Meldrick Lewis !! Well, ok, Clark Johnson, one of my favorite of "Homicide: Life on the Street" and a veteran (especially) television director, I would say he does it better than he can with a project that is watchable but rather average, despite the possibilities. <br /> <br /> Veteran and ace The secret agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglass) has to find out who is blackmailing him and who killed his friend, he has targeted and blown up an Air Force One helicopter and is shooting for the Prez (David Rasche . Does anyone remember "Sledgehammer"?). His relationship with the first lady (Kim Basinger, clearly one of the first HOTTER women we've ever had, fictional or real) is certainly not helping his position. He must both find the real mole in the service and avoid the hound like the hunt for his former best friend and colleague officer and boss (Kiefer Sutherland, almost still completely in "24" mode). He throws some other important agents of the service (Martin Donovan and the foxy, a bit difficult to buy like the Eva Longorria concert) and shady foreign characters and you have a rather standard political thriller that doesn't aim as high as it seems and reaches the desired the results, if not disappointing. <br /> <br /> The summary line is the best way to describe how this show takes place without spoiler. The extras on DVD seemed more insightful and interesting to me than the film, even though the film itself was interesting enough to keep most (myself included) interested.
