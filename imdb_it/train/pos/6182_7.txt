This mystery of murder with musical numbers is long in atmosphere and character, but rather short in suspense and plausibility. Based on a play by Broadway showman Earl Carroll and others, it combines a storyline of whodunit with a backstage environment (a murder investigation takes place on the opening night of the theater where a music magazine is set up). <br /> <br /> The cast is impressive and varied: Victor McLaglen is a tough, clumsy police officer who conducts the investigation and never fails to look badly at any showgirl who happens to be in sight ; Jack Oakie (the pre-war Jack Lemmon? Or Jack Lemmon the post-war Jack Oakie?) As the harassed director who must coordinate the staging and chaos behind the scenes; the ever-housewife Jessie Ralph as a wardrobe lover with deep and dark secrets; Dorothy Stickney, who has a magnificent close monologue towards the end, like the trembling maid madly in love with the male protagonist; Carl Brisson, the Danish star, as a very masculine protagonist, warbles the classic "Cocktails for Two" not once but twice; Kitty Carlisle, operatively distributing "Where do they come from and where do they go?" And other Johnston-Coslow songs; the glorious Gertrude Michael, who separated from us too early, like a showgirl with a petty spirit whose love for Brisson is rejected; the usual ridiculous Toby Wing, which at least here is the center of a laugh that makes fun of jokes. <br /> <br /> When the complications of the plot get out of hand there is always an interesting performer or a fun and melodic musical number to distract the viewer. The most famous sequence of the film is the number "Marahuana", directed by Michaels, but apart from its controversial story, it is really one of the minor musical offerings. All the songs here are staged as if they could actually fit into a standard proscenium theater space, as opposed to the Busby Berkeley-style fantasy film setup.
