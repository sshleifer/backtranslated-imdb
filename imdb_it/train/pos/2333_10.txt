I recently started watching this show, and I have to say that it really made me laugh. You have to appreciate the unrealistic aspects of it, along with everything else. Some other people have said that this show should have more realistic reactions than the dead, among other things. If you accept that Ned can bring the dead back to life, you have to accept that the other pieces are completely crazy about the show. I couldn't help but smile after each episode I saw. I really think it's great that there's a show out there that can take a very strange subject and make it really cool to watch. I love storytelling, I think it adds an extra touch to the show. You can't always compare a writer's old shows with new ones, you have to take everything as if it were your own entity. Definitely give it a chance, and enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are.
