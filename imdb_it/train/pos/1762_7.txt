Okay, here's the deal: if you feel easily offended, you might want to stay very, very far from it. There are some painfully funny moments in the film, but I probably blushed as much as I laughed. Actually, I probably blushed more than I laughed. And if I wasn't literally blushing outside, then I was blushing inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this film that embarrasses you, then you have no shame. Whether this is a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder I suppose. <br /> <br /> I will not deny that I laughed a little, but this is a film that I simply cannot give a general recommendation because of its subject matter. If I had to say, "This movie is hilarious, go take a look!" and a sweet, small and elderly lady who goes to church goes to the theater and has a heart attack during one of the graphically explicit sexual situations, well, it's just something I don't need on my conscience. <br /> <br /> So how vulgar is it? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Honestly. My mother would go out during the first scene. I feel it is my duty to at least warn you of what to expect. <br /> <br /> There is a cleverly intelligent comedy here, but that's what I expect from the man (Judd Apatow) who had a hand in both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm all for teasing Michael McDonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money. Paul Rudd proclaims: "If I listen to Ya Mo, there will be once again that Ya Mo will burn this place", is hilarious, but it is one of those things that most of the public will not appreciate. <br /> <br /> And when we see a quick 3 second flashback of Steve Carrell singing along with Cameo's Word Up, I laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over, while most of them all giggled and then he forgot. > <br /> Strangely, despite the madness, there is an admirable moral for the story. The film does not portray Carrell as a crazy loser just because he is a virgin. He is really interpreted as a nice and admirable character. Sure, it's a little weird. After all, he has a poster framed in Asia, "more Asian boy video games," and a toy collection that features the Million Dollar Man BOSS, but we're never led to believe that there's actually something wrong with it that he is a virgin. Strange as it may seem, there is a bit of a "OK to wait" message. <br /> <br /> But man, oh man, please be warned that this pushes your R rating to where it can go. This was certainly the intention of Apatow. According to him, he simply let some of the guys (especially Rogen and Malco) improvise and talk the way they normally talk, all in an attempt to find many new ways to be dirty. If you can handle it or talk like that alone, then you'll love the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of excessive swearing and sex jokes. I find that subtle and intelligent humor is a lot more fun than about 200 uses of f-word and fratboy sex discussions. But it's me. As I said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself if it's worth watching one of the most vulgar movies you could ever see in the cinema. I just don't know how much most women are interested in what is being discussed by men while playing poker. Honestly sir, you may not want to know. If you've ever been curious about why some girls think kids are bad, well, that gives you a good idea. <br /> <br /> Here is - my humble, honest opinion on what to expect. Be your guide. Certainly it should not be seen with your Sunday School class, mother, grandmother, family members of the opposite sex, children of any age, or anyone who is easily offended by excessive vulgarity or explicit sexual discussion. If you saw it with one of the precedents, apparently you have no concept of what it means to be uncomfortable.
