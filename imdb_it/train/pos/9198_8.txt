B film? Yes. DO YOU DO? Yes. First movie? Yes. But Aestheically A +. This film has definitely had a bad sound / editing / lighting / acting / etc. problems etc. However, this film has many positive things about it. First of all, the most annoying character dies first! Secondly, it's made to be a parody / funny B Rated Horror movie. The comments our killer makes to his victims let me and my friends roll on the floor laughing. <br /> <br /> The problem is that many people try to take every independent film and expect it to be a masterpiece. Take it for what it is, a group of kids just out of high school made their first film. For what it is, only that, it's really good.
