Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in espionage stories and didn't know it. The only reason I saw it was Nick Nolte, who has been one of my favorite actors since I saw "Breakfast of Champions" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the film brought me a pleasant surprise. Obviously Nolte was exceptional, but so was the plot. There was relatively little political intrigue and much more attention to the moral question: reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with secret messages hidden from the Americans, he actually contributed to the general attitude of the Germans (and, as it turns out, Americans) towards Jews or Hitler. What brings more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-Semitism? The dilemma is even more important as these words are never spoken, not even as narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who has learned to hide his feelings so perfectly that it does not open, not even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film manages. <br /> <br /> There are other points in it, such as the humor or ironic use of romantic clich√©s (like the song White Christmas), which make it very different from average American movies. I recommend it to everyone who is bored by Hollywood spy movies.
