This episode introduced Holodeck in the world of TNG. The Jaradas must be contacted and a precise greeting must be given or insult them very much. A tired Picard decides to take a trip to the Holodeck and start a wonderful adventure. The settings are superb and almost like movies. Unfortunately, the Jarada probe sent shortly after it damages the holodeck and all its safety devices stop working. Picard and now the guests must outsmart the American gangsters of the 1940s and return to Jarada's appointment. Picard greets the Jarada correctly and a new day rises between humanity and the Jarada. This jewel of an episode of the first season set the holographic bridge for many interesting and unusual adventures
