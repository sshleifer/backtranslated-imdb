This Belgian film, directed by Tom Barman, lead singer of the well-known dEUS group, will not be favored by everyone. For the simple reason that there is no clear story or even a plot. This film shows only 24 hours in "a city" (here Antwerp) and allows you to really watch and enjoy the dialogues, the direction, the humorous (Dario !, the osteopath Bruno !, ...) and tragic (Windman , Paul Garcin, ...). <br /> <br /> There are several memorable scenes: the Windman on the beach, the dance party at the end, the KISS-fan, Windman visits the osteopath, ... <br /> <br /> Clearly some others viewers have not understood what is so beautiful and interesting in this film. They complain that this film has no history, etc. But it is the atmosphere that keeps you looking and that will drag you inside. <br /> <br /> If you haven't looked at it yet, make sure you listen carefully to the music. The soundtrack is extraordinary just like Tom Barman and his dEUS group. <br /> <br /> E "ssst, mondje dicht h√©." (do not tell anyone)
