In 1990, the world of Disney TV comics was certainly in first place. Shows like Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Gummi Bears were already popular, and now Disney has created another great cartoon and that cartoon led to the birth of Disney Afternoon. That cartoon is called TaleSpin. It's about the old Jungle Book character, Baloo the Bear, getting a job in the airplane industry. In the series he meets Kit Cloudkicker, former Air Pirate and good surfer, the businesswoman Rebecca Cunningham and the hyperactive daughter Molly. This series is a lot of fun and has lots of nice word games that you might not understand as a child, but understand later in life. This is a cleverly written series and it's great to add to your DVD collection. Parents, buy this for your kids rather than show them all those horrible Nickelodeon cartoons. If you liked TaleSpin, check out "Darkwing Duck" and "Goof Troop". Spin it!
