Of course, 65 years have passed since Thalberg's last production. But IMDB members, come on, this movie is definitely one of the masterpieces of the 1930s! It's a 10. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I saw at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, around 1970 (I was a teenager). Expensive but with scenes of such poverty, masterfully photographed, often electrifying and always engaging, for me it was the MGM film at its best. What did the public feel when they saw an attack of locusts, the destruction of a villa by person, the horrible poverty and then the splendor of wealth. <br /> <br /> Last week, those watching the Academy Awards saw the Oscar-winning "senior" Luise Rainer. How nice to see an actress who presented one of the most masterful and haunting performances in history that she decided to return for a party. <br /> <br /> Ok, so you shouldn't have won the year before (Great Ziegfeld), but don't blame Luise. The talkies only had a decade when he was released, and his dialogue was limited. But like Olan, his use of visual and vocal elements is memorable. <br /> <br /> On a large and moving scale, what a film lover could want more!
