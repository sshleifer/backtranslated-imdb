Let's start this review on a positive note - I'm very happy that they didn't decide to go wild with Tony while they were shooting and do a retrospective season as if someone were talking. In fact, the creator and writer of this episode David Chase did exactly the opposite. We don't really know if Tony will live or die. She is in a coma and her chances of recovery are very scarce at all. This episode seemed to move very slowly, and the coma-induced dream Tony was involving an incorrect identity and the Asian monks dressed in bias slapping his ass were absolutely strange. After 45 minutes I got a little tired of all those who suffer, but it should not be a reason to slam this episode. It was a strange and unpredictable episode, but it was still well written and intense. Edie Falco gave a stunning career by defining the performance in this episode as the wife in conflict who faces the potential disappearance of her husband. I also found AJ abandoned school and vowed revenge against Junior, which AJ most likely won't have the balls to pull out. Silvio is now head-acting that opens many doors to problems in subsequent episodes. There have also been many excellent jokes in this episode, and I think Vito "Pole-Smoker" Spadafore can meet his death if he continues to be an avid SOB <br /> <br /> This was not a great episode and disappointed just because even if Tony kills people, we adore him as a public and feel that he is our show hero. This was a necessary episode for the series, even if it was a bit of snoring that led to the conclusion. Congratulations on the performance of Edie Falco, and David Chase and the writers for creating this completely original and unpredictable plot. This is the only season of "The Sopranos" in which I have no clear idea of ​​where it will go. I can't wait for next week's episode. My vote: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Best line of the episode: (Paulie to AJ): "Come on, Van Helsing!"
