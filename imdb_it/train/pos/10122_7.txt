I found this a bit difficult to follow to the extent that it seemed to plunge into the middle as I tried to make the head or tail of who was fighting who and why. One of the problems is the cultural / linguistic one. Here we have a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading the English subtitles we inevitably lose some of the subtleties. Another problem is that there seem to be too many segments and coincidences only half explained. However, it seems unlikely that there is a completely bad Miki movie and this is certainly not that. A lot of elegant and obsessive violence, a window on some less orthodox sexual aspects and the family aspect. All in all a decent ride, but maybe checking out the plot could actually be useful before looking at this.
