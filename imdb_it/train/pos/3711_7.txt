"The Gingerbread Man is the first thriller I've ever done!" ?? Robert Altman <br /> <br /> In 1955 Charles Laughton directed "The Night of the Hunter", a spooky section of southern Gothic in which Robert Mitchum plays a scary serial killer. One of the most famous sequences in the film consists of two children fleeing Mitchum on a rowboat, the children playing frantically as Mitchum wades behind them like a monster. <br /> <br /> Seven years later Mitchum played an equally ghostly assassin in "Cape Fear", another film set in South America. That movie was about a local lawyer trying to protect his family and he also ended up with Mitchum who was terrorizing people on a boat. In 1991 Martin Scorsese, trying to expand and tackle something more mainstream, reworked "Cape Fear", a boat scene and everything. <br /> <br /> Now we have "The Gingerbread Man" by Robert Altman, another slice of small southern Gothic town. Altman says he consulted "The Night of the Hunter" for inspiration and faced a mainstream film purely because he wanted to "spread his wings and try a popcorn movie", but what he's secretly trying to do here is deconstruct the canonical films of the genre of Southern Gothic. <br /> <br /> So instead of a showdown on a small boat, we get a showdown on a giant ship. Instead of two children being abducted, two children are safely returned to the police. Instead of hidden money, we have money that is readily given through a last will and a will. Instead of the upright lawyer of the 1961 film and the deplorable lawyer of the 1991 remake, we get a rather three-dimensional lawyer to Kenneth Branagh. Instead of the monster that chases the family, the hero pursues the villains. Instead of the monster that breaks into the family's houseboat, we have the hero who hunts the monster aboard the monster's "ship house". Similarly, instead of a murderous serial killer we get an innocent wacky starring Robert Duvall. . . etc etc <br /> <br /> Altman goes on indefinitely, inverting everything slightly a little, pulling the edges and doing its thing. His touch is more evident during the first half hour of the film, the film exists in a restless space between the traditional cinematic narrative based on the plot and Altman's passion for superimposed dialogue, casual narratives, camera movement and the way the characters are not so much presented as they are simply part of what is happening. <br /> <br /> Despite the best intentions of Altman, the film never exceeds mediocrity. Altman is too tied to the conventions of the "thriller format" to do a lot of damage, his style is too lethargic to generate tension and the film is simply not radical enough to oppose other canonical films of the genre. "Gingerbread Man" is therefore too mainstream to function as a purer Altman film and also Altman to function as a mainstream thriller. <br /> <br /> The film is not a complete waste, though. Robert Downey Junior, Kenneth Branagh and the usually intolerable Daryl Hannah, turn into juicy shows. The film also has a nice atmosphere, set against an approaching hurricane, and the final act contains interesting twists. Although it is not the total disaster of Scorsese in "Cape Fear", the film has never been anything special. <br /> <br /> 7/10 ?? In the late 1990s, Altman made 3 subsequent films set in the South American: "Kansas City", "Gingerbread Man" and "Cookie's Fortune". Unlike "Gingerbread Man", both "Kansas City" and "Cookie's Fortune" tackle the genre on the larger and softer canvases with which Altman was most comfortable. <br /> <br /> "Kansas City" is the most important of these two films, its hierarchies of class, politics and crime, and its desire to break radically from the typical gangster genre paintings, would prove to be influential on all the 21 series writers of film crime of the century (see, for example, "The Wire"). That said, "Cookie's Fortune", while a much slimmer story, is perhaps the best photo. <br /> <br /> Note: Altman claims this is his first thriller, but he directed "Images", an art house thriller, in 1972. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
