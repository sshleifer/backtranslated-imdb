(spoiler?) <br /> <br /> while historical accuracy may be questionable ... (and with the mass appeal of inaccurate LOTR ... such things are more easily excused now) I liked the art of it. Although it is not really an auteur film. From time to time it provides some emotionally loaded scenes. <br /> <br /> I have two complaints. 1. It's too short. and 2. The voice you hear whispering from time to time is not explained. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replayable: 5/10
