The first time I saw this episode it was a shock to me, actually it was the first time I saw "24". The speed at which things are going is incredible, and it's so surprising, electrifying and even interesting, it's almost like I'm reading a book; once started, it is very difficult to stop. From the moment Richard Walsh was talking privately to Jack about the possibility that they had a mole inside CTU, I was sitting at 6:40 am, which means 10 episodes !!! (He looks funny and crazy, but I'm the kind of guy who can't stop when he's interested.) This series is one of the best of its kind. And it's built in a way of having different stories that are connected to each other. Recommended in every way!
