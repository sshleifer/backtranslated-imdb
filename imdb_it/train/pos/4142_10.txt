FATTY DRIVES THE BUS is simply the most fun, original and fun piece of work I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. <br /> <br /> this film is by no means up to the standards of Hollywood, or even a straight-video fluff comedy starring Terry "hulk" hogan, in terms of working with the camera , editing, acting, budgeting, or anything else. <br /> <br /> what this film does have, however, is very original and a funny story, and it is obviously made by people who love doing it, and the enthusiasm of the whole cast and crew really breaks through all its budgets his falls. <br /> <br /> this film shows that you don't do it. I need a huge budget or decent actors to make a great movie, all you need are some original ideas and a passion for what you're doing . <br /> <br /> simply the best film ever. I don't care how you get it, rent it, order it, steal it, download it, just watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I just hope they make a DVD version.
