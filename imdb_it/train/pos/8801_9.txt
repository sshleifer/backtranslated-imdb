This is the biggest movie I saw in 2002, while I'm used to mainstream movies. He is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act from these 11 short films. From the technical information (the chosen directors), I feared that it would have an anti-American base, but ... it is a kind of (11 times) personal tribute. <br /> <br /> The weakest point comes from Y Chahine: he fails to "swallow his pride" and considers this event a well-deserved punishment ... It is really the weakest part of the film, but this testifies to a true freedom of speech for the entire piece. The strangest thing comes from the almost conceptual film on Mexican art ... I'm still not sure what A. Gonz√°lez Inarritu meant. The other 9 are perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or almost perfect (C. Lelouch) and they made me smile, or cry or even left me stunned. I still don't know if the fable of St. Imamura is really related or not to the catastrophe of September 11th, but it is so pretty that its final finale "really does".
