I loved this growing show and I still watch the DVD of the first season at age 19 today. What can I say? I grew up in a house very similar to Full House. I had a dad, two sisters and a dog. I guess the only difference was that I didn't live with my uncle and my father's best friend. Besides, I grew up with my mother at home. I don't know what I would have done without Full House on television. I think Stephanie (played by Jodie Sweetin), D.J. (played by Kirk's sister Cameron, Candace), and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can identify with each of them because they are the middle child of my family like Steph, I am a younger sister like Michelle and I am an older sister like D.J. I really like the way the show always has moral values, because today I don't like O.C. I also like the Full House comedy. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier) and Danny (Bob Saget) are as exhilarating as the uncle, dad's friend and the daddy of the girls, respectively. The story goes that, after the girls' mother dies, Danny's best friend, Joey, and his brother-in-law, Jesse move in to help raise the children. Three men trying to raise three girls = hilarious. Every Full House character is heartfelt, funny and genuinely believable. Joey is an aspiring comedian with the heart and soul of a child. Jesse is the cool, motorcyclist, sturdy uncle who is softened by his three nieces, and later, his wife Becky (Laurie Laughlin, of Summerville). Both children and adults will love this show. Guaranteed.
