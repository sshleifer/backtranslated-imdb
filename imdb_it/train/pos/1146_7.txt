This film is about an imaginary soap opera. It's very fast and fun. Saying more could ruin the film. There are different textures and subtitles in the film. This film has a choral cast with today's hottest stars. All give the best performance. This film has been my favorite since 1991. Soapdish is perfect for everyday soap opera fans or prime time soap operas !!! If you look at the soap go and see this movie it's fun !!!
