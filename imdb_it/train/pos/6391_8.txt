Taken this movie at the Arizona International Film Festival. I didn't expect much (although the festival director told me it was one of the best films presented). Five minutes later I was sold. Shot in black and white on a tight budget, this film is hilarious. The acting is solid, the writing is solid and the appearance of the film is solid. Acting is probably the biggest revelation, since most movies shot on low budgets tend to have amateur or theatrical acting. Not this one. Presents one of the most convincing, engaging and amusing portraits of a character with Tourette syndrome I've ever seen. The plot is twisted without being confused and vulgar without being free. If you get the chance, watch this movie. Filmmakers like Majkowski (I hope I understand it well) deserve the chance to show their stuff to a wider audience.
