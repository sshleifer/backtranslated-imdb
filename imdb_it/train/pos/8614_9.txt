The film aroused my interest, mainly because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress. I disagree with some of the other posts that the plot was not twisted. I had no problem following him (maybe some people had too much eggnog the night before). The film was also very sad and moving. What do you want more? Alexa Davalos is an excellent new talent (also beautiful), and Tom Everett Scott does a great job with his part too. The relationship between mother and daughter may have been a bit unrealistic, but the behavior of young people in the film was not. It was tragically sad but illuminating. He certainly beat the other shows that were on TV on New Year's Day
