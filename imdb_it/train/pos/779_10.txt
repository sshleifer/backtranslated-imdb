In the northeast of Brazil, the father of the twelve-year-old illiterate Maria (Fernanda Carvalho) sells her daughter to the middle man in a prostitution organization, Tadeu (Chico Dias), to be hired as a waitress and have a better life. However, the girl is resold to the peasant Lourenço (Otávio Augusto) who defecates her, and gives the abused girl to her teenage son to have her first sexual experience. Then she is sent to a brothel in a field of gold in Amazonas and her owner, the deplorable Saraiva (Antonio Calloni), is explored. When Maria flees to Rio de Janeiro expecting a better life, she is explored by the cáften Vera (Darlene Glória). <br /> <br /> "Anjos do Sol" exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in Brazil through the fate of the girl Maria. Last year I saw "Lilja 4-ever" which tells an identical story in the former Soviet Union; so this problem exists in Third World countries. The director and writer Rudi Lagemann presents a great film that exposes the reality but that never shows nude scenes or explicit sexual scenes. It is the debut of promising Fernanda Carvalho, who has an excellent performance in the role of a frightened child struggling for survival. Most prostitutes are amateurs, and it is impossible to recognize the famous Darlene Glória so different as to be after many plastic surgeries. Even the bitter and hopeless end of history is very realistic. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("Angels of the Sun")
