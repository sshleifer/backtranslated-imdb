"Hamlet" by Kenneth Branagh hits all points. The acting is magnificent, the 70 mm cinematography is stunning, the costumes and sets nominated for the Oscar are sensational, and the soundtrack by Patrick Doyle (also nominated for an Oscar) is sensitive and moving. Oh yes, the script, by a certain Will D, is not so bad. Film critics have lined up Branagh for receiving the fourth Oscar for the film, "adapting" the script, but his decision to use the full text was courageous. I can't think of many better ways to fly the four hours. <br /> <br /> Almost every decision Branagh makes his works brilliantly: the use of the English Blenheim Palace for exteriors, the Edwardian dress and the staging of "To be or not to be" in a hall mirrors, to name a few. The casting of Hollywood luminaries such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in minor parts can be distracting, but this is fussy. The main cast excels: Derek Jacobi captures Claudio's conflicting nature; Kate Winslet sharply describes Ophelia's descent into madness; Julie Christie brings the passion for her portrait of Gertrude; Richard Briers is perfect as a conniving Polonio; and Nicholas Farrell elevates Horatius's potentially ungrateful role to the apotheosis of true friendship. Every speech, every line, every word is delivered with passion and conviction; there is no wasted moment in the whole film. The final scenes amplify the extent of Shakespeare's tragedy in a way not possible with theatrical adaptations. <br /> <br /> Branagh's Hamlet is a bold, ambitious and ultimately successful attempt to match the grandeur and poetry of Shakespeare's language with equally eloquent images. Is it perhaps the greatest Shakespearean adaptation ever filmed? Strong praise, but well deserved.
