This has always been one of my favorite movies, and it always will be. In the last few years I have become a science fiction maniac in the 50s / 60s, trying to collect all the best ones that were made then. I like a lot of things about them from how trivial they might be as some of them were technically correct. Great colors and sets make me go too. It's a shame when they do some of these good old movies; they almost always fill it up, - just look at the recent makeover of The day the Earth stopped, it's total garbage !! Forbidden Planet is one of the reference space films of all time, and now they are trying to do it too, and I shudder to think about what the new will be like! In my opinion, some things, like the fantastic classic films, should be left in peace to be what they are, classic examples of great attempts to tell simple stories and give people a thrill in the process. Once they have added all the technology we have now, the film seems to be more dog meat than the Hollywood sausage factory, nothing special. By the way, I notice that the astronaut uniforms on the Forbidden Planet were also used for "Queen of Outer Space"! This tells you that budgets were a little lower, right? Hey, less money and better movies, hmmm .... <br /> <br /> Great shows in this movie by Leslie Nielsen, in a serious role, and Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (which has always been one of my favorites actors), Earl Holiman and of course Robby the Robot! <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic and the plot is not too far-fetched. This is a great science fiction experience!
