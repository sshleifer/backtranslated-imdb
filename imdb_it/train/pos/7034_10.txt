when all the aspects of the film are added --- the dance, the singing, the acting --- the only one that stands out as the best in the cast is Vanessa Williams ... her dedication, her energy and her beauty timeless they make Rosie the perfect role for her. I've never seen anyone portray Rose so vividly! Vanessa's singing talent shows itself beautifully with all the songs she plays like Rose and her acting skills never cease to amaze me! His dances are so incredible, even if some people say that the choreography was bad --- his dancing skills were better shown than ever! I would recommend this version beyond '63 just because I find that although Vanessa's long acting is superb ----- not to mention the fact that Jason Alexander and the rest of the cast are also very impressive (with the exception of Chynna Philips. .. what the hell were they thinking when they launched it?) <br /> <br /> All in all I would say that this version is wonderful and I advise everyone to see this version!
