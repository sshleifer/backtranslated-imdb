What can we say about a film that has one of the blackest, most nihilistic and, sometimes, strangely - I will not say "nice" ... I will say the "charismatic" villains in the history of cinema and the best battle with swords by when were Flynn and Fairbanks at their peak? This is an epic about a stubborn, sometimes insane, incredibly courageous and honest struggle for his honor and freedom against tyranny. I loved it. John Hurt and Tim Roth were big villains. Jessica Lange was very moving, tender and sensual.
