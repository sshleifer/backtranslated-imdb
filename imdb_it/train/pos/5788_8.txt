This episode was apparently born of the cold war. There was a holocaust, but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson came out unscathed. It then becomes a battle for the turf. She is attracted to him and vice versa, but the survival instinct takes over. It is a silent and slow chess battle, as they try to achieve trust. They come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again. Of course, the male role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers may find that his need to follow him is a little offensive. But it's still appealing and interesting. Because she doesn't talk, we don't know the mind very well here, but in the end we can guess.
