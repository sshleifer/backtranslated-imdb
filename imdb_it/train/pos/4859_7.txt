I read that Jessie Matthews was contacted and refused co-star with Fred Astaire in Damsel in Distress. Jessie Matthews in bloom has never left his side of the pond to make American musical films. If they had collaborated for this film it would have been a life-long event. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because Damsel in Distress has everything else to do it. Fred Astaire, history and adapted to the screen by the author P.G. Wodehouse, Burns & Allen for the comedy and songs of the Gershwin Brothers. In response to the question posed by the work Nice If You Can Get It, there is not much more to ask for this film. <br /> <br /> Except for one protagonist. Although Ginger Rogers has made several films from Fred Astaire, Damsel in Distress is the only film that Astaire made without Rogers while they were a team. The young Joan Fontaine was cast in this opposite Astaire. <br /> <br /> His character has nothing of the bite that the parts of Ginger Rogers do in these films. All he has to do is act gently and modestly. Moreover, it does not contribute musically. And if I had to classify all Fred Astaire's dance mates, Joan Fontaine would have gone out. The poor woman is simply horrible in the number of things they are looking for. <br /> <br /> When he later performed in a musical with Bing Crosby, The Emperor Waltz, it is no coincidence that Fontaine is given nothing to do. <br /> <br /> The version I have is a colorized and in this case I think it actually did some good. P.G.'s idyllic lush English countryside Wodehouse is really presented in this VHS copy. Especially in that number that I mentioned earlier with Astaire and Fontaine which takes place in the garden. <br /> <br /> Burns & Allen on the other hand as a couple of old vaudeville soldiers complete Astaire in style in the Stiff Upper Lip issue. The surreal sequence of the fun-house is wonderfully set up. <br /> <br /> P.G. The aristocracy of Wodehouse goes hand in hand with Constance Collier for her proud high and for once Montagu Love as Fontaine's father as a good man in the cinema. <br /> <br /> The biggest success of A Damsel in Distress is A Foggy Day perhaps the most famous song of the British capital since London Bridge Is Falling Down. Made in the simplest and most elegant way of Fred Astaire, it is one of those songs that will last as long as London and even after. <br /> <br /> Overlooking the young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine, A Damsel in Distress evaluates as a classical, classical, classical dance, classical comedy. Who could ask for more?
