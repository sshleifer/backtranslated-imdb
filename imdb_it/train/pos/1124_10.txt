I agree with all the awards, I went through a box of handkerchiefs watching this movie. It had a raw authenticity and sounded true in every way. <br /> <br /> The question I am about to raise represents a current sensitivity regarding the treatment of animals. I had a very difficult time with the beginning of the slaughter of sheep and goats, and the dying deer with its pulsating neck and the blood that accumulated while his life was empty was horrible. <br /> <br /> This is the age of "no animals" were injured in the production of this move ". Iphigenia was created in the late 1970s before the advent of computer simulation. It was possible to falsify these dead animals or have these animals been slaughtered for art?
