I had put it on my TIVO for a rainy day because of the cast, some really challenging people in the industry, and when I finally saw that I was NOT disappointed. <br /> <br /> This film has some flavor similar to Altman (it is mentioned in the credits as a "thank you" person) using apparently independent and independent plot lines that intertwine as the film nears its peak . Macy is as pure, clean and honest as a man who cannot escape his "destiny", Sutherland plays and portrays as few as possible, Snow adds splash to a deliberately attenuated environment, adds Tracy Ullman, Barbara Bain (remember Mission Impossible in TV?), Not to mention the constant John Ritter and you have all the ingredients for a good movie. The script is orderly, the dialogue is free from clich√©s and reflective (in particular between Macy and David Dorfman). Suspend your beliefs and have fun, this is really time well spent.
