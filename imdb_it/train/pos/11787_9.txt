It's a short film by David Lynch with only 8 minutes, but it has all the "Lynchian ingredients"! It is mysterious, dark, inconclusive, disturbing and strange; and before the blonde girl starts talking, it's even a little scary! The soundtrack is exceptional for creating this strange atmosphere because it is also sinister and mysterious ?? <br /> <br /> Regarding the same setting, it does not have the "traditional" red curtains, but has purple-painted walls, which give it an equally strange effect. <br /> <br /> the plot is about a girl who is locked up in a dark room and cries for help; then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way, saying she's there just because of her? We don't know what happened or what will happen next ?? it ended unresolved and puzzling, like a good Lynch movie must end! <br /> <br /> It is a great success, despite some amateur acting. The girls are professional actresses, but I think their acting could have been better in this short.
