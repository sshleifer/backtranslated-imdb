Thank God this was not based on a true story, because what a story it is. Populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds, Before The Devil is a mesmerizing and stunning excursion into the perversion that would be laughable (and sometimes it is, even with - or perhaps because of - the tragic underground current of human dysfunction everywhere) if it has not been carried on with such a magnificent, overwhelming conviction by its stars. Kelly Masterson's excellent script and the splendid direction of none other than Sidney Lumet don't hurt either. <br /> <br /> The main dysfunction here is a family one, with the two more messy brothers (brilliant portraits of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) decide to steal their parents' jewelry, a pathetically crooked attempt. <br /> <br /> The story is told with time spans (which are noted on the screen, such as: "Charlie: Two Days Before The Robbery", so nobody should be confused); some people said they didn't like this device, but I thought it worked perfectly, adding the whole thing to the skewer, considering that the two brothers in question are almost playing with complete decks - you couldn't make a decent hand between them poker to save your life. Throw in these extra wafers of cheese: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also excellent), who has a relationship with his other brother, launches into a rivalry between brothers and sisters, along with the fact who said The addict brother hates his father (a harrowing performance by Albert Finney), who apparently caused him severe pain in the past, and you have a Shakespearean / Greek tragedy in your hands. Proceed with caution.
