A horror movie is made and things are not going well. It is a masked killer. The director tells the killer in front of the cast and crew. He goes crazy and kills two people. He committed suicide and the film never ended. Twelve years later a group of film students decide to try to finish it - but there is a curse. People who try and finish kill themselves. The students ignore it. Guess what will happen next? <br /> <br /> The plot is old, but this is not bad ... for what it is (a low budget slasher film). He is well done with a young and talented cast. No one is great, but none is terrible. It also avoids obligatory (and useless) female nude scenes. It moves quickly, the blood is beautiful and bloody and the script does not insult your intelligence. Even Molly Ringwald is in this period of her life playing a faded actress. <br /> <br /> No smoothies but not bad. I give him a 7.
