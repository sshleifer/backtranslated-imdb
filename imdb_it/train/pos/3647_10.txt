I like it when they make a sporting story well. So many in the past have been so tough as to make it embarrassing to see. Not this one. It's just a really cool movie, a kind of old-fashioned story based on a real-life guy who did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this movie. He plays a coach of a high school who is interviewed to try, late in athletic life, to become a professional baseball pitcher. In the end, he achieved his goal of reaching the Major Leagues, even if it was a short period. <br /> <br /> All the characters here are nice people, the kind you come from, from Quaid to players on his high school team, to his child (Angus T. Jones, now a bit of a TV star. ) <br /> <br /> Quaid is credible in playing Jim Morris because, unlike the actors of the past in sports movies, he knows how to throw a baseball. He looks like a pitcher, a guy who could shoot him more than 90 miles an hour. And, most of this film is true, as evidenced by the real jug in one of the DVD documentaries. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for a nice movie inspired by the sports of life, you can't go wrong with this.
