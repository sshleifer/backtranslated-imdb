Of all the princess stories that Disney has published, Cinderella probably has the most enduring charm. I can't really say why, but for some reason, generation after generation push it to the top of their lists. As a child, I wanted nothing more than to be Cinderella with her glass slipper - it was my absolute favorite costume. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I don't think there is a story that more than fulfills the desires of the human heart of Cinderella. Who has never wanted to escape from the labors of everyday life and find someone who sees you like no one else has ever had? The story is older than the English language and somehow still sounds true. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, if anything, Disney can make a wonderful villain. Lady Tremaine is bad for the T, in a wonderfully calculating, not overtly physical way. Her tongue and sharp eyes do the job for her - she doesn't need lightning sticks to hit the fear in your heart. Animal friends tend to grate, especially the idiot Gus. I would have rejoiced if he had met his destiny in Lucifer's jaws. The same Cinderella was not at all shameless, sometimes she made rightly provocative remarks. However, she simply lacked the drive to make her completely understanding. Sure, he was kind and fed the animals, but what was he holding in that place? We will never know. Even if she became a maid in another house, at least she would have been paid and would have had a stroke of respect. It seems that the only reason that things end up in the end for Cindy is that all sorts of falls need to be placed on your lap. He never works for his dreams he sings so affectionately. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to music, which is adorable, as always. Ilene's wood has a beautiful and rich voice, probably my favorite of any Disney heroine. Some great standards were born here - A Dream is a Wish Your heart returns, so This is Love, Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo ... <br /> <br /> Cinderella is a wonderful heartfelt story with lots of musical highlights. While lacking in character development, it provides some bad classics and excellent vocal work. If you feel bad at heart, warm it and it will warm you and hum you Mmm Mmm Well! <br /> <br /> Citation of the movie: <br /> <br /> -Surprise! Surprise! -Duh duh duh- Happy birthday!
