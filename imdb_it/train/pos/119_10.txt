The best way to describe Europe, which tops the list of my favorite films, is the exclamation of a companion after the end of the film: "I didn't know that films could be made that way". Entirely original in its visual style, it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be. It is very far from the "master and cover" shooting style that can be achieved; perfectly integrating many layers of image, sound, effects, props, dialogues, voice over, performance, editing, lighting, etc ... all the same, none predominant. Despite the myopia of Hollywood's "dialogue", cinema does not speak of dialogue, nor of beautiful lighting, action or music. It works best when all the elements are on an equal footing, where ONLY the BLENDING of those elements, in the order or combination in which they are presented, will communicate the idea. Reducing or eliminating the contribution of an element and the film has no meaning. "Europe" is what the cinema should strive to be.
