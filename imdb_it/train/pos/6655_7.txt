It's one of the best Indian films I've seen lately, instead of song crap, dances or dog movies. All the actors showed the right emotions at the right intensity with the right timing. It is the hallmark of a good film, which makes the viewer go back and do research on the subject, which is exactly what I did by checking on Harilal. I always like the subtle acting style of Akshay Khanna and, curiously, she had a rather complicated relationship with her father Vinod Khanna, although not as dramatic as Gandhi and I wonder how she helped him try this character. I was impressed by the management and 2 inches up for Anil Kapoor for producing such a classy film.
