Most people miss the point of view of Hollywood. If a hero can stimulate heroic actions in the mind of a child, within the confines of the law, then I approve the lessons given by Doc Savage. <br /> <br /> At any time of conflict or war, the public and government seek out the heroes to be decorated. The film industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with, like Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. Doc Savage is remembered by more than one generation as the "best of the best" before James Bond, Superman or any of the others. All the others who follow Doc Savage are only a part of the character, not the Bronze Man.
