I knew I was going to see it when I saw the first preview. Dennis Quaid was one of the reasons, but the theme of holding on to your dreams speaks to me. People talk about this as a children's movie, but I think it's a film for baby boomers that is dealing with old, infirm parents, our own mortality, our growing and leaving children, and all the others things we never thought would happen to us <br /> <br /> The film does not fall into the trap of tragedy; talk about what it means to live your dreams when you have a real life. <br /> <br /> Quaid is too small for a pitcher but makes it look good, and Rachel Griffiths does a small part as a wife in a thoughtful and layered performance. Camera work is slow and sweet. When they put this film together, they left out everything that wasn't necessary. Very beautiful.
