A hot-headed policeman accidentally kills a murder suspect and then covers the crime, but faces a guilty conscience while trying to solve a murder case. Andrews and Tierney reunite with director Preminger in a film noir as effective as "Laura", their previous collaboration. Andrews is perfectly chosen as the serious cop, a good guy involved in unfortunate circumstances. The acting is fine, including Malden as a tough police captain and Tully as Tierney's protective father. The screenplay by Hecht, a great and prolific writer, is tense and full of suspense, and Preminger creates a great atmosphere.
