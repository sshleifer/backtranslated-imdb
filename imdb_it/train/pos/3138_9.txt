Yes, I did, while sitting here with a red face, remembering that I felt almost guilty as I watched him for a couple of weeks while my wife chose to look at something irrelevant (in comparison) as "Mamma cara" . <br /> <br /> How do you explain the appeal of "Batman and Robin"? I mean the only ones that ever really counted, Adam West and Burt Ward. It was a terrible sight, with terrible plots and terrible acting - and, oh yes, it was terribly funny! The same goes for this "reunion" and "flashback" movie. Adam and Burt are invited to an auction where the old Batmobile will be sold for charity. But it's stolen, and our friends (like them) jump into the characters of their old characters (if not their costumes) and head off to find out what happened. Along the way they remember the series, and we see how it all came together in flashback, with Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden playing the young Adam and Burt of the TV series. It was really interesting to see some of the old series backstage, and Adam and Burt just got back to the character perfectly (even though they weren't really character - well, you should see it to see what I mean.) It was nice to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of the old series, it will hate you. If - we would miss the sky - you actually thought that Michael Keaton and George Clooney made "Batman" acceptable, then you would hate it even more. But if you grew up with Adam and Burt and are still willing to admit you never missed an episode - well, this is for you. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's true - 9/10
