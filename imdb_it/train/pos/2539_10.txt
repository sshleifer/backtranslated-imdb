For real filmmakers, this film is a must, since it works like a perfect little allegory for the films themselves. The science of Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff has to do with capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena. This light can do harm, or it can be harnessed to do good. On one side he blinds his mother, on the other hand he is used to cure blindness ("I can see!", A girl shouts on whose eyes this light is projected). When Rukh / Karloff is himself poisoned by the disturbing power of this light, we see him emitting a ghostly glow on his hands and face as a badly developed negative, drawing attention to the fact that the man we are looking at is a projection, an entity seen on the film (visible only, as in a cinema, when the lights are off). <br /> <br /> There is a wonderful passage near the beginning where Karloff / Rukh explains his research as informed by the fact that everything that happens is captured by the light that rolls in space for millions of years, when the light of Andromeda was emitted from that Galaxy at a time when the earth was still molten rock. <br /> <br /> There are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed to the old cultural vehicles: that of the writer, in the person of Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; and religion, represented in the sculptural figures of the local cathedral, Karloff explodes with his beam projector / gun. <br /> <br /> We should be surprised if this film was meant to take a look at what was happening in Germany at the time, and in particular the use of Riefenstall's film the year before to promote a regime that would surely go on doing much harm: triumph of the will. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) finally intervenes, reminding Janos Rukh of the first rule of science. <br /> <br /> If only more films make you want to stand up in the theater and shout, "I can see!"
