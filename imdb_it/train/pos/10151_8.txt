A beautiful New York postcard. The thing I liked most was the chance to see this with all my family and not cringe waiting for a stupid humorous bathroom joke. It never happened. My kids liked it too. My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan. My wife and I commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit down with the children and EVERYONE enjoys something. This film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or over. The ending came with a twist that we liked too. If you are not just a cynical person and are willing to let a story develop, then this is for you. As a boy it takes a lot to keep my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this has happened. I recommend it and we need more of these films to watch.
