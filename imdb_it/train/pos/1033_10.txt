Say what you want on schmaltz. A beauty of this film is that it is not pro-American. It is a moral for some Americans to be called to a high purpose and to have risen to the occasion. It is stimulating because it speaks of people with a noble purpose. <br /> <br /> For me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Farrelly (mother and brother of Bette Davis). As Fanny says, "We were shaken by the magnolias". <br /> <br /> In today's political climate in which, led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used 9/11 to bring out the worst in human beings, we sank to the level of the killers of September 11 to seek bloodthirsty revenge. It is not all to blame for Bush - after all, we allowed him to guide us in that direction and even to re-elect him after his lies had been exposed. Now, with complete justification, we Americans are insulted all over the world. <br /> <br /> Today we watch this film with a new awareness: that the rise to power of the Nazis in Germany is not due to a defect in the German Character, but a defect in human beings that allows us to rationalize all this which will justify our immoral action and atrocious acts. I'm not comparing George Bush with Adolph Hitler. But, I'm stressing how a leader can let us into a frenzy of terror, hatred and hyper-nationalism to do despicable things. <br /> <br /> Sadly, the blackmailer, who will do all that needs to be done for his own appreciation, no matter how immoral, is like the leaders of our country, those who support them and those who have buried the head so deep into the sand, that they can't even be bothered to vote. br /> <br /> A film like Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be - a strength for the betterment of humanity - and that we have in ourselves to aspire once again to great goals. <br /> <br /> Geoff
