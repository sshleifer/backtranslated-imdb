They often laugh out loud, sometimes the sad story of two divorced boys working - Lemmon a clean and neurotic "house husband" and Matthau, an insignificant sports journalist, who decide to live together to reduce expenses. <br /> <br /> Well photographed and directed. The script is very articulated, that is, there is always more than one side in almost all the lines. A particularly amusing scene involves two English sisters (Evans and Shelley) who seem amused by everything someone says, but when Lemmon publishes his pictures of children and, yes, the ex-future wife, he has the girls who sobbed with him first Matthau can present himself with the promised drinks! <br /> <br /> Very funny.
