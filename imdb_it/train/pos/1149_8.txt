Fast and fun satire on that original "reality TV", the soap opera. The screenplay by playwright Robert Harling is full of a coating and ridiculous situations. The best of them is the climax, a live transmission that rapidly deteriorates into bad improvisation and a brain transplant. The murder of the lines of Keven Kline, due to not wearing glasses, is exhilarating. "His brain will explore laterally in the next houses." The brilliant cast is on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall and Kathy Najimy are all perfect. It is a pleasure to see a cast like this in this movie. This is a classic that has somehow slipped through the cracks. <br /> <br /> P.S. Alan Silvestri's score is a further advantage. It adapts to the soap opera with its flaming and melodramatic air.
