A bit slow (somehow like a Sofia Coppola film), but still a very catchy film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls. The magic of the film lies in its ability to bring back many memories to how their age felt. Confusion and insecurities are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life. The music is perfect and the acting is incredible. The camera also works beautifully. I highly recommend it to those who are not afraid to look back on this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires. I would also say that it is a good film for young people who go through that period. So many films have been made about adolescence, but this really captures the true essence of the discovery of the adult world of romance and its complexities.
