I imagine everyone has to make a return at some point. And that's exactly what embarrasses the Taft resident Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) who intends to do in "The Best of Times". Yes, the man who went mad with the radio in "Good morning, Vietnam" is playing soccer. In this case, he tries to repeat a game that costs his high school a prestigious title. But former teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) will not follow her so easily. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not the best film for either of us. But Williams and Russell are actually a pretty good comedy. And some of the names in this film risk giving you giggles (to say the least). Check it out.
