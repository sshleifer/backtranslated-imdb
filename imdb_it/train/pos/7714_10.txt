There were many sci-fi movies from the 1950s. They were great projects for Drive-in theaters. Many of them were crappy even then. This film and 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' stand out, and both have aged in their own way. From the beginning with its eerie theremin musical score (which still sounds strange since they are almost never used) Forbidden Planet takes you where no man has gone before. Speaking of Star Trek there is so much material in this film that he joined Star Trek TOS as a pilot for the series; from the interactive captain / first officer / doctor, the mad scientist, alien beings, short skirt girl, computer intelligence; it's all rigorous now but this was the first of its kind. Moreover, it has a good acting and a well-made work of art that even today evokes a certain astonishment for the images. Consider how the huge Krell machine is successfully represented with real depth. I saw it as a child (at a drive-in: 0) when it was a new movie and it scared me. Certainly every movie that was even vaguely scary back then, but I remember being very worried about the invisible monster. Forbidden Planet is a movie that a science fiction fan can watch repeatedly and find something new to every vision.
