I saw this important intense movie tonight. His most important and most important work is that of Richard Gere and Claire's Dane. Gere deserves an Oscar for his beautiful interpretation of a man forced to retire early as administrator of the register of sexual crimes. Claire Danes is as compelling as the woman Gere is doing to replace him - a woman who tries to teach everything she can while studying a final case in which Gere's character is convinced that one of those he is accused of keeping under control can a girl hostage. The topic is shocking, sexual offenders and those who monitor them, but this film will not soon be forgotten. I know I will be obsessed with the portrait of Gere for a long time. Not since the portrait of Anthony Hopkins of a serial killer has a terrified portrait on the screen and so he hired me. The film opens with a shocking statistic so don't miss the opening credits. Intense and memorable The best role of Richard Gere to show that man can act. Even the Danes can do both extraordinarily well in this often difficult film. <br /> <br /> This is a gritty film and Gere offers a deeply felt multi-layered performance. Just give him the Oscar now ... he deserves it!
