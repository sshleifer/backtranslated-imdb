This is one of the best comedies I've ever been on television. The first season was as fun as most subsequent seasons. The only reason I gave this show at 9/10 is because of the unlucky final season. The only good part of the final season was the final. My favorite part of this show was the scenes that inspired people's imagination, often depicting characters from famous television programs or movies from the 70s. It's a rare spectacle in which I liked every character (except for the final season ... too late to try to develop a new character and the fez was not so funny). Red's foot in the comments on your ass never aged, nor did Kelso's stupidity. Good at fox for having kept such a beautiful show, so long, too long.
