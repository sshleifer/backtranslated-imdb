Given how trivial these films are, you must understand that they must have enjoyed creating them. The film focuses on a house that strangely hosts anyone who lives there. The inhabitants were: the author Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)), Who is haunted by one of his creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who gets too close to a wax statue; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose daughter's cuteness is apparently a facade; and actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), on the verge of becoming a bit too character. <br /> <br /> "The House That Dripped Blood" is really worth seeing (well, see Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). In addition to being simple, there may be some overtones: it could question the question of true horror against the alleged horror. As in "The Shining", we may wonder if the house / hotel itself has memory of past events. And if absolutely nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (as Paul's co-star) is HOT HOT! In the period in which he came out, he also starred in "Countess Dracula" and "The Vampire Lovers" (also with Peter Cushing). Perhaps you - like Barbara Steele - will only be known as a screaming queen, but mark my words: IT'S A HOT QUEEN OF SCREAM! I'd like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele co-starring in something. I imagine the only strange scene (so to speak) is where Denholm Elliott is wearing a pink shirt and a fluffy jacket. You read that right. What kind of name is "Denholm" anyway? Oh good. A very beautiful film.
