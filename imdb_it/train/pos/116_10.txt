Man oh man ... I was foolish to procrastinate (it's not the right word, there's a long list!) To watch this movie and finally had the chance to do it. And the "novelties" are: Wonderful labyrinthine show! <br /> <br /> For every "follower" of Von Trier: either Rejections, Crime Element, Dogville, Dancer in The Dark, The Five Obstructions, etc ... Europe is probably the differential for its size in terms visual. Everything is wonderfully dark and claustrophobic! You really have the feeling of being inside this nightmare "temporal distortion". Taking inspiration from the masters of surreal cinema like Bunuel, Bergman, up to the noir films of the '40s with the acid drops of the avant-gardes Von Trier leads the scene of auteur films as today's "well-intentioned totalitarian" filmmaker. His authoritarian way of dealing with very complex issues, without being irrational, affects the viewer's nerve with the intent to cure some of the deepest wounds we harbor in our hypocritical world. <br /> <br /> Utopian as it seems, I believe that people like Von Trier can help society in many ways in a wider aspect. The day when films and filmmakers who carry this kind of power are no longer needed, as a tool for reflection, perhaps it could be the beginning of a new era: "The era of emotional control over our fears". This is what he constantly offers us through his work. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
