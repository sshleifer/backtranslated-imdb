A bit like a very primitive episode of "General Hospital" set in a natal department (and one for difficult cases), this rapidly evolving programmer has a satisfying emotional impact - especially since Eric Linden, like the young husband upset in the plot main, it is so obviously a wreck, and with good reason. His future wife, Loretta Young, is taken to the ward at the start of a 20-year prison sentence for firing a libertine who probably sent him to him; Ms. Young, as always, does nothing to defuse the public's sympathy, and she is a little too good to be true, though sympathetic and adorable to watch, of course. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls in the department are the heart of the film, and the result - not entirely happy - seems right. Aline MacMahon, "one of the few perfect film actresses", in the apt words of film historian David Thomson, exudes warmth and authority as a head nurse, and Glenda Farrell, like a new twin mother of twins, arrives to croon "Frankie Johnny "like a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh figures in another subplot, and manages to show a wider radius than what Warner usually allowed him. He has a modest pace, and his father's panic waiting for Linden stays with you for days - this kind of part was often interpreted as a laugh, but he's a terrified kid in trouble, and very persuasive.
