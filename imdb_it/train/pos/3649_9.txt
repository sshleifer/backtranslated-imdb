I've seen many TV movies in my student days, most of the normal waste of time that American television throws out. This, however, was well done and traced and had a very nice turn in the end. Having seen Richard Dean Anderson only in MacGyver and Stargate, I was surprised by his excellent performance rather than the rather wide range of A-B expressions he normally gives. It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after a long period dating back to The Fly II. Good to see Robert Guillaumme again in a leading role. I can't say I ever took Jane Leeves seriously after her days at Benny Hill, but she managed to cope well with her role. All in all a highly recommended film.
