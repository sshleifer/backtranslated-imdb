higher learning is a slap in the face for those of us who have been in the closet too long regardless of ethnic origin. it is a topic that most of us would like to ignore but we cannot afford if there will be a real progressive change in the way we will be able to embrace and understand diversity. Some have criticized this film as hateful or stupid but the fact of the matter is that ignorance reigns supreme in the world and many continue to help it dominate our society. anyone involved in this film has done a good deed showing what steps have yet to be taken to avoid having to make more films like the ones above. learning sounds like an impossible dream, but we have to start somewhere and this helps.
