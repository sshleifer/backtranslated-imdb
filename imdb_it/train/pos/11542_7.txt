The first time I saw it, I didn't laugh too much. At the time I was only about fifteen years old and I thought that maybe some of the deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at the time. I had the same reaction when I saw it a second time a few months ago, and this time, it was because Felix's failed suicide attempt at the beginning of the film somewhat overshadowed the film. This scene made some of the things that Oscar said and did to Felix later in the film seem unnecessarily cruel, and their personality clashes weren't as fun as they could have been. If I hadn't already known the story, I would have been worried that some of Oscar's antics to Felix push him over the edge. As it is, it didn't make me laugh or smile like the TV show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. And yet, all in all, a very beautiful film and generated one of the biggest sitcoms on television. 7 out of 10.
