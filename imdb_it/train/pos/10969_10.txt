I knew but I had never seen Gray Gardens before seeing the Broadway musical of the same name. Friends warned me that if I hadn't seen the movie, the musical would have made no sense. He did it, but he also pushed me to rent the film. At first I thought it was a railway disaster, full of strange and screaming characters, and it was extremely difficult to watch. But being able to stop it, digest it and go back made me understand why Gray Gardens is considered a memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and their complete lack of self-awareness deserves to be seen. Both remain beautiful despite their intrusive age. They have a relationship that will freeze any woman (and undoubtedly some men) and will have you re-examine your own relationships with your mother. In an age where the reality of television and cinema is commonplace, it is fascinating to see the work of the Mayleses of thirty years ago and realize what the impact the film must have been. <br /> <br /> I can say what the other posters said: how could they slip into this squalor from their family? But beyond that, how could two people living in the 1970s be able to escape reality so completely? Or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped? I highly recommend watching this with the commentary track, which gave me more information about the movie.
