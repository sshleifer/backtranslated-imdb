Well no, I tell a lie, this really isn't the best film of all time, but it's a really nice movie that none of the ones I know have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's a detective film with Jay Leno and Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) with some little story about a missing car engine prototype or something like that, but it doesn't matter. the reason this movie is funny is because of the interaction between the two protagonists, who initially don't love and distrust each other, but in a shocking twist, they end up becoming friends. The whole cultural thing is done quite well, as it's fun to watch, it's completely ridiculous but in a fun and entertaining way. The soundtrack is beautiful, once again in a typical 80s style, it fits the film, I tried to find one of the songs for years, but while I'm working from memory of what I think some of the words were that I can't To find it. <br /> <br /> Another thing that this movie has is the most fantastic reward of any movie ever, but I won't give it away, oh no! In conclusion, I would take this film for 48 hours, most of Eddie Murphys' output, including the Beverly Hills cop, and any other mate Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence have their names. If you're looking for a friendly cop movie and you're fed up with "black and white cops meeting a black streetwise cop", give it a chance. You might be pleasantly surprised because this turns the whole formula upside down with "a frank Japanese cop meets a white streetwise cop". <br /> <br /> I'm giving this 7. To be honest I like it better. I'd rather see it than a lot of things I'd give 8. But I guess I know in depth that it's kind of madness that makes me look like this movie.
