This must be one of the best, if not the best film I've seen for a long, long time. He had enough action to satisfy a fan, yet the plot was very good. I really enjoyed the movie and it got me excited from start to finish. <br /> <br /> He added blood and blood, but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the film, and he even had a jerker ending for many people I should think about. <br /> <br /> It is a watch not to be missed by anyone. Given the many reviews, the film is in order, but to be honest, most of the films that get negative reviews turn out to be among the best. this proves it once again. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, buy this movie, go out and watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.
