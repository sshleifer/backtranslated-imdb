This is one of the most guilty pleasure films ever! <br /> <br /> I am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is TISH, but I still enjoy watching her while she makes her space dress "like super cool" with a "I like" bitchin "belt and stick on rhinestones on the face. <br /> <br /> But anyway, the film is actually one of the few "family" films that holds your interest, I know the beginning drags on, especially if you know what's going to happen, but the second half is probably one of the most unnerving segments of a family movie. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't do me In front of millions of people and claims to love this film, in fact renting it is quite embarrassing, but I admit it here with internet to hide behind. <br /> <br />
