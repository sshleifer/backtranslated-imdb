The show is really fun. Nice theme The jokes and the jokes are really good. With little harmony it can become a very popular show. But the main negative point of this show is the cast. David Spade does a great job as Russell, Megyn Price does a good job. But who the hell threw Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich. <br /> <br/> Technically Russell and Jeff are the main characters of the show, which entice viewers to watch the show. Russell is a playboy and Jeff is a kind of frustrated family man, the relationship with ... with an experience of all the problems a married couple faces in a relationship. <br /> <br /> Patrick Warburton - does a horrible job like Jeff, not at all suitable for the role. He is like a robot, literally there is no punch in his delivery of dialogue. <br /> <br /> The cast is really very important for the spectators. Bad acting will certainly bring the show down ...
