Excellent political thriller, he played much quieter and slower than other high-level films in this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack how do they jump these incredible performances in career peaks? A story of friendships, father-son relationships, corruption and deception. The two actors froze incredibly well together, and the supports of Aiello and Fonda are equally impressive, even if Aiello is brilliant, especially when the newspapers go to press. Instead of focusing on an overly complex corruption scandal, it creates wonderful characters that show the human side of failure as political corruption. The final scenes with each of the main characters are wonderfully written and performed.
