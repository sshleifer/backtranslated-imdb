I had never heard of Robert Roy MacGregor before "Rob Roy" came out, but the film certainly deserves to be seen. In the lead role, Liam Neeson brings the same spirit to the role he brought to Oskar Schindler, and Jessica Lange also does a great job as his wife Mary. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is a person who will most likely make your skin crawl. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's as good as "Braveheart" (maybe even better). I laugh when I think about how Hollywood has released two almost back-to-back films making the coup in England. Very good. Also played by John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng.
