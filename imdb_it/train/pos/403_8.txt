I remember that the Legend of Zu trailer was pretty awesome and being a fan of A Man Called Hero (my all-time favorite), Storm Riders decided I had to watch that too. I know there's a lot to do to criticize Ekin Cheng's acting ability everywhere, but it's my favorite Hong Kong film so far (much better than Nicolas Tse) and he's one of the factors I liked about this film. No doubt this film is a work of art from beginning to end. I even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated at the end of this movie. They must have put a lot of work into this and deserve good credit for this. The plot of the film was a fairy tale between good and evil with a love story thrown in (I guess Ekin Cheng pulls the girls easily). The story is not very intellectual and profound, but it is not what you expect when you make an action movie. I wanted there were more martial arts actions with punches and punches instead of battles with magical abilities, but good is life and never goes as you would like. And why did they look like supersonic planes in the battle across the sky in the end? It is too funny. Legend of Zu can't be A Man Called Hero in my eyes but it flows like a video game and it's not a bad thing at all. If a company decides to publish games on this film, I won't be surprised because it brings all the elements of video games. Good job. Please make more fantasy movies like this
