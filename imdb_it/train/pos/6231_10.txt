This is just a fantastic, fun and adorable movie. It captures the true essence of the decade and of the people and tells a beautiful love story of two sisters with two sailors. Although this film can only be in black and white, it does not count against it now in modern days. The main purpose of the film is timeless. This film features great recitations, beautiful numbers of songs and dances, great design works and film shoots. Follow the Fleet is also comic, there are funny moments, moments that will make you laugh, but other moments in which acting involves you so much in the plot. It's amazing how, although this film can be set in a decade, how it can affect those of today. If you want to see something big, look at this.
