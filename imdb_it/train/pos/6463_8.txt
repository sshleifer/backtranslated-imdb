This is one of those movies you are thinking of when you wake up the next morning. It will give you that warm and confused feeling and leave you with a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Of course, we fed on the typical characters and stereotyped stories, but it does the trick: Entertain. <Br /> <br /> Being from Sweden and living in the United States for quite a while, it's fun how we react. "The dead husband will kill him", "She (Gabriella) is about to die and then there will be a harrowing ending". We know how these things work, everything comes together in the end. And he did it. The characters were a bit simple, they were so elaborate that you didn't think twice, nothing was left to your imagination. The closest would probably be Siv, it makes you wonder if she's really in love with Daniel, but that's all. <br /> <br /> But the film is beautiful, set in the Norrland countryside, the music is absolutely incredible and the characters are adorable. Michael Nyqvist is really brilliant, with his unique crazy appearance and Frida Hallberg is charming and accessible. Maybe a little too beautiful. <br /> <br /> But above all this film makes you feel, and this is the most important thing. Cry, laugh, hate and identify yourself. I don't know about you guys, but this doesn't happen often.
