"Der Todesking" - The second full-length feature by Jorg Buttgereit (the first is known as "Nekromantik") has no central character or characters, but a thematic continuity in the act of suicide. Divided into days of the week, it includes a series of set-pieces, each with the self-destruction of a complete stranger. Yes, production values ​​are low and disturbing, but in many ways "Der Todesking" is extremely effective. It makes you think sometimes more important than pure entertainment. Unlike the other works of Buttgereit, it is not very bloody, but there are some unpleasant images such as the castration scene in the Tuesday episode, a decomposing corpse and various suicide acts. The last episode (on Sunday) is so depressing and full of pain! - just great if you want my opinion.10 on 10-look at this burglar of post-modernism! Disturbing art in the purest form!
