My assessment refers to the first 4 seasons of Stargate SG-1 which are wonderfully fresh, creative and compelling. When the cast went through the gate, you never knew what was on the other side! Starting from season 5, the show had a different focus - still good, but different. <br /> <br /> The series follows the adventures of a team of humans (and a foreigner) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the "Stargate". The background of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie "Stargate" in which the device is discovered during an archaeological excavation in Egypt. <br /> <br /> The episodes are light (innocent and easy to look at) and very creative. Many of the inventive stories could easily be turned into great science fiction films. What happens next is always unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The characters on which the show is based are also well defined and brilliantly executed. Their tone is serious, but the dialogue has flourished with incredible intelligence and humor. They are simply fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Starting somewhere in Season 5, the series began to evolve into a continuous plot based on fighting a single enemy (the Goa'uld, then the Ori). The plots become more complex (much more politically / strategically oriented) and interdependent. The characters were still fantastic as always, but the show was of a different nature. <br /> <br /> One thing that needs to be mentioned is to look at the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes. They are simply unmissable shows. They exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that brought the series through 10 seasons. <br /> <br /> If you are a science fiction fan, watch some episodes of the first 4 Seasons and you will probably be captured. If you like the evolving story lines between two opposite sides, you have 10 seasons of shows to watch.
