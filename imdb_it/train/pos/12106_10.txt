"Danza Macabra" by Antonio Margheriti is a disturbing and atmospheric chiller that is successful on all fronts. It looks absolutely beautiful in black and white and has a wonderfully creepy gothic atmosphere. Alan Foster is an English journalist who pursues an interview with the visit of the American horror writer Edgar Allan Poe. abandoned by Poe's friend, Thomas Blackwood. By accepting the bet, Foster is locked in the villa and the horror begins! atmospheric and scared me to death. The sequence of the crypt is really disturbing and the tension is almost unbearable. Barbara Steele seems incredibly beautiful as the sinister specter Elisabeth Blackwood. "Castle of Blood" is easily one of the best Italian horror films made in the early 60s. A masterpiece!
