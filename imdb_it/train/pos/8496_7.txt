Wow, it's been years since I last saw this movie. Watching him in 2008 is certainly different than seeing him in 1986. Initially I didn't think I would pass the film. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so hateful, arrogant and disrespectful that I found it difficult to observe. He embodied every negative American stereotype. If this were not bad enough, once the best workers in the American town were shown, the image got worse. In the opposite spectrum the Japanese were presented as workaholics without emotions and robots. The film was not so funny, I only hung it because of the nostalgic value of it. And I'm glad I kept the watch. <br /> <br /> Just like boxing, judges are influenced by how you finish the round. This film has gone from about three to seven I evaluated it because of the ending. The end was excellent. You always want a harmonious finish and this was just that. It was nice that the city managed to maintain jobs and maintain the factory, but the most special thing was the marriage between Japanese customs and values ​​and American customs and values. It was a mediocre film that ended on a high note.
