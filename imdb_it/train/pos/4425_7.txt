Another attempt by modern Japanese filmmakers to redefine the chambara genre. Successful, and not, at various levels. <br /> <br /> The Buddhist monk has the vision to kill a legendary (and very active) demon at the Gojoe bridge to achieve enlightenment. Although not at the forefront, Buddhist thought is at the center of this film, very similar to Kurosawa's "Ran". Probably the one that made the film the most interesting to me even though it is now close to the "Ran's" league. <br /> <br /> The elegant visual direction and excellent photography keep the film mostly interesting for the duration of two hours and eighteen minutes. The main actors are uniformly excellent. The music is really good. The two weaknesses are the story and the fighting scenes. The film draws in the middle that could have been solved by some prudent editing. And the fight scenes are mostly filmed in blurred close-ups. This works for most of the film, but the ending looks like a crook. Another recent film like this is "Seven Swords" by Tsui Hark, great movie, but the promised fighting scenes are disappointing. Asano does not move like a sword-armed demon, his acting is great, but it would be an extra in a traditional chambara fighting scene. <br /> <br /> Good movie, you will probably find it interesting only from don 'We expect traditional fights with swords.
