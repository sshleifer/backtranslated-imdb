I have to say that as a BSG fan I wasn't exactly sure what I thought of this show. I saw it on the big screen of the Arclight cinema tonight (as part of the Paley Center screenings), and the cast and directors talked later. Ron Moore said that "they wanted to take a clean break from Battlestar, and do something different, and that they would lose some fans, but hopefully they would gain others". <br /> <br /> Even without their speeches, I'm now a fan of the new show, but here's what I thought of the movie. <br /> <br /> I loved it, it was really very nice. I guess I'm a real sci-fi (or 'syfy' - should I write this? ', Because I would totally watch this as a series. It has a strong and rich history, and it has kept my interest. <br /> <br /> It starts with a small group of teenagers who plan something, which for me was the weakest and somewhat confused part. The actor who played "Ben" should have given us a taste of his intense beliefs. The actress who played "Zoe" looked a little posy, but she was playing a teenager (and I'm sure I won't be the only one to think "Zoe" was a cylon at the beginning, dangers of being a BSG geek.) If they hope that these will be the new Bamber / Helfer / Park, they might want to rethink ngly, it was the adults who caught the attention of the public. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz gives an extraordinary performance as Daniel Greystone, a man so tormented by his family tragedy to skip the first chance to get out of his pain and not the wake to go. She does a chilling and compelling job of conveying the sly knowledge of her character from the inner world of computers and people, especially in a scene where she runs a web for her young teenage daughter of her daughters, traps her, then dismisses her and frees her. No sign of the "serial killer" he portrayed in Grey's Anatomy, a truly impressive drama. <br /> <br/> Equally strong, though not so much, is Paula Malcomson as much as his wife Amanda Greystone. It's just as smart and well written and beautifully interpreted as part of Stoltz, and I completely believed that they were a couple, and a couple that have been together forever and have a strong relationship, something you rarely see these days. I can't wait to see what happens with this family, and I hope they give her as much to do as Roslin in BSG: she is strong and intelligent and when she hurls herself at her baby, it makes you shudder, it's really great. Not to mention his eyes, which may contain magical powers, that's how intense they are. The scene in which he plays the government agent - a very short but beautifully played scene - really gives you an idea of ​​his power. <br /> <br /> The other part of the show that didn't work 100% for me was the scenes with Esai Morales and his mafia-type clan. He does a good job in general, but I didn't believe in this mob power, nor intimidated by their threats. I found myself wishing that this whole plot was a little more mysterious and difficult to understand; the way it is presented is almost a tribute to the Godfather, who hits you a little above the head. But with the passage of time, I can see how this will turn into an interesting type of "Upstairs / Downstairs", with poor minorities (Morales et al) against the rich ruling the planet (Stolz et al ). And to be honest, I really liked it when he spoke to his son about the origin of their name - it was a very well played scene. <br /> <br /> Note to BSG fans, the guy who plays "Willy Adama" doesn't look much like Olmos, but is just a child. Whether or not he is more a protagonist than he was in this film, who knows? I certainly didn't know. But it didn't bother me, because it wasn't as interesting as everything else around him. <br /> <br /> Polly Walker plays "Sister Clarice", and is chilling and strange in every scene she is in. I'm not sure where it will go or who it will end up, but I was very impressed by its acting. In this film it was a sort of party, but obviously it was set up to play a very important part later. He wasn't like his character in "Rome", something I always find impressive in the actors. <br /> <br /> A nice surprise - the music is actually better and less obvious than BSG, even if it's the same guy doing it, Bear McCreary. He has an obsessive and unusual approach that took me by surprise, I would have bought this score if I had the chance. <br /> <br /> As for the "round table" after the show, it was hosted by Seth Green. Ron Moore was very intelligent and articulate, David Eick was becoming wise (very similar to his video diaries), Esai Morales told a long story about how he was chosen, and Eric Stoltz was very funny and did not answer the questions (but I have always had a thing for him). Paula Malcomson was tough (she instructed Seth Green to mistakenly say she was in "24"), and the girls who played Zooey and Lacey were both nice. Grace Park and Tricia Helfer were also there, answering questions about how they did the scenes with themselves on BSG. Overall it was a very interesting and wonderful evening. <br /> <br /> I'm giving a 9 out of 10 show, and I'm looking forward to seeing it all open. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I just saw this second time and I really hope they explore what HOLOBAND was originally created for. I have no idea what it may be, but it really fascinates me.
