This is the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I saw the film on Dutch television in 1988 (?). <br /> <br /> That month they were showing a Yugoslavian film every Sunday night. <br /> <br /> The following week there was another great film (involving a train rather than a bus) whose name I don't remember. If you know, please let me know! In any case, how can I see this movie again ???? A DVD of this movie, where ?? Please tell me at doviord@let.rug.nl <br /> <br /> Next week there was another great movie (about a train rather than a bus) whose name I don't remember. If you know, please let me know!
