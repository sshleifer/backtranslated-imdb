There is a great detail in A Bug's Life. Everything is covered. The film looks fantastic and the animation sometimes leaves you speechless. The film is not too horrible, it's basically a modern version of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, only with bugs. I liked the interaction between the characters anyway and the villains in this movie looked really bad. It seems that Disney usually makes them pick up their bad guys in copy. The grasshoppers are threatening and Hopper, the villain of lead, was a brilliant creation. Check this out.
