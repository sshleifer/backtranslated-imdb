Exceptional 1943 film with Paul Lukas delivering a performance calibrated by Oscar as head of his family bringing it back to Europe from Europe as the Nazi threat deepens. <br /> <br /> The usual extraordinary Bette Davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for the best actress for this or all of the 1943 films. <br /> <br /> Counting the betrayal around them, Lukas successfully addresses the situation. He knows that he must return to Europe for a clandestine mission and return to it. <br /> <br /> Davis pulls out all the stops with a shedding of tears similar to Katharine Hepburn when they have to part. Resolute, she knows that her eldest son must follow him on his journey to freedom. <br /> <br /> A wonderful film that highlights American positive propaganda against an evil enemy.
