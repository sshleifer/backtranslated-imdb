<br /> <br /> Arriving in a freight car in New York, the cunning young woman with BABY FACE methodically begins to dig her way to the upper floors of power in a large bank. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is as charming as the amoral hero of this influential pre-code film. Without a shred of decency or regret, he coldly manipulates the removal or destruction of the unfortunate men enough to find himself in his way. A wonderful actress, Stanwyck has a full opportunity here to showcase her many talents. <br /> <br /> Appearing quite late in the story, George Brent is a welcome addition as the only person capable of managing Stanwyck; his sophisticated acting style makes a nice counterpoint to his icy demeanor. Douglas Dumbrille, Donald Cook and Henry Kolker portray a succession of his unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> John Wayne appears for only a few seconds as an unfortunate suitor for Stanwyck's affections. This would have been the only time these two artists appeared together on the screen. <br /> <br /> Film critics should recognize Nat Pendleton as a speakeasy customer and Charles Sellon and Edward Van Sloan as bank executives - all non-members. <Br /> <br /> The music heard in the soundtrack throughout the film, perfectly punctuating the plot, is it ?? Baby Face '(1926) by Benny Davis and Harry Akst and ?? St. Louis Blues' (1914) by W.C. Practical. <br /> <br /> BABY FACE is an excellent example of pre-code badness. In his frank and unpleasant relationship with sex, it is precisely the type of film that the implementation of the Production Code in 1934 had to eliminate.
