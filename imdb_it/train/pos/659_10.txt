One of the last classics of the French New Wave. As director, filmmaker, Jean Eustache draws on the simplicity of first century cinema; for history, Eustache drew on the torments of his complicated love life. So many things can be said about this film: brilliant from a vantage point; car indulgently excessive; occasionally funny; emotionally draining ... etc etc. In my mind, any complaint that can be compared to this film is easily obscured by its many strengths. Any film student, writer, or just anyone willing to run a 3-hour movie without sudden cuts, no subtitle music videos, no soap opera twists, and no trivial dialogue should make a point to watch this movie . Everything must be admired: the writing (concise, intelligent, surprisingly amusing), acting (all, simply, is perfect in their respective roles), and the simple direction (the viewer feels like a casual observer in the film) makes this film unforgettable . This is undoubtedly a film that stays with you.
