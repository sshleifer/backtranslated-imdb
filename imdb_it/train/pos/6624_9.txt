I highly recommend this movie. Set in the future of Bladerunner-esquire of 2054 in Paris, it is in the most respect a classic film noir: lady in danger, sister trying to find her, honest cop who fights everyone. Fortunately, it avoids being stereotyped and combines a pretty good storyline with interesting and innovative images. The film might remind you of Sin City in appearance, but it looks even sharper, even more like a graphic novel that I found really compelling. Each frame, each sequence looks as if it had been pulled from the desk of a skilled graphic designer. In terms of history and works of art, you can find signs that date back to the 1940s (or even earlier with the classic views of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Couer) and films like Casablanca, as well as looking towards a dark future where our destinations are governed by corporations. Get any excuse to see this movie.
