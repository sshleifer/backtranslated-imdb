LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first film I saw in 2000 and I doubt I'll see a better one this year. This beautiful tragic-comedy by Belgian director Benoît Mariage is set in the abandoned industrial areas of Wallonia. Benoît Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car (a Lada!) For him. To do this, the child must break the opening doors of the record. What the father really wants is that his son be someone, because he himself never managed to become a local news reporter for a newspaper that ironically is called L'Espoir (Hope). Obviously nothing works as expected. This film can be compared to the CLIUDE NUVANTE by Aki Kaurismäki, although it is more dramatic and the humor is more obscure. Just like in that film, however, the tone is more melancholy than the depressing and upbeat ending, without being unrealistically happy. The humor is absurd, without making the plot incredible, and Mariage finds wonderful images in the sad environments that never seem artificial. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the acting of Poelvoorde. This actor became famous with the cult genius COST ARRIVÉ PRÈS DE CHEZ VOUS in which he plays the charismatic assassin Ben. Since then he has only played two small roles in films that have not been published in Holland, because, as he stated in an interview, he was not convinced of his own acting skills and all the roles that were offered to him were taken from the character of Ben. With his return to a leading role in the ACL, there should be no more doubt about his acting. He is simply brilliant as a stupid and wicked man to put his family in poverty, but smart enough to realize what he did and be torn by remorse. A must see
