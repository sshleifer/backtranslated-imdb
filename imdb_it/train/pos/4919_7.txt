Kazan's first noir film won an Oscar. Some reviews report extraordinary details and durability of the film and its symbolism and evaluate it very well. I can almost see where they come from. But I prefer to take a more subdued approach to a long-forgotten film that seems to have been shot with virtually no budget and almost documentary. The pneumonic plague is unleashed in the streets of New Orleans, and it is up to a military doctor (Widmark) and a citizen detective (Douglas) to arrest the main carrier (Palance). The film is moody, shot in black and white, and makes excellent use of places. Widmark is wonderful as usual. Forget symbolism (crime is the same as sickness and sickness is equal to crime) and enjoy hunting. It is not always easy to watch a film like this now that we find ourselves well in this new century, as it is of a particular style that has had a very short life (after the Second World War since the early 1950s) and will hardly be interest in the casual guardian of the film. For those who will watch it for the first time, sit down for the big chase at the end. It's something else, and frankly I don't know how they filmed part of it. I can say that it probably took so long to film the finale as the first 90 percent of the film did.
