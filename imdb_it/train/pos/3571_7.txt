I've seen this movie twice with my teenagers who love it. This should be a cult fave! The best line, "Your dress is really cool!" says the prince to Cinderella. Kathleen Turner shines like her stepmother. I also like cars and motorcycles from the 1950s. The melancholy prince is a great departure from the typical swordsman. He tries to remain calm, but he can't hide his love for the future fairytale princess. His slipper is not glass (more faithful to the original story), but Cinderella loses it anyway, but remits it from the heir to the throne. My only complaint is that it is not shown more and it seems almost impossible to get. Hopefully, Blockbuster or Amazon will start stocking up soon.
