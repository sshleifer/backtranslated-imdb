More than a "children's film", "Fori" looks at how the accidents of the past still influence us today, whether we are aware of them or not. When the teenager Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) is sent to a prison camp where he is forced to dig all day, he discovers a series of things on the field and his personal connection with it. Through flashbacks, we learn that a number of things are closer than we think (you will understand it better when you see the film). LeBoeuf does a great job, as do the other cast members: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette and Eartha Kitt. A very interesting film.
