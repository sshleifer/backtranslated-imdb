This is a complex documentary that shows many things about the lives of the first Gay. To put it in perspective it was when Gay was the word used for the homosexual revolution, and not just Gay as a descriptor. Or is it still used this way today? I think most of the film comes from 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993, so it was shot. <br /> <br /> I have been touched by documentaries that have captured a man's love for another over a little strange year. A love expressed in ways that only true love can be. There are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain, along with scenes of joy and pleasure. There are scenes of life like homosexuals and gay life. The film itself was a labor of love, and I think it's a diamond. <br /> <br /> At least an understanding of the devastating impact of AIDS will come out of this film. As I write this, I think that this film seemed set to me as soon as possible. The advances in the medical and political sciences and in the social culture that have taken place since this film was set (about 15 years ago) are surprising. However, obviously, in the case of the AIDS disease itself, we have not yet finished. Heck, I suppose we're not made on all fronts. <br /> <br /> However, it's just a good documentary. I would encourage anyone who feels they don't fully understand gay life, homosexual problems or the devastation of AIDS to watch this movie.
