I've never laughed so much for a long time - even though the film also has some sad moments, especially when it changes from hyper-funny to honest and serious. The characters are very realistic most of the time, sometimes even sloppy, but quite credible. I'm not a fan of the Jerry Springer show - I'm sorry for the participants. This film is rather a satire, and it's going great. <br /> <br /> Too bad that all the expletives have been * beepate * while this film was being broadcast on a public TV, which is very funny. I'm going to rent this movie to fully enjoy it. <br /> <br />
