I was able to see this film as a preview and I was dazzled by it. It is not the typical romantic comedy. I don't remember laughing so much in a movie and being moved by it anyway. Laughter is not gags here - it's remarks, laughter of recognition, little shocks of "Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way!" I won't give away the plot, which is more than "Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend". Here the whole family has a role in the relationship. Probably the best mix of laughter and warmth from "While you were sleeping". <br /> <br /> Steve Carell goes much deeper than he was before, and for the first time I really enjoyed it. The cast is incredible, a list of veteran theatrical actors that I loved in other roles, but come together to form a convincing family. Dianne Wiest is as adorable as her mother, Juliette Binoche is bright and fun (who knew it was fun?), And even the insulted Dane Cook gives a warm, quiet and touching performance. The soundtrack of Sondre Lerche is a wonderful addition, and I will buy the CD when it is available. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this.
