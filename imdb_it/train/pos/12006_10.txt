The most incredible, spiritually uplifting film on the restoration of the Gospel. Much better than any other movie or film made for restoration so far. If you haven't seen it, get on a plane to Salt Lake and watch it now. You will not regret! You really understood what the early Saints had to fight, putting the complete and total faith there in the Prophet Joseph Smith. Finally you get a kind of understanding of the things the prophet had to fight and the persecutions he and his people faced. If you have questions about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and our humble beginnings, watch this film, then it will make complete and complete sense.
