"This Is Not A Love Song" is a brilliant example of the chase genre, which many people think has a fundamental meaning. The love between the two main characters could be more than fraternal. I think Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike is too naive to see it. <br /> <br /> I truly believe that this is portrayed with scenes like "blow back" and "letter writing" sequences. Heaton shows great intimacy towards Spike. With intense facial expressions and how he takes care of writing Spike's name on top of his letters. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed when looking at external reviews was that when the film was scheduled, the reviewer didn't seem to fully understand the film, as they didn't even mention the possibility that Heaton has sexual feelings for Spike. I also have the feeling that some of the reviewers didn't recognize it when they use phrases like, "Who is Heaton? What is he doing with a retarded like Spike?" This person, however, may have hit the nail on the head with their observation. Spike shows obvious signs of having A.D.D, although I don't think this person understood it, since it seems that he uses the word "retard" as a derogatory term. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie. Although it is not for the faint of heart. The film is extremely based on the characters, after the shooting until the end there is not much, but the dialogue between the two anti-heroes. Unless you're used to watching such profound and gritty movies, stay away.
