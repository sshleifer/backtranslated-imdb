Famous for presenting the world to Hedy Lamarr and full frontal nudity, but it is really much more. Indeed, this is one of the pinnacles of cinematographic poetry, up there with some of the fundamental works of auteur cinema of the 1930s, in the same prestigious group of Under the Roofs of Paris, Tabu, Olympia and even L'Atalante. It is almost a silence, based above all on his miraculous images, and also on his fantastic symphonic column by Giuseppe Becce. It is a masterpiece of cinematography and music, yes, and also of editing, directing, writing and acting. A good 90% of the film moves perfectly. Machat√Ω seems an expert in using reasons. Perhaps not as subtle as it could be, and perhaps a little abused, but the appearances of objects like insects, lights and horses carry the story marvelously. The small fragments of dialogue are, fortunately, not intrusive. They don't cheat as much as you could imagine. The last bit is strange, to say the least. Remembering the Russian silences, we have a montage of workers. This just makes sense in the narrative, but it's so wonderfully done that I refuse to harp on that flaw too much. Ecstasy is a film that desperately needs rediscovery. It belongs to the best films ever made.
