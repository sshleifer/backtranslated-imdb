After obtaining extremely positive evaluations to the point of SUPERB, I was extremely satisfied with the film. The film was dark, moving, anger, grief, guilt and an extremely convincing demon. <br /> <br /> I had initially expected to see many special effects and, like a lover's caress, upset me with the subtlety and correctness of it. Brian, I am struck again by your artistic talent with the story telling and your special effects care. You'll go a long way, my friend. I will definitely be the president of your fan club. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari, the best award-winning actor, was the number one choice. You made Jr. Lopez look like a child compared to Kasadya. :) <br /> <br /> Overall, the acting, the plot, the high quality footage and the fantastic effects, was fantastic. I just wish it were longer. I look forward to The Dreamless with extremely high expectations.
