I have to say that it was not very exciting, but talking about fashion and bizarre ways to solve a mystery. A little too simple, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb ... it's great! I really liked that part of the movie ... <br /> <br /> Corky (Josh Flitter) is still extremely funny ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) seemed really hopeless ... he should have been more angry with her for how she treated him ... <br /> <br /> Okay, this movie is touring and fashion in disguise. Anyway, I recommend this movie, just for summer fun. Encore Nancy, just for fun. Emma Roberts's other teenage spy movies .. Spymate ... remember? He's getting good at this difficult detective work.
