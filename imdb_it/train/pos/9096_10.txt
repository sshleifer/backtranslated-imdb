Adorable! I saw the domestic import to Philadelphia in October with my children. We liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents. I've never heard them laugh for years! It was the first time I remember seeing a film that my parents and children could appreciate. It's really nice and we can't wait for it to come out on DVD. They need to make more films like domestic import. It is refreshing to go to a movie that three different generations can enjoy (and not be embarrassed). I haven't seen such a nice movie from My Big Fat Greek Wedding. I loved Mindy Sterling as a mother. He was also at Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also in this and it's fun. I remember it from WKRP.
