I saw him in the theater in '86 and I fell off my chair laughing more than once. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" ... "Beirut ... is the best damned baseball player who ever lived." <br /> <br /> You know how it will end but it's a great time to get there. The training scenes are great fun but the best scene could be one in which Jack and Reno are trying to watch the Falcons v game. Monday Night Football while looking for a dinner with their wives. <br /> <br /> Williams and Russell seem to have a lot of fun with this and it is a pity that it is overlooked as a first-rate play.
