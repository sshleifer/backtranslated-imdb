Make the world go away. Take it off my shoulder. Say the things you've always said and let the world go away. <br /> <br /> Well, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in a pickle, one for embezzlement, and the other for kissing a child. Neither of them was guilty, but faced with the accusations and their house that was about to be torn down, they ended up inside, well, nothing. The whole world, except for their home has gone away. <br /> <br /> It's a little weird, but it's fun too. What would you do if you were all alone in the world? The two friends enjoy each other's company and do what they want. But, it gets old fast, it seems. <br /> <br /> Then they start to improve their lives obsessing over memories. The sound effects during this were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Things are really weird in the end. This film is the product of a great imagination, written and directed by Vincenzo Natali, with the help of the two stars. It just needs to be seen.
