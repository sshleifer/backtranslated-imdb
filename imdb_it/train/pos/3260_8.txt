People call this play, but when I looked at it, I just laughed once. I guess the problem is that I saw it for the first time when I was 14, <br /> <br /> and I wasn't old enough to realize that it wasn't meant to be taken seriously <br /> <br /> . There were some scenes that were supposed to be fun <br /> <br />, but I cared too much about the characters to make them laugh <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie the next time you're falling in love, <br /> <br /> and try to take it seriously. I think you'll find that despite some stupid <br /> faults, it's one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen.
