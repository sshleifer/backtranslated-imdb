It's always nice to see Angela Bassett acting in a role that she can really sink her teeth into. Sometimes she is intense, funny and even sexy in the role of Lena, a "colorful" woman forced to build a house on a desolate mud bank just outside Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also good at a role not as comprehensive as his partner, Boesman. Willie Jonah offers a finely nuanced performance like the stranger who discovers Boesman and Lena's new living area. It is not often that you have the chance to see an intelligent film that deals with mature issues. Although based on a play, the late director John Berry (who also directed Claudine) opens the material by shooting the film in the Cinemascope widescreen format. It also keeps things visually interesting through the creative block of the actors and showing us things only mentioned in the game. Just like Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry may have directed Angela Bassett in an Oscar nomination. This is definitely a movie worth looking for.
