I also saw him in a screening last night. I was totally amazed by how much better this film was than what I expected. Not many films can combine the dark comedy and the drama of the current event and not make it collapse in the conclusion. <br /> <br /> I won't worry about reworking the plot too much because I think that the less you know about this movie going on it makes it much better. But I will say that Adam Sandler's performance was really refreshing and real. It was fun and a lot more fun than most of his recent comedies. Don Cheadle was credible as always. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as fun as Borat or Billy Madison, but it has a good rhythm. I would say that 90% of the audience laughed at most of the film. Halfway, the film slows down to face the dramatic end of things and it really does a good job of tying it all together. <br /> <br /> I also thought it was really nice how instead of playing the whole black friend / white thing they chose to ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves.
