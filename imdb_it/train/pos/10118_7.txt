I really like the films of Miikes on Yakuza, I saw this about 2 years ago and I really enjoyed it. Never seen something so sick and twisted. The story is good and the actors do their things very well. I haven't seen the English or Japanese version, but I have to say that I think the German DVD is a bit censored. If you haven't already seen the movie and you live in Germany, maybe it's better if you watch a DVD from the Netherlands or Austria. The I-ON DVD contains a lot of very difficult and bad scenes, but at the showdown I felt that something was missing, about one or two very short scenes. <br /> <br /> All in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence, this is what I like about Miike !!
