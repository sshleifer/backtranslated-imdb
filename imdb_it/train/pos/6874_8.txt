A series of cartoons, most of which have television spoofing in the 1970s, but also some excavations at the government and corporate America. One of the longest segments, "The Dealers" is not so fun for me and I don't know what it parodies. Some of the others, however, are utterly broken down. I particularly like the kitchen show segment. Most of the vulgar words I know are used in the film and, if you oppose full frontal nudity, stay away.
