So don't spoil it for you, I'll be very brief. There are some excellent interpretations and fun lines from the attractive cast. A young Harvard Med School (Brian White) graduate discovers he doesn't know as much as he thinks about people. He goes to a small hospital in Florida for his internship because a girl (Mya) left him for a job as a television producer. His Senior Resident (Wood Harris), helped wonderfully by his "creative collaborator" (Zoe Saldana) brought him to fruition. They help protect his career and show him the broader possibilities that come from being a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money (as seems to be true of many of my pre-med friends).
