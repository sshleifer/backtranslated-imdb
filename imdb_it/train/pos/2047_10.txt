This film hit me at home. Being 29 years old, I remember the 80s and my father working in a factory. I thought that, even if I had worked hard, if I had pride and never surrendered, I too could have had the American dream, the house, some children, a whole car to call mine. I noticed however, without a degree in something (unlike my father who stopped at the ninth grade) and a keen sense of greed and laziness, you can't get anywhere. <br /> <br /> I'd like to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. it's made for TV and I only saw it an hour ago. I can't find it anywhere! I'd like to show it to my friends, my pseudo friends, family and other relatives, see what they think and remind them that once, Americans worked for the pleasure of feeling honored and that we were proud of what we did !! I think the feeling is still there, but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things done abroad ...
