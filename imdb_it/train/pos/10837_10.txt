Like an aging rocker, this film is about Heep and Quo - my 2 favorite bands ever - but with the incredible cast (all) - and the fantastic storyline - I love this piece of creative genius. I can't recommend it more strongly - and Mick Jones added so much (foreign leader and primary singer along with the greatest rock singer ever - Lou Gramm) - I've seen this great work more than 10 times - Bill Nighy - what a voice - and Jimmy Nail - the talent exudes from all the pores - then Astrid .... and Karen ..... what else could a rocker ask for? 10/10 - Brilliant Bloody. <br /> <br /> Alastair, Perth, Western Oz, originally from Windsor, England.
