The cult film for every true Russian intellectual. Everything is brilliant, especially acting: it is beyond praise. The film, like the book, is full of symbols: my favorite is the brightest symbol of Razrukha (a colloquial Russian word for "devastation", often indicating the period of chaos of lifestyle after the civil war 1918-20) - the vast opened the dirty door in the brick wall creaking in the snowy wind and the black hole in the doorway behind it. <br /> <br /> Now the film has been released on DVD with the image completely restored and the 5.1 sound, there are also well-translated English subtitles, although some obscene words of Sharikov have been replaced by the milder versions of the translation. I don't know if that DVD is available abroad, but if you find it, you get it right away, it's really worth watching. <br /> <br /> And in conclusion, one fact: about 50% of Russians today, mostly young, can be identified as Sharikov to a considerable extent. It is the post-Soviet effect: the Soviets seemed to be completely unprepared for the informative attack of Western civilization, television producers and filmmakers have made the entertainment industry and mass media incredibly aggressive, soulless and carefree, so to increase the darkest instincts of every Russian. Even among Internet users, every third party uses obscene language in forums and chats because it is extraordinarily common in colloquial language.
