Not having read Nabokov and knowing nothing about chess, I could see "The Luzhin Defense" just like a movie. <br /> <br /> It works really well as one of my favorite "romance novels" genres. Chess comes alive as a tough competition more than in saying "Looking for Bobby Fischer", in showing how hard mental work can be, requiring thought, preparation, resistance and planning. I particularly liked the special effects on the board since alternative games are planned. <br /> <br /> Through the feminist director Maureen Gorris (of "Antonia"), Emily Watson with her big blue eyes gradually becomes stronger through her transformative relationship with John Turturro's intense and distracted chess genius. <br /> <br /> The settings in Italy and Hungary are beautiful. <br /> <br /> (originally written 27/05/2001)
