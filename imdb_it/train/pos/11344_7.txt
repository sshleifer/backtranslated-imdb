Pufnstuf is what it is. I saw it in the cinema at the age of 4 and I have a very affectionate and vivid memory of it. Seeing this as an adult allows us to grasp the references that are far above the heads of the target audience - like the point where Jimmy's gray wig is torn away and Witch Hazel (Cass) grins "I KNOW that he had brown roots!" . Of course it is strongly influenced by the culture of the power of the flowers of the time, and in some way quite progressive. The Different track, for example, sends a clear message to young viewers about being themselves, not running with the pack and caressing what's on you is different. This could be a hymn to the gay community, it should be, excellent track. <br /> <br /> Martha Raye, Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are all great as witches, and the Living Island cast gives us all boundaries of their character seeds (includes Billy Barty, Felix Silla and other famous names). There's a lot more to acting in this film - there's really nothing subtle about it, and when little Jack Wild has to express his concern about the abducted residents of Living Island, it's really little more than screaming. This is drama and comedy spread with a trowel. Even if I think about it, I could never stand the flute. <br /> <br /> I love the soundtrack, in particular the aforementioned Different but also Zap The World, Pufnstuf and even Jack Wild's which touches If I Could. Furthermore, it is now available on CD by the tasteful people of El Records in London. See here for more information: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
