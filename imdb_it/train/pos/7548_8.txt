Short, but long enough, Cat Soup is a very wild journey to watch. One day, I was just looking for my On-demand list through the anime section and found it and decided to watch it. I spent all my time practically sitting with my mouth open. All the time I was free to think, or I had an elusive one who shouted "GO OUT !!!". But I didn't. And actually, I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> The animation is amazing. Very artistic, strange and dark. Personally I loved him for the incredible animation, but the seemingly empty story behind it is equally convincing to myself. <br /> <br /> A boy - well, cat - goes in search of his sister's soul. In the first part he is lying sick in bed, and is soon paid by a visit from some sort of reaper reaper. His soul is divided in half. One is regained by the cat while the other half is lost. <br /> <br /> So the rest of the film is slightly lost to me, honestly. I expect them to come back, and their world is ... perhaps slowly falling apart? Perhaps his absence of soul is the answer behind this, because the rest of the film contains various phases of which the world is inside. First there is a giant deluge, and then it dries in a desolate desert, and then everything stops (thanks to both what is God or destiny, as you will see). Then I believe they find the soul of their sister in the form of an orange blossom. After that, the whole world disappears. Haha, he didn't understand it, but it makes me shudder every time. <br /> <br /> Despite being seemingly random scenes, I'm sure there's a deeper message behind it if you look at it enough and do some research. Personally, I LOVE sad things like this, and I'd like to spend time doing it just to understand it. But for some people, it's probably not their cup of tea. It's very disturbing, so if you like simple souls, this is not a movie for you. However, if you have an open mind, I highly recommend this movie.
