Conrad Hall came out with a bang. The great film photographer finished his illustrious career with this film before passing. He is proud of the fact that this is one of the most beautiful criminal films you have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Of course, acting is not bad when you have Tom Hanks and Paul Newman playing the protagonists! Even the amount of action here is right: not too much; not too small. <br /> <br /> None of the characters here, frankly, is a "good boy" since Hanks is a professional hit man for the head of the city Newman. The saving quality of Hanks alone does not want his young son to end up killing a murderer like him, even though he teaches him how to be the man who goes off in robberies! Eh? <br /> <br /> As interesting as the story is interesting and interesting, the real star of this film is director of photography Hall, who paints the scene after a beautiful scene with his lens. His work is simply fantastic.
