This is one of the best in the series, ranked there with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (O Biohazard: Last Escape). The game has a very good storyline in which you play Claire Redfield in search of her brother, Chris Redfield (Who probably knew from the original Resident Evil) It's as scary as the other Resident Evil, and contains many other movies. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** on ***** Stars (Evaluation based on comparison with other video games)
