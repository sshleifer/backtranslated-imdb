I can't stop saying how much I loved this movie. This film is one of the least known and one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The film follows the exploits of a rap group, NWH (Ni # $% rs con Cappelli). It goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group, after the tragic breakup. Following the group is the documentary producer Nina Blackburn. <br /> <br /> The film has a low budget, but does not seem to matter, this is a well made film, well produced and the performances of all these actors and actresses are excellent. The main strength of this film is writing, there are so many brilliant lines and take off on rap in this film, it's unreal. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> There are take offs on rappers like MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Ice Cold, Tone Def, Tastey-Taste and songs (Booty Juice, Grab Your Dick, Etc .) Rusty Condieff made an excellent film. The rapper Ice Cold plays in the film. The film doesn't close, it's fun from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The film works so well because sometimes it gets extravagant, but it hits that line where it's fun without going too far out there. Listening to the three leads try to talk about a kind of philosophy was one of the best parts of the film, as Tone Def tells a record producer, "when you take the bus, get there", and the producer answers, ?? it's deep! '<br /> <br /> The group that plays NWH has a kind of natural chemistry for them. They work so well together, and they manage to bring this film where there's not a week in the film. What makes this film so beautiful is how true it is for some of the rap groups of the time this film is. Many rap groups have had problems with violence, with censorship, and like the NWA, the group became popular only when the establishment began to make a big deal with the controversial texts. <br /> <br /> I like this movie because it's offensive. There is something here to offend everyone naturally. The film has a take-off on a good number of people even outside of rap, the funniest being of Spike Lee. I can't imagine where they invented this dialogue. The film has a line after the other that will make you roll on the floor. As I said before, the writing is simply excellent. <br /> <br /> I am not surprised that this film has encountered such a limited version. It is an intelligent film, controversial and even stimulating. This is too much for the mainstream, despite being hilarious and almost flawless in its production. There are no major stars, but many familiar faces, including Marc Lawrence, who plays Tone Def. Watch this movie, at least you will surely have an opinion.
