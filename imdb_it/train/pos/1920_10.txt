Paul Hennessy and his wife, Cate have to deal with their two teenage daughters and their strange son ... But after the premature death of John Ritter, the show became more important to cope with the loss of a loved one. .. <br /> <br /> I found this show, passing through the canals one afternoon and I must say that I was laughing until it hurt my ribs, simply to the range of characters; the jokes and the situation that Paul would have to face mostly with his daughters ... From that moment on, I took the rest of the show when I was free and I have to say that the writing was very good ... But then I read about John Ritter's death ... Shortly after I saw part 2 of "Goodbye" and I must say that I was almost in tears, looking at the emotions of the characters, losing a loved one ... How Rory takes punching a wall with anger and frustration. .. Like Cate takes care of having to sleep in his bed alone ... Briget and Kerry talk about what they should have done. <br /> <br /> But the show continues, bringing with it Jim Egan and CJ Barnes who offers great laughs, as Cate's father tries to protect his family and gives Rory talks on the subject 'man'. .. But the real gem is CJ ... which is absolutely hilarious like the wild cousin. <br /> <br /> It will always be the masterpiece of John Ritter.
