"This Man's Navy" is, as other comments have indicated, a rare and well-turned look on the activities of the lighter-than-air Navy (LTA). The LTA crews were justifiably proud of the fact that the convoys that shadowed never lost a ship to attack the submarines. And the shots in the various NAS locations give a precious look at a type of aviation now far away. However, the first half of the film is about Beery, his relationship with his service friends, about him meeting the character of Tom Drake and his mother, and staring at Drake's leg. Only then does the second film begin. The second film is mostly LTA in action, undergoing an emerging subtitle, the boys are killed and a lot of damage is caused. The look is quite gritty and realistic, I imagine. So we move to Southeast Asia. Did the Navy have LTA there? No matter, this part is really wild, with an airship used to extract a crew member shot down from the jungle. And the Japs shoot like crazy. The nuances of Vietnam, except the escape is oh, so pleasant. This is an airship we're talking about. In the end, a dramatic film from World War II on a very unusual part of the war.
