"An Itch in Time" by Bob Clampett leads to seven minutes of crazy action from a very small premise. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he scratches himself again he will be given a feared bath. Unfortunately for the dog, a relentless flea makes it almost impossible to stop scratching. The cartoon changes between the flea's progress in the dog's fur and the dog's desperate attempts to deal with it. In a large sequence that really captures the frustration of an itch that cannot be scratched, the dog changes color from brown to blue to red to polka dotted plaid! It looks ridiculously surreal but perfectly evokes the indescribable feeling of an itch in a way that only Clampett could. There are many other elements that make Clampett pure "An Itch in Time". There is the same grotesque concept, which leads to some graphic scenes of the flea that crunch on the flesh of the dog. There is unbridled violence that lifts its head in every scene with the cat. In particular, there are dirty jokes, including a huge back stroke of the dog that causes the wolf-whistle flea and a hysterical sequence in which the dog tries to scratch by dragging its backside along the floor. He pauses momentarily to address the public: "Hey, I better cut it, I could get to like it"! With a very limited concept, Clampett manages to make "An Itch in Time" a unique, meticulous cartoon. As an initial episode of "Seinfeld", "An Itch in Time" is practically nothing but very funny with it.
