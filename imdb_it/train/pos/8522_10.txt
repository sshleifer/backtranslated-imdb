I found this show really late at night and gave it a try. It is a refreshing change from the other types of things shown late at night, if you can understand my direction. Its simplicity of values ​​and the sweetness of hearts remind me of the way friendships were when they were children. It's something I indulge whenever I find it (which is rare, maybe I should actually check the listings! Haha) ..... and the tension between Joe and Nick is so pretty. Like any good movie, you are really emotionally involved in the characters. Good old Louisa May Alcott continues to inspire good stories :) So, apparently, I have to complete 10 lines of text to make my opinion valid, so I guess I'll tell you a little more. Children are played by talented actors and actresses, and the settings are beautiful and full of nature - another thing you don't see much on television. I hope everyone tries. I recognize and am fully aware that it is mushy, but it is a good heart. As I said before, it's refreshing.
