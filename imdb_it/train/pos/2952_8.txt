Judy Davis shows us here because she is one of the most respected and beloved actors in Australia - her portrayal of a lonely, directionless nomad is first-rate. A teenager Claudia Karvan also gives us an idea of ​​what would have made her one of the most popular actors in this country in the years to come, with future roles in THE BIG STEAL, THE HEARTBREAK KID, DATING THE ENEMY, RISK and the acclaimed TV series THE SECRET LIFE OF US. (Incidentally, Karvan, as a child, was a young girl whose Panda toy was stolen from a pharmacy in the 1983 drama GOING DOWN with Tracey Mann.) If this movie comes to you, make sure you see it !! Score: 79/100. See also: HOTEL SORRENTO, RADIATION, POSSESSO VACANTE, LANTANA.
