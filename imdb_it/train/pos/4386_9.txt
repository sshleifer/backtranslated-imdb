This is a powerful film. The first time I saw it, Scottish accents made it hard for me to understand a lot and this ruined the visual experience. I gave up on this, but then I acquired the DVD, I used English subtitles when I needed it and I entered this movie, discovering how beautiful it is. It's excellent. <br /> <br /> The widescreen image makes it spectacular in some parts, with some wonderful and robust landscapes and the story reminded me of Braveheart, an engaging tale of good versus evil. Here, it is Liam Neeson (good) against Tim Roth (bad). Both do their job well. <br /> <br /> Few actors are as despicable as Roth. Dude, you really want to hit this guy in his arrogant, irritating kitty. (It's so bad and ignoble that sick critics love his character more than anyone else here). Neeson is a man's man and a solid hero figure like Gibson was in Braveheart. Jessica Lange is strong here as a female protagonist. The film involves you and involves you totally, so prepared to have an emotional experience that sees it.
