And I love Isabelle Blais !!! She was so cute in this movie, and very different from her role in "Quebec-Montreal", where she was more like a man-eater. I think it should have been named for a Jutra. I mean, Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabelle was far superior, IMO. Pelletier did a good job for the first time, and I noticed that he slipped into a couple of his friends from Rock et Belles Oreilles, Guy A. LePage and Andre Ducharme. It was fun to see them in this, I didn't know they would appear. <br /> <br /> I don't think I saw a romantic comedy from Quebec that I didn't like, and that's as good as any I've had the pleasure of seeing. And if you're in the United States and wondering how to get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca delivered it to me in less than a week.
