Anyone who has never seen anything like the fight scenes in The Matrix has never seen this movie. The fighting scenes were choreographed by the psychopath of the action scene Yuen Woo Ping, who also did the fighting in The Matrix. And the fight scenes are something. <br /> <br /> Li plays a super-soldier who feels no pain, who now lives a life as an anti-war librarian (you took me). When other evil super-soldiers start killing local drug lords to take control of drug trafficking, Li is paired with his cop friend to help them stop them. <br /> <br /> There are absolutely crazy things in this film (a badguy gets its arm cut off with a glass plate and hardly known). The fighting scenes are full of kicks and flying fists; the body count is very high. Li was rarely better, and he surrounded himself with a group of beautiful female costars (Yip punches serious like a fellow super-soldier). Anthony Wong also makes a cameo as a drug lord (no surprises, makes a cameo in every Hong Kong film). It is unfortunate that they do not make action films like this in the United States; I shouldn't go through all these horrible dubbing jobs to see that action that I long for. Recommended.
