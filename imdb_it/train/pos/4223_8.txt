The film has a great written genre story. Presents all the usual Columbo ingredients; The way Lt. Columbo approaches and binds to his suspect, the way the mystery unfolds for him, Columbo's dog, the cat and the mouse play, which is great in this and, fortunately, a certain good humor of easing, which mainly involves the character of Columbo. It's all written despite the fact that it doesn't even have a truly original concept. Columbo on the hunt for a detective / murder novelist had been made more than once in a Columbo film. <br /> <br /> It is also a very well directed film by James Frawley, who after that directed 5 more Columbo films, in the 70s and 80s. He provided the film with style and some really fantastic and memorable sequences. <br /> <br /> It is one of the slowest moving Columbo films, despite not having a too long execution time. This style and approach do not always work well for a Columbo film, but in this film it does, which may not be secondary at all thanks to the film's recitations. <br /> <br /> Most Columbo movie has starred in a big star or a well-known star since the early days of the film, as the film is its killer. This film plays the rather unknown 81-year-old Ruth Gordon. She hasn't starred in a lot of movies during her career, but is still well known to some, especially for her role in "Rosemary's Baby", which also earned her an Oscar. He had a realistic and rather unusual style of acting, which some might not like. He received 4 more Oscar nominations throughout his career, before his victory for "Rosemary's Baby" in 1969. He also had a nice interaction with Peter Falk in their sequences together. <br /> <br /> The film also features a young GD Spradlin still young. I say young because I only know him from his last productions for his career, despite the fact that he was already 57 years old at the time of this production of Columbo. He is still alive but has retired from acting since 1999. <br /> <br /> An even more beautiful film than the usual Columbo. <br /> <br /> 8/10
