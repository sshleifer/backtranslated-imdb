1939 is universally accepted as the greatest year in Hollywood history, with more classic films published than any other, and John Ford directs three of the best, "Stagecoach", "Drums Along the Mohawk" and this beautiful tribute to the days of frontier and a young backwood lawyer destined to finally save the Union, "Young Mr. Lincoln". <br /> <br /> With the world plunging into a war that America feared, but knew it would be involved, Abraham Lincoln was very minds of people, in 1939, as someone who had faced the same dilemma in his own life, and had triumphed. On Broadway, Robert E. Sherwood's award-winning "Abe Lincoln in Illinois", with the physically dead portrait of Raymond Massey, played in crowded houses (it would have been shot in 1940). The continuation of his epic biography of Carl Sandburg, "Abraham Lincoln: The War Years", was published and quickly became a best seller. President Roosevelt often referred to Lincoln in speeches, and the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC became the most popular landmark in the city (a fact that Frank Capra made good use of in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"). /> <br /> All this was not lost on Darryl F. Zanuck, at 20th Century Fox; as soon as he read the script by Lamar Trotti about Lincoln's beginnings as a lawyer, he designated a "prestige" production and gave John Ford the direction, and Henry Fonda, to act. <br /> <br /> Fonda did NOT want to play Lincoln; he felt he could not do justice to the "Great Emancipator" and feared that a bad execution would damage his career. Even a filmed make-up test, in which he was stunned by what he would look like Lincoln, wouldn't change his mind. According to Fonda, John Ford, with whom he had never worked, cursed him sincerely at their first meeting, and explained that he was not playing the Lincoln of Legend, but a young "Jackanape" campaign lawyer in front of the his first murder trial. Humiliated, Fonda took the role. (John Ford offered a different scenario of the events, but the result was the same!) Obviously, they found together a chemistry that worked, since almost all their couplings would produce "classics". <br /> <br /> Unlike the introverted and melancholy Lincoln of "Abe Lincoln in Illinois", Ford's vision was that of a shy but likeable lawyer, who made friends easily, and loses his lost mother, too young (resulting in a bond with a pioneer mother becomes a vital part of the story). Injustice irritates him, and he speaks "common sense" to quell violence intertwined with doses of humor. Both productions play on Lincoln's (undocumented) relationship with Ann Rutledge; in the Ford version, the couple is really in love and engaged with each other. After his death, Lincoln often visited his tomb, to share his life with his 'spirit' (a theme that Ford would have continued in "He wore a yellow ribbon"). <br /> <br /> A murder trial is the focus of the film, and shows the prodigious talents of the star and director. Fonda cleverly interprets Lincoln's inexperience, but firmly believes in justice tempered by piety, and Ford emphasizes the gap between the "intellectuals" of the big cities (represented by the pompous DA Donald Meek and his astute "adviser", Stephen Douglas, played from a young Milburn Stone), and the informal and reckless sense of Lincoln. With Ford's "regular" Ward Bond as a key witness, the process is both unconventional and compelling. <br /> <br /> With the movie closing as Lincoln moves away into the storm and his destiny (dissolving into a view of the statue at the Lincoln Memorial), the public could take comfort in the film message that if a cause is right , the beautiful will eventually triumph. <br /> <br /> "The young Mr. Lincoln" is a truly remarkable film, from a fantastic year!
