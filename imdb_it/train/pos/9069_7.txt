The school bully, Joe and his "team" of friends start teasing Billy and call him "worm boy". Billy decides to play saying he "eats worms all the time". Joe and his friends don't believe him, but Billy assures them and bets on Joe who can eat ten worms in a day, otherwise he will come to school with worms in his pants. <br /> <br /> The boys take Billy on his bet, leaving the weak son with the strength to earn respect from his classmates by eating cooked, fried or live worms. <br /> <br /> The film may seem disgusting but there are many messages in it.

It also shows you why some bullies resort to bullying other children. <br /> <br /> The protagonist of the film, Billy, is a brave and courageous person with whom we can all identify. It is easy to empathize with him as we silently encourage ourselves to achieve his goal, even though we may not always agree with what he is doing or the choices he makes. <br /> <br /> Children in the film are portrayed exactly as children are in real life and the film deserves a lot of credit for it. Children's actors are the protagonists of this show, showing real emotions and feelings with respect to most other children's films. <br /> <br /> Some adults may not like this movie, but children will do it, maybe even teenagers. <br /> <br /> At the moment there are no other good films on the circuit, so if you are not in the mood to see snakes on a plane, try worms on a plate in How to Eat Fried Worms.
