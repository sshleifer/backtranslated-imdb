While the soundtrack is a bit dated, this story is more relevant in the US now than ever. With not only jobs, but everyone's jobs are outsourced to US corporations while government profits and Americans suffer. <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss is Emory, a steelworks that works the same job his father did for 35 years. His wife is well represented by Pamela Reed, who is very realistic, trying to support the family with two children when Emory loses her job. The mill is closed under the pretext of bad management, but there is also embezzlement and cheaper salaries where a steel worker can pay in one month (outsourcing) what Strauss / Emory should pay in one day. It doesn't matter that these men are all good loyal workers who have values ​​and look for the best for their family. <br /> <br /> John Goodman, Gary Cole (like Strauss's brother) and some other colleagues are also affected. It is very disturbing and realistic. Some scenes between Emory and his father are moving. Emory hopes his local union can reopen the mill, as they promise to do. <br /> <br /> Emory's brother, Lee already sees the writing on the wall. There are no jobs left in the rust belt (Ohio) and must go on. However, where in the United States can they move? Where will it be better for a steel worker? <br /> <br /> There is a triumphant scene at the end where Emory and her crew fill the loading platform with steel products. The guard allows them to do this as a final gesture, one of the men committed suicide and he empathizes. <br /> <br /> In general, a nice movie message about hard times right here in America. Something that few care about facing until they are personally affected. 8/10.
