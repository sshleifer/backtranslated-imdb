Just a comment on New Orleans accents ... <br /> <br /> A previous reviewer noted the following: "This film could have been shot in New York, or in another big city in the North because there presents characters who speak more like "broklynese" than perhaps a southern accent that could be heard in that part of the country. "There was also another comment in this sense by an English reviewer. <br /> <br /> Many people in New Orleans, in fact, play "broklynese". I never found out why. (It is quoted in "A Confederacy of Dunces" by John Kennedy Toole). I always appreciate the movies that take place in New Orleans and that include this detail, like this one. Too often it's just the Hollywood version of the standard southern accent.
