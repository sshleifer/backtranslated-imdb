Excellent plot within a plot within a plot. Too bad for two of my movie heroes who have a nice snot. It must be my education :) <br /> <br /> Very well performed by everyone. You never know who will come out who. The last small turning point in the end allows everyone to get their merits. <br /> <br /> Recommend to everyone. An innocent and ironic thriller that, if it has any flaw, is probably the excessive use of the word "bloody" by Michael Caine, but this is his signature, isn't it? <br /> <br /> 9/10
