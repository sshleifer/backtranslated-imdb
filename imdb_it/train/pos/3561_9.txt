At least something good has come out of Damon Runyon's misguided attempt to sentiment the Mafia. "Guys and Dolls", the seemingly indestructible musical from the stage, was filmed in 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ("All About Eve") in a colorful and fun movie with a cast of stars including Vivian Blaine (from the original Show Broadway), Jean Simmons (whose character bears a strange resemblance to Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday") and two of the great leaders of all time, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, both recently won Oscars for Best Supporting Actor ("From Here To Eternity") and Best Actor ("On the Waterfront") and were at the top of their game. One listens to Brando singing "Luck Be a Lady Tonight", which talks about where the first Dylan got his voice. Stubby Kaye steals the show as Nicely Nicely Johnson, who brings the house down with "Sit Down You're Rocking The Boat". The ubiquitous Sheldon Leonard adds another page to his gallery of television gangsters. The film has a bright, cartoon-like appearance that anticipates the Pop Art of the early 1960s. The characters speak in a stylized patois, apparently based on Yiddish idioms. Although the social attitudes and gender roles of the film are dated, it is all very funny, and even the sweet hoax of the Salvation Army is harmless and does not reflect any real animosity towards organized religion. Seeing Sinatra and Brando in the same movie is reason enough to watch this film, but it has many other attractions to offer during its 149 minutes.
