Of the three remakes of this plot, I like them all, I have all three on VHS and I also have a copy on DVD. There is only enough variation in the scripts to make all three fun and reusable. Also, have any other films been redone three times with such casts of all stars? Obviously the main stars of this are great, but secondary actors are also exceptional. I particularly like William Tracy as Pepi. He was a scene thief that I tried to find other movies he was in. It has appeared in many, but most are not available. Like the other comments, I also say - buy this.
