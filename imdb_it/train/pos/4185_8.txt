This film has everything that makes a bad movie worth looking at: sloppy editing, little or no continuity, crazy dialogue, bad (you might even say non-existent) acting, meaningless plot, shots that go on too long .. and is perfect for the MST3K-style riff, not to mention the "Corpse Eaters Drinking Game": scribbling on the shapes ... making a shot - signing your name ... making a shot - take Foley's bad shot. .. take many, many shots. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't rate it above 8 is because there isn't enough free nudity and because despite its bad madness, it's just a long hour - hell, a movie like this should have been at least 20-30 minutes longer!
