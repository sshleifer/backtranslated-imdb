The low-budget Brit pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to become a star, becomes one and then finds it all a bit too much. The good cast and sense of time and place cannot hide the fact that we have all been here before. Several scenes are a bit hysterical and O'Connor's voice looks a lot like Mini Mouse! She disappeared immediately after making this film - so life can imitate art! A must see if you want to see a punk version of a star was born though.
