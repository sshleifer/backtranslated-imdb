this film was one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen. great for the whole family to watch. ideas can be a bit far-fetched, but it's a beautiful comedy and acting is great. love the kid, j.p. and the winner of the adrien brody academic award may have been very short, but very memorable. highly recommended.
