I think part of the reason this film was made ... is for us players who actually play all of Nancy Drew's PC games. Lately there have been many movies based on video games, and I think this is one of them. <br /> <br /> So this film does not follow any book. But it follows parts of the games. I buy and play all of Nancy Drew's games as soon as she comes out. And the games are from HerInteractive and are for "girls who are not afraid of a mouse!" And some of these games have actually won the parents' Gold Awards. They are not just fun, but you can actually learn a thing or two while you play. <br /> <br /> I brought two of my children with me to go see him and they loved it! The 10 years The old man had started playing his first game of Nancy Drew a day before I took her to watch the movie, and was having so much fun in the game that I thought would also like the movie. And I was right ... not only did he love this movie, but he couldn't wait to get home to finish his first game and start another. <br /> <br /> My other stepdaughter is only 7 years old and she loved the movie too, but she's still a little too young, still playing games, but she likes watching her sister play sometimes just for see what's happening. <br /> <br /> The games are based on 10 year olds. All games usually get rather descending reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information on the games, just take a look at her Nancy Drew games. So I personally thought the movie was good enough and I'll buy it when it comes out on DVD.
