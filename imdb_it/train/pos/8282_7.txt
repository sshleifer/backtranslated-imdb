** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The biggest part of the movie that doesn't work is Wendigo, and when your main character fails, your movie is usually not far behind. The interpretation of the filmmakers of the Wendigo form is interesting, and can be adequately threatening when properly filmed - when the fleeing murderer sees the Wendigo in a flash in his rearview mirror, for example - and the tree shape was actually very good. However, as a monster, he never really comes to life. We do not receive many explanations for his behavior, and what we see from it does not coincide with the story told in the film itself, or with any Wendigo tradition I have ever read. <br /> <br /> I think one of the main reasons why the monster fails is that it is not given enough to do in the film. When you boil this movie to the bone, what you have is a suspense with a bit of a supernatural element instead of a movie about a monster. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is good, even if it is a bit cheese; the directors use the scenery, the lighting and the time of day to convey the atmosphere and the atmosphere rather well. The character of Otis turns out to be really dangerous and unpredictable, making him the real monster of the film. It would have been more effective to explain his behavior as if he were possessed by the hungry spirit of Wendigo, which would also be a more accurate representation of the true legend. <br /> <br /> I have heard unconfirmed reports (from a newsgroup) that the reason Wendigo does not do much is that, when the monster was built, it found itself so heavy and uncomfortable (to imitate its position standing on cloven hooves, the performer had to walk on toes) that it was almost impossible to run, walk, or otherwise perform in it. So the many glow of the creature stopped, and the obvious footage accelerated its run. I emphasize that these reports are not confirmed.
