It is not a criticism of the film, but rather a comment on how blind we are to our past. <br /> <br /> I recently saw Winter Soldier, and The Ground Truth was like watching a remake or a sequel ... except for Iraq rather than Vietnam. Similar to Winter Soldier because of its one-sided message, both films illustrate how quickly we engage in conflicts based on false pretenses, and allow our young and brave (and often naive) to bear the brunt of this greedy speculative war. Both films effectively demonstrate that forced mentality in the minds of young people makes them efficient as killing machines, but training sadly falls short of teaching the diplomatic and police skills necessary to effectively win hearts and minds of the people who are supposed to be fighting for. This is ultimately what lost the war in Vietnam, and probably will also lose the war in Iraq. <br /> <br /> My only negative comment is that the film is so one-sided that it could easily be passed down as left-wing propaganda. Not from me, mind you, but from those who aim to discredit the film and the message. A more balanced point of view would speak to a wider audience.
