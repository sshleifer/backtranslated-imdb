Kusturika has done it again. Another masterpiece. A coral comedy full of its landmarks, with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments, we have laughed and laughed, what a party! Music is everywhere, and even filming, animals, crazy bastards, sex and incredible gadgets and inventions, all visually colored to entertain only. Pure cinema in essence. A wonderful experience to watch. And one is particularly grateful because good comedies are so rare and so wonderful. Well, this is one, and if you enjoyed the previous Kusturica films, you will like this one, even if, as in all comedies, it is a chemical reaction, and you have to be in the mood to do it.
