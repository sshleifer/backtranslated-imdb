This is one of the greatest love story films I've ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parts may seem dated, but this does not detract from the film. You should try to observe, criticize and enjoy any form of art from the point of view of time. Clearly by the standards of "Sex in the City", Charlie Chaplin was horribly boring. However, when he was judged from the perspective of America in 1925, it was fantastic. Similarly, Sayonara is a revolutionary film in its gaze on a mixed love story, the "manifest destiny" arrogance and prejudice, and the complexity of different cultures. It is a natural next step towards films like Gentleman's Agreement. Its purpose, however, was not just a social commentary, on the contrary, it is fun and enjoyable, with innumerable lines that are not forgotten. <br /> <br /> However, even if considered only as a love story, it is fantastic. Although, some attack Brando's accent, he is at his best in nuances and characterization. Buttons and Umeki (both won the Oscar) and the rest of the supporting cast add a lot to the film. <br /> <br /> Taka, the real star, does a fabulous job making you feel the passion he has for Brando, while being torn by his sense of obligation and loyalty. His speech when he meets and speaks for the first time with Brando is a classic and something rarely, if ever, combined with cinema. The dialogue between Taka and Brando in his Tokyo dressing room at the end of the film is just as good. Of course, he has no bloodsucker, spit swapping and worse, which exemplifies love in today's movies, but that makes it even better. It represents true love and passion, and not just "warmth". If this movie doesn't touch you, you're too young, too cynical or dead.
