Cat soup in the beginning seems like a very casual animated film. The best way I could explain is that it is quite acid. Although it is not entirely random. The story is about Nyatta, a young cat and his sister Nyaako. Nyaako is very sick and dies, however, Nyatta sees his soul being carried away by death and is able to recover half of it. The story is about their quest to bring Nyaako back to life. <br /> <br /> Although many of the contents of this film seem completely random, it is not. Most is symbolism for life, death and rebirth. You can also see the references of other stories, like Hansel and Gretal. This strangely cute short film has an interesting story, full of a deeper meaning than what you see on the screen surface.
