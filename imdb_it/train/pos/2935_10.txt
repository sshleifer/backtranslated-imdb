Eddie Murphy Delirious is by far the most fun you can ever see in your life. You can compare it to any movie, and I guarantee you that it will decide that Delirious is the funniest movie ever! This film is about 1 hour. 45 minutes. And for all that time, there was just a moment when I wasn't laughing. Laugh for hours after it's over, repeating the lines over and over in your head. Eddie Murphy gave so many funny interpretations about his career (48 hours, Trading Places, Beverly Hills Cop, Raw, Coming To America, The Nutty Professor, Shrek, etc.), but this is by far his most HILARIOUS moment. I've seen this movie so many times, and it's always more fun. He never loses his advantage. From this day on, every great stand up performance will be emulated by Delirious. ***** and two thumbs up!
