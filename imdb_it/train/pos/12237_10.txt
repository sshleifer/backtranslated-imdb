Mating Game is a fascinating and wonderful film of a bygone era. Hollywood needs to consider a fascinating remake of this film. My wife and I would go see it. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and I have seen on AMC. <br /> <br /> This movie has Tony Randall at his best. Debbie Reynolds is great, as always. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. We expect to order on DVD to add to our growing movie collection. <br /> <br /> Too bad Hollywood doesn't make films like this anymore. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood .... it's time to dig out some of these types of scripts from the old safe, update them a bit (without ruining the original film and script like you did with other remakes), and hold a casting call. <br /> <br /> A remake would be a big hit on the big screen, DVD and cable / SATTV. <br /> <br /> SN Austin, TX
