With this topic, it is so easy to make cheap clicks. You know, the guy with hairy legs tries to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here - Adrian Pasdar does a superb job of making Gerald a REAL person, someone you care deeply about, and as a result you feel from his difficult situation trying to live both as Gerald and as Geraldine. Not only that, but like Geraldine, it looks HOT! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is electric. They are two characters who love each other, and even when they look at each other on the breakfast table. Even the potentially vulgar subplot line of business acquisitions is believable, and in the end you'll find yourself cheering for the end! At least I did it!
