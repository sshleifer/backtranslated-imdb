As a fan of Pokémon, I really enjoyed this movie. It introduces new legendary Pokémon (like any movie) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters. However, I do not expect those who are not Pokémon fans to have fun (this includes MOST adults). Some lines were trivial, but this can be somewhat inevitable when duplicating the film in English. The entertainment was beautiful, although there were a couple of parts that didn't look nice. And even if the villain is a bit cheesy, I think the movies have done a good job of cycling through different types of criminals, and I guarantee you that they're not all like this. Who doesn't like it, I tell everyone his, but Pokémon fans will love it.
