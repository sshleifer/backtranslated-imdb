Critics are stupid. This movie is fun and smart. I loved this movie a lot. Because everyone hates this movie so much. I wish people loved this movie more than it was. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real comedians and have done a lot of work to make this film. I don't see you guys out there making movies like them. So people should just look at it and not comment on it. I like this movie. Everything is alright. There are parts that are stupid, but at least they did it. Jerry Stiller would love it because this film has acting just like the King of Queens show. But this is better than that. I can't believe this was rated so low.
