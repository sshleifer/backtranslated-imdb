I had never seen Richard Thomas play a bad boy. I wasn't sure I would have liked it that way. And I wasn't sure he could do it. But this surprised me. He sent shivers down my spine and pushed me to take a closer look at the street people. The film is compelling and fast. Bruce Davison is convincing, but all he can really do is be a good guy. The real talent here is Thomas. The ending was a bit clumsy, but maybe that's how people would fight ... If you're a Thomas fan, you MUST see him here at his best to be bad!
