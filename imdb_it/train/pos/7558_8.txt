This episode of the first season is slightly closer to the controversy with the entire angle of gender bending. I imagine that there would have been a significant amount of changes before this ended up placating the censorship. <br /> <br /> The story itself is original and well written and the direction is completed by the fine acting. (Nicholas Lea makes his debut with X-Files though not as Agent Krycek but as a victim called Michael. I particularly liked the construction and the ending itself. <br /> <br /> It is different but pleasant. Ignore any negative reviews you might hear
