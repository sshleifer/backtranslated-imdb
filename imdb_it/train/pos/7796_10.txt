This was the first film I ever saw Ashley Judd and the first Victor Nunez film I ever said, and boy am I glad I did it. His "calm tone, his" relaxed pace, his "realistic representation of a young woman just started in life, his" refined representation of the struggles he has to go through to make his mark on life, the decisions he makes based on things, people you meet - there's nothing wrong with this movie. It is the closest to the magic of cinema that I have ever seen outside of the "Star Wars" films and, given what those films are, it means that this film really deserves a high score. The acting of Ashley Judds, the writing of Mr. Nunez and his "big and simple story make it a beautiful story of formation and a wonderful film.
