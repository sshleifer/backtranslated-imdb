This must be one of the most sincere and moving boy-meets-girl films ever made. While "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Say Anything" offer beautiful portraits, this film removes unnecessary subplots and Hollywood differences. This film focuses exclusively on watching the budding of a beautiful love story. Never doubt for a second that the film will lead to the romantic coupling of these two people. He almost immediately feels the synergy and chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it's simply pure joy to see them find them. This film is mostly based on dialogues. But every conversation between them is very intriguing. What makes this combination so romantic is how real it is. As in all that conversation, even if it often has no relation to something critical, you can perceive the nuances while these two become more affectionate and trusting each other. This is exactly the way you would dream of meeting that special person. And what makes it so true is that it's not even too great to believe it. This could be what would happen if you were safe enough to start a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere randomly. And what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent Vienna background in which this film takes place. It only adds the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests. And no matter how many times I watch this movie, I don't think I'll ever get tired of that.
