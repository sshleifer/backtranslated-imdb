Eva (Hedy Lamarr) has just been married to an older man on a honeymoon, he realizes that her husband does not want her. Her disappointment at marriage and the deprivation of love brings Eva back to her father's house on a farm, leaving her husband. One afternoon, while bathing in a lake, his horse escapes with his clothes and a young worker retrieves them and returns them to Eva. They fall in love with each other and become lovers. Later, her husband misses her and tries to bring Eva back home. Eva refuses, and luck leads the trio to the same place, concluding the relationship in a tragic way. I just saw "Extase" for the first time, and the first observation I have is relative to the horrible quality of the VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Network: the film has only 75 minutes of time, and it appears that several reels have been used of film. There are some parts totally damaged and other parts very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the images not obtained by the Brazilian viewer, if he has the opportunity to find this rare VHS in a rental or for sale. The film is practically a silent film, the story is very dated and has only a few lines. As a result, the characters are poorly developed. However, this film is also very bold, with Hedy Lamarr's exhibition, beautiful breasts and naked body and fat for current beauty standards. Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphorical use of flowers, which symbolizes the relationship between Eve and her lover. The way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and deprivations of Eva is very clear. The inconclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 film. I liked this film, but I hope that one day I will have the chance to see a restored 87-minute version. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "ÃŠxtase" ("Ecstasy")
