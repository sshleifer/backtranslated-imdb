I have to start by saying that it's been a long time since I saw it, but I've seen it 5 or more times; a wonderful little game that was clearly inspired by the musical / comical couplings of new or endangered stars with prominent musical groups. The mysteries of Kay Kyser would be a good example. <br /> <br /> Having Spike Jones unleashed is the best part of the show, as he and his band play many melodies and are part of the action, doing a great job of supporting. Hugh O'Brien plays the role, Buddy Hackett the part where it is said to have been offered to Lou Costello and, therefore, Abbott and Costello are replacing the leads. I don't know if it was true. <br /> <br /> all in all, a nice movie, but important to have Spike Jones and his band in film for the story. I wish it was released, because I haven't seen or heard of it in twenty years. I hope he's not lost
