Once you've raised your jaw from the floor, from the knowledge that they ... somehow ... managed to put this thing together so quickly that it was released in the same year that the cause ended, you'll find out it's not bad . The plot is engaging and interesting, and the rhythm is fast, with this it covers many situations, and therefore often quickly jumps to the next one after one or two lines have been spoken. Where this really stands out is acting. The performances are excellent. Neill and Streep are both impeccable. It's also nice to hear so much of the Australian spoken in a Hollywood movie, and even those that don't come naturally, at least try an accent. Cinematography and editing are pretty good, but they don't go beyond standard things. The story of this film is compelling and the fact that it is authentic makes everything even more chilling. While I haven't read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this image, I understand that it's pretty close to the truth. There is a moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this. It is sometimes a real judicial drama. I recommend it to all fans of this type. 7/10
