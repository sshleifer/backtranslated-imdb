"The Man in the Moon" is a wonderfully realistic look at life through the eyes of a teenager. Director Robert Mulligan magically recreates the autobiography of Jenny Wingfield's screenwriter of her childhood with a beautiful photograph and a lyric and musical score. This film is one of the most powerful and emotionally engaging films of recent times. <br /> <br /> This film is incredible, all of the highest quality, especially Sam Waterston and a surprising performance by Reese Witherspoon in his debut film. You will feel every emotion as this life-changing summer in 1957 on the Trant family farm comes to a conclusion. <br /> <br /> "The man in the moon" was a limited version in 1991, and you will love the fact that most of you, family and friends, probably never heard of it. Buy this DVD and enjoy 100 minutes of pure poetic art. This film is really the essence of making movies at its best.
