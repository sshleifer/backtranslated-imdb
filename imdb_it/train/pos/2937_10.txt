I know it's rude, and I know it's not PC at all, but it's so funny. If it can be put into perspective that it is from the early 80s and brings all the stereotypes of the time - and the film still makes you almost faint with laughter - that is really a good comedy. Going with the tradition of what comedies have been for thousands of years, the subject of this film is exaggerated. If you can suspend your political correctness for an hour and a half, just to have a wide-ranging laugh, please look at this. <br /> <br /> P.S. Someone could give it for pleasure on DVD, it's so hard to find on VHS anymore.
