Stargate is the best show ever. All the actors are absolutely perfect for their roles. I love the connection between the characters. If you have not seen this show I highly recommend it. Although this program is compared to Star Trek, very often it cannot be because it is completely different. I'm a fan of star treks, but I will definitely evaluate this show well above any stellar journey. Unfortunately I live in New Zealand and we don't receive Stargate on our TV, so if I want to see it I have to buy DVDs and season 10 isn't here yet, so I can't see it for a while (which is highly depressing). However this program is very good and is a must see, but beware is very compelling. So in the summer I Love Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
