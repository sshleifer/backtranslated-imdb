I grew up watching this series. I was about seven or eight years old when he was on. I still remember the first episode called "The New House". It scared the hell out of me! I can almost hear that statue, laughing madly. And the ending, oh my God! The hoor spirit enters the room for the child: Yikes! This was classic TV and it was a unique series. I found a collection of DVDs for sale on the Internet: 2 actually. My question to all readers: has anyone bought this set? It's a bootleg. Both sellers claim to have a very good copy. I have a sketch and a poor DVD of the episode "The New House", and a couple of other episodes that are a little better, however, if anyone knows if they are much clearer, it would be worth buying it and sharing it my children. A great series, intelligent, frightening and boldly supernatural. Thanks in advance to all the fans who have the least of all this. In fact, I'd like to discuss it. Chris Walker
