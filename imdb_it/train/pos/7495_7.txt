Dwight Frye steals the show in this one stupid young man (who seems to be mentally handicapped) who blames himself for vampire-like murders, especially after he reveals his love for bats that he likes caressing and giving unsuspecting friends as' gifts '!. Besides all this, there is a mysterious funny story involving the aforementioned murders. Underrated.
