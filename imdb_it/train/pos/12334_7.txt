Does anyone understand where this film was shot? The aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful. It seems to be England. However, Ivy's apartment building certainly resembles the Brill Building, with its charming elevators. <br /> <br /> Charles Mendl is listed as "Sir Charles Gage". Maybe I blinked, but I never saw it. Maybe it was her husband's lawyer, but once again, I don't remember the character being in the movie, besides being mentioned as having made a phone call. Maybe it was in the aviation scene? Or the ballroom scene? Has anyone identified it? <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall was 57 years old when he shot this film.
