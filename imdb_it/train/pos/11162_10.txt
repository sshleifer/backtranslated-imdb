High Energy Raoul Walsh classic of 1933, The Bowery places the owner and operator of local Wallace Beery against the bitter rival and dandy George Raft, with the adopted street boy Jackie Cooper and the beautiful Faye Wray in roles that play among their great rivalry. It is not clear exactly what rivalry is, but everyone follows it in the tabloids. A lot of jokes at the beginning, but the characters soften as the film progresses. Apart from this it is the pure exuberance of the scenes in Beery's saloon. The various characters, the sexy line of the choir, a lot of drinks, a perfect creation of a den of iniquity not too much restrained by the so-called pre-code restrictions, and then the Carrie Nations arrive, led by Carrie Nation itself. All this creates a very vivid image of a life long gone. I don't like to compare eras, but this film is completely and totally different from anything we can see today. The film has a lot of heart and lost innocence and is absolutely not to be missed.
