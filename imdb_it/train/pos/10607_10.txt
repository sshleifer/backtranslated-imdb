Henry Thomas was "great". His character caught my attention. I was so "inside" the story that I forgot that it wasn't real. I wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was. The other people in the story were essential in the composition of his character. The way they came together to help each other was truly inspiring. I love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit your head, as you're not smart enough to understand things by yourself.
