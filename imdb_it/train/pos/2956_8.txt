Today there are very few artists who manage to make me remain fascinated for a whole film only by their presence. One of those few is Judy Davis, who built a successful career by creating characters with a stubborn but very vulnerable attitude. It takes roles that most other performers will interpret melodramatically and add a fiery, deeply emotional intensity that distracts attention from everything else on the screen. <br /> <br /> His skills are well visualized in "High Tide", a film that confirms it a second time with director Gillian Armstrong, who gave Davis his first big hit with "My Brilliant Career" . In that film, Davis played a young woman who was determined to do it in the world, despite the suffocation she felt from her community and her education. In "High Tide", however, Davis' character, Lillie, is about the opposite: he gave up any hope for his future when he was young, and, after giving birth to a child, he escapes from his responsibilities and takes a life without direction or meaning. When he finally meets his daughter years later, the thought of taking care of his son is petrifying; he knows this is his chance to atone for his failures, but how can he be honest with his daughter and earn respect? <br /> <br /> Gillian Armstrong's films usually tell stories of characters who desperately want to communicate with each other, but face obstacles created by their own habits and addictions. "Oscar and Lucinda", for example, spoke of a man and a woman who desperately needed mutual love but were always blinded by their lust for possibilities, represented by their gambling addictions. Here we are immersed in the world of a family torn apart by the inability of the mother to commit herself to a stable life and her struggles to redeem herself, despite being fully convinced that it is too late to change for the better. This is not simply a film with a great performance at the center, but also a rare achievement: a fully convincing story of redemption.
