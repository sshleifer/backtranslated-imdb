I like this film because it is a beautiful work of cinema, made by people who care enough about making art and not just films for the home. It's filled with home movies from Greg Noll's Super-surfer and a load of amateur videos of others that align with his 50-year-old passion. However, it has been expanded to the extent that it comes close to aesthetic glory. He is full of artistic talent and athletic talent, however banal you may think surfing is athletic. Surfers are not astronauts or test pilots. Nor are they surgeons (maybe) or Ph.d (again, maybe). He believes in finding the surfer. He believes in the beauty of human humor. He believes in the great gift of peace, which comes from the cessation of war. Surfers celebrate the end of the beach war north of a Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zeros fifteen years earlier. We celebrate the dead time of a country that fought a cold war, instead of a hot war, with the Russian socialists. Surfing is the ultimate narcissism. It is dangerous, but only slightly historical. I suspect that Alexander the Great would not have been celebrated for his surfing technique. He had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he received. This film has no military heroes. It has no guns. The only beach-star surfers win a beer kiosk and a surfboard shop. This is not a problem. Peace is not desperate. It is the joy of exhaling.
