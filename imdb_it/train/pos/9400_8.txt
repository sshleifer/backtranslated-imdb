If The Man in the White Suit had been made in America, don't you see Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis rehearsing for Sidney Stratton of Alec Guinness for size? <br /> <br /> This is one of the best of Alec Guinness movies and certainly one of the best Ealing Studios in the UK has ever made. It is perfectly in line with the times of the new Labor government and the society it was trying to build. It's amazing how in times of crisis capital and work can agree. <br /> <br /> Alec Guinness this gentle little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea of ​​being able to invent clothes that will never need to be cleaned, which in fact repels all kinds of foreign bodies the moment they touch the boss. <br /> <br /> It is a kind of persistent curse and it succeeds. Obviously the implications have not really been thought about the kind of impact a clothing like this will have on society. In the end everyone chases him as if he were running away, almost like Peter Lorre of M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /> <br /> It is the mark of a great comic movie that a potentially serious situation like the one that was described in some of the serious films I mentioned can be interpreted as a laugh. The dress of Poor Guinness is not just white and stain-resistant, but emits light like a neon sign. <br /> <br /> In addition to Guinness, the best performances are by Cecil Parker, another pompous and pompous, Joan Greenwood as his mermaid daughter and Ernest Thesiger the largest clothing manufacturer in the UK> <br /> <br /> Come to think of it, did Paramount borrow that Ealing dress and give it to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever?
