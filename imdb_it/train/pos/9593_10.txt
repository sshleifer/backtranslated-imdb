First of all I am a straight male white male. But even with this handicap I love this movie. These are real people. A real time and place. And of course New York in the 1980s. I had many gay friends raised in New York in the eighties and the only thing I always admired was their courage in living their lives the way they wanted to live them. It doesn't matter what the consequences are. He's brave. You have to admire it. This is a great movie, watch it and admire what it was like to be a flamboyant African American or Hispanic Gay from New York in the 1980s. It's real life. In short, it's real life.
