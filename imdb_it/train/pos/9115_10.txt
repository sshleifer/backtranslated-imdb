The idea is a very short film with lots of information. Interesting, fun and leaves the viewer wanting more. The producer has produced an excellent quality short film that cannot be compared to any other short film I have ever seen. I voted this film with the highest possible rating. I also recommend that it be shown to office managers and businessmen in any establishment. What comes out is the fact that people with ideas are never heard, their voice is never heard. It is a lesson to learn from any office that wants to move forward. I hope the product will produce a second part to this 'idea'. I can't wait to see the sequence. Once again he congratulates the Halaqah media on producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind.
