Has sung. It has a drama. He has a comedy. It has a story. It is one of the greatest films ever made ... period. If you can't enjoy this movie, then you have to be either asleep or in some sort of mental disorder. In "Yankee Doodle Dandy" James Cagney sings and dances his way to an Academy Award; but in this film it's BEST! This is James Cagney at his BEST QUEST! It's fast with one-liners! He is fast with his feet! It is a non-stop action. And the song-and-dance scenes are classics, in particular "Shanghai Lil". And the supporting cast is great; and the whole film is optimistic, fast and exudes confidence. And although this film was made over 70 years ago, it is still watchable, even today. And, of course, this film features Miss Ruby Keeler (who was married to Al Jolson). She is the perfect partner for James Cagney ... and also Dick Powell! If you like fast and rhythmic films, with lots of songs and dances, this is the movie to watch.
