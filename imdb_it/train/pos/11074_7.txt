Neither the total disaster that the critics of the United Kingdom claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece of its few fanboys insist, Revolver is at least an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add some substance to his cone capers. But then, nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites more than it can chew, especially one that uses the gangster / con-artist movie. As can be expected from the name of Luc Besson in the credits as a producer, there is a definite element of "Cinema de look" in this regard: set in a sort of realistic fantasy world in which America and Great Britain overlap, it seems fantastic, it has a pair of superbly edited action sequences and oozes style, which set it apart as disposable entertainment. But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than just rehash his films for a quick penny, and spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything else. If anything his problem is that he is trying to throw too many influences (a bit of Machiavelli, a bit of Godard, many of the chess principles), motifs and techniques, dirtying the screen with quotes: the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams on photos of corpses of mafia victims, and sometimes it seems that he never read a fortune cookie that he didn't want to turn into a movie. Rather than a commercial for kabbalism, it is really more of a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce, chess and tricks of confidence that for the most part unleashes the difficult trick of making theosophy accessible by hiding central (somehow metaphysical) control of the film. br /> <br /> The last third is where most problems can be found as Jason Statham faces the enemy (literally) inside with a lot of ambitious but not always completely successful crossbutting within the frame to counter the outward bravado of the people with their inner fear and anger, but has much to do the same. It's not worth starting a new religion, but I'm surprised he didn't get an American distributor. Maybe they found Ray Liotta's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary?
