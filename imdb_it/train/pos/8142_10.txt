You probably think this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you watch it. But if, by chance, you look at a second and a third and a fourth and a fifth time (they are now on the threshold of hundreds), you will find yourself spitting a line from here and there and making yourself break! My friends and I have actually launched the Fear of a Black Hat Parties to get more of our friends, "as they say, with riots."
