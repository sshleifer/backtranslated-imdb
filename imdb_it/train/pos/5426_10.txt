The time has come for Gunga Din to be released on DVD. I can't say exactly how many times I've seen this good movie, but I never get tired. The main actors worked so well together. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are an unbeatable team. <br /> <br /> I just can't get past their exploits in India. Your first taste of sergeants three is when you see them engaged in fighting with other soldiers for a so-called treasure map. The three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communication line and enter a largely deserted city - or so they think. <br /> <br /> They undertake the necessary repairs and soon find some "residents" in hiding. Immediately after they are attacked by a group of madmen and barely manage to return to the base. <br /> <br /> They are then sent on another mission which gives Sergeant Cutter the chance to hunt gold with Din. They find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil supporters of Kali. Din is sent to retrieve the help and Cutter is captured. Soon McChesney and Ballentine arrive with Din, and they are too captured. <br /> <br /> Faced with being killed, they watch helplessly as their Regiment comes to rescue them. The wicked look and are about to unleash their surprise attack when a wounded Din climbs the golden dome and blows his trumpet that alerts the British to ambush. In doing so, Din is killed to death. <br /> <br /> Soldiers attack the wicked and defeat them soon. In the end, Din is honored as he became an honorary corporal in the British army.
