Japan is in serious trouble. The demons have infested Edo, taking possession of the earthly forms and bending them to their ungodly will. In addition, the rebirth of Ashura, the queen of demons, is near. The only thing that opposes this serious threat is the Demon Warden, a fearsome group of warriors, which could be just as bad as the demons themselves. <br /> <br /> Izumo is a retired Demon Warden, who five years ago took the theater instead of Demon Slaying after accidentally killing an innocent child (In a battle that strangely resembles the bar scene from Dusk till Dawn). One night from a chance meeting he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki. Their fortunes intertwine (literally) and are bound by destiny to be lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think this sounds like your typical Japanese fantasy epic / Swordplay, you would be wrong. In reality, there is nothing typical in Ashura. It is a mixture of films of many different genres. Those just mentioned, as well as a comedy, a drama and a love story. The director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) juggles the genre quite respectfully (even if the play seems forced in some scenes) and the end result is a ridiculous popcorn movie, but really funny. <br /> <br /> To be sure, there are flaws in the film. Part of the humor seems forced and out of place. And acting is not the best. But seriously, do you watch the Fantasy / Swordplay / Comedy movies for the big recitations? No, we watch them for the crazy CG action and graphics, which Ashura has in Spades. Not to be misleading, the film is not all action, but is generously spaced with a lot of sword and buckets of green blood to keep the average spectator happy. <br /> <br /> Bottom line; the film has its faults and is not an epic of martial arts, but it does not try to be and presents interesting images and a good sword action. The reason the film worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the viewer does the same, he is sure to be delighted by this funny and silly fantasy sword action movie. <br /> <br /> My Rating 7 out of 10. Fun popcorn movie.
