This modest and ordinary series deserves credit in the TV history books for two reasons: it was the first to win an Emmy for the best syndicated series, and it was the very first show of the fabulous Republic Pictures studios, known for its low shooters -budget but powerful in the 30s and 40s. <br /> <br /> Republic was one of the first Hollywood studios to take a leap into the small screen, which was still in its infancy. But the role of studios as a TV drama producer would be brief. After this show, later they delighted with the other format for which they were known, the adventure series, with "Commando Cody", as well as with other series, but like this one, they didn't last more than 39 episodes. Furthermore, the Republic was in its last stages as a study; would end his term in Hollywood as a rental stage for several Revue Studio series such as "Soldiers of Fortune", the original "Dragnet" and "Kit Carson", before finally closing its doors in 1959. <br /> <br In any case, "Stories of the Century" was not so bad, his business card was a story based on authentic figures from Western history, mainly outlaws like Black Bart, Johnny Ringo, John Wesley Hardin, The Dalton Bros .and the like. The late Jim Davis, best known for his role as Ewing patriarch in "Dallas", did a lovely job in the lead role of Matt Clark, a fictional rail detective who has to fight with outlaws, played by a veteran and soon-to-be protagonists veterans. <br /> <br /> Two surprising facts: the accidents would have taken place in different timelines, some in 1880, some at the beginning of the century, but Clark never gets old. And besides, Matt is lucky enough to saddle up with two adorable female detectives as helpers, Frankie Adams, played by Mary Castle, and his replacement, Margaret "Jonesy" Jones, by Kristine Miller. The Lone Ranger could only wish for a company of women. You can spend this time with Tonto for so long. <br /> <br /> "Stories Of The Century" is a production of Studio City TV by Republic Pictures Corp. 39 episodes were made during 1954, all 39 of which are in public domain and on DVD.
