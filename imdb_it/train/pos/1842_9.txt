Series 2 had a great start! I don't think it is necessary to have seen the series 1 to understand what is happening, but like every series it is nice to feel the sense of the characters and to worry about what happens to them. And this show makes you think so! These 4 30-something women seem to lead fascinating and exciting lives but the premise is credible and realistic. So the twists that come thanks to their love and sexual life are exciting to watch, but you also know that these are problems that also happen to real women. It concerns the decisions we make as women and how we are sometimes guided on certain paths of our life rather than consciously making these choices!
