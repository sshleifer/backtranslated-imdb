This film is fantastic for three main reasons. It is aesthetically beautiful. I absolutely loved it. There is a bold color theme throughout the film with extraordinary costumes and picturesque sets. A photograph that seems very expensive (and probably not) completes the look. I always like those stories about groups of misfits / loners who come together and become a family. Sometimes they fall into clich√©s but this doesn't. This group of actors actually portrays correct but extremely nice characters. Alan Larkin is the best (between him, the van and the road movie theme, I couldn't help but remember my favorite movie last year Little Miss Sunshine ??). I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio, a very interesting actor, and I just got a little annoyed by Til Schweiger's performance sometimes. The opening scene, all the scenes in which they fix their tricks are a lot of fun. There is a mix of humor and emotion throughout the film. I really like the end. And of course it's all centered on the theme of magicians. A good magician is making sure that the public looks where he wants to create an illusion. Which is exactly what a director does and that's why they call it film magic.
