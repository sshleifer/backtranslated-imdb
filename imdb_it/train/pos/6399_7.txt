While it certainly wasn't the best film I've ever seen, it was certainly worth the $ 8 (which can't be said for many films these days). <br /> <br /> This was a pleasant account of true history, although many of the details of the real story were distorted for the film, (for example, the character of Billy Sunday was composed of three or four people in history real combined together). Robert De Niro was obviously good, and Cuba Gooding, Jr., was also impressive.
