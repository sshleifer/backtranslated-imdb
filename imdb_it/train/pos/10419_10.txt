I must agree with MR. Caruso Jr Lanza, was the best god of the voice he had to offer if only he could find the courage to go around Hollywood and head towards the opera he could have been the American Caruso who everyone says could have been, but in anyway he is a fantastic introduction to art, there are no bones on it and if this is the way it will be like this. see the film you will understand why Lanza is still under discussion even in my house. Someone says Pavarotti that I say MARIO LANZA. As for the movie itself when it will be on DVD, they must have restored it and VHS is not good enough but this should also be the only Lanza movie put on DVD, the others are just bad and boring.
