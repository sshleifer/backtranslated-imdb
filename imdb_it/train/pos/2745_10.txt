I've seen a lot of movies, but "In Cold Blood" stands alone in a class by itself. It excels in every department. The fact that it contains few large stars helps to push it upwards as you pay more attention to the characters and their story, rather than the name on the box. Blake and Wilson turn into the killer duo's star performances. The fact that most films are shot in the real places where the crime occurred, even within the same house, adds further chills. Black and white photography obscures the atmosphere and photography is magnificent. There are many great cinematic works out there, but if I could only vote for one at the top of the list, it would most likely be "In Cold Blood".
