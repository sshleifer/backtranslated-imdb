This film is surprising for several reasons. Harris takes an extremely embarrassing documentary and turns it into a relevant social commentary. Groovin 'Gary is a small-town boy who is (presumably) well-liked for his numerous imitations. When he decides to play Olivia Newton John in a local talent show (for which he is very passionate), Gary's actions show that he is at odds with the conservative social environment in which he lives. This results in a series of justifications for his actions so that people do not think they are in reality a transvestite or another social outcast. In the second episode, Harris exploits the struggle between Gary and Beaver in a novice attempt to make a narrative out of the original documentary. The third and final episode of the trilogy is truly surprising for Harris's extreme sensitivity to the subject. Unlike the second episode, "The Orkly Kid" shows Gary as a truly tormented character. It strives to gain acceptance within its community without success. His secret passion for dressing up as Olivia Newton John takes him further away from people who already consider him a social outcast. The film is represented in such a realistic way that, like reality, it lends itself to many reactions. Surely, you can see Gary as a ridiculously pathetic character, but he can also identify with him as an outcast.
