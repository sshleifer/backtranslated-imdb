20 out of 10 This is a truly wonderful story about a war-time evacuated and carpenter carpenter Tom Oakley. The boy (William Beech) is rented with Tom and it is immediately obvious that he has serious problems when he bathes his bed the first night. William is illiterate and scared, but somehow the two find solace in each other's solitude. It emerges that William has a talent as an artist and we see Tom's talent as a choir master in a fun representation of Jerusalem. William became friends with Zacharias Wrench, a young Jew from London and together with Tom and Zacharias, he finally learns to read and write and to feel part of this small and close community. Just as he's settling in, William is called back to London by his mother, and that's where we see why he's so messed up. His mother is clearly mentally ill and when Tom does not hear William, he goes to London to look for him. Eventually he finds him holding his dead little sister, where he was tied up in a cellar. After a spell in the hospital, Tom realizes he must kidnap him and take him home with him. The climax is a bitter-sweet ending when William is told that he must be adopted by Tom, while at the same time his best friend Zacharias's learning was killed in an air raid in London. For me, one of the most moving scenes was when Tom was talking to an Interior Ministry official. <br /> <br /> I like "me" and "for what it's worth, I think he loves me too". <br /> <br /> It just doesn't improve what it does?
