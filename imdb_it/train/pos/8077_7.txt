A film made for the contemporary public. The masses see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and of course sensual scenes. This is not exactly a film that you feel comfortable watching with the whole family. It is not for children's eyes. I had to advance a good number of scenes. <br /> <br /> If it's just the entertainment you're looking for, then this movie has it all. The songs are catchy. A sumptuous production, I must add. <br /> <br /> However, the message of the film is not universal. Emphasize on the idea of ​​karma. I mean, if you do good, you'll be fine. And if you do evil, you will get evil. The fruit of good deeds is good, while the fruit of evil is bad. <br /> <br /> In real life, this is not always true. It is known that most people do not get justice in this world. While it is true that some evil people meet an evil end, there are many who flee. And then, there are many people who do good, yet in return they encounter a sorry end. <br /> <br /> If you don't care about the message, and all you want is an escape from the mundane reality, this movie is an entertainer, that's fine.
