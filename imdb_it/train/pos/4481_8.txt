The only reason I gave this film 8/10 stars, and not 10, is because 1) Sinatra is horrible and 2) Kelly's love interest leaves a lot to be desired, (IMHO). I love Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, he's the kid. The dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the funniest and most amazing dance sequences I've ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still my daughter's and me's favorites. I am 28 years old and she is 4, so while the character is less iconic than Mickey Mouse, it is still a favorite of many children and adults. Kelly is as captivating as ever, her eyes full of fun and excitement. In every movie I've ever seen, he always steals the show. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. No wonder Paula Abdul "tried" Kelly's moves. I would also like to list Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century. If you only have to look at one part, don't miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse. You will not be disappointed.
