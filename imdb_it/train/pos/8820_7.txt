I saw the film while recovering from a major surgery. While I knew it was just a "B" movie, a western space, I loved it. He could miss the flash of high dollar productions that didn't hold my imagination and provided a great escape. Unfortunately our society has so much available, discounting small attempts is too easy. In the same way that I can enjoy a school performance by Shakespeare, I can appreciate many levels of realization for art. I am a policeman and I found affinity with the retired LAPD. Dreams like those that haunt me, that at the moment of the crisis I will not be able to answer to save the life of another (or mine). while it was a romantic ending in which Farnsworth brought out the bad (predictable) I needed some happy romanticism where good can triumph. My world is really too cynical.
