Oh my God, I think this may be the single most exaggerated movie I've ever seen. I'm serious, this is one of the best b-movies. The first proof is that it's not a $ 5 DVD. Oh no, this is too traditional for that. I got it on VHS, from a bin full of videos for rent in my local video store. <br /> <br /> If I may mention the blurb: "In the 17th century in Japan, there lived a samurai who would have established His name was Mayeda, sent on an epic journey through the world to acquire 5,000 muscatels from the King of Spain, while at sea a violent storm swallows up their precious gold destined to buy weapons and almost takes life Mayeda must fight all the odds to survive and ensure the fate of his beloved Japan. "Then he goes on to say" An epic adventure of million dollars set on three continents "<br /> <br /> I must have seen a different movie. It wasn't epic, and it certainly wasn't a million dollars. No, 'Shogun Mayeda' is really just the crazy adventures of the Maygrass-speaking Engrish (Sho Kosugi). It's not even a Shogun, but it's not important. What is important, is that it makes a nice impression of the repeated accusation of John Cleese about the only castle of 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', and of his ability to pass from serious scenes to show his samurai mental powers. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the Engrish accent by Sho Kosugi. The film may lack almost everything that makes a good film, but it makes up for it with some of the happiest lines ever, presented by the most captivating accent of all time. And honestly, do you really want something else? You could run "Shogun Mayeda" to the end and repeat Kosugi's final line again and again. The tape will probably wear out before you get tired of that line. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - So very very poor.
