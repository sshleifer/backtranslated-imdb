The film itself is so pathetic. He portrayed the deaf as cynical towards hearing people. Of course, some deaf people are wary of hearing meetings, but they are not necessarily as angry as the character of Marlee Matlin throughout the story. Deaf people don't go to the bar and dance like Matlin did. All in all, the film itself is more boring than pathetic. It's so boring that I'd like to believe it's a movie cured by insomnia. If I have a problem sleeping, I can simply enter Children of a Lesser God and watch. He'll put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind, this is a deaf person who speaks.
