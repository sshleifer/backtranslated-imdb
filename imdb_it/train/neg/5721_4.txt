I was not at all a fan of the famous 2005 movie "Hostel", and most of these nonsense is bad or worse - yet "Live Feed" managed to keep me amused for the first 30 minutes. Started with lots of squalid sexual scenes, followed by some good scenes of death involving the Chinese Organized Crime Team and a 7 foot leather apron with an apron ... What got me out of the movie was the hard 'hero' with guns and resentment to save the day ... I would call this film mediocre, at best, since a premise that particularly involves the hateful young people who are massacred in a squalid pornographic theater, doubling as hiding for the mafia, it attracts me. If only torture were prolonged enough to be completely effective, then my assessment would have been very different. Unfortunately, most of the cruelty is accumulated in a scene, leaving the rest of the film to conclude as a vengeful scenario. So basically, it's just a low budget "hostel" that pays for itself with the saving use of free sex, almost constant during the first half of the movie ... Overall, I'd say don't worry about it.
