OK - I LOVE this movie ... I will give credit to this movie - alone - for making me such a hard and hard horror fanatic. I could never watch this movie alone. I have also heard many many stories about the effect it has had in its original version in cinemas, on its viewers. Incredible masterpiece ... Horrible and psychological things scares my pants. Oh bless their hearts, whoever made this fantastic movie. I love it. I thought the whole movie was decent and interesting. This movie is so scary - this is the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life! Not that what happens in the film and the idea of ​​the film are not scary enough, but what always struck me was Brendan's fabulous acting. The best EVER horror film. Nothing can ever be this scary again. Halloween observation at its best.
