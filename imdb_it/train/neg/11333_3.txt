This movie is just crap. Although the directors claim to be part of that culture, it is still a very, very bad directorial debut. The argument itself is very interesting and I accept the bad acting due to the fact that they are all amateurs and never acted before, but the worst thing about this film is the dialogues and the very inexperienced and naive direction. There is absolutely no timing in that movie. I felt like the directors were so excited about making that film (it's their first feature film), that they never really asked themselves, what story they want to tell. I met Ben (one of the directors) on several occasions and he is a kind and caring guy, but that doesn't make him a director. I think "American History X" is full of clichés, but somehow manages to carry a story. "Oi! Warning" is full of clichés, it doesn't say anything new or provocative and (-that's the sad thing about this movie) it's far from any Oi! -Reality. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Strani but great German films, watch films by Michael Haneke, Christoph Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel: <br /> <br /> Benny's Videos Funny games Die Unberührbare Mein Letzter Film Das Experiment Das Weisse Rauschen Muxmäuschenstill ... <br /> <br /> *** out of ten, due to subject matter and photography
