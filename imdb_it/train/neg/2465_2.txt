This would be a watchable mediocre Hollywood if it had a good editing. It is based on the typical plot of the American thriller - "who is going to outsmart everyone". The acting is below average, but with the brilliant appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mainly responsible if the tension in the film increases. The film was completely smothered by empty videos and sound images and most of them look like raw film material. All in all, if you don't mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project, this is a movie to watch. I imagine it would be enough to say about this film, everything else could really ruin the tension that is probably quite low.
