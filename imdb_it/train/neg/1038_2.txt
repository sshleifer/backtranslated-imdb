Raising the winner Vargas is just a bad movie. No amount of denial or publicity supported by the dollar has changed this sad fact. <br /> <br /> Maybe Peter Sollett saw that he didn't have the money to make the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad movie that cynically apes the principles of the current "sharp movie making ". Maybe he doesn't know it better. It's hard to say. <br /> <br /> What is not difficult to say is the result. Except for a few viewers who will intellectualize the bad film production in an attempt at pseudo-realism, few will appreciate it. <br /> <br /> I know I didn't. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and pass on this movie.
