As an inspirational director, this film was exciting to watch with criticism in mind. Shot with a low-end digital camera probably with a 35mm adapter for DOF. The assembly is of good quality, the sound effects are not excessive. I would have given a 7 for an independent film, but the story is not so interesting. It's more on the dramatic side, on the character's developments than on a horror film. <br /> <br /> It is not for those who want to be frightened scared and scared, or sit with popcorn to have fun. <br /> <Br /> honestly this film would be nice if we were still in the 50s <br /> <br /> This film is about a family that has a dry field, and that's just that.
