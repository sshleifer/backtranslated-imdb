In general, I discovered that if you don't hear about a movie before you see it on DVD, there's probably a good reason for it. I had never heard of this film until I was in a Blockbuster the other day and I saw it on a shelf. Since all the good films had already been rented (the ones I wanted to see, anyway), I thought I'd give this a chance. <br /> <br /> It is not very different from other films in the genre, such as The Singles Ward or RM. If you like these films, you will probably like them. <br /> <br /> However, if you are not a Mormon, you probably won't like this movie. There is no way to avoid the overtly religious (Mormon) message contained within and, at times, it appears to be just as saccharine and squeamish. Ultimately, if you don't fit into Mormon's demographics, you're probably better off looking at something else. <br /> <br /> Sure, there were some really fun moments in the movie, but I didn't think it was enough to save the film as a whole.
