I was very disappointed with this 1970 film based on a story by Bernard Malamud. This is fundamentally a story of possible redemption, racial prejudice and dissatisfaction with life based on mistrust. <br /> <br /> A black Jewish angel is sent to help a troubled tailor and his seriously ill wife. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) will only believe in the angel (Belafonte), his wife Fanny (Ida Kaminska) will recover. The problem is that Morris has practically given up on life and refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel. <br /> <br /> When you believe it, Fanny improves but eventually has doubts and Fanny suffers as a result. It would have been very nice if there had been an English translation in the last scene when a dying Fanny speaks with Morris. <br /> <br /> Jan Kadar, who successfully directed Miss Kaminska in his brilliant 1966 Oscar-nominated performance "The Shop on Main Street" also directs this film. Kaminska is reduced in the film mostly from bedroom scenes and her kindness in her speech does not really convey the hopeless situation she faces. He continues to call Ruthie, their daughter, who disobeyed by marrying the Jewish religion. For most of the film, he doesn't realize the appearance of the Angel in his apartment. <br /> <br /> The scene in the pharmacy is confusing and the scene in which the angel's friend confronts Belafonte in their apartment is memorable but all too short. <br /> <br /> We don't know why Belafonte is in danger and why he died. <br /> <br /> Anyone watching this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and despair.
