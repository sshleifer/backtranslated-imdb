Ted V. Mikels Corpse Grinders 2's film is 103 minutes of heartbreaking cinematic swill. The plot is practically a mixture of senseless business negotiations between people grinding corpses in cat food while feline aliens, who are losing a war with dog aliens, try to get some of this cat food. Watching this movie, I started looking for any kind of distraction, anything to reassure me that I was doing something else besides losing my mind from inside. <br /> <br /> Several scenes go on for too long, as the characters take forever to do simple things. I have heard that Mr. Mikels does not like to use jumps too often, afraid that they will confuse his audience. I'm not sure this attitude is "avant-garde" or simply "stupid". As hard as I tried, I couldn't think of any of the characters in the cast unnecessarily big, with the possible exception of the old ones who are the factory keepers. Most of the cast are a group of talentless amateurs who don't even bother to learn the lyrics of "Amazing Grace" before singing them in front of the camera. Although perhaps the blame should go to poor sound quality, since I only listened to about 80% of the dialogue while watching the DVD. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie ever made. I listened to the fragments of the comment, and Mr. Mikels turns out to be a surprisingly sweet old man, what the hell was he doing doing this kind of garbage? I'd like to hear the explanations of the old men who had to lie bare-chested on a metal conveyor belt waiting to be rooted. The films that I hated for a long time seem suddenly much better. I crave the appropriate intermittent music of Excalibur and the coherent lighting of Dawn of the Dead. I have to go do something, anything. Don't see this movie.
