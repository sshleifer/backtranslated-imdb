I enjoyed watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling storyline, fantastic soundtrack, director (Kitamura rocks!), Editing, and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled the part perfectly. So I couldn't wait to see Azumi 2, but after seeing it at last I felt like I had won the lot and lost the ticket :( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off, but these are completely 2 different films, much more slow, the action is not so exciting and choreographed and there is not much development of the character, apparently it was directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO monster series (if possible!) I agree with some other reviewers from the past who say this was a missed opportunity. If only Ryuhei Kitamura has continued with this episode. There is still a nice view of the Japanese forest to watch as the slow action takes place and we are presented with everything too briefly a few characters who are quickly killed, even the real villains, are killed too easily without fighting too much. The fight with the boy Spider (straight out of an episode me of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest y memorable fighting scene. While in Azumi 1 we had a fierce fight scene with chamber-shaped effects, Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi head cam !! Azumi's fury ultimately did not convince, but Aya still does a good job. He looks great in the cloak ... but where did he get it from? I don't think I'll watch it over and over again! ...what a pity.
