How disgusting. It seemed strange to me that their ancient book on curses was made using a common script font instead of handwritten. The acting is so apathetic at times and so dramatic at other times. Why would a "demonic" kill the two suspiciously silent doctors who helped him make him immortal? Just for fun? And it's really necessary to show Lilith's bike every time she leaves somewhere. We have it! You spent a little money to rent a third space rocket. That doesn't mean you have to show it all the time! The lair of the "Faith" looks like an old-school Battlestar Galactica set with some last-minute changes. There is a scene where they are presented to a few people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before they are killed for no apparent reason and without importance. Everyone is a disposable character. Forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this film one of the most ill-conceived that has seen the SciFi channel come out. Stay away, unless you like bad movies.
