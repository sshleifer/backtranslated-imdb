I like animated shows. I really like Nick's rate, including Hey, Arnold. But moving a television program to the big screen is not easy and this didn't feel big enough. It was more like a long episode of the show, and it didn't move so well. Judging by the behavior of the boys we had with us, it didn't go very well with them either.
