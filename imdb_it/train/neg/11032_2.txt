"I Love New York" is another voice of VH-1 (MTV Networks) that shows the fun side of hanging out with a sharp and hateful woman. It must have been an easy decision to take the craziest competitor, speaking Ebonics, the craziest - and his mother - and give them a show on this network. Many will argue, "this is a show". True, it's not as bad as the previous show, "Flavor of Love" - ​​but it's just as bad. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a 1990s show "In Living Color" where Keenan Ivory Wayans was imitating boxer Mike Tyson in "The Love Connection" and chose "Robin Givens" for an appointment. Mike talked about how the appointment was okay, but about how the hateful mother continued to intrude. This show reminds me of it. <br /> <br /> The men are chosen and have given names to degrade themselves and the woman they are dating (I believe that an intelligent man who tries to go out with an intelligent woman would NOT allow her and her mother to give you a name that is so ghetto, you would embarrass yourself every time you appear on TV.) but these are actors of professional reality, so why worry. <br /> <br /> It escapes me to find out what's so funny about all this. The fact that this is as false as its newly implanted additions? 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in time for the network? (Well, you can't hate them for trying to make money.) Perhaps the wonder is - who would want to be with this woman after an hour? Or wonder if she and her mother's next show would be in the WWF! Whichever way you hit it, it's a train disaster you've seen countless times before, so the value of the shock has now fallen to zero. <br /> <br /> No twisting or turning will make this a wreck more interesting, or different from any of the others. It appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those who call an "end" to reality shows, this is just another nail in the coffin of why they should end, immediately.
