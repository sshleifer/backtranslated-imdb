Not long enough to be a feature film and not abrupt enough for a short one, this thing exists for a reason, to have a threesome lesbian. There are worse reasons for existing. One sad thing is that this could have made a decent feature film. Misty fits her dress perfectly and is a very arrogant girl and when people are so infatuated with a game character, like Lara Croft, who make her naked calendars, you know that a soft blow will be blown up. Unfortunately, this is rather pathetic. Especially the painfully false sex scene between Darian and Misty, where you can see his hand fingering the air. Watch this if you can't get enough of Misty or Ruby, who makes a pretty blonde and has zee verst jerman akcent ever.
