A very, very monotonous film, here with Stella Stevens taking directions from someone in disguise (it didn't take me long to guess who it was) in the Old City of Las Vegas, outside Las Vegas, for a shot in the Circus Circus Las Vegas Hotel. Stevens leads his gang of three girls, and they find that they must behave much faster than had been expected. Despite some careful looks in Las Vegas in the 1970s, a very average but credible acting by the most involved, and a plot with potential, Las Vegas Lady lays a big boring egg. It seems that the film starts forever, and when it does it spits here and there and never really accelerates. I was a little disappointed with this movie. Of course, I didn't expect anything exceptional, but at least I thought this could be one of those 70s exploitation movies or something like that. Not even close. No one dies There is a firefight between the squeaky Stuart Whitman and the aristocrat George DiCenzo, a year before his great performance as the lawyer Bugliosa to Helter Skelter. The firefight has all the suspense of watching a waterfall. There is a punch and a head hit by a blunt instrument. Beyond that, nothing in terms of action. And as for the girls, don't expect much there either. Stella and her girls (both mediocre but pretty talents, make a sauna and a bath.) What do we see? Nothing but a side profile fugace.Star wears these beautiful open blouses accentuating his true talents, but I wish it would have been a little more open with his performance, so he could write something that would recommend the film, alas, it didn't have to be, and I have little to say in favor of this film, it's not a horrible film in any way, it doesn't even have anything to say.
