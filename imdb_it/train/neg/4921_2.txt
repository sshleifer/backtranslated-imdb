Blaming executive producer Wes Craven and Weinsteins financiers for this big-budget debacle: a thrash-metal update of "Dracula", with a condescending verbal jab to Bram Stoker (who probably wouldn't want his name on this anyway ) and nothing more for the rest of us, except for bumps and blood. Christopher Plummer looks as casual as Van Helsing in modern times - not just a descendant of Van Helsing but the real thing; he continues to go with the leeches obtained from the corpse of Count Dracula, which is exhumed from his coffin after being stolen from the Van Helsing vault and taken to New Orleans. This is exactly what New Orleans needs in the 21st century! The film, well produced but without a single original idea (except for multi-racial victims), is both repellent and lazy, and after about an hour it begins to repeat itself. * from ****
