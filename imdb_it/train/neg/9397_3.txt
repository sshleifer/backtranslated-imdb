I saw most of the teenage RMFTM episodes at the "Cliffhanger Theater" running after midnight at a local station some years ago, and then again when the Mystery Science Theater showed off in the early 1990s. Time has not been kind to it. <br /> <br /> I can certainly take allowances for special effects, which were quite impressive for a low budget 1950s serial (IMando Commando Cody's flying scenes were better than those of George Reeves / Superman in the his television program). And I can also consider ahem, "acting" and fighting choreography -. with the exception of the boy who plays the ruler of the Moon Men. It's incredibly uncomfortable. Look and act like the guy who comes to repair your plumbing, not the despotic ruler of an alien race. Even the dialect full of things is fine: they all shake their lines like strings of firecrackers, without wasting time or pauses for things like "thought" or "introspection". Since everyone does it, the viewer finds it immersive after a while, and even for my modern sensibility, it doesn't bother me much. <br /> <br /> What really irritates me is writing and plot. I'm not talking about sunny weather on the moon, or cooking rocket fueled with soda, or a flying suit with controls labeled "up / down" and "fast / slow". I'm not even bothered by the generosity of the cliffhangers resolutions that end each chapter. I'm talking about the fact that our alleged heroes are more stupid than fence posts and have no cumulative memory. And from the fact that although the dialog box hooks up like an express train, the plot proceeds repeatedly in the same movements. <br /> <br /> Excavate: Commando Cody and his friend are the spearhead of a top secret hi-tech science lab charged with protecting the Earth (or at least the United States) from an insidious alien invasion. But his office has no guards or security checks. They don't even have locks on the front doors. So the bad guys walk RIGHT IN and beat Cody's crap and his staff ... not once (maybe understandable) but several times. They even kidnapped his female assistant on the second attempt. And they never get smarter. To further demonstrate my point, let me point out the way Cody jumps into his flying suit and flies into trouble and never seems to be able to catch anyone. He does it again and again and again. Cody also takes his ship to the moon (the assistant woman arrives to cook), stays for about 30 seconds and immediately turns around and turns back. Cody captures one of the Atomic Ray cannons ... and immediately loses it back to the bad guys because he didn't bother blocking it. And so on. <br /> <br /> And you would think that if Cody's efforts were so vital to save the United States from the Men of the Moon, he could ask for some soldiers with carbines, some helicopters and a tank or two to support him instead of working always with the local police. It had to be a military operation, but they behave as if it were another episode of "Gangbusters". <br /> <br /> It's all rather difficult to bear. I appreciate the fact that the creators have been severely limited in the scope of their history by budget and time limits ... and I appreciate that Cody is actually a pretty tough hombre (even if he loses half of his struggles). But I can't help but scream "DO IT! BLOCK THE DOOOOR !!" when the gangsters simply enter his laboratory, or try to blow up the ship and there are no safety measures on the landing site in place ... not even a fence (!). <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's fine. Of the three Republic serials I've seen, "Phantom Creeps" had a better storyline, and "Undersea Kingdom" had more atmosphere (hah!) And a better hero than "Radar Men", but it's an OK time-waster. <br /> <br /> BTW ... why men "Radar"? They didn't use radar, they used atomic guns. The title was not supposed to be "Atomic Ray Gun Men From The Moon?"
