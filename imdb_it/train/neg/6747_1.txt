Wow ... speechless about the making of this film, I can't say much. The coverbox of the local videostore should have said it all ... nothing but 6 actors / actresses who lose themselves on the set of Scream and decide to make a movie! <br /> <br /> Acting was apparently not the budget, but they were able to afford nudity and good-looking actors! The style on substance has almost left its mark here, except that most of these acting class failures continue to forget that there is a plot that has to go somewhere as they read this script. After only 4 or 5 killings by the so-called masked assassin and a plot of conspiracies on a Murder Club that the stupid actress protagonist thinks is a real club she can join (only if she manages to outdo a girl who hits her car) , you want to stab your hands with the nearest sharp object to remind yourself that you are not too excited by a movie as beautiful as this. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the people who bought this movie and can't find anyone to take their hands off. Another example of what's wrong with the growing number of straight-to-date versions of horror videos without any thought going into it. Throw it away if you bought it.
