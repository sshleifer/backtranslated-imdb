I remember seeing the BSG pilot. I can describe exactly that night. I remember which chair I sat on. That show was magical. He became alive. I liked the first two years of BSG. I also liked the parts of the third year, and I watched every episode of the fourth year, totally faithfully, in the hope that we could somehow turn around. Well, it's not like that. <br /> <br /> I saw the Caprica pilot and I was enchanted. There was hope for something good here. Then I started watching regular episodes, and they are becoming more and more boring. <br /> <br /> It's too obvious, too predictable. It reminds me of the politically correct droll of his last failed show, Virtuality. <br /> <br /> Much of his work on DS9 has been good. When he focused on BSG in an organized way, it was nice. This has been particularly true since the beginning when they have more or less followed the model of the episodes set by the first BSG series. When they left after meeting Admiral Cain and Pegasus, everything went to the plate. It was as if he had written the rest of the show without knowing where he was going. <br /> <br /> Maybe it will improve. Maybe they were just some faint initial episodes. But I'm very, very nervous.
