Enemy Mine's monster somehow made his way into a small mountain community, where he had moved. He is chased by a doctor - who has become vigilant and is trying to exterminate him. This murderous woman, who looks like a refugee from a Motley Crue video, goes around on a motorcycle and tries to save a group of children who have chosen to take a Big Chill weekend right in the middle of the monster's terrain. Beheadings and a lot of blood are first in place to divert attention from the history that limps like a bad version of Dr. Moreau's Island (and yes, it's worse than that with Val Kilmer).
