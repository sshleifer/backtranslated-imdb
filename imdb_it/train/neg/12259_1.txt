A film about a group of directors who want to make a documentary about a new type of surf in shark-infested waters. As an absolute fan of movies, including some vicious animals or monsters, I thought this could be my kind of movie ... it wasn't !!! This should be more than a guide on how not to do it! He has a lot of accidental humor and the evil beast is an incredible joke, in the final scene he goes after the main characters * rolling *, his feet are obviously waving in the air! Seems ridiculous! Good for a laugh though. If it was only due to the lack of talent among the actors, the embarrassing stupid dialogues and the hilarious stupid crocodile, it would be at least a good laugh, but it gets worse: I guess, the people responsible for this movie noticed how weak he was, so they thought of the old idea of ​​"selling sex" ... Basically, I mean COMPLETELY, without any reason, one of the main actresses shows her breast to the beast. And somewhere at the beginning there is a sort of meaningless "trick". This is the last ingredient that makes the film absolutely trash for me. It's amazing how people actually spend the time producing that waste! If you're looking for a real waste of time: watch this movie !!!
