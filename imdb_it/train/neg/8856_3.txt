Lee hosted the 100 years of horror for Ted Newsom and talked about film wolves. He said something in the effect that his only werewolf brush was The Howling II, then he joked: "The less he said about it, the better." In fact he was right, because this movie could be the worst in his entire catalog of on-screen shows. Joe Dante's first Howling was a revolutionary werewolf film with his incredible special effects and his captivating sense of style and matter. It was a film to be taken seriously. Like other good original films, the filmmakers for some strange reason thought that even campy sequels were needed rather than what worked the first time (see CHUD and then CHUD II to illustrate this point). This film is miles and miles away from the first on each front. There is absolutely nothing scary about it. It looks cheap and is pitch black through most of the main scenes. Lee is the only actor in the film worthy of note (ok, I'll also sell to Ferdy Mayne). Lee seems embarrassed while saying absurd dialogues and doing ridiculous things (check that he ends up with him and Stirba). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what this dreck is that is a little more perceptive than the two leaders who leave America to go to Romania. The story does not really deserve to be examined here, and you can bet that there is a small story worth mentioning when you have to have Stephen Parsons and his band Babel playing most of the film at the beginning and ending with that terrible noise. Sybil Danning is here and, yes, she goes off once and then the scene is shown again and again and again - one reviewer said 17 times (I counted ten), but then he could have been so bored of my mind ). I gave the film three stars, but it really deserves a zero - the three I gave are 1 for Lee and two for Ms. Danning's contributions. How disgusting!
