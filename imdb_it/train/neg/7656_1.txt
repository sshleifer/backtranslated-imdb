Alone in The Dark is one of my all-time favorite role-playing games. I remember spending entire nights in front of the PC screen, trying to escape from that villa and actually being scared at times when monsters were surprisingly loaded. Now, mind you: I'm tired of videogame movies. I don't remember a single success story in this new Hollywood genre, although some are fun enough to be watched. Still, I'm a big fan of the game I couldn't resist. My rationale was that if the movie had a plot so similar to the game's, it would be OK. <br /> <br /> Friend, those were 90 minutes (which seemed 300) of my life that I will never return. If I had this chance, I would have willingly spent them reorganizing my sock drawer. This isn't even in the "so bad it's fun" category. You'd think even Christian Slater made a little more sense than joining this stinky bomb. Now, Tara Reid ... I'm not complaining about your presence. However, if the purpose of putting this chick in a leading role is to have a sex scene, - that I totally understand and support (hey, I'm a boy!) - I've seen more of his body in press conferences. <br /> <br /> There is no plot to talk about. Don't waste your time throwing it at you. The credibility of the story comes under "I didn't have sex with Mrs. Lewinski". The acting is just a couple of notches above 'Street Fighter', which, by the way, being one of the worst movies I've seen, I'd recommend BEYOND this. <br /> <br /> Guys, I recommend Video game. It has a much better story, acting and a lot more thrills. As for the film, here's a spoiler: THINK! Wait for the porn version.
