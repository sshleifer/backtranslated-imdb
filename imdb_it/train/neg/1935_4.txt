Chinese Ghost Story III is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films. The film offers the special effects of the spells that can be expected, but fails painfully on all other fronts. All the actors play extremely silly caricatures. You still have to be in diapers to find their humor to beat even remotely funny. The plot is predictable and development is sometimes irregular and often slow. Towards the end, the film begins to look like the old Godzilla movies, including the squalid "larger than life" special effects and a (very good other) ghost with a Godzilla head. Maybe I would have enjoyed it if I expected the camp. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see what the junk fans have to endure - in this case because someone thought they could squeeze a little more money out of a successful formula. They will not be able to do it again: the cash cow has died like a dodo.
