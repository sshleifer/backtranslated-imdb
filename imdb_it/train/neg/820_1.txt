What did producer / director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's baffling script? Were there some pieces left on purpose? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this very confusing story? <br /> <br /> And why did Candice Bergen, who gave a horrible performance, accept such a thankless role? <br /> <br /> The Domino Principle wants to be on the same level as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate and the mark is missing with a very wide margin. A great misfire by Stanley Kramer.
