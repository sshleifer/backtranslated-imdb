All the X-Men movies have been fantastic. And I mean everyone, including the long-hated X-Men 3. They had solid characters (Magneto and Xavier were the best, in my opinion), and a good span of history. <br /> <br /> I was all excited when I heard that this film was in production, and my expectations grew more and more until I saw the movie. I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best film is The Fountain, even if you don't hear about this film when they talk about the actor), and his acting is not The whole film is plagued by a lot of meaningless characters that don't add anything to the plot (like Blob or Gambit), which were launched there to make fans believe that the directors had read the original comics. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of XMen, I have read many, many of their stories and this film has not respected any of them. None. Not even continuity. Does not respect the Weapon X project, or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, or Emma Frost, the reasons for Wolverine are simply stupid and seen in millions of films: Revenge for the death of a loved one. <br /> <br /> Oh. What I expected was a Berseker moment for Wolverine similar to what he had in X2 in the school when Stryker's men arrive and he alone decimates the enemy forces, but hey, this is Fox, this is a family movie and you won't see the violence expressed by the most violent and gruesome Marvel hero. <br /> <br /> Also, I had the feeling of dejá vù constant with this film because Wolverine's origins are already explained in X2, we already know how he has his adamantine skeleton so it makes no sense to make a film of something that we already know. <br /> <br /> I personally believe that the wolverine is one of those few characters that does not need a solid background story because the mystery is the nature of the character. Do we really want to know how the Joker has its scars?
