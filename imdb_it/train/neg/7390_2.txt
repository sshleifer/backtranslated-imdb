How do you write the Italian fat washed who can barely make a martial arts move without needing a heart medicine? In this film we see Steven Seagal at his lowest level of achievement - since he started his career it has been a steady decline in pathetic, more lenient behavior that has ruined his career. In this film it seems that most of his training consisted in ordering the alfredo fetishes to his restaurant. <br /> <br /> He is fat, slow and very old in this film, almost a martial arts action hero, more like a laughing clown. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to retire. This film is about 2 hours of reasons. <br /> <br /> Plot: a fat Italian boy with a great reputation on strength is the wind that a criminal group can play with a drug designed by the military to create the final response of the warrior. This fiction, even if pathetic and ridiculous, offers the opportunity for some of the most important combat scenes that include shooting through the walls like a comic book. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that this movie sucks and Steven Seagal is a complete joke? Yes. I did it.
