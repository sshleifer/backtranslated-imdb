The problem is the role of the characters in the film. Man to Man shows a British anthropologist who kidnaps two pygmies bringing them to Scotland and then realizing that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to themselves. The problem is the role of the pygmies in the film - two people who are kidnapped, treated like animals, yet with such a superficial and stereotyped role in the film ... The kidnapper (British anthropologist) ends up being the hero of the film film because " manages to relate to the pygmies ... No idea how the two hostages feel, of their point of view, their ordeal ... I find it to be a superficial film, with a fundamentally racially unilateral vision ... it never succeeds to move away from the "white" point of view
