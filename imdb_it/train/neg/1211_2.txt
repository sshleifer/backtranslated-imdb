The only qualities that redeem this film are quite original death scenes. Besides this this film is a great DUD. We have Kim Basinger, the besieged housewife who slowly snakes through the local mall for the first 30 minutes. of the film, which added nothing. Then the film takes a while while it has a confrontation with 4 punks who have occupied 2 parking lots on this Christmas Eve. They start chasing her after warning the local security guard who tried to help her. From there this film gets worse, much worse. I know it's just a movie and you have to go with the flow but you have about 5 minutes. head to head and she can't hide or find someone to help her. Instead he drives to a subdivision half-built next to a forest. Typically, it does everything it can to allow its followers to track it down easily. But now it turns into a hard mofu. Get the point. Don't buy or rent this movie under any circumstances, no matter how you like this type. It is so illogical that you will have to question every scene. It's embarrassing for Basinger and Craig Sheffer and for the rest of the cast, as well as for consumers.
