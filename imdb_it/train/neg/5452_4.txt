As for the films, this is quite pleasant. Funny characters, good dialogue, quite interesting story. I would have really liked it if I hadn't been irritated immensely while watching the lack of respect that the city in which it is set showed. <br /> <br /> Glasgow. In Scotland. Yet each character is English (except Sean's girlfriend, who is Dutch). Scottish accents are only fleetingly felt in menial jobs and roles. As a Scottish woman (and as a spectator who likes her "real life" movies to be a little more like real life) I really don't think it would hurt to use one of the countless talented Scottish actors ... or at least those Brits who could put together a decent accent! The futile attempt to use the word "wee" sometimes did nothing but favor the insult.
