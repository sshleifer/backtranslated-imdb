This is an incomprehensible piece of horribly low budget terribly. <br /> <br /> I don't even have the vocabulary to say how terrible, turgid, boring, confused and simply weird this effort is (hey, what? I know I know ....) Set in a Post-apocalyptic America some guys meet on a beach and the massacre and chaos are unleashed - it was all so incomprehensible that I didn't manage to make head or tail to any of these. <br /> <br /> Seriously like this was picked up by National Lampoon it totally defeated me: it's really terrible. <br /> <br /> And it's not as bad as a good way of worship. <br /> <br /> It's just awful, terrible, terrible, horrible. <br /> <br /> Honestly. If you still don't believe me, look at him with every intention of loving him, then come back here and tell me what you think. Even gerbils with acid cannot hope to understand it. <br /> <br /> Avoid or destroy even better ...
