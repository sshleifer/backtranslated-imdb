Next time you're at a party and someone asks you, "The other day I heard the expression 'Author's Will'. Does anyone know what it means?" Tell them to sit at 'Head over the water'. The only way Diaz could have survived this film was through this literary device commonly used by bad writers. There are some comic scenes and you will have some laughs. However the film does not hold up to the smallest logical analysis. Why does Keitel tie Diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind? Because so she can do the chainsaw gag of course. For me the best part of this movie was that I saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four dollars in the video store.
