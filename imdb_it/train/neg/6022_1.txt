I'm getting a little tired of people who use God's name badly to perpetuate their bigoted vision of the world. Well, I don't reject the idea of ​​Armageddon, or the coming of the anti-Christ, I ignore the idea that only some people who live a really good life (seem to be mostly white Christian children) will go to Heaven, while the rest of us must suffer for millennia of hell on Earth, just because we weren't good enough. God can be a judge, but I don't think he will measure every level of goodness. Give some credit to the Creator.
