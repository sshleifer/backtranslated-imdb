This is simply cumbersome. If there's a story here somewhere, it's so deeply buried under the horrible characters and the hard work of the camera that it's indiscernible. There is a group of vampire hunters who go around doing their thing, and the vampires they kill have little aliens in them. They snort and talk like Speedy Gonzales. If you can imagine an alien puppet covered in blood and blood covered with screams horrified like a cowboy guy hits him with a cattle goad, well that's what you get here. These people are noisy, hateful, violent and just extremely annoying. Then there are some anti-human humans, who wander around in their CGI spaceship being so incredibly pompous that it's impossible to catch. These people make Hillary Clinton look like a right-wing extremist in comparison. They're friends of some vampires, or something ... who cares. <br /> <br /> Then there's the camera work. Do you remember how everyone hated the shit of a thousand cuts of the recent Rolleball remake? The people who made this movie LOVE that stuff. There's enough here for three really bad nu-metal videos on MTV. <br /> <br /> Nuff said. This thing smells. In comparison, Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
