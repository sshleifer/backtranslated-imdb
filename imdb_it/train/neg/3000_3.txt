The Marty school nerd (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a group of classmates and then is in a laboratory explosion (set by them too) where his face is marked by acid. Years later all the jerks were invited to return to high school (closed) for a meeting. What they didn't know is that Marty is inviting them to kill them. Then a storm starts, they are stuck in the school and Marty starts to get revenge. <br /> <br /> Quite silly. The murders are inventive and bloody and there are some disturbing atmospheric blows from the deserted school - but that's all. The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel (he is stripped, his head is soaked in a toilet AND he burns) and I'm just uncomfortable watching. Considering that Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after being released, it's almost impossible to see him. This film also goes out of its way to have nudity. There's a whole front of Scuddamore (surprising for any movie), but a girl decides to bathe on her own ... AFTER they know that a murderer is hanging around behind them! And then there's the couple having sex. This is the kind of movie where the killer seems to know where everyone will be and can teleport to them. It ends with a turn that made me moan and roll my eyes, then ANOTHER round that made me want to throw something heavy on the TV! The acting is bearable - not good, but bearable. Caroline Munro is also in this. She is a very beautiful woman but not very actress. <br /> <br /> This gets a 3 for some murders and a really gory atmosphere. Otherwise it is managed by the mill and forgettable. Scuddamore's tragic suicide gave this film more attention than it deserves.
