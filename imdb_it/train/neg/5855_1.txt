The film released in early 2000 along with MELA both disasters. So sad to start a millennium with this nonsense. <br /> <br /> The film seems to fit into the 70s but looks like an involuntary comedy for 2000 <br /> <br /> Anywayz some classic gems from the film: Paresh Rawal I don't understand laughing at his role or crying Reason: Going to look for his mother in the worst part of the village is when he realizes an Anil secret that keeps the secret in his stomach that gets big and makes him look pregnant I remember that in my childhood my teacher told me anyway Urrf joke !!!! as a child I laughed at that time but here? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a joke can't explain We have Anil in a dual role (One older and younger) and Rekha who plays the older wife and the young Raveena We also rejected Harish while Shakti plays the son of Aruna Irani who both fight for the one who has the worst wig <br /> <br /> The direction is outdated The music is bad <br /> <br /> Anil tries us hard he seems too old in the younger role and too young in the older role, but a good effort Rekha is adequate, even Raveena is ok Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is terrible Aruna Irani is as usual Rajnikant is ok in a cameo
