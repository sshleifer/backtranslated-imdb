It's true, you heard me. I'm a big fan of James Patterson. I own 10 of his books and read the entire series on Lindsey Boxer. In my opinion, the writer should be shot. <br /> <br /> What right did a director have to slaughter a terrifying fictional work and turn it into a mockery of the mysterious genre? If I ever thought Harry Potter had been slaughtered, then Michael O'Hara showed me that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only pray that the next writer facing this fabulous book will do him much more justice. To Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: don't quit your day job.
