"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" consists mostly of rambling and poorly assembled movies in search of a movie. The plot doesn't make sense and the various characters come and go without explanation. Looking at this silly parody, one has the feeling that so many other comments have captured so precisely: that it is easy to make a cheap and low quality film and then use the "parody" angle as an excuse for its cheapness and low quality (in one scene, the swimmers are terrified of the tomatoes that float near them, to what extent can go "suspension of disbelief" - even in a parody?). The title song is fantastic, though. (* 1/2)
