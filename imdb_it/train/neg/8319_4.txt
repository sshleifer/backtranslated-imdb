Fairly insignificant. The "twists" are all quite predictable, if you've seen a few movies in the last ten years, and the few parts that are somehow interesting (in which someone uses contextual cues to make a decision) are few and far short of, from the moment which has already been shown before these clues are explained. <br /> <br /> (spoiler, sort) <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty decent. The story simply isn't very interesting. The whole 'still awake' premise is canceled by the astral projection stuff (no kidding). <br /> <br /> The surgery scene is initially tense, a bit annoying, but then it becomes absolutely trivial. <br /> <br /> Not horrible, but not memorable. Terence Howard's less interesting role so far, as far as I have seen. <br /> <br /> Kind of boring in general.
