I hope Spike Lee chose a different title for his film. "Summer Of Sam" conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer, David Berkowitz. It is not. It is a gritty and earthy portrait of New York street life during the hot summer of 1977 when Berkowitz terrorized that city. <br /> <br /> The film follows several young fantasy characters in an Italian-American neighborhood, and their reactions to the threat of Sam C'e Vinny and his wife Dionna; there is Richie and Ruby and many other characters. <br /> <br /> The problem is that these characters are not nice. They are annoying and sometimes unbearable. Lee then believes in their high energies, chaotic lives, which are full of anger, lust and general turmoil. There are at least two long-running fight scenes between Vinny and his wife, redundant disco dance scenes, countless gabfests ... Again and again I asked myself: where is the editor? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, with all that big, the film conveys the possibility of transmitting a real sense of fear or fear resulting from the threat of the Son of Sam, who is too much in the background. Lee is more successful in showing a different kind of threat, one arising from neighborhood vigilante groups. <br /> <br /> The acting is uniformly good. This, combined with the disco music of the 70s and the lavish attention to costumes and production design, really make you feel like you're in an Italian-American neighborhood in New York in 1977. <br /> <br / > The atmospheric authenticity of the film, however, is not enough to compensate for an incoherent and shocked script about the lives of severely irritating people.
