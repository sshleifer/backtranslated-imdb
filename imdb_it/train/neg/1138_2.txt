This was a complete disappointment. The acting is not bad, but the production was so bad that sometimes I felt the need to stop it, but unfortunately I did it and managed to finish a little embarrassed by the whole poor movie. All right. if you are o.k. with mild moral plots and it does not matter to watch a movie that largely abuses Whitman. If you want a fictional fiction story, do it.
