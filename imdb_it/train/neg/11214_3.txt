I saw this film even in a local screening about a year ago. First, I will say that it looks fantastic. Cassella has an incredible talent and a fantastic filmmaker. I just hope the movie was as good as it sounds. I wouldn't call it a horror movie. Putting the decadent ghost in a few strokes doesn't make it a horror movie. There is no mystery, no suspense, you know who did it all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a drama. You know what's going on with both parts of the whole movie. The acting was fine, I imagine, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> And the slogan, "Revenge can be deadly" .... really? ... should they check how many hundreds of horror / thriller movies have the exact same tagline? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say something about this, but I know many of the people who worked on this film, and I know they don't want people to choke up their ass, so I give my honest opinion.
