This film became extremely stupid when things started to happen. I couldn't care less about any of the characters; Susan Walters was so annoying and even the main actor (forget his name) got on my nerves. I can't remember how it ended and so on, but the whole idea of ​​aliens possessing human bodies and everything just seemed silly in this movie, things weren't quite right. My dad told me it's a stupid movie ... I should have listened to him.
