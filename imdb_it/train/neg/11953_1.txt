Do you know those movies you've trapped in the cinema? You are stuck there in the best seat in the house, in the middle of the row in your special sweet spot you swapped three times before having the right place - and after about 13 hours you're still trapped there, uncomfortable and itchy, thinking "When the F ** is that this film will never go to FINE ??? " (Know the feeling - think about A.I. and The Village). <br /> <br /> Well, visitor Q offers a strange variation of that feeling. I sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when it would start! It's endless! So "Arty" hurts. This is the first Miike Takashi movie I've seen. Apparently he does dozens movies and, if they are all wen nk pretentious like this, I suspect it will be the last. <br /> <br /> I'm not against Pretentious w @ nk. David Lynch is up there in the top 10 directors for me, but Visitor Q is pretentious w / nk at a reduced price, cheap and bad. <br /> <br /> As you may have worked now, I hated it.
