Attention Spoiler below. Superb recreation of the base in Antarctica where the real events of the film took place. Apart from that, defamatory!, Scandalous! Shot in Canada; presumably from a largely Canadian crew and cast. I recently saw the last half of this film on global television here in Canada. There was not much else to say except how upset it was that it was a clear example of American historical revisionist propaganda; and played by Susan Sarandon of all people! I can only assume that Canadian director Roger Spottiswoode was forced to make USAF the film's heroes when in reality the real rescuers were a small private airline based in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.
