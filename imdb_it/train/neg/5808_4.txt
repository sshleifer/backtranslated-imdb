In the days when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a lively and warm Hollywood couple, they filmed this (almost) scene-by-scene remake of Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw's action thriller of 1972 on a runaway couple. It worked almost for the first time because McQueen was such a vital presence on the screen: even the silent and tired stone, you could hear its clock ticking, its chaotic magnetism. Baldwin is not in the Steve McQueen championship, but he has his charm and is probably a more versatile actor - if so, this is not a showcase for his attributes. Basinger does well and certainly looks good, but James Woods is artificially starched in a stupid mob-magnet role. A subplot involving another couple taken hostage by Baldwin's ex-partner was unbearable in the '72 movie and sounds even worse here. As for the action scenes, they are a rather old hat, which makes you wonder: why even redo the original? ** from ****
