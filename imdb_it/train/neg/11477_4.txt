Excuse my neighbors Nevada City, but this is bad. <br /> <br /> Brian must have had too much botox because he had very few facial expressions throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Alice seemed to have a board tied to her back. It was rigid throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I looked up at both Alice and Brian and was surprised to see the rich work biography. I would have imagined that they were first-year students. <br /> <br /> Ed Asner and Peter Jason brought the film frankly with their lines and ease with each line. And he certainly did not lose his charisma. I wish I had time to meet him while he was here. <br /> <br /> I love snow scenes and shop and church scenes because I've been there. I made Nevada City my home and was anxiously waiting for the first one. I was sadly disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sorry.
