WARNING! Don't even think about watching this movie in any form. It is not even worth downloading it from the internet. Every piece of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid. Apparently, the so-called directors have absolutely no idea how to make a film. They could not say a good joke to save their lives. It is an insult to any human being. If you are looking for a funny movie, go look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> We hope this Mr. Unterwaldt (the "Jr." is a good indication for his obvious inexperience and intellectual infancy) dies a slow / painful death and NEVER makes a film again. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's also a waste of time to WRITE NOTHING about this shit, that's why I'll stop right now and rather watch a good movie.
