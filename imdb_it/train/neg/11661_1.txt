Basically this is a too long, unpleasant action / comedy. First of all I would like to say that I liked the brother of Wayans Scary Movie (1) and the sequel has had moments. Unfortunately the white chicks do not even deliver the RETHS. <br /> <br /> The humor in it is absolutely raw. If you like burping, farting, stupid slogans, you should probably take a look at it. When he is not coarse he is an idiot. The first 10 minutes of the film gave me everything, totally unpleasant, just idiotic. <br /> <br /> However I've seen everything since I was with a friend (otherwise I wouldn't have bothered). The story is undeniably subtle, it was also in the movies of fear, but at least the laughter was fast and constant. I think this is probably one of the main problems with this film too, the laughter doesn't come fast enough. Some jokes are dragged too long when they are more disgusting than fun in the first place. If you prefer your play with few brain cells, simply avoid this. If you want a stupid comedy with more laughter, watch movies, airplanes, scary hotshots 1 + 2. <br /> <br /> 1/10 Completely unattractive, Subtle plot, A film that seems based on an idea (ie what if we dressed as white chicks for a movie?) but we simply didn't have enough material.
