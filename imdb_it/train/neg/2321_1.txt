I can't believe this show is still worth a 9 out of 10. I could see if those votes were in the first 2 seasons, but what would anyone have to continue to vote high afterwards? I was a big fan of the 1st season. I was hooked - all the mystery, suspense, inexplicable events. You never knew what would happen next. In the second season, I was still looking faithfully, but I felt a little frustrated that some basic things had yet to be explained. And instead of giving you more answers, it just seemed more questions. I love the suspense, but you have to throw people away from time to time to keep them watching. <br /> <br /> Now, I can't even remember what eventually pushed me, but somewhere in season 2, I had enough. I'm not a big fan of viewing appointments - and clearly you can't miss an episode to stay up to date on what's happening. Therefore, it was no longer worth it for me. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that they could not have been a little smarter and more respectful of faithful fans. I agree with some of the posters that the ABC seems to have become greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this show. They do not realize that in the end, they will lose more fans than they could earn.
