I just looked at it. A couple of laughs, but nothing to write home about. Jason Lee seemed to be enjoying himself. The (long) dvd gag reel consists almost exclusively in the fact that it has uncontrollable laughter. Selma Blair seemed to be punching a watch, but then again, her character should have been a stick in the mud, so "well done", I guess? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny. (Being married to Babs cannot be a picnic.) The soundtrack was trendy and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played Julia Stiles' father (hilariously), in 10 Things I Hate About You is fun here too. It's great, but the best thing about this movie was the casting of Julia Stiles. I could spend two hours looking at her while she folds the laundry, and I feel like I just did it.
