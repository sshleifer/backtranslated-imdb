As difficult as it is for me to believe, with all the terrible reality shown in recent years, this has yet to occupy the first place at worst. I'm still wondering if this was just a parody of the SCTV band. If Andy Kaufmann were still alive, I would be sure he was behind this. Can a rock band lower themselves lower than INXS did to do something as shameful as this? The premise is simple and cruel. Audition a karaoke group refuses to become the new INXS singer, to take the place of Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years and no successes later, the band commits the latest pathetic act by submitting to a group of talented aspirants to become the new singer of a band that is over 20 years old. Then they trot all these horrible singers (I thought that American Idol had its share of doozies) that performed atrocious interpretations of almost every classic (and predictable) imaginable rock song. And then they turned to the members of the INXS band who are seriously discussing the merits of each of these candidates. You could see the best (and most original) rock artists in any night club in any city in the world. <br /> <br /> It has all the usual non-creative elements of any other reality show. Participants in the limping reality, limping interviews, lame hosts / emitters, lame "judges" of the performances and the limping start of a participant at the end of each show. Can these shows be more predictable? It is clearly a publicity stunt by the band; a last burst of hope in rekindling their lost celebrity before they are finally buried in oblivion. Michael Hutchence, if he had had a shred of dignity when he was alive, had to roll into his grave. Not that INXS had ever been a great band, but I had no idea they were so pathetic. If the INXS are absolutely representative of what rock and roll has become, this show would be the definitive proof that rock and roll is once and for all dead.
