I saw this film mainly to see Brooke Burke (as Jill), whom I had met briefly in LA at a model fair, in her first feature film. I was hoping to see more, but I thought he played his role very well. Since she's such a nice and quick host and model, it wasn't a surprise. I wondered why she was killed and what happened accordingly. Maybe I just missed it. <br /> <br /> I wasn't very sure about the genre of this movie, and although I liked the actors, I felt like it was for a university audience. I tried to keep an open mind considering that horror was not my favorite genre, but I felt like I had passed the gags. It seemed to drag on in some places, in some places it lets you guess what were the powers of the evil professor and, like many other films, he had an unsatisfactory ending. <br /> <br /> Having written a couple of scripts, I know a lot of this is difficult and can come down to personal opinions, how many movies you've seen and studied and those you relate to at a given time. <br /> <br /> In short, I found it interesting, but not a satisfying storyline and ending up for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) would come back through the portal at the end and kicked everyone's ass, that would have been a satisfying ending and would have earned a higher rating.
