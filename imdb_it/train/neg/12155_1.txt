If this film was written direct and produced with the intention of creating a cult classic of the bad film, it could (I say I could) have been a success. Have you ever sat watching a movie so terrible that it looks fascinating in terms of flaws? Well, that's all. Each of the cast actors should be nominated for the worst acting awards. It would be difficult to find another film, with this type of production budget, which contains so little of any value. Everything from the opening scenes defies logic. The dialogue is completely incredible and illogical. Ditto for the behavior and general plot of the film itself. What is really shocking is that some buffoons in a boardroom have actually made the decisions to spend money on this piece of junk. Wow.
