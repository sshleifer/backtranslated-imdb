- When the local sheriff is killed, his wife takes over until she is determined to clean up the city. However, not everyone in the city is happy with what he is doing. When the sheriff orders a curfew in the city, the owner of the local saloon (also a woman) hires a killer to take care of the sheriff. In no way could the owner of the salon know that the sheriff and the murderer would fall in love. <br /> <br /> - Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and combines it with a bad performance. There's a good movie here somewhere trying to get out. In the most capable hands or with a larger budget, Gunslinger could have been a funny look at the role of women in the old West. As it is, Gunslinger is a movie disaster. <br /> <br /> - There are so many things wrong with the film: a supporting cast without acting skills, stylized and unnatural dialogues and sets that look like sets. But the biggest delinquent is editing. I was amazed how many times a scene with the actors (and even the horses) would start, obviously waiting for Corman to shout "Action". The best is the scene of two horse riders standing next to a building. Suddenly, they take off and come running around the corner as if they were riding for several miles. Or take the example of people who can apparently move to the city. We see a man enter a building and a second later emerge into the city to mount his horse. <br /> <br /> - It's not like Corman didn't have a few decent actors to work with. While no one was big stars, Beverly Garland, John Ireland and Allison Hayes were all able to perform well. But in Gunslinger they don't have much to do. <br /> <br /> - Now I've seen both the MST3K and non-MST3K versions of the film. I highly recommend following the MST3K route.
