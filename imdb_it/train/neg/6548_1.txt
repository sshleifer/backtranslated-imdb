If you are looking at this without an idea of ​​what the story is, then you are quite surprised. Even then the synopsis painted a picture of a rather healthy plot, but the real film is everything but. <br /> <br /> How the synopsis went, tells of an obsessed mountaineer, whom you will see as the prologue in front of the opening titles and the text that crawl, which tells you of the presence of Chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind (known to itself, this is a trouble with flashing lights), where its inhabitants are immortal eager for a change in their omnipresence. They can see our world and notice all these people this mountaineer, and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy, creating a smart sphere to meet the man. <br /> <br /> What he translated is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5-year-old could produce. Create created shapes, even if the merit goes to the stop motion style and you put it in a cycle that numbs the mind. And repeat until your eyes start to close, then move on to the next scene. If anything, the Chonopolisians (if this term exists) really love their sticks and balls, constantly playing to summon that magic sphere, and having a field day playing with it before releasing it into the "other" world. Nothing better, when man interacts with the sphere in another hypnotic and boring sequence that induces sleep. <br /> <br /> Thank goodness, of course, the execution time is shorter than what is advertised, or 57 minutes (or less) against the 70 declared. Although firmly dated, its dull colors, non-existent history, scratchy soundtrack and repetitive images will captivate fans. Do not waste time
