While the premise behind The House Where Evil Dwells could be intriguing, the execution is decidedly pathetic. I'm not even sure where to start, since I've had so many problems with this movie. I suppose I only listed a few: <br /> <br /> 1. The acting ?? When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure and Susan George (and his teeth) are the stars of your film, do you know you're in trouble? Not that it's important to me, but these are not A-List names. Susan George may have been in a couple of movies that I like, but I've never considered her the greatest actress I've ever seen. And in this film, his acting is embarrassing. As for the other two, the less I said, the better. <br /> <br /> 2. The ghosts ?? Ghosts, spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me of a lot of ghosts in the haunted house run. At Disney World. And they're scary. And why did they have to be so obvious? Subtlety is not a feature of The House Where Evil Dwells. <br /> <br /> 3. The plot ?? How predictable can a film be? The result of this film is painfully obvious when you meet the three main characters. If you can't see where this movie is going after about 15 minutes, you have to see more movies. <br /> <br /> 4. The convenient priest? What are the chances that the haunted house you buy is in front of a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention the fact that one of them knows the history of your home and approaches, knocks on the door and asks if you need help to remove evil spirits. Absurd is a word that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> 5. Everything else ?? It is very difficult for me to think of any positive aspects to write about. I suppose I'll give a point for the opening scene and a point for the architecture of the house. Is this a sure sign of a winner ?? noting architecture as a highlight of any film does not say much about the film itself. <br /> <br /> I stop. You should be able to get the idea from what I've already mentioned. And, I didn't even mention the annoying child or the crab invasion or a host of other problems. Be careful, this thing is horrible.
