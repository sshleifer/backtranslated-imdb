This movie was turned into an episode of the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think MST3K was at its best when they tore this film. <br /> <br /> Terrible acting, bad makeup, little effect, chick in succinct underwear (from the 60s). I give him a 2. <br /> <br /> The villain is hard to understand because of the trick. The assistant says things like "not you" that sound like NACHOO !! (thinks sneezing). It's just a poor prayer. The long eyebrows are hilarious on one of the characters. <br /> <br /> I still don't know what "the projected man" means in terms of plot. I lost some start though. <br /> <br /> What happens with this minimum of 10 lines on the post ??
