This film is one of the reasons why IMDB should allow a rating of 0/10. The acting is horrible, even what some have praised, the character of Carpathia! The script seems to have been written quickly. In one scene, the black preacher who was left behind, when he asked Buck what "dan7" meant in computer graphics, said, "Daniel 7, * CHAPTER * 24." He probably meant VERSE 24, but the filmmakers didn't notice this mistake. Perhaps the worst part is that the eschatological position of the film is biblically false. While many Christians have embraced the film's interpretation of end-of-time events, this interpretation, in * my opinion *, is incorrect. To understand these defects, read "Christians Will Go Through the Tribulation" by Jim McKeever and "Blessed Hope, a Bible Study of the Second Advent and the Abduction" by George E. Ladd.
