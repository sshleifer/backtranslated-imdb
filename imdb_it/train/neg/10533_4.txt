This version is slightly slower for my taste and I guess I have problems with this game to begin with. But first the film is a typical TV version of a play, which means it doesn't have the charm of the original film version with William Holden. What could not afford to hire more than twelve people as extras? Why move the film until 1966? So could you give the little sister a joke about the protests of the Vietnam war? Why not 1963 and give it a line on the civil rights movement? <br /> <br /> As for the casting, some hit some missed ones. Jay O. Sanders hit the right notes for his character, especially with his scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin, on the other hand, lacks a lot of notes. He is credible as a former BMOC athlete, but does not have the raw sensuality of William Holden. I always thought that Brolin looks a bit like a gorilla to make all the women in the city do to him (excuse the pun). Gretchen Moll was adorable but seemed a little too wise for the character she played. He did not project the innocence or ignorance that the character required. Maybe it's because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be. But again Holden was ten years too old. Bonnie Bedelia has been somewhat forgettable, given that her mother and Mary Steenburgen are unable to decide whether to play Blanche du Bois or Katharine from "The Taming of The Shrew". <br /> <br /> As for Mr. Inge Suona, I've always heard that stories like this from a young woman who chooses a passion for practicality has always needed an epilogue. "The Twilight Zone" I believe will offer a probable ending with the episode "Spur of the Moment" in which a young Diana Hyland was chased by a bitter Diana Hyland, because the young Diana Hyland chose to run away with a guy like Hal Carter.
