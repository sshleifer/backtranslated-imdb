Two years ago at Sundance I loved Josh Kornbluth's directorial debut: Haiku Tunnel. So I was looking forward to his brother (and frequent collaborator) Jacob's, The Best Thief in the World. This is a drama about an apparently good child growing up in a low class area of ​​New York. The film is not without moving moments. But sometimes it's like Kornbluth is working too hard to affirm the obvious: life can be very difficult for some people. And life is not right. <br /> <br /> Thinner, and more importantly, is our understanding that despite all these rather aberrant cultural bases and the anti-social behavior they can generate, these characters do not lack goodness and humanity. We can complain in their language and in their living conditions, but we cannot discard their intent. And indeed, their struggles to keep a family under such adversity has a certain nobility that most of us can barely appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood and his compassion for people is evident throughout. <br /> <br /> That said, The Best Thief in the World suffers from many pains (including the title). The characters are not very credible. The writing is irregular. And the plot is barely recognizable. And for many the most disturbing thing is that Kornbluth uses two young black men who imitate the gangsta rap between the scenes. To each his own: but while I do not question the potential realism of this phenomenon, it pains me to see 5-year-olds talking and having sex with a group of women. It is an unnecessary shock value and is a bit of a forced borrowed interest.
