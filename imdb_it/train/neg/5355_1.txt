Now I don't hate cheap movies. I don't understand why you should waste money on a movie that you could shoot with your dad's video camera. If I rent a movie, I want it to be a FILM, not a group of people who think it would be a good idea to waste some MiniDVs - Tapes. <br /> <br /> Maybe I hate this because so much the guy in the video store said it was great, and it wasn't. Maybe I hate him because he is cheap, he has the stupidest plot EVER, the most unrealistic characters EVER and the SCENOGRAPHY really, really WORSE in the history of films NEVER. Even Tom Savini cannot save him. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is a complete waste of time.
