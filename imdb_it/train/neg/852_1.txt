I'm going to keep this short. This "adaptation" of the wonderful book King is a bad joke and nothing else. Of course there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans on this site and, as a result, this movie has mysteriously found its way into the top-250. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson is as ridiculous as Torrance and so is Shelley Duvall. The story, which has nothing to do with the book, is an incoherent disorder and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes. <br /> <br /> My advice to those who have not read the book and want to understand the characters in this story: stick to the TV series .... <br /> <br /> Oh, and the people who are saying that Kubrick had every right to destroy the king's story, because King is ... not a good writer should simply review "masterpieces" as "wide-eyed".
