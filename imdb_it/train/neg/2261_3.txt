THE RINGMASTER plays Jerry Springer in the role of a television host called Jerry, but he is not THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, his guests are towing stuff, but not the trailer basket on THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, they stick to each other , but not like on ..... What is the point of making a film about the show THE JERRY SPRINGER and pretending that it is not THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW? And what's more, this is a very boring film
