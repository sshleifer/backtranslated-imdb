I've never read Bradbury's novel on which this film is based, but from what I've gathered, it will be interesting (when I finally read it and I'll do it). My comments will be based exclusively on the film. As soon as I saw the trailer I knew I had to see it and I was so excited but when I finally did it, I was so disappointed that it hurt. This is because the film itself seemed so amateurish. The actors were not well expressed (although Robards and Pryce are both good actors - just not here). The child actors, it seemed, were simply invited to introduce themselves, enter the clothes of the characters, recite the lines and make faces. The set and the props were cheap and unrealistic. The management was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised by the gravity that I had to go online and check who directed it, just to see the kind of work he had done. The editing was recorded and the plot (script) was just that (even if the author had been involved alone, irony?). The accumulation of tension, fear and suspense was so mild that it was ineffective when the climax finally arrived. <br /> <br /> I have read some of the comments on this film and have difficulty believing that people love it. What hurts the most is that the content is interesting, fun and intriguing. It had so much potential. Unfortunately, the film was so technically bad that it took away the splendor of the story.
