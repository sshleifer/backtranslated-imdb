Less than 10 minutes in this film, I wanted it to end because it was painful. All this "horror" movie was about a group of whiny bitches doing stupid things for 90 minutes, arguing, crying and screaming. Don't be fooled by the positive reviews as this is really a terrible movie and you shouldn't really look at it. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film could have been something great, but it just doesn't happen. A group of five "teenage" girls are coming home one evening when they find themselves chased by a mad driver who wants to kill them. Two minutes into the film, and the characters are already arguing and this doesn't stop. All we have for 90 minutes is a group of girls who whine, cry, scream, "act" and fight. None of the dialogues is even remotely interesting, so you can't really know these characters or enjoy them. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible and I was shocked to discover that these characters were meant to be teenagers. None of these women seemed a day less than 20 years old, and one of them seemed to be almost 30 years old. At least take people who are old. None of them gave even remotely decent performances, and they seemed to have been chosen on the street or were friends of the director without acting skills. The actress who played the killer exaggerated, but at least showed something that the other girls didn't do - a little talent. <br /> <br /> The characters do not help things because these girls are a bunch of whining and stupid females. That's all I can say about them, and it didn't help that EVERYONE survived. If I have to go into details, in one scene the girls are chased by the killer and their car has knocked a lot. A girl gets hurt and complains about this ... four of them don't wear belts ... what do you expect? One of your friends is brutally attacked by the killer ... and are you all just "too hurt" to help? Everything. <br /> <br /> Filming of the film is absolutely terrible. I don't care if this film had a peanut-sized budget, the shots were terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie. The cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls, pushed against a window somewhere and the number of times the camera blurred, shook and touched an "actress" was horrible. He was also grainy, and sometimes he didn't hear what the characters said (not that it was something worth listening to). Apparently the car of the killers in the movie (which presumably was hit, even though we only heard the incident) is actually the real-life director's car. No wonder they didn't show the affected car! This movie is so cheap that they can't even show a car that gets a little ruined. Oh, I also have to mention the soundtrack ... if that's what it was. It was horrible ... sad a second, then hard rock the next. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, Five Across The Eyes feels like a terrible home movie filmed in the middle of the street at night with a group of stupid girls screaming and fighting for 90 minutes. It doesn't help when the script is terrible, the fear / tension / suspense and (almost no gore to compensate) are absent, the acting is terrible and the quality of the images and the shots are horrendous. <br /> <br /> This was a horrible low budget film. Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> 1/10
