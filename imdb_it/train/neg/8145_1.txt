This movie is so ugly that I can't believe it was actually shot. Are the people who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7 crazy? Did we really see the same movie? Or the same sh ** I should say. Everything is bad in this film. The story (is there a story?) The acting (some dialogues are simply ridiculous), the soundtrack (what is the ****?), The editing and above all the artistic direction, a pure disaster. It reminds me of the old Macist movies ... To give you an example of production amateurism, the mermaid costume is a sequined sleeping bag glued on top. I'm not kidding, that's exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> Another example of the huge mistakes we find here: see in an scene an extra, a fat woman of about 200 pounds, who is talking to her on a cell phone. The next shot, which is in a completely different place, you can see this same woman, who is still talking on her cell phone (!) Yes, she comes so far. <br /> <br /> A big, huge waste of money. Unnecessary.
