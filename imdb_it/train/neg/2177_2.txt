The first obvious problem with this unruly film is its casting. Ann Nelson plays the grandmother here. Three years later, he would play in "Airplane!" like the woman who gets stuck while listening to Robert Hays pine for Julie Hagerty. I couldn't get the image out of my head. <br /> <br /> Matt Boston is fifteen and has many problems. He has a headache. His mother had a nervous breakdown. His grandfather had a huge heart attack. A chain-smoking psychiatrist decides to find out what the hell is going on in this family. First she hypnotizes Grandma Nelson. Nelson tells a flashback story that fills the entire first part of the film. <br /> <br /> She and her grandfather bought a cheap camper van and took him around all the tourist traps in the California desert. The camper soon has a mind of its own, going off the road and so on. So, large boulders start to launch. The elderly couple has adequate fear, but remains in the vehicle to move the plot along. <br /> <br /> In the end, the grandfather has a heart attack after being stranded on the roof of the camper when he went for another unplanned race. <br /> <br /> The Boston mom starts talking to some native American mummies who have been hanging around the house. One imagines an author and makes many notes about moldy corpses. The psychiatrist reads the detailed notes and uses his imagination to fill in the blanks. We see the mother half-shocked, but her mental exhaustion occurs off the screen, just like Gramps's heart attack. <br /> <br /> Finally, the patient de resistance, little Matt. Matt goes under the hypnosis gun and tells his story. He thinks his mother is stirring (this was done in 1977). Apparently, the mother is blowing the astral bodies of Native American mummies into the air. One hits Matt like a bee hits a windshield, and Matt starts acting crazy. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist takes Grandma and Matt into the desert. Matt is inexplicably in a wheelchair now, and the trio face invisible (and unexplainable) forces. Flocker has no sense of scene construction. The only pro here involves the RV stuck in a salt flat in the desert. In the distance, the couple notices some boulders that roll towards the camper. This is a rather creepy little scene that will eventually be exaggerated. As the boulders begin to hurl themselves towards the vehicle, the special effects become apparent. <br /> <br /> The scenes in which the camper moves away from the highway, then turn back on, take an eternity. The scenes in which the grandfather is trapped on the roof of the camper while it sinks to a dirt road requires forever. Mom's conversations with mom last forever. Matt's out-of-body experiences last forever. This film takes forever. <br /> <br /> I was tempted to press the fast forward button at least a dozen times. As the scenes dragged on, it was obvious that Flocker was doing well. Cut the fat here, and this would come in an hour. The last "explanation", according to which the mummies' spirits were trying to kill those close to Matt, never holds up. Did they live in the camper? The director never points out that the spirits are not good in their murderous ways, they never kill anyone! <br /> <br /> While I kept thinking about Nelson in "Plane!", I was also thinking about other films. Something to keep me from falling asleep during this. Boston is as terrible as the boy, who plays a fifteen-year-old like a ten-year-old boy who has a smart alecky line for all those adults who let themselves go by loving him. <br /> <br /> In the end, Flocker wrote and directed a mess. The title is just the beginning of this exercise to make the public feel uncomfortable. This is not scary, and like ghosts, you too can still walk ... away from this tape in the video store. <br /> <br /> This is unrated and contains some physical violence and mild vulgarity.
