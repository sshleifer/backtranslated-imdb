I didn't even know that this film existed until after seeing Blade: Trinity, I was joking about the Trinity card when I saw some users say that the Wes Craven series is much better than the "shit" that is Blade, so I did a quick search: I checked the scores on IMDb and RottenTomatoes for Dracula: Ascension, and somewhere along the search I found out that this is a sequel to Dracula 2000. I also noticed that within the Wes Craven Dracula tabs there was a true sequel to this film which is a big contradiction for the scores I was seeing. <br /> <br /> Now let's do a quick personal summary here. I remember seeing Dracula 2000, and I remember that I didn't like it at all, and then seeing Dracula's scores: Ascension made me lower my expectations even more, but then again, I'm the kind of person who really needs to watch the film myself (any film) so that I can form my opinion. <br /> <br /> A couple of things I learned knowing when I started watching this movie is that it's a low budget, so because of that, I'm going to have to ignore a lot of v / fx and understand that it will be compensated by plot and acting, I was also slightly impressed by some of the castings in this movie (Jason London, Roy Schieder and Jason Scott Lee) <br /> <br /> Oh geez ?? This movie was CHEESY! But cheese can be fun at least, I found it rather laughable, the bad audio synchronization from the re-recording of dialogue in some scenes of POCHI, the stupidity of the characters in this film. Surely they all knew about vampires and some of the basic things, Luke even had a book about it, but did he prevent them from intentionally wanting to "infect"? No, this is the worst slasher gesture in which the girl has to get out of the shower and check the noise she hears with nothing but a towel. <br /> <br /> I must also have blinked at one point, because I'm not sure how "Dracula" has clothes on his body, especially since he is very wild and angry and I imagine that if I were in that situation, I wouldn't want to be the only one to dress him. <br /> <br /> So the film ends as a movie in the middle of a trilogy ?? not so, it is a 'Hangar of the cliff' where I can now wait for the third episode 'Legacy'. Oh the entertainment value of cheese films.
