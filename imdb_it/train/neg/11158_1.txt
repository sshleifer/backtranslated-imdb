What a horrible and horrible movie. The worst collection of clich√©s I've seen in a long time. Not that I've seen much. I left the theater screaming after about 40 minutes looking for a stiff drink to calm my nerves. Meryl Streep was horrible as usual. How many wounded and tortured expressions can have 1 person? The talents of Aidan Quinn were, as often, totally wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan that she could act? Trying to be politically correct, this film still applies racial stereotypes. (Teacher of solitary music, brave and inexperienced, he teaches low-privileged children the violin in the poor neighborhood school). The kids weren't even cute! Just write to adapt to the scary script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me shiver for once. this a real horror!
