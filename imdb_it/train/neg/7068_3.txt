The coolers start on a cold and dark stormy night while a bus leaves three passengers in front of a bus station, a young boy named Mason (Jesse Emery), a university professor Dr. Howard Conrow (David Wohl) and a woman of name Sharon Phillips (Laurie Pennington). Inside they discover that they have lost their connecting bus and are stuck for the night. In the waiting room find two other people, Ronnie (Jim Wolf) and a sleeping woman named Lindsay (Marjorie Fitzsimmons) who is having a terrifying nightmare ... <br /> <br /> While swimming in an indoor pool Lindsay meets and befriends the boy named Billy Waters (Jesse Johnson), the next time Lindsay sees Billy he dives into the pool and then apparently disappears into the air before it surfaces. Soon after, Lindsay discovers that Billy Water died in a diving accident 5 years ago ... Lindsay wakes up and tells others about his nightmare, all the others respond by saying that they too have had disturbing dreams recently and decide to share them to pass time ... <br /> <br /> Next is Mason who tells a story of how he and two friends, Scott (David R. Hamm) and Jimmy (Will Tuckwiller), are terrified on a camping trip. .. <br /> <br /> Then it is Sharon, whose story revolves around a journalist named Tom Williams (Thom Delventhal) who phones, in a moment Tom is at his front door, but he actually turns out to be a Vampire ... <br /> <br /> It's Ronnie's turn and describes how he discovers he can bring the dead back to life, unfortunately he brings the mass murderer Nelson Caulder (Bradford Boll) back to the murderous life. .. <br /> <br /> Finally Dr. Conrow tells a story of how two of his students por an ancient Aztec war-god called Ixpe (Kimberly Harbo ur) returned to life ... <br /> <br /> Then he returned to the bus station for a last (predictable) twist ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Daniel Boyd Chillers is one of the worst horror anthologies I've ever seen and I usually like this subgenre very much. Boyd's script lacks what is needed for films like Chillers at work, you can see the final turn away of a mile and every story is really lame. The first one is totally useless and does not seem to have an ending and the best thing about these anthologies are the short, snappy stories that are completed with a twist. The second story is predictable and, once again, it ends without any reward. So it continues in all the Chillers that every story is deeply unsatisfactory to look at and not to have prizes to do it. The character and the dialogue are poorly written, the stories seem to have no original ideas and overall the film sucks. At least every story doesn't last long and I liked the idea behind the link segments. <br /> <br /> Director Boyd was obviously working on a very low budget and showing. All I can say is if you want to see a 15 minute short story set entirely in a pool, then Chillers is for you. The stories are neither smart, scary or have any tension or accumulate in something. That being said, there are some pretty scenes and some surprising expertise sometimes shines. Violence and cold blood there is not much success in Chillers, a torn heart, a decapitated head and a bitten hand is as bloody as it is. <br /> <br /> Technically Chillers is poor stuff that will not impress anyone. Basic cinematography, bad music, special economic effects and lower than average production values. Chillers also presents one of the worst closing songs of all time, period. The acting is also of a very low standard. I'm sure a lot of efforts have been made in Chillers as a low budget movie and at least the filmmakers have tried it, so I'll give credit for that at least, but that doesn't stop me from thinking it's crap. Similar anthology films such as Tales From the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), The Vault of Horror (1973), Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965), Creepshow (1982) and Tales From the Darkside: The Movie (1990 ) are far superior to the Chillers, so look at one of those instead.
