I guess I'm late for the party. I just saw this 1995 version of Bye Bye Birdy on Sky TV. I didn't know it existed and I was completely prepared to see the 1963 film version when I turned it on. <br /> <br /> I played Albert a long time ago and I'm thinking of putting on an amateur production to show why I remembered it as very fun to do. I was not impressed by this latest version. It wasn't funny enough. It was not colored. The exuberance of youth was lacking. The lighting was bad. No one seemed to mention this. This is not a moody musical, it is brilliant and fast. The choice of lighting technology was a not very creative choice. <br /> <br /> Bye Bye Birdy is a farce, a comedy of errors. I had no idea in this version. The lighting was horrible and reduced overall performance. Even the numbers of the dance seemed anemic. Today we have music videos. At least the dance numbers should have been measured with some of the best, or some of the best on Broadway. The choreographer was asleep at the wheel it seemed. <br /> <br /> Although all the actors were extremely talented, there were some really bad casting choices. Vanessa Williams is not Latin and with so many talented Latin artists out there, it would not have been more correct to write one in the role of Rosie. Vanessa is African American, adorable and talented, but of ugly cast. Jason Alexander's effort was stunning, he always does a smart job, but it wasn't Albert. It was a mixed bag and I think it's obvious to most people who see this version. <br /> <br /> The medium of the film is not the medium of the stage. There must be translation from one medium to another. The exuberance and the flash of the stage musical must be TRANSLATED to film. There is no merit of being faithful to a theatrical script when it is shot. The spirit, the essence of production must be carried forward. For me, the 1963 film production of Bye Bye Birdy was brilliant and lively, while the 1995 production was as grim as the lighting and lackluster dance numbers. It turned out to be an unfortunate waste of effort on the part of many truly talented people.
