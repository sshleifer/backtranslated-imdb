... especially because Ju-on 2 boasts a material of forty or so scandalous literally taken directly from the first Ju-on - and when you consider that the sequel only works for 76 minutes, this leaves you with 36 minutes original "worth a movie "Ho-hum. I found it deeply irritating - as if the spectators simply didn't remember the same things! - not to say boring, having to review it again. <br /> <br /> OK, apart from the complaint, the subtitle for Ju-on 2 was that it should have explained many of the unanswered questions from the first movie, which frankly, in 36 minutes, doesn't go far enough to make sense of the highly twisted plot of the original. <br /> <br However, there are some really nice new horror sequences that show how good the movie was, if it had time to develop, and some of the questions raised by the original - some, but not all - have an answer. <Br /> <br /> So in conclusion, if you loved the first original film and you want to see some further developments of the story, go for it - but remember to keep the remote control handy with your finger on the fast forward button for forty minutes.
