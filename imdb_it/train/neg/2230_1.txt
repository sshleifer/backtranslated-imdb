If you want to see a delayed homosexual Karate expert hit over and over again a group of bandits of Mexican bandits eager for an hour then this is the movie for you. otherwise, choose another DVD from the 20c trash, which is the only place this movie belongs to. the acting was so horrible that I had to force myself to look at it until the end. The cover makes it look so cool, but it's just another cheap and quality gangster movie, along the lines of 2 g's and a key, bloody streetz and threat. I would not buy or rent this movie unless you are planning to be stoned and plotting, editing and acting don't really matter to you. it is truly the worst film in the history of humanity !!!
