- A small temporal hood deceives the local mafia boss with a lot of money. Obviously the head of the mafia wants his money back and doesn't care who he has to kill to get it. The punk enlists his friend and an old mafioso to help him save his life. <br /> <br /> - If it seems ridiculous, it is. The idea that this punk capable of resisting odors and dune buggies can keep one of the most powerful mobs in Rome at bay is simply silly. His friend may be good with a gun, but he is against a group of trained assassins. The old mafioso is little more than a comic relief and is not a real help when it comes to dealing with the crowd. There is also a sub-plot about how the friend's father was killed by the mafia boss years ago, but there is little and it doesn't help the film at all. <br /> <br /> - The mafia boss, Mister Scarface, is played by Jack Palance. I suppose he got the name because he has what looks like a shaved knot on his cheek. Palance is as ineffective as the rest of the cast, doing what it must to get a salary. <br /> <br /> - I have seen some good Italian detective films / detective stories recently, but Mister Scarface is not one of them. Check Syndicate Sadists or Revolver instead.
