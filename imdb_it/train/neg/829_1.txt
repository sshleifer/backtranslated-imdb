I heard about this movie and knew it wasn't very nice. But I started watching the movie (on my movie channel) and was interested. This could be a really fantastic, obscurely black satire on today's moral in the media. The small featurettes on each competitor were good. It accumulates in something that I would not want to lose. But when the so-called show begins everything becomes implausible, cheap and rather silly. That's where the writer should have added something that would make people think. But instead it is finished and assuming that people are so stupid. <br /> <br /> The ending is so bad that I give it a 1. Even if the film starts to promise.
