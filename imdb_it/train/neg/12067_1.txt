You know that a film will not go well when John Carradine narrates (a.k.a. reads the screenplay and the synopsis plot) about the funeral procession of his character, just 5 minutes into the film. The narration is the last will and testament of his character. It establishes that his property is divided between his 4 sons and his servants. Children must share $ 136 million in the same way, but if someone dies, that part is divided among the rest. If all the children were to die, then it is divided among the servants. To be admitted, they must live on the family estate for a week. It looks like the typical plot of a reality show. <br /> <br /> There is little subtext about the nature of the Presidia. They are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family, but the real problem begins with the drowning of that dog. From the opening voice of John Carradine you expect this film to lead to a Machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twisted ending. <br /> <br /> That journey is painfully slow and meaningless. We walk for minutes looking at the people sitting around, playing billiards, throwing darts, the improper use of the blow "through the fish bowl", dramatic conversations between silk tie wearing men, continuous quarrels, circus music out of place, bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of the fake German expressionism, the horror aesthetics of the 4th grade and heaps of dramatic exaggeration. All this inevitably leads to the expected and not aggressive end. You will be happy to still be alive, but the pain may be too great to bear alone. Share the children, share. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
