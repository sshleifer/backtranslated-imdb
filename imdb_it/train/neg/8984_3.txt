If you've ever wanted to see a film that emphasizes style over substance, this is for you. For me, Son de Mar is beautiful to SEE, but there is a small precious substance, unless the amorous, melodramatic and manipulative filaments do not excite you. This could be one of those famous "yellow movies" that you've heard so much about. <br /> <br /> We are about halfway through the movie before something happens: Ulises (Jordi Molla) goes to sea looking for tuna and doesn't come back, leaving his wife Martina (Leonor Watling) and son to look after themselves . Then, in six furious minutes on the screen, they bury Ulises, Martina gets married again, and her son grows until mid-childhood. This rapid transposition is nothing short of inconclusive and very sloppy: after 40 minutes more or less, we suddenly find ourselves in a full-blown melodrama, all in six minutes. I think this is called a rebellious narrative rhythm. <br /> <br /> Five years later, Ulises (as in the vagabond superhero Ulysses, understood?), Returns to his "Penelope" (Watling) only to discover that she is married to Sierra (Eduard Fernandez), an inexplicably rich boy (what does it do to gain all that dough?) That inexplicably keeps the crocodiles as pets. When Martina, in great anger, questions Ulises about her absence, he tells her that one day he will take her to the island of Sumatra and she will understand EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> And here's the thing: he DOING Â«We bring it to the island of Sumatra. The reference dies somewhere in the script. He does NOT really explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and son for five years. YOU DO NOT absolve yourself as an honorable boy, and the film does NOT fill the holes in the plot that fix us for at least half of the film. I can only assume that the director Bigas Luna wants me to fill the lines of the story with mystical clues (fish, reptiles, sea) that he offers through breathtaking cinematography and an evasive dialogue. It just doesn't work. The "arc" plot of this film ends up looking more like a clothesline. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Jordi Molla is a good actor, but I couldn't buy his Ulises as any kind of hero (which is what the original Ulysses was supposed to be). With humid sensuality, he throws a short verse of identical poetry from Virgil about 2000 times and each time he excites Martina to the explosive orgasm. This guy should be rented to reinvigorate stale marriages. I'm sure Virgil would have been impressed. He was not fired often, as I understood. <br /> <br /> This poetic "device" stands out prominently in the film, and I had no choice but to assume that it was a gender inversion of the famous "siren song" by Ulysses (ie beautiful girls who sing seductively in the distance sailors, who were sentenced if they responded to the, well, called siren). If this is what Bigas Luna is doing, you can see the problem: it is offering a twisted symbolism in an attempt to grab High Art. Once again, it doesn't work, at least in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Watling is a magnificent and magnetic young actor, but he gives us a character here that doesn't seem to have much intellectual or even romantic depth. It is above me how he could desperately fall in love with a boy who wears a tick on his face (as in vacant), fat 60s-style hair that looks more like algae and one of those fashionable beards of the 21st century '( you know, four-day growth, nothing more, nothing less). He supposed he was a kind of dreamy guy (I think), but his eyes suggest that he might suffer more from overexposure to an absurd script. <br /> <br /> But don't despair, this movie is fantastic to watch. Just don't try to connect the dots on the false docks or think too much about what you're listening to in terms of dialogue. You can make a quick progress loss on this movie (especially in the first 40 minutes) and you won't miss much.
