This "compelling comedy" seems very forced. In fact, the actors ARE very difficult to do for an essentially unpleasant script. And consequently, it doesn't really go anywhere. The idea of ​​a woman finding out she's pregnant after suffering a drunken divorce is not so funny. And then, when Cooper sneaks in with the child because he doesn't want it put up for adoption, he looks terribly unpleasant and is really pushing hard to turn it into a comedy. It's really a pity, also because the actors were more capable than the script and I found myself just bored by the whole mess. Considering that Cooper has done so many GOOD comedies, I advise you to see them in their place.
