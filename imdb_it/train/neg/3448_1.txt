I checked this movie when he still had 6 votes and said like 7.2 or something, but seriously this is a horrible movie. Let's find out. The first thing we notice about this film is that it was shot on a digital camera owned by a freshman in a community college. the next thing you will notice is that the actors are all friends of that freshman (he probably met them at the pub the night before. Thirdly you will notice that the music editing is horrible and try to cram a lot of songs into this film, at intervals 30 seconds ... even all digital editing is done on Freshman's home PC ... probably using Windows Movie Maker This movie was horrible ... pretentious, had an undeniably bad script, and acting that I followed this example : I would not recommend this film to anyone I know, but I condemn the writer and director to watch this movie in hell for an eternity.
