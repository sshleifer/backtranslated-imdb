<br /> <br /> The innards of a Virgin are so bizarre and incomprehensible that they allow the viewer to interpret it subjectively, applying any meaning they desire to their inexplicable excesses of sex and violence. If this were an intentional feature of the film, it would be a work of postmodern genius, but obviously it is not. <br /> <br /> Without going too far into the plot summary, let's take a short walking tour of the events. In an isolated booth, an orgy is taking place, which includes topless wrestling and diaper-feeding. A laggards' van joins the current orgy, but they were unintentionally followed by a monster that I like to call "the muddy ninja". This monster precedes killing the participants one by one, except the proverbial virgin (if one does not consider oral sex) who receives her seed and consequently becomes so passionate about the desire that she masturbates with someone's severed hand. <br /> <br /> Finally the courage comes out, and then there's a scene that seems to imply that she's pregnant with a muddy ninja. Do you have all this? If you plan on renting this movie, it's best if you don't speak Japanese and you don't have subtitles. In a season populated by boring Hollywood movies, putting it in the VCR could be the cinematic equivalent of shock therapy. It will surely be something different.
