It was nice to see all the familiar characters, but the story bothered me. We loved Ariel in the first movie, so why is the second one focused on your daughter? The new characters were annoying and I didn't like the plot of this. Worst of all, Christopher Daniel Barnes is not back as Eric's voice! Disney, please stop remaking classic movies with these poor imitations.
