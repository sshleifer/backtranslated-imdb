If it wasn't for Barry Diamond and Art Evans performances like the clueless stoners, I would have no reason to recommend him to anyone. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a 10-year high school meeting, which takes place in a supposedly abandoned high school (it seems more like a support than a low-budget horror film of the 1950s) , and the unbalanced class student threw a very traumatizing joke. This student wants to kill the whole class for revenge. <br /> <br /> John Hughes falls in love with his characters too, as only one student and the lunch lady (Anne Ramsey of Goonies) are killed. We are led to believe that the horny pair is killed, but never see a devastated thing! This is a horrible film that continued the downward spiral of National Lampoon in the 80s and 90s.
