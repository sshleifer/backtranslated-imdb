despite being one of the "stars" of this film it does not necessarily give me insights from essays, but I know quite a bit of what was the first ... and what ended up on the screen. I remember seeing the original "freshman coming" cut and being very happy. it was fun, sexy, vulgar, all the main requirements of a drive-in movie. you must remember that this was shot and released before everything else ... animal house, porky's, etc ... so in its own way, this film was really ahead of its time. for whatever reason, the film was distributed to the main distributors who cut out half of the original film and then modified (should I say "mixed up?") THE most random scenes ever. the fat man, the people with goat heads ... what the hell was all this ?! I'm sure it was inserted into an additional T & A, but the pace was so slow that it caused anything before stopping at a strident and painful arrest. but all in all, it's a fun memory for me ... especially in this I can say that the worst movie I've ever seen ... I'm in!
