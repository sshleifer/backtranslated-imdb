THIS REVIEW IS MORE ALL THE SPOILERS. IF YOU PLAN TO ENJOY THIS FILM, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW. <br /> <br /> This is the problem with children's TV nowadays. It's all so condescending and condescending. "Wow, it was fun, wasn't it?" No it was not. And unfortunately it seems to have penetrated even into children's films. And that's all about 'Flight of the Reindeer'. Actually I don't see "Flight of the Reindeer" in a few years, so I might be confused about some points, but I remember being completely impressed with it at that time. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the story follows a teacher who is given a book for Christmas. Now, the teacher is a respected scientist on the flight habits of some animals. I think they were bull frogs. However, through this book, the teacher / father of the family discovers that the reindeer can fly in exactly the same way as the bullfrogs. Apparently this book was written by a scientist who disappeared hundreds of years ago at the North Pole. Now, if I were me, I would have thrown the book out of the nearest window. Flying frogs are a natural phenomenon, but the flying reindeer is a fantastic and totally unrealistic concept. But, university professor I am NOT myself, so I imagine that this explains why he decides to fly to the north pole leaving his wife and son at home without having any idea where he went. Of course, things go wrong and before he knows it, a flying reindeer crashed into his private plane and ran aground at the North Pole. <br /> <br /> Are you still following this? Well. <br /> <br /> His family is obviously devastated. I would be too, I mean, what a beautiful Christmas. Elsewhere, the lecturer is in a hidden city at the North Pole inhabited by dwarves and a tyrannical figure who dresses only in red and white. Rather than trying to escape immediately, as I would have done, greet everyone with open arms. This hidden civilization of dwarf monsters greets them with open arms. Oooo-kayyyy. They give him this story that they are the elves of Santa Claus and spend the whole year creating toys for children who have no idea they exist. And the teacher accepts all this. He even accepts that Santa is actually the scientist who died two hundred years ago or whatever. There is only one problem: they don't want it to go away. The world cannot know of their secret existence. After all, before they knew it, there would be a McDonalds and a Starbucks on every street corner. <br /> <br /> Still with me? <br /> <br /> Now, the family of Mr. the book and suppose he went to the North Pole. Boy, wouldn't they be embarrassed if they found out he'd just gone for a brisk walk? Before the public knows, they enjoy spending a Christmas in the most authentic winter wonderland on the planet. Meanwhile, the teacher gets sick of all the pits and decides to leave. I don't remember exactly, but I remember holding Santa Claus at gunpoint. A fire disappears when the midget attack and manages to escape Santa's sleigh. With Santa Claus on his heels and with the thirst for blood in his eyes, Mr. Whatever, through a wonderful coincidence, finds himself flying alongside his family's looking for plane. So jump on their plane, planes fly back and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> The fact is that there have been some shocking films made in the name of Christmas over the years, but because they are present that festive charm they get away with it. And it is that charm that is completely devoid of "Flight of the Reindeer". There is not much wrong with it; nothing that offends intelligence (well, of course, IS, but it's a film for children and therefore can get away with it) or something particularly offensive, but the problem is that there is nothing right. Simply DO NOT HEAR Christmassy. And for a movie that covers all of Christmas, it's a pretty big flaw. But hey, don't I think the target audience of "Flight of the Reindeer" is aware of it? Why should they? They are all so drugged with sedatives that they probably could not write "Christmas". I gave three out of ten. If it were a TV movie, I would add two more stars. We all know how bad they can be.
