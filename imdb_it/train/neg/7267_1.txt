This film is simply too long, too repetitive, with male nudity and sexuality (as they say gay with my collection of adult titles) all too free and useless. Much of the first third of the film could have been reduced to ten minutes and would have been equally effective without the patience (and resistance) of an audience. <br /> <br /> I saw this film on a first Saturday afternoon with a film festival audience; the type of audience that tends to be more adventurous, interested in more experimental or atypical films, such as those without dialogues, short films, foreign films. The almost exhausted crowd in a theater with about 275 seats began to dribble in the first half of the film and while the vast majority remained for the "pay off" (which never arrived), I never, in about 14 years of attend any number of film, experimental, gay and non-film festivals, with so many people moving away from a movie. <br /> <br /> This film could easily have been cut down by more than half and was just as effective. He could also have gone in different directions, with a shorter execution time, and been much more effective. <br /> <br /> As it currently exists, this is not something you can easily recommend or one that I would wish to look at again.
