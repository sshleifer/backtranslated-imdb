Honestly, I went to watch the film, not because of the actors, not because of the plot, but because it was rated 17 here in Luxembourg and a film must be really brutal or pornographic to be included in this category. Believe me, being a movie maniac, I've seen a lot of brutal movies in my life (Ichi the killer, Irreversible, Hellraiser) but this film was by far the most disturbing and brutal image I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is simply stupid, the direction is terrible, the acting was mediocre even though the music was an economic copy of the so-called "Horror Soundtracks". There is not a single intelligent aspect to the whole film, and some scenes are really hard to bear. (especially the scene, where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby cry - horrible). I can't understand why the film was rated 16 in Germany, where normally the criteria are really difficult (for example, kill-bill (brutal but self-made and had great allusions to Asian cinema and a magnificent direction) even a movie like the state of grace is valued 18). No one can call it a horror film, because in reality it was a matter of showing more blood than of frightening the audience (showing the face of "Creep's" in the middle of the film was a bad decision); for me (excuse my expression) it is only a mad director who lives his disturbing fantasies. In some scenes you see violence, which has absolutely nothing to do with the plot or explain anything. The plot has holes and flaws, dialogue is boring, I honestly cannot mention a single positive aspect of the film except the British and Scottish accent. <br /> <br /> If I had something to say, I would like to banish this movie from theaters, I understand perfectly why none of the big production companies have invested their money in this shit. <br /> <br /> I look forward to receiving feedback on my discussion and would be happy to discuss one or the other topic. <br /> <br /> "Liven up the child of dreams, live the dream" David Aames
