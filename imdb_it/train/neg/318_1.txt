I stole this movie when I was a college freshman. I tried to watch it three times, the second two because my friends wanted to see it. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since it's so fun it has to be fun." Mistaken! I can't make myself see this shitty pile after the boxing dream match / insult war, where burning the guy with a good zinger causes physical pain to your opponent. You would think that the terrible comedy that hurts you is ridiculous, but after seeing it you'll know it's true. This film is not worth the price I paid for it. I saw a lot of Steven rye movies and I even saw Crossroads twice ... but I still couldn't see it.
