Why must the stories of Mary and Rhoda be so hard? Divorced women with indifferent daughters. And why very little reference to the show and the original characters? The daughter's characters were stupid and uninteresting. Why can there never be daughters who love their mother on TV? It makes sense that Mary would leave Minneapolis, and Rhoda would return to New York, but why couldn't Phyllis and Sue Ann Nivens be a guest star? It looks like a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters. It was nice to see Mary and Rhoda together, of course, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there was a Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, a Dick King Dyke Show Reunion, hopefully Mary will do better next time if she revisits her old Mary Richards grounds again.
