I just finished watching this movie and found that basically it wasn't funny at all. <br /> <br /> I am a role-playing game (type of computer, none of DnD's table stuff) but I have found no joke in this fun at all. <br /> <br /> Some scenes seemed to drag a lot (the incline and zoom could have been reduced to 5 seconds instead of more than a minute) and it seems that the director was just trying to fill the time. <br /> <br /> I think I laughed a total of 2-3 times in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The acting itself was not so bad, around the standard that a B Grade film should have. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't suggest worrying about this movie unless you're a big DnD fan and even then it would probably be better to avoid it.
