As a fan of "Jane Eyre" I was thrilled to release this film. "Finally," I thought, "someone will turn this book into a film by following the story actually written by the author." Mistaken!!! If the casting director intended to launch a "Jane" that was clear, surely it would have succeeded. However, he certainly could have found one that could also act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the spooky suspense of the novel when laughter floated in the seemingly out of nowhere? Where was the spark of the child who flirted and danced like his mother? Finally, why has the plot changed in the end? One wonders if the writers actually read the book. What a disappointment
