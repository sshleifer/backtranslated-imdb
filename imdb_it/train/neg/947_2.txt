As someone who lived, and still vividly remembers that decade, if the 70s had been half of this fun and (semi) normal, they would have been much more enjoyable. The real children of that age did not act or behave well with the bright and normal eyes of these children. The country's youth was still under the influence of the hippies and drug culture all that rebellion of the 1960s that it had generated, especially in the behavior department: petulance, complacency, self-justice, childishness, the unreasonableness of them - none of the characters shows any of this. <br /> <br /> Someone compared to "Happy Days", and I can understand why: they were both sitcoms that take place 20 years before the current time were transmitted, and both offer only superficial representations and clich√©s of the current ages not even close to its purpose, showing only the obvious things - fashions, toys, music, gadgets, etc. stop. For those too young to remember, or not born then, trust me, the 70s were not like that, no more than "Happy Days" were like the 50s, since "M * A * S * H * "did not accurately represent life on a US military base during the Korean War, etc.
