I'm not sure what. I couldn't laugh at this. I had an open mind. I didn't want to be a tight- @ ss about it. But seriously I couldn't laugh at this movie. It wasn't fun for me. In some parts it looked like Ben Stiller and Jack Black were trying too hard. Just because you've put two very funny men together doesn't mean this will be an excellent comedy. Some films should not be made. This is one of them. Because it makes a lot of old jokes and the acting was just stupid. I know, I know it's a comedy. More or less. But I wasn't simply impressed. I'm sorry, but I can't give anything lower than a two. And that's all I'm giving. <br /> <br /> 2/10
