I'm a real fan of the original Cracker series, and I own all of them on DVD. Cracker had a tendency to be exaggerated at times, but Robbie Coltrane and other cast members, as well as writers, always seemed to carry it out despite themselves. I know the original Cracker among the great Brit TV crime series of the time, and there's a tough competition: Prime Suspect, Inspector Frost, Inspector Morse, Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Homes and a host of others. Cracker, along with Prime Suspect, was at the top of my list. <br /> <br /> Which makes "A New Terror" even sadder ... <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this was a very pale imitation of the ancient glory of Cracker. I forced myself to sit down for the whole thing, convinced that it really couldn't be that bad, and that some spark would eventually come on. I was wrong, it was bad from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Some criticisms: firstly, only to immediately highlight any potential bias: the anti-American, the screed war that has continued throughout most of the show, has offended me. The topper: the murder of two innocent Americans of any crime and a British addict is, in Fitz's words, "understandable, but not justified". I thought "I spent two hours of shit just to hear this disgusting little braggart?" So I had a negative reaction to the anti-war / American tone caused by my beliefs ... Beyond politics, I had the distinct sense that this Cracker was simply a propaganda support, and actually helped me undermine a already terribly weak script. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how much air-time did Robbie Coltrane have? Fitz was a bit of a player in this, as if it were an afterthought linked to a story originally written without any thought about Fitz's role. Coltrane could have brought the show on his broad and still flabby shoulders, but apparently the writer thought of other things, and missed the opportunity, and by a wide margin. <br /> <br /> Third: WHAT ABUSES SCRIPT! There was a bit of sparkle, and a couple of fragments of the character's development (Fitz's son complained that Fitz couldn't stay at his house if he lost his plane to Australia, the detective he loved beat his poor performers on the heads of their heads and some of the old sparks between Fitz and his Missus) but not enough to carry the boring plot. <br /> <br /> Fourth, where the hell was Panhallagan? Now it would have been interesting ... After all it was Manchester, and after 10 years it would have been among the ranks. Another wasted opportunity (or maybe the actress was not interested?) <br /> <br /> Well, there is much more (it is bad) to say, but I will close with a curiosity: at the end of the show ( while broadcast on BBCA), when the announcement announced that "Director's Cut" was available on BBC On-Demand, I thought AH-HA! The director's cut, which, presumably, has to be paid, could have all the goodies I expected to see tonight, but I've never done it, as a coherent and interesting plot. Unfortunately, after convincing myself to sit through the horrible free version of "A New Terror" with the hope of seeing something, anything, it's worth watching, just to be disappointed, I no longer hope to motivate myself to pay for a second , potentially longer and more boring version. Furthermore, it made me angry to think that BBCA was diced and sacrificed to show the endless advertising stream (about every ten minutes) and then I turned around and asked me to pay for what should probably have been put airing tonight. <br /> <br /> To close, I quote the first paragraph of Variety's review of "A New Terror": it actually says it all: "The initial excitement of Robbie Coltrane taking up his role as a stunning, bizarre, womanizer BBC Criminal psychologist is in love with the heavy-handed political writer Jimmy McGovern is determined to deliver within this vidpico revival Initially he jumps in his message - that is, that Americans are a group of whining namby-pambies in who didn't care about terrorism before it crashed on our front door: McGovern's clairvoyance crush overwhelms the narrative and turns off the pleasure of seeing Fitz on the case.
