The story concerns a genealogy researcher (Mel Harris) who is hired by his cosmetic queen aunt as Estee Lauder. His aunt (by marriage we are presumed) is trying to track down his lost family in Europe. All they have to go on is a picture of a girl standing next to a decorated music box. The researcher heads to Europe and conducts his research in places like Milan, Budapest and Vienna. The scenario is the real thing and is actually shot outdoors (unlike a murder, She Wrote in which Jessica should be visiting in a very large room and Lansbury never left Burbank). However, he meets a young man who is also trying to solve his family mystery and allies to track down clues and threaten the bad guys. Dialogue, especially romantic dialogue, is terrible. I saw it because of the scenario, but the script was so bad that I stayed only to see if it would get worse. He did it. Even acting was out. I understand why Mel Harris's career never took off after thirty years, but it is adequate (but it seems too old for his co-star). But supportive players are directly outside the community theater. I also lost count of how many times we say "Budapest" to each other. Yes, it is pronounced Bood-a-phesht. We know that, okay? I realized halfway through the film that this was supposed to be one of those Arlecchino movies and it certainly is. Guess who says it all.
