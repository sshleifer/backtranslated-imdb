Attention: Neither Zeta-Jones nor McGregor play the main part as the poster would have us believe. Their roles are actually minor. <br /> <br /> The film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama, without being truly engaging. Above all I find it impossible to gather much sympathy for the main protagonist, not to mention his friends fucking and his sex-obsessed boyfriend. The plot drags on terribly, and I turned it off after about 2/3, which is unusual for me, because I like to finish what I start. Good acting and beautiful setting take it from 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
