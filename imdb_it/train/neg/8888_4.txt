I evaluated the basic instinct 2 high, yet that movie got less than 4 votes. This film has only a 4 from me, but has 7.3 from more than 600 people. I don't see a reason why they like this movie so much. <br /> <br /> This film is boring, because it almost never comes out of those rooms in that big destroyed house. And he only has a total of 5 people in this movie. It is almost two hours that it is absolutely useless. Many of the dialogues are slow and meaningless. The tone of the film is also dark blue which is depressing to watch. The film can be abbreviated in a few sentences. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of "Three times" directed by Hou Hsiao, which is equally boring, dialogues are also boring. It also has a high rating! I had to stop watching that after the first story ended. <br /> <br /> This film lacks passion or excitement.
