On the way back from IMC6 (San Jose, California), all five (mind you, three of us hardcore Kamal fans) of us had reached a unanimous verdict; VV was a blow and thanks to the film we would have had a big mess on Monday. Not to mention, we have sworn to stay in theaters for next year. <br /> <br /> I will not blame Kamal here for dropping a clue in a recent interview with cartoonist Madan (on Vijay TV). He said something like: "Tamizh Cinema'la Photography, Editing'la namba munnera'na maadri Script, director, acting'la innum namba munnera'la" (Tamil cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing, but we have just improved when it comes to scriptwriting, directing and acting "). While watching VV, those words sound very real. <br /> <br /> Now, here are the 10 reasons to hate this movie: <br /> <br / > 1. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 2. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 3. Harris Jeyaraj I'm barely keeping from using the curses here, but the fact is that HJ dominated the the beautiful ability to ruin his every recent film (let's remember 'Anniyan', 'Ghajini') with the crackling cacophony, is the background to the music, the next time I have a eardrum transplant, he is paying for it. <br /> <br /> 4. Songs Neither the songs help to move the spatial / temporal narration of the film nor make you get up and take note.The film feels as if fo sse composed of four VERY long songs with a few scenes thrown n between them. <br /> <br /> 5. A short film gone too far. At best VV is suitable for a story, not a 2-hour thriller. To use a clich√© here, like the Energizer rabbit, it goes on and on and on; only in this case you don't want it. The next part of a film seems like a great resistance. <br /> <br /> 6. Kamal-Jothika coupling Two ice cubes rubbed together could produce more sparks than this lead coupling. There's no reason you could root them together. In fact, every time they meet in the second part of the film, they get very upset about the story. I hate to say this, but Kamalini Mukerjhee's 10-minute romancing does more than what Kamal and Jothika do in this more 'Thenali' movie. <br /> <br /> 7. The accent of Kamal Haasan Kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in India or in the United States; and it's not new either. He's doing it from "Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae". Simply get nervous. Imagine what mess it can cause when his talent for using this strange accent meets filming in the United States. Not even he leaves it to Immigration, offers doses of advice to his men (disconcerted Cops of TN from Keeranor, Sathoor and beyond) in the Kamanglish chaste ("Wha we hav here is plain bad wok"), obviously with nauseating effect. <br /> <br /> 8. Logic There are some directors you expect to face to a certain extent. Gautam seriously disappoints us with some disgusting performances in the Department of common sense. Which D.C.P in his senses would have met his love interest on the streets to discuss matters such as commitment and life afterwards! The scene inside the theater was so ugly, towards the apex; we could hear the people behind us challenge the hero's IQ at the top of my lungs. "Is he stupid, can't he just use his siren or lights?" (On a busy Madras road, Kamal-the-cop-on-a-police-Jeep chases a guy on a bicycle just like any other guy!). "Can't you use your gun?" ("The guy on a bike" leaves on foot and we have a fully equipped Kamal in pursuit for a considerable amount of time). I don't vote in favor of the next one, but I'm just trying to explain the atmosphere inside. <br /> <br /> 9. Gore & Violence If I wanted to see women raped, throat cut, more women raped and thrown into the bushes with an original authenticity, I would sit at home and watch a "police report" or "Kuttram". The use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story, not overwhelm it! At one point Gautum seems confused about what extensions (rapes, murders) and what the hinge (history) is! <br /> <br /> 10. Even a double hit, the Espresso could not take the pain out of its head.
