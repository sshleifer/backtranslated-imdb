At the time of writing this review it would seem that over 50% of IMDb voters gave this film a rating of a 10 or a 1. I can only assume that those who gave it a 10 were either members of the cast or crew . <br /> <br /> They say that, given enough monkeys and enough time and enough typewriters, those monkeys, only from random strokes on the keyboard, would eventually write the complete works of Shakespeare. However, I seriously doubt that given the same number of monkeys and time, you could find one just to give this movie a rating of 10. <br /> <br /> I have patiently observed the first time, madly assuming that the movie would be , at some level, develop either the plot or the characters, or perhaps make some kind of social commentary or provoke a barely intellectual thought. Otherwise, I was quite ready to accept actions, suspense, comedy, horror or even free sex as a way to get my attention. In the end, I was disappointed and, as a result, much of the second half was seen at double speed as I searched in vain for some small fragments of cinematographic redemption. Unfortunately, there was none. <br /> <br /> If "The Choke" was set against an episode of Scooby Doo, then I fear the cartoon could win hands in terms of mystery, intrigue and unpredictability. And speaking of cartoon characters, the acting skills of the various cast members varied between acceptable (at best) and embarrassingly poor with the portrayal of Brooke Bailey of the death-obsessed pseudo goth, London, being so bad I almost felt for her. I'd like to have finished on a positive note, but the soundtrack, a second-tier contemporary punk rock party, also failed to entertain, let alone serve to improve a very poor shot.
