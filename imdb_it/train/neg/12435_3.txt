Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin as the central figure in the third film in the Home Alone empire. Four industrial spies acquire a computer chip from the missile guidance system and introduce it into an airport inside a remote-controlled toy car. Due to the confusion of baggage, Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) grumbler takes the car. He gives it to his neighbor, Alex (Linz), just before the spies arrive. Spies rent a house to rob every house in the neighborhood until they find the car. At home alone with chicken pox, Alex calls 911 every time he identifies an ongoing theft, but spies always manage to escape the police while Alex is accused of making joke calls. The spies finally turn their attention to Alex, unaware of having rigged devices to cleverly undermine his entire house. Home Alone 3 wasn't horrible, but probably shouldn't have been done, you can't just replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern. Home Alone 3 had some fun parts, but I don't like it when the characters are changed in a series of films, viewed at your own risk.
