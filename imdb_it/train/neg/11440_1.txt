Otherwise it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - and I always mean. My wife and I were both bored by our mind in 10 minutes. Not to mention being boring, it's absolutely incredible. Women (not lesbians) do not bathe together, nor kiss "accidentally". Brothers and sisters do not live well together around the age of 30 and go around dancing together and engaging in footraces in Central Park. Men do not discover his wife and sister kissing romantically the night before the wedding and then never discuss it with his wife. Absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham is probably the worst actress in today's movies. He smiles when he should cry and vice versa. The only movie she's ever been good at is Boogie Nights - and that's because she didn't act. <br /> <br /> I can't stress enough how bad this movie was.
