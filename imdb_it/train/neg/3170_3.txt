There have been some funny movies about the spirits coming out of Hollywood. Cary Grant was an angel in "The Bishop's Wife" (1947). Obviously the best were Topper's films between the 1930s and the early 1940s. And, more recently, "Heaven Can Wait" (1978) by Warren Beatty, which was a remake of 1941 "Here Comes Mr. Jordan". These were well-written, funny and amusing comedies, all centered on supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels. <br /> <br /> Now comes the writer and director Jeff Lowell, who makes his feature film debut with a story about an unlikely bitchy young woman, Kate (Eva Longoria Parker), who is killed on her wedding day and then returns to harass the nascent spiritualist, Ashley (Lake Bell), who is falling in love with Kate's boyfriend, Henry (Paul Rudd). One thing that is clear at the beginning: Longoria Parker is not Constance Bennett (Marion Kerby in the first two films "Topper"), which is the standard against which all female ghosts are measured. <br /> <br /> There is a line at the very beginning when Henry's sister, Chloe (Lindsay Sloane), tells Henry: "Don't smile". This has rightly described my situation throughout this film. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the film is that the script is not very funny. But it's worsened by the presence of Longoria Parker who simply rubbed me in the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen. Just to start, compounding her lack of comedic talent, she's covered in so much pancake make-up, who knows what she really looks like? Kate is killed while getting ready for her wedding by a frozen falling statue. It is so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about what her afterlife is about to come out of (well, actually fades), so Kate finds herself on the earth like a ghost without knowing what her mission is. <br /> <br /> Chloe wants Henry to step out of the funk he naturally stepped into after Kate's death (from what I saw of Kate, he should have felt a wonderful relief), so introduce him to Ashley, who really he doesn't. I know what he's doing as a spiritualist (he's also a caregiver to make ends meet), to see if he can get Henry back in touch with Kate. There is a lot of meshugaas going on. <br /> <br /> The emptiness of the film is summed up in a "B" story that revolves around Ashley's assistant, Dan (Jason Biggs). This is thrown towards the end, but the way Ashley handles it indicates that she is as much a busty as Kate. Since Dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely imperfect women, he deserves all he gets. Eventually Kate appears to Ashley and the fun should begin. It is not so, and the more it is the sin because in other hands this could have been rather funny. As it is, Norman Z. McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Alan Mowbray and Co. must be filmed in their graves to see this is what their genius in the first two "Topper" films produced.
