This mess is so bad that it doesn't even qualify as horror. <br /> <br /> Debbie Rochon's talent is completely wasted in this movie. She's not even the bad guy. The rest of the actors look like aspiring porn and the plot is so lame that I won't even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and jump to the credits to hear the next band TwoMarlowe play "Better Than Sex" is the Candy Disco song from the 80s. Rhythmic song on Gambleing & Sex. Much more fun than "Bleed". Put it this way, when one has the equipment to copy videos, but only decides to record the song at the end of the film, you have a really "BAD" movie.
