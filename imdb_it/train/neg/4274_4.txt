We are not in the fairy tale of the naked emperor. We can confess the truth of what we see, without being stupid, confess that this spectacle is in many ways incomprehensible and that it is clear that much of it has been created by pure intuition without a true concept. <br /> <br /> Well, obviously many people love these things. I do not. I prefer well thought out and planed shows. And I also confess that the show is very serious for my taste and boring ... those stories of love and drugs ... There are so many exciting soaps with a lot of suspense (for example Dallas), but Twin Peaks can't capture the my attention. I don't care about those people except Cooper and Gordon Cole.
