Columbo's films have been going downhill for years, this year may have reached the bottom. Peter Falk offers the same performance without inspiration and becomes disturbing in this film. As is customary in this series, crime scene protocols are unheard of, so plausibility is always missing. Brenda Vaccaro chews the landscape and attracts the faces of pantomime and Andrew Stephens is a rather unconvincing woman's man. (His weak, however, was a hoot!) The script was from the numbers and its paternalistic delivery. They should never have brought Columbo in the nineties, but they left us all with one or two happy memories of clever plots, better scripts and sharp characterizations.
