I started watching this movie with great expectations. However, after an hour I gave up on this film as it gave me many unanswered questions. This has already begun in the opening sequence and only worsened. <br /> <br /> Why would they bury the Hollander under a statue? Why is there an Italian comedian present? Why did the peasant wife save the Hollander? Why, after being saved, didn't he run for his life instead of starting to make love with his peasant wife? Why didn't the peasant wife save the Hollander at a time when the farmer wouldn't be around? Why did these supposedly illiterate peasants understand Italian? Why did the Italian comedian know about the gold of Holland? Why did he hide it in the cesspool in the midst of evil farmland? These and many other questions appeared and none of them seemed to have an acceptable answer. So I guess I totally miss the point of this movie, and I'm not connecting to the story in any way ....
