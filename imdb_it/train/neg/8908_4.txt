This series was the response of CBS networks to the success of the Big Valley. It was a 90-minute western just like the ABC program was. While it was an answer, he didn't have the material to get through the second season. <br /> <br /> The problem has become reality, it got lost on this show. For example, in one episode, Johnny gets his eye hit by a stick. Surprisingly, at the end of the show, Johnny was completely cured. Beyond that, the stories about this were not as strong as The Big Valley. <br /> <br /> This is a show I don't want DVDs, and frankly I hope they never get published. He thinks that since CBS was short of lots, they reused many family settings. This was one of the last western series produced by CBS while westerns weren't very popular in the 1970s.
