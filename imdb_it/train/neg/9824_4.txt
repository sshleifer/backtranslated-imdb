Not familiar with American TV stations, when I relayed this information on the cable of my in-laws, I thought it was just a cheap science fiction movie, then after a couple of minutes I started thinking that it would be a bit smart satire on the worst excesses of the Christian fundamentalist, and then it occurred to me - good pain, these people are serious! It's been a while since I saw something so unintentionally hilarious. I hesitated to write a review of this for fear of offending the believers, but then I saw other reviews and thought, hey, they can take it. Difficult philosophical enigma: how do you make a film that criticizes films without actually showing what you are criticizing? Answer: do it so that the only people who will appreciate it are people who hate the kind of movie you're criticizing. I suppose some liberals (ugh! Spit when you say so!) Could be offended by the disdain of filmmakers for those in the audience who are not obsessed with the myth of J **** C *****, but I don't have it. - it was really damn funny!
