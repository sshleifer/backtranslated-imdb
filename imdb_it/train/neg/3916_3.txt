We all know that a film never gives complete justice to the book, but this is exceptional. The important characters were cut, Blanca and Alba were essentially merged into the same character, most of the subplots and the main elements of the main plot were eliminated. Clara's clairvoyance was extremely understated, making her seem a much more superficial character than I had the opportunity to know in the book. In the book we learn more about his powers and the important effects he has had on so many people, which in turn have been a key element in family life. In the film she was nothing but a special woman. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Third-Third, by the way, is the son and therefore comes after Segundo-second) and his connections with Esteban and his nephew by Pancha Garc√≠a (not son, who also acknowledged) is cut in the middle and its importance is underestimated. <br /> <br /> One of the most fundamental things in the book is that the film is anything but stripped: it's called "The House of the Spirits". Where is the house? The story of 3-4 generations of a family should revolve around the "big house around the corner", a phrase affirmed many times in the novel. The house is fundamental to the story, but the film unjustly relegates it to a simple background. <br /> <br /> If I hadn't read the book before, I never imagined that such a superficial and superficial film could be based on such a rich and fun novel.
