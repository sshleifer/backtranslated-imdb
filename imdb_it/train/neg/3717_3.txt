Chris Rock, apparently desperate for an intelligent star-vehicle that would transcend his appeal to the white and mainstream public, updates the 1978 comedy "Heaven Can Wait" with an urban agenda. He plays a distressed comedian involved in a car accident that has his soul removed from his body too soon - as a result, his angels must find another body to put him in, and he can only come up with that of a man. white business. Rewriting such a bland and sentimental film as "Heaven Can Wait" only shows that Rock's eye was at the box office (it was a corporate move organized by the most mercenary of Hollywood players). Why not look for something more or less memorable than a stupid reincarnation comedy that culminates with an Apollo evening? The formidable supporting cast (including the usual Regina King, the wonderful Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy and the terrifying Frankie Faison) do what they can, but Rock looks awkward and unsure of himself. * 1/2 from ****
