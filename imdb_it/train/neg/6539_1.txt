If this could be evaluated at 0, it would be. From the atrocious acting in wood to the boring and dull rhythm, from the corner of childish exploitation and the pseudolesque hesitancy of the second year, added simply for the pleasure of the sad spectators, this is a disaster of a film. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable, as from the beginning it is absolutely certain what will happen to all the characters and how the plot will start. From a boring, unexceptional start to a pathetic and bleak ending, every single presence in this film is wasted, and any meager talent for talent unearthed for this turkey is squandered. <br /> <br /> If you want to look at something as inexorably gloomy as such childish hesitancy, look at one of Ilsa's films. At least they are unpleasant and upfront about what they are trying to do. The way something terribly bad has ever been rated above 5 is a miracle of how people with no tastes or demanding standards can sometimes come together for more questionable purposes. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not interesting, and above all it's not exciting in any sense of the word. It is, in my opinion, a crime; it is a crime that a piece of garbage so horribly offensive and incompetent has ever been conceived and given the resources to come to light, and even more a tragedy that is still defended by some terribly misled spectators. <br /> <br /> Not even the cheerful personality of Elvira and his playful ways could mitigate the blow that this horrible parody of the film is. Avoid it at all costs.
