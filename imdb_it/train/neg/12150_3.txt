Feeding the Masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies behind your hard-earned dollars. Suggestion? Keep your hard-earned dollars and let's just say that good old TheatreX took one for this. Guess what they talk about? Zombies take over. This time, however, for the sake of originality (?), This film takes place in Rhode Island and, honestly, I'm not sure I've ever seen a zombie movie set in Rhode Island. A TV station, controlled by the government, presumably keeps "normal" broadcasts so that all the remaining citizens don't think there are problems in the world, that is, those who don't watch or never go out anyway. I have to say that some of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most fun part of this movie. There is actually a bit of a story to this, but I don't care about that, because after a while you won't worry or fall asleep. In any case, this has a lot of terrible action to throw away all the "seen everything before" material that is pulled out before the camera. Trust me, you can find many other things to do with your time than watch it. 3 out of 10.
