When you have two theaters of artists clashing against each other, the least you can expect is the superb camaraderie and this is the case in this film where we have 64 years old Amitabh Bachchan from Rome a 34 year old . Wait! In fact this is all there in the name of the plot so instead of "cheeni" is the content that is "Kum" in this Adman has transformed the first attempt of writer-director R. Balki .. <br /> <br /> Trust us of the two senior actors to bring down the house with their essays and sweetest moments when love happened in this unconventional couple, and this is all that you find in the slow but refreshing first half. The London clubs captured in the rainy season are captivating. By the end of the first semester, the completed love story and mission accomplished. There is still not much to say. Therefore in the second half a strange opposition comes in the form of the girl's father to the extent that he turns to a Satyagrah is really a test of patience. There is an equally strange climax about how it surrenders. The result, the second half is dry, flat without energy. There is a subplot with a child who dies of cancer, not making much impact. However, the film is recommended for its fresh approach and performance.
