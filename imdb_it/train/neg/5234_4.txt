This is a strange sexual comedy because there is a very small comedy but a lot of sex, most of which takes place in the back of a car and is so graphic that it makes BASIC INSTINCT an edition of TELETUBBIES. No kidding, the sex in this movie is so in the face that it could choke you, especially if you're watching with your grandparents. <br /> <br /> Regarding the rest of RITA, SUE AND BOB TOO there is not much else to mention, except the language in which every single sentence seems to contain the word F. This is a rather hyper-realistic British film grimly made at a time when Channel 4 was the leading investor in British films, which explains its sensitivity for low-budget television
