Cage (1989) was another of those low budget buddy action films produced in the 1980s, thanks largely to films like 48 hours. and lethal weapon. This features Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno as former Vietnam veterans who ran a local bar. Reb takes care of Lou because he saved his life in 'Nam. But Lou was hit in the head and is now quite soft. Although huge, Lou has a child's brain. One day some ruffians throw the wait in the bar and Lou and Rebb beat the tar from them. But the reimbursement is a mother. They block the bar leaving Lou and Reb with nothing. That is until these two thugs enter the scene (one of them is a good boy) who has a plan in mind. <br /> <br /> The film is a waste of time. Perhaps if they went to the bottom and made a tough action movie, instead of trying to mitigate the narrow-mindedness of the situation, maybe it could have worked. Alas, this is not the case and the public remained with the bag. Oh good. Too bad because you have all the elements for a great B-movie. Better luck next time, I guess. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. <br /> <br /> xxx
