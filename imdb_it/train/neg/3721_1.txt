Two films are useful to scare people to God, this is "event horizon". One has a significant and moving message, the other is as one-dimensional as a religious film can get. Too bad that Paul Anderson followed the damn Resident Evil movies, he really had something to do. <br /> <br /> Thief in the Night is hampered by many obvious independent film attributes (acting, storytelling, dialogue and persuasion) and it's obvious what the film's intentions are from the beginning. The Christian film industry has not learned from the failures of this, so we are stuck with The Omega Code, Left Behind and the other Tribulation films. Their basic element is that they are so worried about selling their message: "Get them saved, people!" that everything else becomes the second to hit the public with the Bible. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't believe that I write so much on such an ineffective film. Skip it entirely and go back to Sam Neil who tries to pull his eyes out. 1 out of 5.
