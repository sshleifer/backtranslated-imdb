I've never seen a movie in such a short time. The only salvation was the DVD drive's fast forward function. It was like watching a badly produced CBC movie. Obviously there was no money for lighting, filming, sets, locations, writers, editors, actors ... Oh, there was absolutely no story! I need to write ten lines of comment ... Bad, horrible, miserable, distressing, torturous, bile, nauseating, disgusting, fromage, disgusting, fragile, icky, yucky, pukey, smelly, smelly, vile, putrid, all -thumbs -down, and I don't know if I can continue to complete all ten lines of how bad this crap-o-matic production piece was!
