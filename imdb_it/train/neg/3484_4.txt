I remember when he was in theaters, the reviews said it was horrible. Well, I didn't think it was that bad. It was fun and had a lot of ironic humor about families on vacation. <br /> <br /> Ben Affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. He goes to visit the house where he grew up and makes a deal to rent the family there for Christmas. I really liked the lawyer's scene where they sign a contract. It was fun. <br /> <br /> So, make stupid family requests and even write scripts for them to read. Of course, the family has a warm daughter for love interest. And he learns that the holidays are not so bad after all. <br /> <br /> Also, the whole doo-dah act was fun, especially when they replaced the first with a black guy, and the girls' parents didn't even talk about it. And the parts where doo-dah is hitting its "supposed daughter". VERDETTO FINALE: I thought it was worth trying if you capture it via cable.
