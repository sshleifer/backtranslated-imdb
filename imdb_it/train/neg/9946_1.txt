THE SPOILER HERE <br /> <br /> My High School has done everything possible to try to motivate us for the exams. But the most memorable method they used to put us in the right frame of mind was a guest speaker, who was no less than the favorite son of the Australian Kickboxing, Stan "The Man" Longinidis. The first mistake they made was giving this guy a microphone, because he was screaming half the time even though we didn't sit more than 3 or 4 feet from him. Now, his speech was full of the usual "if you can't prepare, so be prepared to fail", but there have been several cases where I really got excited. The boy was there in front of us preaching how his whole life he did everything for himself and no one else. He was offered many agreements in the past to give up kick-boxing, but he never took his eyes off the prize of becoming Australia's best kick-boxer. He said it wasn't a sell-out, he was happy and a pensioner, had he never been involved in other activities besides Kickboxing ?? then he inserted his film. Yes, you heard right, he connected his new movie. While he was talking about it, he had a woman come in and raised a poster that advertised it, and then showed this shitty 4-minute clip of this base movie called "Trojan Warrior". (All this before being defeated by Gurkan Ozkan in his last fight (for now)) <br /> <br /> Stan plays Ajax, a former special forces kick-boxing agent who is dragged into the underworld underworld in Melbourne. Ajax's cousin Theo (Arthur Angel) recently ran out (well, at least Stan didn't stray too far from EVERYTHING) for the feds, and as a result he escapes from all organized crime trails. Ajax and Theo face all sorts of ridiculous situations, fighting in a kebab shop and posing as a playboy at a slavery party. It's all pretty ridiculous, but if Silverstein really wanted to make a credible film here, this man should never be given a camera again. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I was actually pumped to see it. I love action movies, even if they are trivial, and especially if they are set in my backyard. But what was presented to me was a film with acting that was terrifying from the word "go", and continued to do so after the words "for the love of God, please stop it!", They were introduced subplots and are not you haven't even been touched again after coming out of the closet, the characters were simply thrown for absolutely NO reason, and the most choreographed fighting scenes didn't even remotely reflect the true talent of Stan in Kickboxing. The cast consisted of unnecessary cameo appearances by almost all famous REMOTE (Dermot Brereton, Mark "Chopper" Read and Greg Matthews). All the time you're sitting there and you're guessing who's standing there in the background. It is a pity that the film relies heavily on the appearances of a moment later ex-celebrities. Remember those plot holes I told you about? Ajax was once apparently locked up, unjustly accused of killing his wife. Now, we hear that Ajax was in special forces through ONE single sentence in the WHOLE movie, and then we leave it for sodomy. This is followed by another SINGLE sentence that persuades Ajax to help the same people who have unfairly blocked it. Then, take this, in the end, it is revealed to Ajax that his wife is not really dead, but was sold for prostitution. Do we see it? No. Does Ajax go after her as soon as she hears it? No. Now it's a wedding! <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this annoying and childish shit, some websites describe this film as "a cross between Jackie Chan and Guy Ritchie ??". Has this man ever sat down and watched a Jackie Chan movie ?! Chan shows more dexterity by making a dump than Stan did ??, well, ANYTHING! And Guy Ritchie is the Messiah of the criminal film and are you comparing him to Salik Silverstein!? This film is more like a mix between "Pizza" and "Enter The Ninja". <br /> <br /> Now, where does the whole title "Trojan Warrior" come from? The fierce fighting skills of Ajax like that of an ancient Greek warrior? No. The unification of the gangsters to find Theo, like that of the Trojan Empire? No. Is it because ?? wait for it?? Theo carries a condom with him. Yes, that's right, because THEO IS ALWAYS PREPARED with a BRAND RUBBER trojan in your pocket, it's a Trojan WARRIOR! <br /> <br /> I had the regret of seeing "Trojan Warrior" on DVD, as well as its "special" features: <br /> <br /> ?? Video clip of "Chop Chop", a rap song by Mark "Chopper" Read: Chopper did this for the sole purpose of demonstrating that SOMEONE can do rap. The funny thing is that Chopper just beat for 30 seconds and then threw it at these two albino Doncaster teenagers, using words like "dis" and "drugs" etc. In their Australian accents. Face it, the rap was developed in the United States, left there! The clip looked something of a Channel 31 cameraman on ecstasy put together. <br /> <br /> ?? Bloopers: There was no real difference between these and the actual movie. <br /> <br /> ?? Stan "The Man" Longinidis Kickboxing Featurette: This was not bad, considering there were only 6 or 7 different fights shown from different angles (I think I saw Dennis Alexio fall about 15 times in that montage for 3 minutes). /> <br /> I don't want to say that this film contributes to the reason why this country is going to hell when it comes to movies, but ... oh wait, I just did it. My advice to anyone reading this is that you go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of "Trojan Warrior", tie them together and use them for a paperweight, because this movie is just damn bad.
