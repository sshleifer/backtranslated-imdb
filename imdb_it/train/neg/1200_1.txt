VERY boring, obvious, tedious exorcism that has a Doberman with red eyes as its protagonist - this is the scope of special effects in this cheapie made for TV. Richard Crenna is as animated as a chew toy. The dress and music of the 70s are added only to torture. You should go to sleep almost as fast as "The Corpse Vanishes", or "The Blue Hand". Practically useless. MooCow says what a stinky dog ​​is! : = 8P
