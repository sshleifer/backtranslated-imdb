Since I loved the cartoon Inspector Gadget in the 80s, I went to see this movie. I wasted my money. The plot was very thin. Besides, the film couldn't get me interested for long. I was glad it was over. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the Inspector Gadget, look at the cartoon instead. It was much better than the movie.
