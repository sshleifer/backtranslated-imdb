Pam Grier is the protagonist of Coffy. She is a nurse who seeks revenge on the drug dealers who have angered her sister with the bad heroine. Like any Blaxploitation shot from the 70s, you can expect to see racist villains taking their sweets. <br /> <br /> There were dozens of these films made during the 1970s, and they were really demeaning both for the black and white audience and for that. This is mainly due to the fierce racial hostility in these films and to the degrading and stereotyped characters. Especially female characters. <br /> <br /> Other common threads between Coffy and other films of this type include brutal violence, corrupt cops, car chases, a generous abundance of nudity and beautiful women gone crazy by sex. Not to mention the urban ghettos populated by drug dealers, protectors, mobsters and other criminal scum. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier, was the undisputed queen of the Blaxploitation heroines of the 70s. It was magnificent, being both hard as nails, and beautiful to die for. As in his other films, Pam highlights the other characters, in Coffy. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on the screen, that these films are unwatchable, without her as the protagonist. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Grier, it's better to see his other films, like Foxy Brown, or maybe Friday Foster. These films have a much less empty sleaze than Coffy does. Pam's character in Coffy degrades too much to get the bad guys. Pam's characters in his other Blaxploitation films don't bend lower to get revenge, like Coffy did. <br /> <br /> I would say, just look at Coffy, if you can't see any of Pam Grier's other films. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Only Pam's talent as an actress makes Coffy's vision bearable.
