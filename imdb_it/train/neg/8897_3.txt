I remember when I saw this film for the first time, I was in the sixth year when it happened. Before seeing it, I had listened to the original Broadway recording and loved it! But when I saw this, I was like, what the hell? In this film, many of the musical's songs are missing to shout loudly! Who decided to do all this ?! <br /> <br /> I'm really a huge fan of Gene Kelly, but this movie is probably the worst of a musical I've ever done! The film looked more like a Hollywood set than the beautiful Highlands of Scotland. And who the hell decided to cut all of Meg's songs from the movie ?! <br /> <br /> I'm willing to bet that when they saw this film, Lerner and Lowe probably asked themselves, "Who in the world has decided to do this to our masterpiece?" Well, they had the right to say that if they did, they were probably angry that Hollywood turned their big musical into this rather blank movie. <br /> <br /> Song and wise acting Mr. Kelly, you passed the audition with flying colors, but you are in a film that lacks a lot of text. <br /> <br /> So anyway, if you want a good movie based on a Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner musical, this is not it! <br /> <br /> 3/10
