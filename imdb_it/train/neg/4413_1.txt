Wide enough for you? Wait until you see this heavy adaptation <br /> <br /> of a small collegial act. What is shocking and wild in the college rarely endures over time, and this is the proof. Dealing with the <br /> <br /> Catholic Church with broadside humor is not shocking or <br /> <br /> interesting or amusing, it's rather boring. The artists are all <br /> <br /> game, giving everything they have, but it's basically a game that doesn't <br /> <br /> open well to the film. Not very funny.
