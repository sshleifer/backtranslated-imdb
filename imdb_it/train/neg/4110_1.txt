It's just unbelievable as it's horrible-- you really have to see it! <br /> <br /> Depending on your perspective, Dylan Walsh is the savior or the problem here: since he is the only one on the screen who can really get his head with something like cadences and natural inflections, either it ruins the film by emphasizing the faults of all the others, or it saves it by providing a context for their terribleness. <br /> <br /> I'm prone to post-view-- thanks to him, it works like a high comedy. It's 7 feet in a dwarf basketball game, his skill set doesn't apply in this context, and his disagreement is delicious. <br /> <br /> The real pleasure is Mrs Eastwood, whose inability to speak in plain English is so pervasive that I actually searched for her, expecting to find out that she was a Russian beauty who spoke her lines phonetically, without understand their meaning. But no: she is just an American without talent who will let you laugh with every joke she leaves. If you knew what the lines meant, it must remain an open question.
