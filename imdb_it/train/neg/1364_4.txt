the more I think about it, there was nothing saving in this movie <br /> <br />. I saw it 9 months ago, so my memory could have made it <br /> <br /> worse than it was, but I know it was at least worse than a 4 of <br /> <br /> 10. < br /> <br /> after seeing the movie, I met the director. he seemed so incapable of knowing what he was doing or what he had done, and as far as he knew, he didn't even care about the movie. he also agreed that he didn't really know what he was doing, and was forced to do some things because it was digitally shot. <br /> <br /> I heard that the film was trying to adapt to the formula that was built by itself <br />: "9 people must all be connected in some way. <br /> <br /> we can get from point 'A' to point 'B' "then to get from the prostitute <br /> <br /> we see at the beginning and get back to her at the end 10 <br /> <br /> minutes on the report of each character with another person. <br /> <br /> makes you feel suffocated by the 2 idiotic and ill-designed characters <br /> <br />. I just remembered the only part that redeems the movie .. Steve <br /> <br /> Bouchemi there is a scene in which it is fantastic. that's all. as I say <br /> <br /> ... 4 out of 10.
