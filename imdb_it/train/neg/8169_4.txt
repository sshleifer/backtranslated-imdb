The film begins with a couple of campers, a man and a woman supposedly together, walking alone in the vast wilderness areas. Certainly the man feels something and torments him so much that he goes to investigate him. Our killer greets him with a stab in the stomach. Then he chases the girl and cuts her throat. The camera during the opening scene is from the killer point of view. <br /> <br /> Next meeting with our four main characters, two couples, one in which he is on the rocks. The men joke about how the woman would never have been able to manage the camp alone on a double date, triggering the ambition of the blonde ambassador to leave a week early. Unexpectedly, the men leave the same day and their car breaks down ... They end up arriving in the evening. When the men arrive, they are warned that people disappear into the forest from a mad doppleganger Ralph. They ignore the warning and venture into the dark night and a song from the eighties plays in the background with lyrics that talk about being killed in the dark forest. Men are lost. <br /> <br /> In the next scene we realize that this is not just another Burning clone, but a ghost story! The women, frightened and alone, are huddled together by the fire. Two children appear in the shadows and decide to play Tom's head. Well, they're obviously ghosts by the way their voices echo! Their mother appears with blood dripping from a hole in her forehead and asks the two ladies if they saw her children, before disappearing, of course. <br /> <br /> The children run away from their father's house and tell him about the two beautiful ladies of the river. This causes quite a stir and rises, grabbing his knife from the top of the fireplace. "Dad is going hunting", the little girl exclaims with bad acting. Here it is evident that the father is not a ghost like his children. <br /> <br /> Freaked out of something in the woods, the blonde token splits, running blindly through the night, carrying a knife. Meet the father who explains that he is starving and will be fast. This makes no sense due to the panther growl we heard earlier (maybe he's allergic! Are they honestly panther in California too?). He ends up hurting him slightly before being stabbed in the head. A storm breaks out and men seek shelter, which turns out to be the place where the Pope resides. Clearly someone lives here because there is a fire and something strange is roasting over it. The children appear and warn them of Pope, who presents himself a few moments later. They disappear as soon as it arrives. <br /> <br /> For whatever reason, our killer only goes after the females. Invite men to eat something and tell us the story of his ex-wife. We are given a flashback of his wife who is caught cheating. The old man, however, does not tell them that he kills her and her lover later, but dreams of her daydreaming. We are not given the reason for the disappearance of the children. Men fall asleep and remain unharmed. The next morning the men discover the empty campground of their wives. After a brief discussion they separated. One is staying at the campsite, while the other goes and gets help. The one who is returning to his car breaks his leg. We then meet with the children as they explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who have killed themselves for being sad for their mother. I agree in helping the woman get together with her friends. <br /> <br /> The following scene challenges the logic of the film when Pope kills the boy who is waiting at the campsite. He was also engaged or married to the blonde. Somehow, the children realize that he was murdered and told the woman about it. He decides to see it for himself and obviously runs into the murderer. Fortunately, children stop it by threatening to leave it forever. You know where it's going. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film deserves four out of ten stars, and is generous. Despite all his doubts, the musical score is well done. It's still watchable. There are some camera angles that look professional, and some sets are well made. The plot is incredible. There is a voluntary suspension of disbelief, but with the toad 6 miles away; I can't imagine the blond token taking off like that in the middle of the night. I mean, come on! <br /> <br /> - Alan "Skip" Bannacheck
