This movie should have been fun. A young Lea Thompson, a young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn. In the space. But he dragged on, had unlovable characters and had no target audience. <br /> <br /> Some children go to a space camp and are accidentally thrown into space by a robot friend of theirs (appropriately called Jinx). The spatial scenes are therefore long, repetitive (the same incident happens twice) and both in good humor and fear depending on the point of view. Adults will be bored and derided, children might be scared because the way this was filmed really leaves an unreal sense. <br /> <br /> There is a budding romance, but unlike the shuttle - this never takes off. The reason it is included in the first place is not clear, except perhaps to add more tension between the characters - but it failed if this was the idea. <br /> <br /> A young Lea Thompson should be eccentric and attractive, right? I mean, "Back to the future" is fantastic. But no, it was irritating and mediocre in appearance. Not someone you would like to attend, have as a friend or even consider a role model. Joaquin Phoenix? He's really lucky he ever appeared in the movies again in this performance. Maybe he can act like Mikey in Life Cereal commercials, but he doesn't seem to know how to be a normal guy. It doesn't fit the screen and I don't think we can identify with him at home. Actually I would have been happier if he had never returned to Earth. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
