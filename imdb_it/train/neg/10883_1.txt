This film was not programmed in Italian cinemas, I saw it in an event called "fantafestival". I find it terrible because some scenes look like chaotic and obscure music videos, the use of fluorescent colors is ridiculous and there is no suspense in the film. Music is completely out of history and I have no words to describe visual effects. If you watch the first scene the movie seems to be interesting, but a few minutes later it becomes challenging. The story is interesting but the development needs a complete overhaul.
