If you want to see a mystery, don't look at this. Although there are elements directly from the territory of Elmore Leonard, this comes close to an episode of "Dynasty", since the director focuses on "character development" - that is long boring talks between stupid and non-engaging characters. Some people can make fascinating films without real action (see "Exotica"), but not this one. Avoid it, especially if you like the actors involved in this.
