I'm sorry every single second of the time I lost while watching this movie, really. Unfortunately, I always find it difficult to turn off a movie when I started watching it. Above all, when it's a classic or what people use to call a classic. I think this is one of those movies that every movie fan should have watched at least once, which is why I watched it. Don't get me wrong, I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall both as a couple and as actors, but in my opinion this film was a big scam. No really good plot, neither a spy movie nor a romantic love story. Well, not even a convincing mixture of both these genres. The only thing that caused tension was that he wasn't sure if "Bogey" and Bacall would stay together at the end or part of each other. I think "To Have and Have Not" is very overrated and Bogart has been in many better films during the 1940s.
