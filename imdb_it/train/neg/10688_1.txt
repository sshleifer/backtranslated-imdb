I spent almost two hours watching a movie I thought, with all the good actors, it would have been worth watching. I couldn't believe it when the movie was finished and I had absolutely no idea what had happened ..... I was angry because I could have used that time to do something else .... I tried to understand everything, but I really didn't have any idea. Thanks to those who understood it and explained it .... right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything !! Who was the woman in the dark-haired movie we saw a couple of times in the driving? How did the First Lady know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the film, Kate said he would eventually find out the truth. Does this mean we will be subjected to End Game 2?
