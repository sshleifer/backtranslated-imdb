A real head scratcher of a Bill Rebane film that seemed to get worse in his eighties work. Three crackpot millionaires invite nine people to a remote hotel to compete in a final competition where the final competitor will receive $ 1 million provided he has come this far. A series of jokes by some guests are raised while the others engage in what most adults would do in these circumstances, that is, get tossed around at the hotel bar. Most of the scenes are just an excuse to focus the camera on various parts of the female body including an opening dance number which is a crossover of American Bandstand meets prostitute geriatric aerobics complete. If there has been any hesitation that whites cannot dance this scene hammer the last nail in that coffin. Pay close attention to the nipple slipping. This continues for about forty-five minutes until Bill Rebane starts throwing darts at various twists and anything he hits becomes the inspiration for the next scene making this inconsistent mess. It's a game until it's a game. The three old coots have complete control until they are. The hotel is possessed of a supernatural force until it becomes only props. They are dead until they are. Even the narrator finally replies that he doesn't know what the hell happened. I challenge anyone to think about where Rebane is going. Acting is the caliber of dinner theater minus dinner. Most of the actors returned to their daily jobs at Stuckey's. I give him a couple of points for the scene where the yuppie broad opens the closet and a skeleton is inside the skull. Let's see Gone with the wind doing it! This Chilling Classics collection is really becoming the bane of me. Bane, take it! Like Rebane! My God.
