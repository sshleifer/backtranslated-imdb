This movie is complete shit! Avoid this celluloid waste at all costs, it is inconclusive and inconsistent. I am proud to explore the depths of the 70s cinema from everything from Salo to Salon Kitty. I like to be shocked, but I need a coherent story. However, if watching the horse mate takes you out of this movie is for you. The saddest part was the lame werewolf with the functional wang. I mean it's just hard to sit, not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is nicknamed. Please, I know the cover is interesting (it looks like a gorilla's hands reach a woman's bare ass) but don't waste your time or your money, because you won't come back.
