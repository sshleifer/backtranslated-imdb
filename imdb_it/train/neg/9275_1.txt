Omen IV (1991) was a bad deed for T.V. movie. By the 1980s they were over, I imagine the executives were experimenting with methamphetamine (the favorite drug in the 90s) because there is no other reason to explain this disguise. Why did they even take the trouble to do it? A t.v. movie? What were they mulling over when this appeared on the idea board? They even thought for a second that this film would take hold as. Maybe they thought he could make it as a series? We will never know. But I know one thing. This film was the main reason why I never bought the Omen trilogy. They should have thrown away a couple of dollars instead of publishing this "extra" record. <br /> <br /> Omen IV is basically a medium remake of the American family of the first film. Instead of a snot-nosed punk kid, let's take the ghostly girl who is a real brat for everyone around her. If the family had stronger parenting skills, then none of the demonic events that happened in the previous films would never have occurred. These parents must put their feet down and do real discipline! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, better to avoid at all costs!
