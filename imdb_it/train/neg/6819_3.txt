In this movie, Joe Pesce Slams crushes a basketball. joe pesci ... <br /> <br /> and be consistent, the rest of the script is equally unreliable. <br /> <br /> Fish is a funny guy, who saves this film from sinking int the absolute behind the cellar, but the other roles were pretty bad. his father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people, which wasn't even well played. instead of being an evil archetype, it seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs. then there is the piece of token that is assigned to fish like a girlfriend or something ... I don't even remember ... it was so forgettable. <br /> <br /> anyone considering this film over a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of movie studio trying to improve the reputation of this sunken movie, or at least one of those millions of media servants who don't they can criticize efficiently (you know, people who feel bad if they give something to score under 6). <br /> <br /> stay away ... far away. and shame for the central comedy, where I saw this film. usually they choose better.
