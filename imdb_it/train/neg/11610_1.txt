No doubt Frank Sinatra was a talented actor and a talented singer. After all, very few actors nowadays manage to get a fair scene in one shot, and it was pretty much Sinatra's modus operandi on the set. I feel that, as in the 1960s, the quality of a man's films really started to tank. Tony Rome's detective series was nothing short of competitive with Dean Martin's Matt Helm series, released at the same time. Maybe even a James Bond race, but nothing has worked for Frank in these years. His personal life in chaos, his music fading away ... Sinatra appeared more like a throwback to the 50s. Sinatra's last major film of this period was probably Von Ryan's Express in 1965.
