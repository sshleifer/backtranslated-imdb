I can enjoy the guilty pleasure of a vigilant whine, but this is just ugly. And not as bad as you could see MST3K teasing him. It's simply sickeningly bad as if I couldn't find anything to enjoy, no matter how hard you try. I'm really sorry to waste 2 hours of precious life in this shit. You can say by observing that no one was invited to act and everyone knew that this movie would only bury their careers. Apparently "Walking Tall" has raised enough revenue that someone has decided to make a buck off of their investment. If it's not the worst movie I've seen, it's so bad that it has erased the worst movies from my memory.
