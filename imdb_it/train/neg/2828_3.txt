There seem to have been any number of films like this released in the 1970s. And the fact that he can't remember the title of just one of them is a measure of their impact. These are what the novelists would call "boiling pots". They are little more than a vehicle to keep movie stars in the eyes of public opinion. We have Micheal Caine, Peter Ustinov, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and William Holden; more than enough names to chat about cinema places. Every taste in hero is satisfied. Even if it is suspected that most of the public has been disappointed. <br /> <br /> Their talents are simply thrown away, and I wonder which stars with so much money and reputation can still be so desperate or lacking in common sense. This kind of film hardly adds gilding to a CV. Sometimes maybe the actors should choose their director instead of the opposite. <br /> <br /> It was pretty obvious that it would have been crap even from the beginning. That ridiculously disarmed "jaunty-jazz" theme music, which was also perceived whenever an accidental noise was needed, had all the atmospheric conviction of the Muzak elevator. Who imagined using a jazz band when a scene depicted the humid jungles of central Africa or the infinite Sahara with camels and palm trees as a backdrop? Definitely a serious goof ball. Ennio Morricone would have known what to do; and his results would have emanated enough atmosphere and tension to raise my score by two points. This director should have taken the trouble to look at "Lawrence of Arabia", or even Sergio Leone's westerns; could have learned some things. But then again, he probably wouldn't. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock interpreted the theme of his missing wife with good results in his film "Frantic". Later it was redone with equal sparkle by staring at Harrison Ford. In any case, the confusion surrounding his loss and the tension of pursuit was tangible. Here, when Michael Caine could be forced to use a bit of brains and bravado, Rex Harrison kept popping up out of nowhere, like a shrewd old genius, to put him back on track whenever the narrative stumbled. <br /> <br /> At least the photography was pretty good, with an excellent use of the often beautiful environment. But then the stupid music has to stuff itself and blow on the atoms for the little atmosphere created. <br /> <br /> The action scenes were also built and rigged, with combat sequences so inept and choreographed that they could have been staged in a first-class drama And, of course, the players must fight for jazz accompaniment - like you. <br /> <br /> And this is so much the comment that this article deserves. Except that the script was pretty miserable. <br /> <br /> Follow your hobby on this. Even if it contained your favorite movie stars, you too will be disappointed.
