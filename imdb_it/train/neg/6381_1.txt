This film is about a group of extra-terrestrial gay black men who exterminate females on Earth in order to create a gay universe. I looked at him with the intent to see how bad he was. However, I was shocked at how bad it was. It looked more like a movie made 50 years ago. The acting, if present, is really bad. The sets and props are so ridiculously fake, making every college movie a huge budget. And the special effects are ridiculously simple, really astounding as others have commented, but the jaw has become embarrassing. <br /> <br /> One must be seriously intoxicated, or in an altered state of conscience to appreciate this film. If I were from Denmark, I would be seriously embarrassed and humiliated that my compatriots would produce a film so horribly ugly.
