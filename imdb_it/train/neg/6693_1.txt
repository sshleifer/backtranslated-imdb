Run away from this movie. Even by B movie standards this film is terrible. It is also insidious in its theme. The main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for anything are interesting and deserve to be admired. People who treat others with respect are losers. Guncrazy is a film that speaks for the disinherited much better than this film, to see it instead. <br /> <br /> No normal child would do what Trent does. State soldiers do not work as they do in this film, etc. Seeing this movie realizes why writers use the beat clich√© with a heart of gold. Mija is a completely unpleasant prostitute, who has had a terrible life. However, he is such a terrible person that the public cannot identify with her. <br /> <br /> There is usually something for which a film can be recommended, in which case there is none. It's such a ridiculous film that it insults the person who tries to identify with the main characters. The acting is adequate to the standards of the B films and the director does not present anything new or interesting.
