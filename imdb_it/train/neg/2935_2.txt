(Evaluation: 21 of The Film Snob.) (See our What-To-See-Next blog for details on our rating system.) <br /> <br /> Here is a movie that will have you scratching your face in an attempt to get rid of boredom on the screen. <br /> <br /> You won't be twisting your hands, rolling your eyes, or sighing in your popcorn. No, really. For a film of * this * mediation, you will only need to scratch your own face. <br /> <br /> When you start scratching your own face - how to start! - start at the bottom. You will need the upper part, with its comfortable tear ducts, intact for the third act of Truly Tear-jerking that could bring you to your knees if you haven't made your way free from the whole theater. <br /> <br /> In a season that celebrates Joe Six-Pack and Hockey Moms as the new Gold Standard for leadership and foreign diplomacy, perhaps this film will be welcomed as something that anyone could create. * Watching *, however, is a far more dangerous undertaking. <br /> <br /> Here's our story ... <br /> <br /> Sidney Young, the London editor of a fourth-row celebrity / entertainment magazine, is about to see his magazine fail. He needs a miracle, and what he gets is a phone call from New York, in the United States. <br /> <br /> The editor of Sharp magazine, Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges) says "Come work for me!" With its employees faxing outside your apartment / office in the background, saying "Yes" is child's play. <br /> <br /> Soon Sidney is at work in New York City, doing the wrong things allllllll. His interviews consist of asking Broadway directors if they are (1) Jewish and (2) gay. <br /> <br /> Kills the pet dog of Sohpie Maes, the hottest star in the industry, when he leaves her in the magazine offices during a business lunch. <br /> <br /> This is a bad luck place for everyone, because, among other things, Sidney imagines he is in love with Maes, before waking up with the Dunst character. Worst of all, it is totally alien to Alison Olsen (played by Kristen Dunst's scripting-confusion), a colleague in charge of showing him the strings of the magazine * and * The Big Apple. (We have, of course, seen a movie before, so we know how this relationship will end. That's why we need intact tear ducts for the third act of the film.) <br /> <br /> The problem with The Thing is that the screenplay was never created, except for the one piece set of tears in which True Love prevails. <br /> <br /> The publisher Harding should be a son of a bitch who also wants to throw away all the finished work. The script never comes down firmly on one or the other side of this dichotomy, however, and Bridges is left to turn and crow in the breeze. <br /> <br /> Alison Olsen should despise Sidney Young, but whenever he approaches her (as he constantly does), but tries to involve him in conversation, instead of trying to discourage his existence. <br /> <br /> The "comedy" of the first scenes is built around a piglet that destroys an expensive hotel room, and then take the elevator downstairs to urinate on the expensive high heels of a celebrity at a cocktail reception. <br /> <br /> The warm little star Maes confesses to being attracted to Young because he is "injured." The character never shows us * because * he is injured, however. This is yet another result of the film's mortally wounded script. <br /> <br /> At an hour and fifty minutes, This Thing feels longer (and more deadly) than Napoleon's withdrawal from Moscow. It is uninteresting, not funny, irredeemable and not even rentable. Escape
