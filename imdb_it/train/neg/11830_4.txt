OK, maybe a 13-year-old like me was a little too old for this movie. It is on this spoiled mouse, who lives in a palace. Then a sewer mouse dumps him in a toilet! He ends up in this city of rats and meets this girl who has a gem that a voracious frog wants. He will do anything for this gem that sends an entire army after these two mice. Plan to take the gem and flood the city of mice! The interesting part of this film is the snails. They make all the sound effects. They sing, they make noises, they are fantastic, they are also quite funny. Bottom line OK, is aimed at children aged 7 years. Another essay, a great film to show a younger family member. I didn't think animation was a true dream art, more like WAllace and Gromit. I think they are a little loose. The film was just decent, it's not worth spending $ 9.50 for itself, sorry.
