This film is by far the worst movie ever made. If you have to create a movie about the guy who plays Lars in the heavyweights than the damn movie does. I have to say that I could see Leprechaun in space 6 times before I could watch the trailer for this POS movie. Adam Sandler should be limited by any film after this misfortune. Watching this movie is like a mix of Cher's listening and voluntarily putting your dick in a blender. Anyone with half of the brain cell will realize that this film is not worth it. If I had an extra dollar and had to spend it, I'd give it to the Lorraina Bobbitt foundation before buying this movie.
