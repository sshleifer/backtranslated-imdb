The show has had great episodes, this is not one of them. It's not a terrible episode, it's just hard to follow "The man who was dead.", "The whole house", and "Dig that cat, he's gone." <br /> <br /> This episode is of a couple who has just been married to Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you discover that Charles married only Peggy for his money. The two of them go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they must seek refuge in an old abandoned villa. Charles soon discovers a secret from Peggy's family ... <br /> <br /> I think you should watch this episode, but don't expect the same feeling from the rest of the first season's episodes.
