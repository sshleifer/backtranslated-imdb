Let me first say that I love the stories of Westerns and Civil War. I also consider John Ford an excellent director. I also have the same strong feelings for the acting ability of John Wayne and William Holden. <br /> <br /> I don't remember if I saw this movie when it first came out in 1959. Last night was the first time I saw it. <br /> <br /> According to my vote 4, I can say that I didn't like the film. <br /> <br /> Now I will try to tell you some of its shortcomings. <br /> <Br /> John Lee Mahin who wrote the script for the novel by Harold Sinclair, was a very gifted writer and wrote many beautiful scripts, This script is poorly written and poorly researched. They mention the poor condition of the Andersonville prison, at the time of the film Andersonville was not in operation. They also use rifles that were not used at the time. <br /> <br /> John Ford had been directing films for over 40 years and won 4 Academy Awards. He must have been sick during the making of this. His usual style was lacking. It could be that this was a film in the south and east and not in Monument Valley. He normally had a stock company of players that he used in almost all of his films, most of which this time were missing. This time only the minor cowboy stars Hoot Gibson and Ken Curtiss have roles and, of course, Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other known faces except the 3 stars. (see below) Mr. Fords's stock company made most of his films with the classics they were; unfortunately I miss them here. <br /> <br /> Now let's get to the main stars John Wayne and William Holden. Even the Duke had to be sick, he seemed out of place here. This type of role usually fits his style perfectly, it was simply adequate here. Wiliam Holden did the best he could, but nowhere was he as good as usual. <br /> <br /> It was requested that there be an actress in this type of film. Here in his first important role (second film) is Costanza Towers, a very nice person, but not really an actress, still has roles on television. Let me be kind and say that he has had a long career, more based on his appearance than on acting talent. Also in Caas the servant of Ms. Towers is the tennis star Althea Gibson. I'm glad she stayed in tennis. <br /> <br /> The rest of the production credits were far from the usual high level of John Ford's other films. some military-type songs presumably made by cavalry marching, not at all good. The action scenes were good but come to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Classifications * 1/2 * (out of 4) 47 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)
