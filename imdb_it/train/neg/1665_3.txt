It was a decent film, I actually liked it. But the ending is so abrupt !! There is absolutely no closure and it leaves a lot of things to do. What happens after the concert? What happens with your boyfriend? Do you connect with Grant? Will you be caught in the next semester? What about Angela? Obviously Holly's performance would have knocked Angela down, but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts. There is so much left in the air and it is very unsatisfactory. I don't know if he's trying to make room for a sequel or something, but it's a terrible ending and I think it really makes the movie a joke. I was very disappointed.
