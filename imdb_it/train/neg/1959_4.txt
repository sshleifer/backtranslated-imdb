The Tooth Fairy talks about the ghost of a deformed old witch who draws children to her home to get a prize for their loose teeth and then takes life. The first few minutes introduce you to the legend of the tooth fairy at the beginning of 1949 and then pass to the present day. The plot of horror consumed is practically saved by solid acting. They could have done without the Hammond brothers and a few other scenes, but overall the blood scenes were bloody but fast which had a minimizing effect. Eye candy is good enough for both sexes. Camera work is good. The dialogue is right but of cheese. I expected the film to be a treat, a limited budget, a slasher with very few redeeming factors. I was surprised by the quality of the film.
