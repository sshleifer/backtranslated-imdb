This must be the worst movie I've ever seen. I bought the DVD and it didn't work, well, the DVD worked well, it's just the film, not, in fact it's so bad that I think the actors haven't worked since then (or before judging by acting). There is no real plot to talk about and no real horror. Production values ​​are disgusting even for a low-cost movie with some external scenes difficult to hear due to the wind at the microphone. <br /> <br /> All in all it was such a bad film that a viewer could think it was going to turn into a porn if they didn't know better (which was an improvement). There are only two lines in the film that are funny, both of them revolving around the prostitute in disguise. (Although they hardly deserve to watch all 76 minutes for) <br /> <br /> As for the marketing of the DVD I feel completely cheated. I mean by reading the back I expected it to be ugly: <br /> <br /> he chose his weapons. He selected his victims. He took his nose. He turned into a girl! <br /> <br /> But I thought it might be fun. Even the case states that it is digitally reset, I'd like to have seen it in advance, the print is so grainy that you could use it as sandpaper. The case also says that it is an absolutely disgusting film, IN WHAT WAY?, Disgusting production, acting. <br /> <br /> This film is always welcome in the first five minutes, (if you're thinking of buying it, I'd like to say "bad taste", but it's a much better film and it's fun, it also has Peter Jackson, the director of the LOTR in it. <br /> <br /> By the way if anyone knows anything about any of the actors (or director Patrick J Mathews) and what they have been doing since then, please post here as I would like to know , purely to find out if there is a worse movie out there, or if anyone in this film has ever bothered to learn how to act
