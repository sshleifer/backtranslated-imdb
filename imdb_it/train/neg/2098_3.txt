I was hoping for some sort of in-depth background information on the Apollo 11 mission and what I got was a fair amount of material for interviews with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other people involved in the mission, connected by a sensationalizing and unpredictable voice that predicted disaster. ended in the worst tradition of television production. <br /> <br /> If you could cut out the voice and change the rotation of the program in a positive testament to how people can overcome setbacks to reach a goal out of the ordinary then it would have been great - but I feel having lost about 45 minutes of my life while watching a 60-minute program. I want those minutes back.
