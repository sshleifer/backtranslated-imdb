I reviewed the other comments and was amused to discover that clearly only the people who actually worked on the film had commented. I mean, I hate to say bad things about an amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, I stick with it a little. "Pioneer" is a bit exaggerated. This is a university production based in Boston that does not even reach the level of the most amateur university film. That's what you'd expect lots of kids to do. A silly action movie without much creativity. It's pretty funny if you're willing to make fun of it. Not something you'll ever see unless you're a student at Emerson college.
