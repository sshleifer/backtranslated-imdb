There is an interesting discussion in this film. Is being a moral person good enough, or do you need something more? <br /> <br /> The film preaches that without God's guidance, being a morally good person is not enough. There is a sentence at the beginning of the film, "You and I can look at a person who is morally good, but both know that he will go to hell." <br /> <br /> Even though I am not a Christian, discussions on this topic throughout the film have been fascinating, but not in the way the film was conceived. I left the film with the strongest feeling that being morally good * is * enough. The arguments and discussions presented were heavily biased, so much so that they are crushed in the weight of their own ignorance. Fanaticism can be a powerful thing, especially when it is inferred in the minds of the ignorant and ignorant. As the character of George Carlin in Dogma said: "I love em while they are young". <br /> <br /> Even the basic premise is very interesting. A 1990s Bible scholar is attempting to publish a book which states that morality without God is OK, as long as the moral is meaningful. Are you just telling a child not to steal? Or do you tell him not to steal because God tells you not to do it? (don't worry about tracing back what tells the child not to steal because, well, how would he feel if his marbles were stolen?) <br /> <br /> The author, Carlisle, wants the recommendation of his school helps to sell the book (to spread the world). However, he needs unanimous consent, and one of the scholars objects. He tells, in a very interesting discussion at the beginning of the film about morality for the sake of morality against the argument of God's words. To prove his point, he produces a time machine (insert the film only to make the plot work, with I'm fine), and send Carlisle in the year 2002 to see where the morality of teaching without God will lead us. <Br /> <br /> As should be obvious, he has his opinion, and is changed by what he sees , and reversed himself at the time of his return (because he returns, that's not really a spoiler, this is a bible movie after all). <br /> <br /> As for the film as a film itself, it is rather slow and rather misinterpreted. Something that * was * not necessary in this film, is that it produces two "bad guys" who want to try to understand who Carlisle is, even if he didn't hurt anyone, he committed a crime or something. What is wrong with the film that shows only Carlisle's opinion, which shows his vision of this "sinful world" and that returns it with a new point of view? <br /> <br /> Furthermore, there are some points in the film that tell me that I am happy not to be a Christian, or at least someone who says "It's God or nothing". Three at the end of the film I was rather disturbed .. before, when the two "bad guys" get to the corner of Carlisle before he jumps, Carlisle makes his * single * truly contemptible act .. he simulates how his time jump is advent of Jesus, and thus makes the "bad guys" (who are also Christians among them, strangely enough), they think they have simply lost ecstasy. <br /> <br /> Secondly, after Carlisle's return, he finds a boy who scolded him at the beginning of the film not to steal (but without mentioning God, the boy kept the marbles and ran away), and tells him this time when stealing is wrong because God commands him. Like Carlin's quote above, scaring children toward religion is a misstep in my book. <br /> <br /> And finally the epilogue. Another intimidating tactic. Carlisle asks the inventor how far they can go in the future, and says he doesn't know ... the epilogue shows him trying to warp a bible in the distant future (starts at 2100), and fails ... continues to decline the years at 10, and trying again, and in the end, it's like around 2030. Throughout the film, Carlise claims to have heard the end of the world, because the world was full of sin and the loss of God's name ... intimidation tactics have been in use for thousands of years ... you would think about these enlightened times , the church would have lit up as well. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw this movie. While I was pretty certain before he was morally good enough, I now know for sure. It is worth looking at if you are not a Christian, to say how happy you are not to be as ignorant as the people in this film.
