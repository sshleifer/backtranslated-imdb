On the surface, "Show Me The Money" should have completed at least an entire season. You had the ever-entertaining William Shatner as a guest, surrounded by a dozen beautiful legendary baker models collectively called "The Million Dollar Dancers". You had happy competitors who had interesting stories to tell about their lives and who presumably knew a lot of curiosity about pop culture. And you had a lot of money! So what went wrong? <br /> <br /> The format of this game was failure. A good game needs at least two things out of three: very simple rules, exciting stimulation and the possibility for the spectator to play at home. The best and most resistant have all three. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, SMTM had none. <br /> <br /> The rules for this game were among the most complex of any primetime game in history. Let me try to explain how the game worked, as briefly as possible. <br /> <br /> A competitor started with a single word or a short sentence followed by letters of choice A, B, C (thin plug for the network?). Each letter was linked to a separate question, all from that word or phrase. Once a competitor has chosen one of the letters, you can answer this question or pass and select a second letter. If they passed, they had to see the next question and they had the same option. However, if they passed the second question, they were asked to answer the third option. <br /> <br /> After they responded and before finding out if their answer was correct, they had to select one of the 13 dancers on stage, each with a different amount of money on a parchment by their side. They revealed their dollar amount (between $ 20,000 and $ 250,000) and based on whether the competitor answered correctly ... or responded badly ... that amount would be added or subtracted from their pot. <br /> <br /> with me so far? Also, there was a dancer who owned something known as "The Killer Card". If you selected the dancer with the Killer Card and you had your right question, you were safe, and the game continued. If, however, you were not in good standing, you had a last question to answer. If you missed the last question, you were out of the game. If you understood correctly, then the game continued. <br /> <br /> There was no quitting, not going away with the money you earned until you answered six questions correctly or you were wrong questions or you were so far away from the hole you couldn't earn enough money to go back. Done? All right! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, as I have seen, was the total lack of tension due to the design of the game. A competitor could pass questions that they knew they didn't know and answer many questions they knew, making the pressure even less. Thus, they could still find a low dollar amount, even after knowingly losing a question, which meant that there was still no "drama". And the fact that they could answer five wrong questions and still have the chance to win was a big mistake. And the rhythm of the questions was tremendously slow: often the questions were so obvious, it was ridiculous to try to create tension, as if there was some doubt about some of the most common answers. <br /> <br /> The rhythm, the lack of any real tension during the show and those very complicated rules prevented this program from working, despite Shatner's terpsichorean talents.
