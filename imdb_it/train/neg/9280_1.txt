honestly, I don't know what's more fun, this horrible remake, or the comments on this forum. The Masterpiece review made me cry, it's so funny. However, this film is one of the worst films ever, and certainly the bottom of the sequel barrel. The name "Omen" on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on HBO, but it's a slap in the face to the other three, especially the original. There are so many classic bad moments, but my favorite is the guy who takes fire from the juggler to the psychic fair !! good times ! This film is for the Omen series that "Scary Movie" is for the whole genre. Avoid unless you are looking for a good laugh.
