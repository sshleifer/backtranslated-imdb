I had the luxury of seeing this movie once when I was quite young, so much of the film is confused in trying to remember it. However, I can say that it was not as fun as a film called killer tomatoes should have been and the most memorable things in this film are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor Timmy. In addition to this, the film is actually just scenes of small tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling and people behaving in a frightening and threatening way as people should do in a film of this type. However, having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song is not a good comedy. That being said, this film is supposed to be a B series movie, nothing to be taken seriously, however, you should still make funny jokes and not try to extend a slightly funny premise into a full-fledged movie. Perhaps a short would have been fine since the trailer showed the aforementioned elderly couple and a man desperately trying to shoot a bigger tomato was actually pretty good. The trailer itself looked like a fake trailer, but in fact they didn't make a complete movie and a rather weak one.
