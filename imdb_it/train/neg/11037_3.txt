I love the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman. It's big! When Jim throws that little person through the window, the expression on his face is priceless. Then when does he start talking to the priest on behalf of his wife, only to find out that she became Pee-Woman? Great writing and great casting together with great acting make it a must see. I'm trying to find a certain photo of that episode. I'd like to use it as my avatar on a bulletin board because I think the Greenman is hilarious. Does anyone know where I can download a picture of Jim like the Greenman? Can anyone point me in the right direction to find a picture like that?
