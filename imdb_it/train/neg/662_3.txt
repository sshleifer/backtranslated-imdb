and rent a good horror movie. It is as if the writer had never seen a horror film and had not realized that every single thing he wrote was cliché and banal and that it was parodied perfectly in films like "Scream" and "Scary Movie". <br /> <br /> Among the scary bits is the more written BANAL and BORING dialog box ever written. Stupid "we're going to the dance". I wanted to claw my ears. Honestly, "The Hills" has a better dialogue. <br /> <br /> There was really no need to make this movie. The main character is not interesting and I kept thinking "She? Really? Is the boy obsessed with her? Really?" <br /> <br /> All the characters act stupidly, including the police. (Cover the place in teams of 2! Front and rear! There is no sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window down waiting for his throat to be ripped open.) <br /> <br /> The serial killer is simply chirp to kill everyone you want without the slightest problem. No resistance from victims (or doors). No one has any protection or the slightest idea of ​​counter-attacking (or throwing the lock on the door of the hotel room). People are like mentally disabled sheep. <br /> <br /> By the by, if you are a fan goreo, you will be disappointed too. All the killings are kept off the screen and is - ahem - done with taste. (So ​​boo hoo for you!) <br /> <br /> None of the murders is the least interesting. Most of the time they have already happened when we discovered. <br /> <br /> The only missing cliché was the cat that always comes out in this type of film. "Oh cat, you scared me, I thought you were the killer - AIIEEEE!" <br /> <br /> And then in the end, when it's time for the killer to die - well, let's say it's the simplest and most obvious choice. Russian. <br /> <br /> The audience was joking and talking on the screen again. He was too stupid to believe and not scary enough. Don't encourage this kind of lazy movie. <br /> <br /> (Oh, and anyway - no crowning of a king or queen of the ball, no tiara, no bucket of blood.)> <br /> Save your money and rent! "Carrie" or "Friday the 13th" or "Halloween" or "Scream" or "Scary Movie" (none of them) to get a good scare with some original twists.
