From the guys, some previous reviewers have almost written a novel commenting on this episode. It's just an old TV show from the 60s! This episode of Star Trek is remarkable because of the most serious child (Yeoman Barrow's) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it was shot in a real outdoor location. Unlike the TNG and Voyager series which were totally limited to the stages. <br /> <br /> This use of an outdoor location (and of a child) gives an adequate depth and an almost cinematographic quality to a fairly normal episode of this by now dated and a very familiar show. <br /> <br /> Except for some noteworthy exceptions, for example "The city on the edge of life", "Land allotment" and "Tomorrow is yesterday" The old Star Trek series must be seriously moth-packed and put out of his boring suffering. Half a dozen good episodes of 79 is a fairly low average. <br /> <br /> This is typical of the boring stuff produced by Gene Roddenberry then, contrary to popular belief that some people adored the land on which he walked, he actually did a lot of garbage! It does not deserve to be said in the same breath as Irwin Allen for example. <br /> <br /> Just look at the whole bridge of the Enterprise from a modern point of view. They used rickety plywood for the floor, dining chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard over the instrument panels. You can clearly see the folds in the paper! Any expense saved or what!
