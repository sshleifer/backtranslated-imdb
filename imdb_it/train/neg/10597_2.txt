This film was absolutely terrible. I can't think of a good thing. The holes in the plot were so huge that they could drive a Hummer through them. The acting was incredibly bad that even Jean Claude should be ashamed, and that's a lot more! And the dialogue, what dialogue ??? To think that I was a fan of the first (I use that comment freely, it's more a guilty pleasure than anything else). This movie had Goldberg in it for crying out loud !!!! Nothing good can come from this film. What makes this movie even worse is that it's so bad you can't even watch it with a bunch of friends to tease !!! This must be in my first five worst movies of all time. 2/10 because it is so difficult for me to give a 1.
