This isn't a good movie, but it's not even a stinker. It's very confusing and unnecessarily long so let's rent it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My GF and I imagined this film (we think) so here it is: <br /> <br /> * ** MAJOR SPOILERS UNDERLY *** <br /> <br /> In Firstly, this movie is actually quite simple after removing all the confusing unconsciousness-dream-state-junk (95% of the movie.) <br /> <br /> Ignoring the garbage, what REALLY happened is this: a group of schoolmates go to a rave one night. They leave and end up in a car accident where everyone except Cassie and Sean die. This is the simple reduced version. (Exactly, I said Sean, bear me) <br /> <br /> Immediately after the incident, Cassie lies in the hospital between life and death until the end of the film. This is where the dream part begins. <br /> <br /> The film is called SOUL Survivors, right? Cassie's mind and soul continue after the incident interacting with the other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, the 2 weirdos and Jude) along with the images evoked by her mind (Sean, the school and everything else around her ). The souls continue to do what they have been defined as: Annie the girl who goes around, the 2 weirdo-killer (from the opening scene), father Jude who still helps people etc. <br /> <br /> We are therefore very long turned, showed many images (many of which are my GF and I still can't tie), but it all boils down to not being Cassie's time to die. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cassie wakes up in the hospital after being "dead" for a while. His family and Sean are there. This is reality again. Is fine. <br /> <br /> Then the director adds a bit more spice trying to confuse us again by showing a fragment of her dream in a wheelchair that is strangled. But this part is really just a nightmare, and he wakes up next to Sean, obviously still with his traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Due to space restrictions, we didn't cover every little thing, but feel free to send us an email if you want. <br /> <br />
