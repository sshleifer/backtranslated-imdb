Usually I don't comment, but there are things that need to be said. Where to start ... <br /> <br /> The acting, at Jeremy London, was horrible! I didn't think it could be so bad. The plot could have been good, if it had been well directed, along with a good solid performance by the protagonist. Unfortunately, this is one of those movies you read about and think it has great potential to be fun, but you'll be disappointed from the start. <br /> <br /> Well, at least I had a good laugh. I wouldn't waste my time if I were you.
