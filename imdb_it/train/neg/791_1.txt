Imagine the scene where a group of writers sit around a table and one says "let a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public (even black) in the street and ask him if he's black, then leave". The other writers fall into a hysterical laugh until one suggests to repeat it in each episode. More laughter. Now, if you think the premise is fun, and the show contains many kinds of similar situations, you'll like this show. For the rest, use the zapper and find something more fun like looking at dry paint. Those who have written exciting reports of this show should either go out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really fun. Another example of humor in the show, a girl tries to get out of the supermarket checkout trying to hypnotize the cashier. Marginally funny the first time, but why repeat it over and over again in different shows with different cashiers? I could give other examples but these could be treated as spoilers, divulging why this play is not funny at all.
