OK, as everyone pointed out, this film is a complete dog. To a certain extent this is due to the fact that it was a bloody sexual exploitation film that had a lot of excised material (or obscured to almost invisibility) to escape the censor's X rating; but the film also has many other flaws. <br /> <br /> To begin with, it appears that the writer has mixed werewolves and vampires. The villains in this film are furry and dislike silver, but in every other respect they act like vampires. Now you can't do it with a poor genre movie, you have to respect the rules of the genre or the fans get confused and annoyed by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing. Actually the whole plot (confused and poorly presented) is something that has already been done for vampires, but it doesn't make sense in a werewolf movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the werewolf costumes are the smallest I've ever seen. Anyone in the werewolf world should know that the werewolf customs and transformations are something critically appraised by fans, however some of these werewolves are simply stupid. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of slightly good bits. Actually I really liked the score. Others mentioned Sybil Danning's tits. And ... <br /> <br /> (*** SPOILER ***, if such a thing can exist) <br /> <br /> I also liked the plan to attack the werewolf stronghold. There are so many horror films that are based on characters who behave in a stupid way, but in this case they first acquire a very sensible and effective anti-werewolf arsenal and go to slaughter the monsters. I mean, you can kill werewolves with silver bullets and we have powerful weapons today. It shouldn't be too difficult to put two and two together, hmm? But in the typical style this film goes beyond the lines and adds some other very funny and bizarre anti-werewolf weapons.
