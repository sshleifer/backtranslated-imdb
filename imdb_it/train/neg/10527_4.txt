I discovered this film with a retailer that sells OOP. And this is definitely an OOP. A year later The Exorcist is back in business with this film, but what we all were new is that Blair's career never exploded, it never became a mega star. This is one of the reasons why many of his films are OOPs. She gives a good interpretation in this film. This is a gap not recognized by his parents and has no friends. Playing 15 years with a 14-year-old girl, it's fun. The film is also known for the scene of the rape in the showers, if they attached a broom to its virginity. In most editions it is cut off, because, I don't know, blood isn't involved, okay, Blair has a bare ass but nothing is shown, no T & A so nothing to offend people. But the film is slow, extremely slow. I don't normally like it, but I almost felt asleep. It's just that 14 years becomes a rebel against society, but no blood flows, no blood. Because this is categorized in horror it is still a wonder for me. If you're a fan of Blair, buy it if you find it, otherwise leave it as it is.
