All right. Look - I've seen many and I mean a lot about these types of movies. You know, those where the DVD cover looks so good and scaarrryyy that you can't wait to see it? Well, I got GOT again. And I'm getting tired enough. But I digress. It's pretty simple It sucked (I know, quite young) but it happened. And I agree with the other manifesto that if we were to sit through the boring thing, why oh WHY was the leading actress so unattractive? So distracted so if I can add. And the frown he used expressed unresolved grief / pain for his daughter's death didn't help much. I mean, Jesus .. Oh, but the creeping monster on his demon was pretty clean ...
