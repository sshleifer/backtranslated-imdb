This is a film that has had a lot to live. in the year of its release the legendary film critic Barry Norman considered it the worst film of the year and I had heard nothing but bad things, especially a plot that was criticized for being too complicated <br /> <br /> being honestly the plot is something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word "plot" is used because, as far as I can see, there is no plot as such. There is something involving Russian gangsters, a character named Pete Thompson who is trying to get his wife Sarah and an Irish guy named Sean pregnant. I'm not sure how they fit into something called "plot". It's difficult to explain the story lines of Guy Ritchie's films, but if you watch one of his films I'm sure we can all agree that everyone has one, no matter how complicated they may seem at first sight. Likewise a James Bond movie even if the plots are stretched with action scenes. You will have a serious problem in believing that RANCID ALUMINUM has some kind of central plot that can be explained convincingly <br /> <br /> Taking a look at the cast list will sound pretty alarm bell on what kind of movie you will be looking. Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films made in the last 15 years and is doing nothing to become inconsistent. Steven Berkoff gives the acting a bad name (and plays a character called Kant who sums up the spirit of this film) while one of the supporting characters is played by a TV presenter presumably because no serious actress would have been seen dead in this film. > <br /> The only good thing I can say about this film is that it is absolutely to be forgotten. I saw it a few days ago and immediately after seeing it write a very long critical message that warned people about what they are letting themselves look at, but now I have mostly forgotten why. But this does not alter the fact that I remember immensely loving this piece of shit
