You would think that with Ingrid Bergman and Warner Baxter this film would have been much better. Unfortunately, the film suffers from characters that are hard to believe as well as a serious plot problem that makes the characters seem a little emphasized. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Ingrid Bergman coming to work for the Stoddard family. Everything is so full of charm and swells: the family loves Bergman and things couldn't be more perfect. Well, that's until the mother (Fay Wray) dies, the stock market collapses in 1907 (wiping out the family's fortune) and Bergman is forced to go home to France. This part of the film is a bit sticky, but it's not bad. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, after the family's fortunes have improved, Bergman returns. The four boys are now all grown up and there is really no plausible reason why they will once again assume it as a housekeeper. But, briefly, everything swells up once again. But when the first world war occurs, all four go to war - God! In the midst of this, one of the sons (David) brings his new wife (Susan Hayward) home. The character of Miss Hayward is black and white like the others, although while they are all good and swell, she is obviously a horny devil. To make matters worse, she comes to live in the family home while David is at war. <br /> <br /> Now here is where the movie really gets, really stupid - painfully stupid brain. Hayward begins a relationship with one of David's brothers but when his father sees a silhouette of lovers, Bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her, not Hayward with Jack! WHY?! Why would a sane person do this to save the ass of a clearly bad and conniving woman? This was exactly the kind of excuse Bergman needed to finally get rid of the ditch! This is just a case of crappy writing and it drove me crazy ... and most likely did the same with the public in 1941. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film consists of failed opportunities after the failed opportunity for Hayward the evil to be exhibited. This simply flies against common sense and made the film a melodramatic mess. As expected, however, the truth eventually comes out and everyone swells up once again - happy to be a great and wonderful wonderful family except the whore, Hayward. <br /> <br /> The film suffers because of bad writing. The Hayward affair made no sense, at least as it was managed. And, having characters that are so damn good or evil (with nothing in between) sinks this film to the level of a second choice soap. The only thing that saves him is acting --- they tried as best they could with a turgid script. Suffice it to say that the Columbia Pictures writers who made this film should have been slapped to death with a dead chicken!
