What a long movie, pulled out, useless. I am sure that, historically, this film is delicious, but how entertainment does not really make the mark. Ralph Fiennes was in some fantastic films, the English patient, Schindler's List, but this was disappointing. It seemed like he wasn't going anywhere, his character at the beginning was so superficial and tense that it amazes me that his "sister" would never be interested in everyone. Don't worry about paying to rent this movie, buy a copy of the English patient instead.
