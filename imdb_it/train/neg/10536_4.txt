William Cooke and Paul Talbot share the role of director / writer for this fun low-budget film about three kids camping in the woods with their horror magazines. Feet leaned on the fire and the jokes of the schoolchildren back and forth ... and a vagabond from the shorn city named Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... famous Leatherface) wanders and exchanges four stories of blood in exchange for food and the heat of the fire . <br /> <br /> A story is the old reconstruction of "The Hook", two boys in a lover's lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand. Another story has a couple of tokers who need to score some grass. They come across a guy who knows a guy who has a nice s # @ t. While they are smoking a couple of full bags, their skin starts to turn gray and green before it explodes and falls. One of the best stories is about an unhappy man who returns home for Christmas, who cannot wait for his mother to die and enjoys telling his nephew and nephew Satan Claus. The fourth story of the bonfire is that of an avid sailor who is washed ashore by an empty casket and ends up being chased away by zombies. <br /> <br /> Without a big budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES gets the point through and really could have been a lot worse. A bit banal, but fun to watch except perhaps the sailor's tale. Acting is understandably not a worthy reward. The cast members include: Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
