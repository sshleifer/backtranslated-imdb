Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is a high-class housewife who lives in a private condominium on the outskirts with her twin sons and violent husband Kenneth (Craig Sheffer). Della gives all the attention to the twins, neglecting their home and her appearance and upsetting Kenneth. On Christmas Eve, drive to the local shopping center overnight to buy gift wrapping paper and find no parking available. When he sees an old car parked in two places, he leaves a message to the owner calling him "selfish idiot". When the mall closes, Della's car is kept by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks ?? Chuckie (Lukas Haas), Afro-American Huey (Jamie Starr), Chinese-American Vingh (Leonard Wu) and Latin Tomás (Luis Chávez). When the mall's security guard protects her, he is hit in the head by Chuckie, Della speeds up his car trying to escape the criminals. However she crashes into her truck near a forest while being chased by the gang. He takes the toolbox and hides in the woods, fighting the gang to survive. A couple of days ago, I saw the trailer for "While She Was Out" and I was anxious to watch the DVD. Unfortunately the trailer is better than the film, and I'm totally disappointed with this boring and implausible cliché collection. Della Myers is presented as an insecure and negligent housewife who does not exist as a wife; motherhood is his only interest in his concept of family. It is chased by four villains, but defeats them with a toolbox that appears to be Batman's utility belt. Therefore, the plot is so absurd that it irritates. The band of criminals is made up of the favorite cliché of American films, with an African American, a Chinese-American and a Latin along with an American gentleman to be politically correct. Kim Basinger has decent acting, but their children are too young for a fifty-five-year-old woman. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Enquanto Ela Está Fora" ("While She Was Out")
