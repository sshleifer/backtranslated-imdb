Although I had seen "Gymkata" in a theater back in '85, I could not remember anything of the plot except for vague images of Kurt Thomas running and fighting against a background of stone walls and disappointment regarding the ending. > <br /> After reading some of the other reviews I took a copy of the DVD just out to enter the world of Gymkata again. <br /> <br /> It turns out that this is one of those films produced during the 1980s that would go directly to video today. The director is gymnast champion Kurt Thomas in the role of Jonathan Cabot, recruited from nothing to infiltrate the "Parmistan" nation to enter and hopefully win "The Game", a bloodthirsty suicide sponsored by the Khan that encourages his people shouting what looks like "Yak Power". The objective of the mission concerns the Star Wars defense system. Jonathan is trained in martial arts by Princess Rubali, who never speaks or leaves home. Once trained he tries to blend in with the locals wearing a bright red sweater with blue and white strokes. Needless to say, Cabot finds himself running and fighting for his life along the stone streets of Parmistan, towards an appointment with destiny, and play. <br /> <br /> Star, Kurt Thomas was badly served by director Robert Clouse, who looked like he was never on set. The so-called script is just this side of the incompetent. See other reviews for the many screaming throughout. The city of the mad has some good moments, but in the end it is ruined by a bad assembly. The end ... meh. There is still the germ of a good action adventure here. A version of Hong Kong with a more visceral action and a faster pace could also be quite good.
