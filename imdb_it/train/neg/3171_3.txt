Was it the best movie I've ever seen? No. Was it the worst? No. <br /> <br /> As a mother of four, it's nice to see something light and fun. It was nice, but it was nice. <br /> <br /> I think he definitely had room to improve, but he tried. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure this film deserves the extreme level of abuse from the other reviewer. Obviously they don't care about Eva Longoria. I think it was better in this respect than The Sentinel. I think films are a matter of opinion. Actors have an important role in being a success or a flop. <br /> <br /> Maybe the cast didn't work. Maybe there were too many things going on. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to talk for a medium film, not terrible. It could just be a chicken shot. A bit like the movie The Split-Up or French Kiss. My husband still talks about those. :)
