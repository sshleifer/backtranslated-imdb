Really terrible, pretentious, endless film. Director Bellocchio seems to be infatuated with the beautiful face and figure of his actress Detmers - and who can blame him? But maybe, just maybe, he should have focused his attention a little more on how to make a good and engaging film. I hate it when a sex movie stands as an "art movie" just to become more "respectable". Frequent, occasionally hot sex scenes are the only reason for the existence of this film. Whether it's worth sitting through the rest of the image is a matter of taste. (*)
