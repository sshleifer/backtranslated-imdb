Well, I guess I'll have to say "The emperor has no clothes". When I saw this show listed for PBS last night I was a bit full of hope and apprehension. I loved "Morse" (even going to buy the complete DVD set) and I thought that while I always liked Kevin Whately's sergeant. Lewis character, the show was John Thaw, period! After seeing the new "Inspector Lewis" (as was announced here), I am more convinced that he was right ... Whately is fine (even if it looks horrible (both aged and too fat), but he simply has no charisma bring the show as Thaw did. <br /> <br /> And as for his "sidekick" Fox, well ... maybe the reviewers here from England can understand what he's saying, but I for one for most couldn't. <br /> <br /> As for Mrs. Innocent ... all I can say is that I miss James Grout. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say they should have left " Morse "rests in peace.
