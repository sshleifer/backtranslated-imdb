True, the setting in Paris is fantastic. The actors are fine. The plot is a game of twisted morality. It is assumed that if you want someone bad enough, is it okay to hurt everyone else along the way? In a true love story, one prefers less clich√© than the man who is bored with his wife and is willing to discharge his family, and the woman who is well encouraging him to do so. So what if they are decent and if Karen Allen shows her body? The characters are still self-absorbed and reprehensible. Perhaps the moral of the story is "get what you deserve". I give it a 4, just for the potential of quick scanning through the bits of "male interest".
