I mean, really ... or suddenly I lost my sense of humor or this is just a bad movie. It's stupid, ridiculous and simply not fun AT ALL. <br /> <br /> Since I saw the preview I knew it wouldn't be a great movie, I didn't think it would be so bad. .. <br /> <br /> What happened to the good old days when you could find fun and intelligent lines in every movie? When actors weren't supposed to play ridiculous roles trying to be funny? Now we find ourselves with movies like this, Borat, Little Men, Scary Movie 4 where I couldn't find the fun parts !! <br /> <br /> Just skip this piece of garbage <br /> <br /> PS (excuse me for my English)
