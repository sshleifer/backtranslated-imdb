It's amazing that this movie will turn out to be one of my hit lists, after all. It is by far the worst number 1 movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not only have I ever been so bored (fortunately not for more than an hour and a half), the preadolescent attempts of humor that feature isn't even remotely close to me, but one of the corners of my mouth slightly inclined. After the very embarrassing first part, you tend to hope that the other parts are at least slightly better. Hope in vain, from there it only goes downhill. <br /> <br /> The film has no story worth telling and repeats this non-story three times. One can only hope that by some miracle all the remaining copies of this film will be lost forever and Trent Harris never puts his hands on a camera again ...
