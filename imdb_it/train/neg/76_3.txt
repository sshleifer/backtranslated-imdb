I saw it at the Melbourne premiere <br /> <br /> It is superficial, two-dimensional, unaffected and hard to believe given the subject, boring. The actors are acceptable, but they haven't had much to work given the very tiring and insignificant script. For those who may have feared that Ned Kelly might be overly intellectualized, you can take comfort in the fact that this story is completely devoid of literary depth, told entirely on the surface and filled with central casting standards. However, it doesn't even work as a popcorn movie. His rhythm is too offensive and his ability is too poor to satisfy even the level of a trivial actor. <br /> <br /> I strongly doubt that Gregor Jordan can sit down and say to himself "this is the best I could have done with the material". <br /> <br /> Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and so is the national response to him. Perhaps folk genius, possibly class warrior, perhaps psychopathic and probably all of these things, has dominated the true Australian mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story failed miserably on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Such is life.
