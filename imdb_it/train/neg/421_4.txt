My title above says it all. Let me make it clearer. If you've seen the "Planet Earth" of the BBC, which I'm sure many of you have, then you won't like this movie too much. And I have all the "Planet Earth" records. I saw the evaluation of this movie very high, and I read good reviews about it. I was excited to check it out. <br /> <br /> Alas, I went to the theater and the film started, I saw that it was a Disney movie with production companies that listed BBC and Discovery. And when the first polar bear scenes started, I recognized them from my DVDs at "Planet Earth" home. <br /> <br /> The film continued and continued, and so on, me and my friends in recognizing the scenes all came from "Planet Earth". We were very disappointed, as I think that 90% of the footage comes from "Planet Earth". I'm saying 90%, because some of the scenes I didn't recognize. I have a feeling that I simply didn't remember them. <br /> <br /> So finally what this film really is, is a collection of several videos taken from the different albums of "Planet Earth", with a narration aimed at children. Yes, the narrative is rather kiddish. Let me give you an example. When they show puppies moving away from the puppy, the narrator says "Puppies are not like human children, they don't always listen to their mothers" (I don't remember the exact words, but that's how it is) So in a nutshell. This is condensed "Planet Earth" for children!
