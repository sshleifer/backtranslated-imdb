I see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark. The main actor was really good but the editing around his moments takes you out of it. The camera works, that is, the lighting and exposure are a kind of amateur that I could forgive if the direction was more fluent, but it wasn't. The sound was a little off and takes you out of the movie too. I see that I could see this director doing a little better in the future, so don't have a total right, but don't expect a dv movie almost 28 days later or something like that, keep your expectations low and get more out of it. At least it was only an hour and a half. Oh yes, apart from the main role, the acting was pretty bad if you asked me. But I'm a cinema snob, so take it for what it's worth.
