I don't come from America and I know what "Wife Swap" is. When a show came out of that name, I was thrilled to see some imaginative and glamorous sexual moments from the program. But what I got was a real stupidity. I have been misjudged by the name of the title, it has no adult content, nudity, non-vulgar dialogues (the Hallmark channel cast the cast and I think they changed / deactivated this content to make it sorted). <br /> <br /> A show that offers a photo of the current state of the American / Western family, overweight chubby, polluted teenagers and their suckers. In each episode, two wives / two mothers (more correctly) were chosen to live at home in each other and change the family routine again with their new rule. Sometimes it turns out to be good or more evenly bad. In the final section, each mother is brought back with her husband and attempts to conclude what she has done to each family in recent days. It is the sucking part of the program in which each contender strives for its rights. I was sucked in to see all of these instead of seeing some interesting things for adults. I mean who does this program, more than the one who gave the name "Wife Swap"; it is better to call it "Mother Swap". All in all it corrupts all the great things that the true Wife Swap represents! <br /> <br /> Wife Swap = Media Sucking Reality Show.
