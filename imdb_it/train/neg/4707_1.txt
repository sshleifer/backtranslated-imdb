OMG this was the most painful experience of my life watching this. I could even finish what's happening to Nick. Their best thing about teenage Nick is Drake and Josh and he's about to go on the air. Children's songs are rather annoying and so are children. My little sister wanted to see the show because she usually likes everything that comes from Disney or nick, but after she finished watching this show she said "one of the worst shows I've ever seen so boring". My little brother really fell asleep. I envy him. In short, if your 3 years without brain activity will have fun with this show, otherwise change channels now.
