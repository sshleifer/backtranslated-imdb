Mary Pickford becomes the head of a Scottish clan after her father's death, and then has a love story. As fellow commentator Snow Leopard said, the film is rather episodic to begin with. Some of them are fun, like Pickford whipping his clans in church, while some of them are there. All in all, the story is weak, especially the plot of recycled and artificial romance and its climax. The transfer is so obscure that it is difficult to appreciate the scenario, but even taking this into account, this does not seem to be the best work of the director Maurice Tourneur. Pickford and Tourneur once again collaborated with "The Poor Little Rich Girl", a little more accessible, which he named Pickford as a child's character.
