The film that shoots scenes of a scenic cave tour. <br /> <br /> Remember none of this film except for Michael Pataki who expressed JC's extreme pain in "Five the Hard Way". It is the really annoying sheriff that I did applaud when he plays the truncheon on our rabid doctor. Probably the most laughter will come with Dr. Beck's seizures from nothing. Ms. Beck could be more wooden? Seriously, if you took a 4-foot branch, put it in a hot tub, you wouldn't be able to see a difference. The fear and the suspense are looking at the watch wondering when the credits will arrive. <br /> <br /> Watch it as a late-night movie, MSTified, but don't overdo it.
