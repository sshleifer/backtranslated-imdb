I had never heard of this before it appeared on Cable TV. It's typical of the science fiction of the 50s: sober, depressing and not a little paranoid! Despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple, the film is practically put into a documentary style - which is perhaps an economical way to leave a lot of exposure to the narrative and an excuse to insert as many repertoires as is humanly possible for that which is unequivocally an extremely low-budget venture! Although not monotonous of himself (the apocalypse-via-renegade-missile corner later used, with greater ease, both for DR STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964] and mercifully short, the monotonous approach of film to its subject turns out a good dose of involuntary laughter - particularly in the scenes that involve an imminent birth and a gang of clueless youngsters!
