If it weren't for bad dialogues and scripts. I mean, the management was really in touch with his subject. The actors were doing well to bring their characters to life. But in the end, the really missing thing was a solid script to keep all the pieces together. I highly recommend not to watch it. Unless you're a fan of Al Pacino as I am and will look at everything that's playing. Even if the result lately is rather poor. This is, after S1m0ne, a second very bad film for this actor who once knew how to choose roles.
