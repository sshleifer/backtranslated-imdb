The beginning of this film is excellent with a tremendous sound and a certain good humor, but once the film turns into animation, it quickly loses its charm. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons it was so, at least for me, was that the colors in most of the animation are too weak, with too little contrast. It doesn't look good, at least on VHS. Sometimes it bursts and looks nice, but not often. In addition, the characters come and go too quickly. For example, I would have liked to have seen more of "Moby Dick". When the film begins to drag, however, it resumes with the entry of the dragon and then the film ends strong. <br /> <br /> Overall, simply not memorable enough or able to compete with the great animated films of the last twelve years.
