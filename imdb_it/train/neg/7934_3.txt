A family traveling for the daughter's softball league decides to take the "scenic route" and ends up in the middle of nowhere. The father is a passionate photographer, and when he hears an old collateral show abandoned in the city, he decides to make another detour to take some pictures. <br /> <br /> Of course, the collateral show is full of bizarre inbred, who quickly kidnap women and leave their young son and father to look after themselves. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is how the family actually fights against their trapped captives. In addition to this, there is nothing useful in the film.
