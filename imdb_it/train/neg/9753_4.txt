I am grateful for one thing and only for one thing - that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on a completely different continent !!! Yay!!! This program perfectly sums up Victoria Beckham's obsession with prostitution of herself and her family towards the media in the name of self-promotion and the "Brand f * cking Beckham". <br /> <br /> Some years ago I really liked 'Posh and Becks', I really admire David's talent, but I have no respect for him anymore. How can you respect someone who pushed his wife's hand on his backside acting like a puppet. <br /> <br /> It was clear that Victoria's hand was over for the whole time of Beckham's premature departure from Manchester United and now the same thing has happened to Real Madrid. I hope Beckham can live with the fact that although he can earn millions of pounds - he sold his soul for American Buck and will end his days playing for a team that would struggle to get the promotion from Division One in England (no offense America - but at Baseball and Basketball you dominate - you don't do football!) <br /> <br /> Anyway - I digress. It's been years since I saw a performance so exaggerated and totally false by "Posh" - this being surpassed only during his deserving red carpet performances after the "debacle" by Rebecca Loos, when instead of throwing all the cr * pa David deserved, he clung desperately to his arm trying to save the million-pound spinner that his marriage became. <br /> <br /> All this publicity stunt was pathetic. Why can't she just go over there in silence, support her husband through the biggest mistake of her professional career and keep her head down? When has it become so full of importance for itself that you feel the transfer to America should be wrapped by this huge fan? <br /> <br /> Incidentally, I saw David Beckham's documentary last night. At least it has kept a sliver of grace and humility. Two things your wife could do with learning. <br /> <br /> Another thing Victoria - you complain about being constantly haunted by fathers. A small suggestion: stop giving yourself a crush on where you are, stupid woman. <br /> <br /> Good Luck America !!
