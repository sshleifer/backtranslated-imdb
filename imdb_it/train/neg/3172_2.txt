This film is not very original, not original garbage. I like romantic comedies sometimes. Looking at a good one is like eating ice cream for dinner. It is not something you will always do, but the experience is so pleasant that you can ignore how unwise you are. This film made me think about how stupid I was for continuing to sit for the duration of the film. Everything about it screamed cheaply. In reality it seems that they have overexposed the film in certain places it is so faded. It also boasts CGI and lame sets. <br /> <br /> The writing was awkward. I know you can usually expect some plot problems in a dejected comedy, but you usually don't care because you laugh. This film is so funny that you sit down and wonder about the unlikely series of absolutely incredible coincidences and behaviors. Events were included in the film only to move characters from one scene to another or to provide an exhibition. Sure, that's how all the movies work, but you shouldn't notice that it's happening. Inelegant. This is the term I should use. <br /> <br /> In the film there was hardly anyone who was really nice. I didn't care who ended up with whom, as long as they were all away from me, and I didn't have to listen to them talk about it anymore. Why does the only really cool character in the film, the character of Paul Rudd, want to have something to do with the disappointing and condescending maniac played by Eva Longoria? Moreover, almost all the characters involved have constantly chosen the weakest solution for any situation. A straight man pretends to be gay for five years just to go out (and bathe with) with a woman he is attracted to? The best time to feel good was to face a happy ending for the same schmoe in which he joins with Rudd's equally annoying liar and kleptomaniac sister? Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are attractive and attractive women. Perhaps they will find something better to appear down the street.
