I saw this movie on t.v. this afternoon and I can't see how anyone can sit through this piece of trash. It's not funny at all and you need your I.Q. down a couple of notches. I know this film is for children, but that doesn't mean that writers should take their intelligence for granted. I bet the writers were sitting around a large wooden table and realized that a) The word "poop" is like a big laugh. b) A child four feet tall can crush a ten-foot basketball net. c) Children should always fight kidnappers armed with rifles because kidnappers would fall for anything and d) 3 months of karate training is all it takes to beat the so-called "ninja" with swords. One good thing I can say about this film is that it contains the weakest suburban "band" in the world that can't scare anyone. Maybe the MST3K guys could use this movie for a good laugh. Don't worry about this crap excuse for a movie.
