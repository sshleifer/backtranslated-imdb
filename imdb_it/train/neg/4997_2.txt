... but certainly not without merit. Writer-director Preston Sturges is already experimenting with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories, creating widely drawn but distinctive characters and situations and writing intelligent and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogues. (No wonder the Coen brothers' next film will be a tribute to Sturges.) The main problem is that the plot is not over yet; missing the surprise, the unexpected twists and the sudden changes of luck that make spectators suppose. The coffee slogan is a bad thing to base the plot on, and the ending is absolutely predictable. Frank Capra does this kind of thing a lot better. <br /> <br /> If you are new to Preston Sturges, check first "The Lady Eve" or "Sullivan's Travels" or "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek". If you've already seen them, then go ahead and watch this.
