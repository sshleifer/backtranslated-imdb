A well done cast and do their best with what they gave, but the story makes no sense, the characters' actions are inexplicable, and there are too many moments of involuntary humor, such as when a man is killed pierced by pieces of a record phonographic or when they get the witch drunk at a hip-hop pace and then hit her in the head with a bottle and she grabs her hostage and pouts. The scene in which the two witches and his victim (played by the same actress) are at home together prepares themselves as a routine of 3 Stooges, and the plot raises the question: if the witch wants to possess the soul of this other woman , why doesn't he do it? Does it simply do this instead of guiding these people in this chased pursuit? Do not miss the eyeglasses of Christopher Walkin and his automotive explanation of the afterlife (paraphrased): "The ancient Egyptians - they were materialists. They expected the body to last for eternity, like a used car you rigged . " But the Druids, they knew you could not drive in the afterlife. You had to go out and walk. "Eh? The ending is absolutely indecipherable. It seems they have just finished the film.
