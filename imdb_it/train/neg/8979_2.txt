It was Jon Pertwee who said "It is very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly". Well, if this is the case PASTY FACES is "Very easy". David Baker (as a director / screenwriter) and his cast seem to have the impression that the play involves theft of scenes and style by superiors such as LOCK STOCK .. and TRAINSPOTTING, using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down talking very fast very strong voice. Alan McCaffrey is particularly suffering from this type of OTT performance but not enough to ruin the film because there is not enough of a movie to ruin. <br /> <br /> PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts, especially regarding scriptwise. I couldn't understand why it ended this way, it seemed to stop very abruptly and silly. Oh and other obvious errors are that you need a visa to visit the United States and a green card to be able to work there - this movie would make you believe you could get off a plane and start a new life in America without any authorization - that you they are still paid to donate blood in America - People I know in America who donate blood tell me that payment for donations was interrupted several years ago - and that you can buy any type of weapon from a weapons store. As far as I know, the weapons laws in America differ from state to state, but no arms shop sells anti-tank guns at the counter. So we have a mistaken view of America from a very unreal and really unpleasant movie. Perhaps this is a revenge for BRAVEHEART a very Hollywood vision of the Scots? Maybe, but that doesn't stop PASTY FACES from being a crap comedy
