There is not a drop of sun in "The Sunshine Boys", which makes the only ironic title of this supposed comedy Neil Simon. Simon, who adapted the script of his drama (which is not credited), is equivalent to old age with irrational behavior - and worse, to a clumsy, gallant and bad spirit irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is ruthless with us playing an aged vaudeville interview and is reunited with former comedy buddy George Burns on a television special (they are said to have been a team for 43 years, which raises the question "how much did the vaudeville last, anyway? "). Burns, who won a supportive Oscar, has the misfortune to come to the film for about thirty minutes, after which Matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. The more the film becomes noisy, the less it is tolerable and watchable. Director Herbert Ross worked hard only when he wasn't paired with one of Neil Simon's scripts; here, Ross creates gags like a thundering amateur, pounding on belligerent routines that they can't repay (like Matthau semi-incoherent who shows up at a mechanic's garage for an audition for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he over-compensates with the junk. It is up to Ross and Simon to shorten the character, soften his temperament to give "The Sunshine Boys" a bit of sunshine, but Walter continues to project as if we have all become deaf. The image looks terribly sad and crawls at a spiritless pace; one loses hope for it soon. * 1/2 from ****
