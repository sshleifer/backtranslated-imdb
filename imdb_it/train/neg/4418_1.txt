This is a film that requires some digestion. On the one hand, we are offered a hard outer shell, a story that not only derives the Catholic Church, but it does so in a foolish and uninformed way. On an inner layer, we are offered a history of orthodoxy for orthopraxis, and what happens when people blindly follow a faith they do not have to understand. <br /> <br /> At first glance, it seemed that this was to be a comedy. If so, then Mr. Durang needs to open a dictionary, because he clearly does not know the meaning of the word. The jokes are pale; humor is embarrassing and poorly distributed. In particular, Ms. Keaton's performance is fickle and over the top, well below the quality of her Annie Hall and Sleeper days. Jennifer Tilly is again the model of strenuity, with her high-pitched voice and plaintive style. All this could be forgiven had it not been for the last 20 minutes of this film, which evidently was a controversial game made in 1981. <br /> <br /> *** Attentive, spoilers ahead *** <br / > <br /> It all starts with the appearance of four former students of Sister Mary Ignatius (Ignatius, by the way, is a male name, and a nun won't adopt it after her vows under any circumstances simply because of that fact, only to show you how much untiring research began in the project.) When everyone admits that they are not up to the teachings of the church, the sister becomes irrational and abuses them in a way that the public must believe. I think she came back when she was in flashbacks with sepia tones, all too cliche. When one of them admits to having two abortions, the nun becomes even more violent, until the student takes out a gun. After taking her away from her, the nun kills the pupil, presumably in self-defense. Then he goes on a rampage screaming, killing a former gay student because of his sins. The last blow is of the dead pupil lying in a Christ-like pose while the shadow of a cross hangs over her. Can you say "heavy hands?" I knew you could! <br /> <br /> I know there have been abusive nuns in the past, and I know that many people have been emotionally damaged as a result, but this imaginary is fueled in almost every other shot on this shipwreck train. I learned from the writer and director that this is a film about hysteria and why orthodoxy should not be followed in such a religious way, without pun intended. This explanation is difficult to digest, however, simply because we are never given an authoritative point of view that is not biased against the Catholic faith in one way or another. This film is simply anti-Catholic tripe, which in the name of fairness and equality is petty and full of hatred. <br /> <br /> This is a film I would recommend to a Catholic, that is, to wake him up to the realities of what cynicism and ignorance are facing today. If it was "Rabbi Ray explains it all" or "Imam Muhammad explains it all", there would have been riots in the streets and Showtime would have lost all its subscription. But unfortunately, because this is a film that strikes against what is perceived as the majority, it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same mischievous point of view. <br /> <br /> I certainly hope every member of that cast was a practicing Catholic, so it wasn't just the ignorance that led them to make this movie. <br /> <br /> I give it 1.5 stars out of 5, not because of its offensive nature, but because it was badly written, badly directed and just a bad movie in general. Don't waste your time either.
