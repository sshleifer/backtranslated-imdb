This film lacked ... everything: history, acting, surprise, ingenuity and a soul. Fifteen minutes later, I was staring at the screen saying, "How could all these guys be together and consider themselves friends (even without the girl)?" Another quarter of an hour, I was praying as much as possible Amanda Peet. When a bad movie awakens in silence it is ugly, the look is a nice consolation. But there wasn't much of this! Deceived on all fronts!
