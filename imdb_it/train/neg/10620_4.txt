Despite having some exciting (and bold) sequences, NBTN never starts. There are barrels that explode, pin kills, mass suicides, pathologists with body parts and all kinds of classic mystery / horror scenes, but they are interspersed with long periods of pure exposure. Everyone in the movie seems bored. This is a shame as many of the sequences would have been considered bold the moment it was shot. <br /> <br /> Add to this the "too real" English characters and you feel like you are lost in a Holmes Sherlock Movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, cinematography is very ordinary. There are many opportunities for beautiful shots of the campaign, or complex shots of someone being dragged into a huge bonfire, but the whole thing is unimaginative and boring. <br /> <br /> Definitely only for Lee and Cushing fans.
