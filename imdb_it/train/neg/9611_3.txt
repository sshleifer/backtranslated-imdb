There are so many silly things about this movie that I can't name just a few: <br /> <br /> the character of BOGART: 1. His name ?? Whip McCord (too easy, so I'll let it go. Boy, make `Humphrey 'a good sound.) 2. His long curly hair and stupid sideburns. 3. His Black Bart get-up, complete with spurs! 4. You are not sure which shade of lipgloss has been wearing it, but it is not too flattering either. <br /> <br /> The character of CAGNEY (Jim Kincaid): 1. His lipstick does him no favor, either. 2. The man is swallowed by his hat during the whole movie! Couldn't they find a hat suitable for him? Even a little? !!?! 3. His pants are too tight in the back. 4. Blow the smoke from his gun too many times, if you know what I mean, and I think you do. <br /> <br /> If you are a casual fan of Bogart or Cagney, and imagine that it could be a change of pace to see them in a western, do yourself a favor and forget that thought. ALSO THE LOOK OF THE EMBRA HORSES! (I mean, when they don't seem bored.) <br /> <br /> In all honesty, I admit that westerns are my least favorite kind of film, but I've seen a lot, MUCH better than that. <br /> <br /> Comically, or as a high court, The Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, he is an attentive spectator. Therefore, see this only if a) you have to see all the westerns out there b) you are a true Cagney or Bogie complete c) any of the comments above attracts you. Woah ?? ..
