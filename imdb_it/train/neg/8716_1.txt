I do not know where to start; acting, special effects and writing are all as bad as you can imagine. I can't believe the production staff reached a point where they said, "Our work is over, it's time to release." I'm glad the first two of the series never made it to the UK. Actually I would recommend watching this movie only to be able to appreciate how well most movies are made. <br /> <br /> I don't know how any of the other IMDb users could find it scary when the "terrifying" dinosaurs walk down the aisles with their rubber arms flailing around.
