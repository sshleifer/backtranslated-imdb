I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor, so I was very interested in seeing how he would do as a writer / director. I couldn't have been more disappointed with this move. The film was so bumpy and the cinematography was so complete that I wanted to pull the plug from the wall. The actors were very good but it was a waste of talent. Not all actors are cut to be writers or directors and clearly Mr. Hopkins falls into this category. Of all the movies I've ever seen in my 50s, this is absolutely the worst movie ever. Please, do everyone a favor, Mr. Hopkins, and stick to acting, to which you are excellent, and leave writing and directing to those with talent in those areas. If I could give this film a lower rating than I would certainly do.
