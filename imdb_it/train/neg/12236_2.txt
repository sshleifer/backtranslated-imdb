Very simply this should not have been done. It is predictable and clich√©. The chemistry on the screen that made the first "My Girl" so appealing is nowhere to be found here, and the acting as a whole is pungent and forced. Even the script leaves a lot to be desired, some of the "memorable" lines like "earpeircing a barbarian costume" are simply shocking. Where "My Girl" provoked an authentic feeling of sadness and some really funny moments, like so many sequels "My Girl 2" tries to recreate these emotions generated by the public, and fails miserably. Maybe I was tough on this movie because of how good the first one was, but honestly it insults the quality of the original with that kind of drivel that this episode offers. Surely this must approach "Son of the mask" as one of the worst sequels of all time. In both cases, the old saying sounds true; "if it's not broken, don't fix it".
