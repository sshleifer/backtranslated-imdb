The horror images of Poverty Row from the 1930s and 40s depress me. God knows I have nothing against low-budget films, but those produced at that time look bleak and bleak about them - and, ultimately, they're not very good. "The Corpse Vanishes" is a bit more fun than the bottom of the barrel dreck like "The Invisible Ghost" and "The Ape Man", but it's not a classic. Bela Lugosi, for a long time his apogee "Dracula", still plays another crazy doctor; the unbearable Elizabeth Russell plays his wife. They sleep in coffins because, as Lugosi explains to a doubtful young reporter (Luana Walters), a coffin is much more comfortable than a bed. I have buzzing. There are also Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Urecal, who could satisfy the hardcore fans of the films of the 30s and 40s.
