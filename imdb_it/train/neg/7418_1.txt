Oh god, what a horrible and horrible movie. It means to be a comment on the state of society, it's just a reflection of the worst of the worst TV in reality. The interstitials hosted by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most hateful part, written in a tone that is perhaps thought to be reflective and insightful. Rather, these moments are anxious as they talk to the camera with dialogues written by someone with a love for an offensive and condescending speech that pushes the "meaning" of the film into the viewer's throat. <br /> <br /> Also, a point for aspiring filmmakers: long scenes and quiet scenes are not the same as art. Even extreme angles or logic do not extend to absurdity. <br /> <br /> If anyone is interested in watching this movie, please don't do it. Seriously. Please. You have better things to do.
