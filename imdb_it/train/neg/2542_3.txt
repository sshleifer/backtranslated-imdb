... not that all Disney movies are rubbish. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw "Legend of Boggy Creek" first and loved the movie. When I heard he had 2 sequels, I was ecstatic. I finally found a copy of this and watched it one night. I don't see how they can do a G-rated sequel to a horror movie. The original is a film / documentary about Fauke's monster and can scare anyone. "Return" is for children and should not be looked at by anyone. I don't remember the plot too well, since it's been a long time since I watched it and I won't watch it again, but ... These are these hunters who come to town and try to kill Bigfoot. Three kids come out of the house to stop them. A great monsoon passes through. Hunters get hurt, they are saved by children. Then they hide in a boat with a large piece of oilcloth on top and try to wait for the storm. Then suddenly Bigfoot arrives and does something really sick. I don't want to ruin the ending for any of you, but it's not scary. Well....
