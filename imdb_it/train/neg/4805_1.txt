I adored Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought it was fantastic on Top Model and it really made me happy when it won. I also liked Chris Knight, he looks like a good guy. But this show made me SICK! I'm so angry with both of them for what happened on that show. I don't care that they were different ages, I know that age can't be between love. But Adrianne, you've been together for ONLY SEVEN MONTHS. It did not surprise me at all that he had not proposed. And I don't see the appeal to force someone to marry you before they're ready. If it is meant to be, then why not just enjoy each other's company and love each other, and make it come naturally? Turning a faith into a chain has been completely useless, it is foolishly obvious that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, shame on you stopping and proposing them anyway! You've gone through two failed marriages, how could you have rushed into another just because you took a step? I hope the relationship lasts, but I really feel that the marriage was rushed and for all the wrong reasons. Maybe now they can catch their breath and find the right reasons to get married inside the marriage.
