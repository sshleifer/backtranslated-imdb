As a fan of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, I can stand ANY footage that can be imposed on me, but there's absolutely no reason for it. <br /> <br /> Vote "Super Action" in the Blockbuster Video section and given the dreaded "Sticker with restrictive view" I assume these are the only methods that the director (HA!) Robert Napton could use to get at least 4 , 50 from an unsuspecting person. <br /> <br /> Shame on Robert Napton! Shame on you for exploiting these poor Mexican actors that you probably promised to hope to make it big in American cinema. You are a disgrace! <br /> <br /> There is no moment in this film that holds back the slightest movement. Did you use the snot on these people? Oh, look, they're doing a rave in a field! Like all 6 of them. And isn't he an Asian guy in the background? Why is it always during the day? Why did it take 1/2 of the movie to show something ... and more importantly because we looked at the other 1/2? <br /> <br /> PS: you owe me 4.50.
