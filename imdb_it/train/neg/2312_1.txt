This is one of those movies where I wish I had stayed at the bar. <br /> <br /> The film is frankly boring. What story is there is very fragile and you have to practically guess. The film indulges in pretentious photographic techniques that seem intent on causing migraines and make it sound like a student film. Did I mention that it was boring? If all the characters had suddenly died at the end of the film, I wouldn't have cared less because I had no emotional attachment to any of them. <br /> <br /> There are about 4 good minutes in this film, but it was on it. This is the first time I thought of leaving a cinema during a performance, but I kept believing that it had to improve. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The kind of movie you could threaten bad children with.
