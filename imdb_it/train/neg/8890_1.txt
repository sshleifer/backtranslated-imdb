For my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I can't believe what these people did for a perfectly good game. <br /> <br /> - Let's start with the beauty, right? - <br /> <br /> Alan Rickman is fine, although some of his dialogues could have been delivered with more feeling. The rest of the actors needed to put it together. <br /> <br /> Romeo, Romeo, why are you not dead yet, Romeo? The actor, although not only completely wooden and impassive, could not read his lines with any taste. He was completely out of focus, he had had trouble looking even at Juliet, and absolutely NO grace with the jokes he had been given. Anyone who has chosen deserves to be punished. Juliet is almost passable, but does not give depth to her character, and seems to be completely out of the game. Mercutio was incredibly disturbing and completely out of character for the entirety of his dialogue. Benvolio was numb and ruthlessly uncertain with his jokes. <br /> <br /> I was forced to endure this semi-cooked production of Romeo and Juliet. The acting was punched and the costumes were distracting to say the least. I saw kindergarten puppet shows with more commitment on their part. I just wish you could give this movie a zero rating.
