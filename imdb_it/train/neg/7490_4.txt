This film was disappointing. It was incomplete and boring. While Alec Baldwin tried to interpret himself as the perfect and proper prosecutor (not to mention the executive producer), the film never showed any of the defensive advisers or tried to challenge the public with a real meaningful debate on how a country could be driven on such a terrible path. <br /> <br /> Of course, nobody wants to defend the point of view of the Nazis, but THIS IS THE POINT of the Nuremberg Trails! Four hours of simple attacks on the Nazis ... It's already been done! <br /> <br /> I really think that Alec Baldwin should just be Kim Bassinger's husband. <br /> <br /> Immediately after the film ended, TNT showed the 1959 film, Trail at Nuremberg. That film is far superior.
