He had a SURPRISING plot! ;) I've seen films with less plot (I don't want to mention Asian films but ...). I thought the camera wasn't bad at all for a cheap film like this, and the atmosphere wasn't too bad. There is no real reason for most of the things that people do and how they react to what happens. Even if I think of a lot of movies, in this case it was horrible, of course. <br /> <br /> He tore some movies SO bad for single scenes only. The acting was bad but I've seen worse. The film was bad but I've seen worse. Watching this movie is an experience of boredom, laughter, death wish, sadism, horniness and low-level entertainment. <br /> <br /> So if you like jerky movies with silly plots this is the right movie for you. <br /> <br /> I gave it 3/10, because it can be fun if you don't expect to see a good movie and you're in the mood.
