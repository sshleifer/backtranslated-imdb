Listen to some of the interesting things that our faith healer fighter hero Pat, his son Gordon (the TV ministry looks like a family affair.) And Terry Meeuwsen (He won Miss America in 1973 wearing a swimsuit and showing his legs Oh my kind God, to say when our poor spectators are sick and need help. <br /> <br /> 1. Someone with a "right tooth abscess" has just been healed.2 Someone with "twisted intestines" is He was cured.3 Then Terry said that there was a person with a "strange condition" (Do you mean God does not know?) A burning in the legs, which has just been healed.4 So Gordon said there is a man (which narrows him!) With swelling of the breasts in his right cheek, with much pain behind his right eye, but is now healed.5 Someone with a right hip problematic, limited mobility by stroke, is now in able to walk 6. Terry said he saw someone with severe bone rigidity of the neck, but did not know the exact disorder (God does not know?) - that the person is now healed. 7. Someone paralyzed on the right side, in particular (not exactly?!) The right side of the face has been healed.8. A man (who narrows the world population again) with a plate in his skull is having ongoing problems, and the doctors simply don't know what to do. Terry said he saw the bone re-form around the plate (funny bone ?!) and the man's pain disappeared, now he's healed. <br /> <br /> The way our war hero Pat helps our sick and poor. 1. There is a woman in Kansas City (in Missouri or Kansas but shrinking down). Who has a breast the gentleman is drying it now thanks Jesus. 2. There is a man with a financial need - I think a hundred thousand dollars (I think their god needs to go to school or something!). This need has been reached right now, and within three days, the money will be provided thanks to the miraculous power of the holy spirit. Thank you Jesus. 3. There is a woman in Cincinnati with a cancer of the lymph nodes. <br /> <br /> I don't know if he was still diagnosed (ask your vengeful god Pat!) but you don't feel well, and the gentleman is melting that cancer right now! (What?!) 4. There is a lady in Saskatoon (I assume Canada.) In a curvature of the spinal column in a wheelchair, the gentleman is righting himself right now, and you can get up and walk! (If you have this condition, ignore Pat!) And it's yours. Thanks Jesus! Amen, Amen! <br /> <br /> When Pat Robertson had prostate cancer, did he go to Peter Popoff ?, Oral Roberts ?, Benny Hinn ?, Terry or Gordon? No! On February 17003 Pat went to a real doctor to get surgery! (You mean he doesn't trust his faith healing friends, Terry or his son Gordon?!) <br /> <br /> When LT Pat Robertson was in the Marines during the Korean War He was a liquor officer, responsible for holding officers supplied with alcohol. He was known for drinking himself and dating prostitutes and was afraid he had contacted gonorrhea. (He should ask a healer for help!) The reason Pat came out of the fight was because his father Absalom Willis Robertson (D Goes from 1946 to 1966) was chairman of the Senate military appropriations committee. <br /> <br /> Terrorist attacks, 11 September 2001 We imagined ourselves invulnerable and consumed by the pursuit of health, of wealth (Pats is worth between 150 and 200 million dollars!) material pleasures (a villa in Virginia Beach Virginia with a helicopter pad!) And sexuality (she had sex with her future wife before marriage and had a son!). It is (terrorism) happening because God is raising his protection from us. (Statement released September 13, 2001) Pat Robertson reminds me of Burgermeister on Santa Claus Is Coming To Town and his evil vengeful god reminds me of Venger on Dungeons And Draghi. <br /> <br /> Rogue Gordon does what his dad Pat says and Terry is a paid woman who doesn't even have a head! <br /> <br /> This will really capture you! The September 5, 2005 edition of The 700 Club included a report from the Christian TV network correspondent Gary Lane outside the New Convention Center in New Orleans, which hosted mostly victims of impoverished black disasters throughout the weekend. "A number of items left behind suggest the mentality of some of the evacuated" Lane said "include this cup of voodoo with the saying" May the curse be with you. "A screen shot of a plastic souvenir cup of one of the many trinkets in New Orleans: Guerrilla Warfare and Thugs 'R' Us. "Lane declared, pointing to a bunch or CD of rap scattered on the ground (his bigot dad Absalom taught Pat's racism well!) <br /> <br /> If any of you good people ever think of donating to these sexist bigoted people please in the name of God do not! Sponsor a softball or basketball team, give a shelf of food, be an older brother or sister of a child, but please don't give these people because they've been around for over 40 years and haven't solved anything . <br /> <br /> If you still don't believe me, write Pat Robertson heard during the commercial break on the web and do a search and once you've heard what he really likes, I know for sure that you won't give a penny to these liars! And by the way Terry had a divorce and Pat talked about divorce many times in his shows. <br /> <br /> I like to greet the guys from Dover Pennsylvania, Orlando in Florida, and the nice people who were impressed by Hurricane Katrina and I hope it's a pleasant day. Has Operation Blessing helped New Orleans? (I doubt it!) Please inform our readers! I want it! Speaking of people if you're sick, go to a real doctor and let everyone laugh at these liars and one day Burgermeister Pat, Gordon and Terry can go somewhere else and take their angry god Venger with them!
