I'm writing this review after watching it several months ago ... the trailer looked promising enough to let me buy this bad excuse for a movie. It's a complete joke ... and literally a spit in front of the true classics of the first generation of horror as Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) who even had the courage to confront each other on the back cover. The producer who played Brandon should go rummage hamburgers and serve greasy burgers ... what the hell might not even be good at that! The lighting was bad and a big annoyance during the film you could not even see the actor's face sometimes. I don't even remember the rest of the cast members who are really sad, they never do anything to impress you and make them memorable. This is all the time I will waste on this review PLEASE, stay as far away as possible from this pile of junk, even if you take it for 25 cents, I wouldn't buy a piece of rubber, at least, it would be fun! <br /> <br /> If you want good low-budget entertainment, much better than this ... then take a look at a Jeff Hayes movie .... because it takes talent to make it horror and the kid has it! <br /> <br /> I gave this 1 star only for the cover .... this is the only thing worth appreciating this so-called "movie" <br /> <br /> -Rick Blalock
