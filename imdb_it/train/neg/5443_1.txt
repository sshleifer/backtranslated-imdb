Too bad, I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director failed to put it together. There is a lot of action, lots of promises, but everything is freaking out. The director didn't do his job. The promising action comes off. It seems so devised in a desperate attempt to save the film. This version of "The Rage" (DirecTV credits it as 1996) is simply not worth looking at. Another director would have done a better job.
