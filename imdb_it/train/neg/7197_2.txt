OK. I think the TV show is nice and always has some kind of lesson. So when my kids decided they wanted to see this movie, I decided to follow it. I would like to stay at home and watch the TV show instead. <br /> <br /> The fact that humor is silly and unoriginal is the least of the problems with this film. The plot is close to non-existent, the characters seem to exist in a vacuum and, worst of all, Gadget brings no lessons whatsoever. It seems that Disney has taken all the things that make the Inspector Gadget work on TV and launched them all. To be honest, my youngest child (8 years old) liked the film, but the oldest (10 years) came away thinking silly (he was too old for youthful humor but too young for adult humor) . <br /> <br /> In general, I like Disney movies but this lacks a mile. It's good for a very narrow band (say from 7 to 9) but not to be missed for everyone else.
