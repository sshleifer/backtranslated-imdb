I do not know where to begin. The cast is full of people who have never done anything before or after. Debralee Scott is listed on the covers, but does not appear at all in the film. The writing is quite ugly, even for university films. It is obviously a very low budget, with a scene where the sisterhood has an extremely rough editing. <br /> <br /> The characters are quite typical for university films: shy boy, nerd, sweet black guy, tough guys, mustache guy, attractive girl, small town girl, etc. The prominent teacher talks about what you would expect ... a middle-aged boy with a heavy group who is easily misled. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to see a college hit, make it clear from this. It's so ugly, it's not even funny.
