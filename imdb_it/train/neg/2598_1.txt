Even in a bad movie, there's usually some redeeming feature, something you can say yes was terrible, but there was that performance, or that part of the script, or that special effect, this was just simply terrible everywhere . The acting was ridiculous, the terrible script, complete with Tiffany's many inexplicable breakfasts and even the special effects were poor at best. This was a very bad film and even the wishes of Drew Barrymore have been erased from history. Watch it if you want to: a) Suffer a hard self inflicted pain. b) See how dangerous a movie can be. This is a film in which I can use the clich√© "there are ninety minutes of my life that I will never return" with some justification!
