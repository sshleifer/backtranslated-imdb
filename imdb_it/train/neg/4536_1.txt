This film is nothing but a religious treatise that promotes classical Hinduism and New York occultism dressed in Western images to be swallowed up by those who ignore religious foundations. The basic tenants of Hinduism contain elements of reincarnation. (Some of the characters appear both in the present and in the 1600s) obviously reincarnated. God is an impersonal force. Animal life and plant life are all the same. (This is pantheism). Redfield sought to mix Eastern mysticism with Western Christianity. His attempt at syncretism can deceive or confuse those who are not seekers of truth, but this film is a weak excuse for any ultimate reality. As the ad of the old Berkeley Barb said for $ 10.00, we'll show you how to start your religion. As a famous prophet said, "Use the Luke Force".
