Well, EYEboy, I have to say that I like it when no one chooses me and makes fun of me, especially when it's someone who looks smart like you. My favorite part of your post was "But no big bang-bang good boy here, kimosabe. I suggest you stick to the movie with a lot of bang". <br /> <br /> Well said! I like action films, especially if they are well made, but I also like films that don't have a lot of action, as long as they are well done. I'm sorry, but Secret and Lies don't fall into this category and it's just a bad movie. I really don't see many non-American films, so maybe I was spoiled and I didn't realize how ugly foreign films were when I saw Secrets and Lies. Perhaps if I judged foreign films with a different standard I might one day see how Secrets and Lies could be one of the highest scoring IMDB films. Hmm ... If that's true, it's very scary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new e-mail)
