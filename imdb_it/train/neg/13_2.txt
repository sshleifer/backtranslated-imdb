Weak storyline, predictable violence, only semi-interesting characters. As the writer (also one of the stars?) He was inventing his mistakes and added incredible fantasies of drugs and murder to make it "hot". From the predictable rap and house soundtrack to family conflicts, it is misinterpreted, stereotyped and, ultimately, terribly boring. Also the title has been done before - IMDb lists five films with the same name published in 2007-2008 !! <br /> <br /> Note: I saw it on Showtime, which listed the synopsis of one of the other films. It was halfway before I realized that no one was an undercover cop. Even if another stereotype, it would have made it interesting if it happened.
