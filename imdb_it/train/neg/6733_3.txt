The exclamation mark in the title is appropriate, although a euphemism. This film doesn't just cry - it screams loud enough to shatter the glass. Directors Andrew and Virginia Stone have created thrillers with humor and acute suspense that sought a semi-documentary sense. Here, they shot in real places in New York with miniature "real-life" acoustics to increase their verisimilitude. But the naturalism of sound recording only serves to amplify the clumsy dialogue of the Stones and the foaming histrionics of the tortured butterfly Inger Stevens. <br /> <br /> In a completely unmodulated performance, Stevens plays the wife of electronics magician James Mason (apparently tired and bored); both are held captive by the estorist Rod Steiger (he looks bloated and bored) and his slimy cohorts in a scheme to blackmail an airline with a deadly bomb that Mason unwittingly helped build. <br /> <br /> Here is another credibility - tense request of a criminal mind so brilliantly attentive to every detail, but shrewd enough to hire a degenerate drug addict as a second lieutenant. Stones' idea of ​​biting tension is to trap the hysterical Stevens alone with the Benzedrine rapist Neville Brand, filling the frame of her sweaty and drooping kisser. But the camera works so lead and Brand so (in an unusual way) that the effect is not very dirty, much less suspicious. The Stones, a square couple in the heart, do not even have the courage of their lack of convictions. <br /> <br /> The film, which ends with the burly Steiger chasing Stevens with the fleet on a track subway train, is as awkward as it is heavily heavy. With Angie Dickinson as Steiger's amoral girlfriend, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey and Barney Philips.
