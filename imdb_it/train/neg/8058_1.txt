Having seen the hot Eliza Dushku in the beautiful Wrong Turn, I decided to take this instead of Return of the Living Dead, of all the movies. I haven't seen it yet, but considering it is one of the most acclaimed horror films of all time, I'm sure I made the wrong choice. There is simply nothing to recommend this film, and I'm talking about the supposed top assassin cut. Nor did he have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre or poor films like I Know What You Did Last Summer or Valentine or Urban Legend. It just didn't make sense, it didn't contain excitement, it didn't have interesting acting or interesting writing. The release date has apparently been postponed numerous times for about a year in a row, and the reason is obvious. The entire film is presented as a series of meaningless scenes, haphazardly put together, with meaningless effects. Get the wrong Turn instead if you want to see Dushku. I'd like to see a movie with her and the super acclaimed Elisabeth Harnois - but I don't think this would have made this film watchable either. Casey Affleck, so promising in Good Will Hunting, is horrible here - he seems lacking in intelligence and courage. This is enough about this.
