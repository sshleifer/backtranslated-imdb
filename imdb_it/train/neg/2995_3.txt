Only on rare occasions does an x-file episode generate no excitement or the episode contains something completely boring to watch. A detective and his former partner both die in unexplained circumstances. The deaths are linked to the presence of a young girl who was there when the deaths occurred. Mulder has come up with a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues is reincarnated as the child and is avenging with exactness. Now for the bizarre thing. no connection and seems to be just a random person chosen as a reincarnation. I think this was a bit lazy writing by writers and this episode is one of the worst in the history of x-files!
