* MANY SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW * This movie was horrible. I'm a big baseball fan so I thought I'd watch it, and I was very disappointed. It all started well. When I saw the negative influence that DeNiro had on his young son, I hoped he would become a better father for the whole movie or something. However, at first it seemed that DeNiro should have been the protagonist. He was the only one who believed in Bobby, and he had his adorable son who was losing custody, which gave me a reason to feel bad for him. He wanted to help Bobby talking to Primo, when he stabbed Primo from death to absolutely nothing from a nothingness anywhere ... Not to mention the sketchy song that reproposes "I WANT TO **** YOU !!!!" in unconscious random moments. <br /> <br /> Later, when DeNiro saved Bobby's son from drowning, I hoped the movie could redeem itself. He could forgive himself by killing Primo if he had saved Bobby's son. But of course this is far beyond the depth of the film, because all he cares about is getting CREDIT for the murder, and he does it by stealing Bobby's son, car and dog and holding them hostage. Bobby just has to hit a home run and announces that DeNiro is a "real fan" as he shows a picture of him biting a knife. <br /> <br /> Now we come to the scene completely unrealistic at the end ... It is going very well and we should believe that the game was not called. Then DeNiro magically appears on the court in a referee's suit and calls Bobby at home, proceeding to take out the knife and start stabbing all those running in the field. Apparently there are no agents in the field (but the police are coming), so DeNiro approaches the mound and prepares to throw a knife at Bobby when he is shot to death. But don't worry, this cheerful and pleasant film has a happy ending, because Bobby finds his son. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a sports movie. NOT a fan. As far as I know, fans are not rabid psychopaths who threaten, steal and throw knives to their admired ones. This is probably the sickest film I'll ever see in my life. The plot was superficial, the soundtrack sucked, the film had absolutely no purpose. I warn you not to waste your time with this disgusting excuse for a movie.
