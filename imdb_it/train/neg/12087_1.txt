I've seen all kinds of "Hamlet". <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh was the most ambitious, Mel Gibson was fast and to the point, Laurence Olivier was the best - hands down. But now we come to see the bardo of Maximilian Schell. <br /> <br /> First, this is a dubbed version of a German television production of the venerable William Shakespeare's chestnut. But if there is a slower version, more strenuous, more lethargic and worse out there somewhere, it must have been recited at the elementary school level. <br /> <br /> After seeing him on MST3K he helps, with Mike and the robots do joker to the boy, to pierce the depth of the black and white TV, Shakespeare and the wisdom (?) of the Germans who play English plays and makes it look like an rejected Ingmar Bergman. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best parts are the MST riffs. The best lines? "I'm going to unleash the Great Dane", "I don't think so, 'vent'", "Meeting with the Beatles", "Hey, Dad, you will help me with my scientific project" and, my favorite, during a party - "Garrison Keillor is leaving Germany (YAAAY !!)". <br /> <br /> But then there's Schell, playing the greatest Shakespeare character much like a department store mannequin, but not as expressive. There is no doubt that he is a great actor, but here he is as Paul Newman in "The Silver Chalice". Have you ever seen that? GOTTA looks at these two on a double bill! <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a case in which it is true that you are much better simply by reading the book. At least the book is not nicknamed by Ricardo Montalban. <br /> <br /> A star only for this "Hamlet"; ten stars, of course, for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Good night, not so sweet prince.
