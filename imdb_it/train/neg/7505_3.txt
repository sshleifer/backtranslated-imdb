This very long film reveals itself less than Berkowitz and its effect on New York, but more on the caricature painting of a certain group of Italian-Americans, known locally as "Guidos". The problem is that the "Guidos" are not very interesting, regardless of the type of story or setting in which they are immersed. They are already living caricatures, so Lee only amplifies them, rather than simply portrays them. <br /> <br /> When someone has a self-made caricature, he doesn't go home and says, "Hey, let's make even bigger ears and noses!" This is what Lee did in this movie. The most interesting characters in the film are the two (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) who wish to escape the "Guido" lifestyle. Complete the whole thing with an uninteresting storyline for the characters, especially that of John Leguizamo, and get a good movie to fall asleep. Especially considering the long execution period. <br /> <br /> Another attack against it: for someone who claims to be a Yankees fan and grew up in New York, Spike Lee should know how to spell Phil Rizzuto, which is spelled incorrectly in the titles of tail.
