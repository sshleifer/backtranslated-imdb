Rather possibly the most beautiful woman in show business, and the sexiest, Debbie offers another beautiful performance here. Although his work in American Nightmare was far superior, it is still worth looking at in this film. <br /> <br /> The cast is full of your typical Melrose Place types, chiseled elements and seductive curves, which I had never seen before. In addition to Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actress I'd ever seen before, in the Delta Delta Die similar. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on a group of arrogant Californians who start the poor gullible Debbie Rochon in their clique. They tell her that they have a murder club and that she has to kill someone to be accepted. Debbie wants nothing more than to be accepted by these fantastic people, so she quickly kills a person, and now the group has to decide what to do with her after she falls in love with their joke. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $ $$$$ (Abundance! From time to time Debbie Rochon has blood splattered on her and all the murder scenes are done in the face. Gore hounds will surely appreciate!) br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$$$ Debbie Rochon has several nude scenes like many unnamed actresses and actors do. The pool party seems like an excuse to let everyone be naked, both man and woman. Julie Strain also has a topless cameo but she disappeared after the first five minutes). <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (Could have received a higher rating because the plot was very interesting and unique but the plot acts as a filler between nude scenes. B-Rate movies often use nudity, but this is excessively borderline. <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ (Acting is nothing short of standard. reat, easily the best B-Rate actress in the world today, but her character in American Nightmare was superior. Danny Wolske does a good job as an object of lust for Debbie, but the other actors were nothing to write about.
