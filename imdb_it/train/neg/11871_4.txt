Gregory Peck's acting was excellent, as you'd expect, and cinematography is really amazing even when you play directly in a melodramatic "moment". But the rest of the film was exaggerated and difficult to watch, at least for me. I tried to like it, but I had to go fast in the last thirty minutes or so. I feel like I've wasted a couple of good hours. If it hadn't been for Gregory Peck, I wouldn't have lasted fifteen minutes. 4/10.
