Ok guys, we know why we watch movies like "The Invisible Maniac" (look at the cover, mate!). T and A everywhere (with much more T than A). But ... shouldn't there be a story to go on with? <br /> <br /> "Come on," I can hear you say - "they are just naked girls!" Who needs a story? ?! "<br /> <br /> Well, if this was called" The NAKED Maniacs ", I would have no problem. But since these guys are contributing from" The Invisible Man ", they need to have some history. around here, you know, to keep your mind occupied. <br /> <br /> However, all they can tell is how this crazy doctor creates an invisibility serum and, when he breaks, uses it to spy on women naked and ends up killing a lot of teenagers. And when you see skinny-looking teenagers, you'll be grateful. <br /> <br /> A star, for the T and A, but there's a little too much blood for your skin fans, so proceed with caution. <br /> <br /> TIDBIT - yes, it's THAT Savannah.
