I don't understand how these animated films keep coming out, and it doesn't matter how good (or bad) people love it. <br /> <br /> I saw this film with my two children (5.7). They like pretty much everything that is animated (like most people who voted for this movie). The theater was almost full and I couldn't wait to see the film with its superb cast. To tell the truth I was bored stupid. It was incredibly predictable and simply banal. There were a couple giggles during the movie and that's it. Of course they tried over and over again to get the economic laugh, but it just didn't work. My son almost always tells me he wants the DVD after watching an animated movie, but not about it. My daughter fell asleep halfway. Furthermore, the children thought that the character animation was strange. I've never heard of it since I saw The Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares. <br /> <br /> Trust me, I'm not the type who seeks the negative in everything. But quality is quality, and like so many animated films that they throw out there, it has very little.
