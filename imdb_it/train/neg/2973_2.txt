I have two very important complaints about this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. That my local rental shop has set aside what is clearly a soft core porn in the "suspense" category. (If I had known what it was, I wouldn't have wasted my time renting it in the first place. And yes, this movie is a soft core porn.) <br /> <br /> 2. The title has nothing to do with the film. No one in this film does anything that is deviant or obsessive, not to mention a combination of both. <br /> <br /> Actually, you make three main complaints: <br /> <br /> 3. That for some reason I watched the movie long enough to find the number two point on this list. Boy do I regret it. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my mistake. This film has no value on practically all levels.
