One is the highest rating I could have given to this film, considering that zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pee yew, a useless mess of a movie with a lot of wasted b-list actors who did a better job, written and directed by a boy with the mentality of a twelve year old who smiles and giggles at stupid puns and poo jokes and fart. For example, the character of Gene Stapelton (Ding-Bat from All in the Family) that tells the character of Marilu Henner who "oscillates in both directions" sexually, was an economic attempt at humor indicative of the general lameness of the film .. Are you fond of brash humor? Rental of Animal House, American Pie (only part one), Old School or Office Space.
