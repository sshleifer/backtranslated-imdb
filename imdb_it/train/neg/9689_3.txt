On the one hand, it is like "The Wizard of Oz", with Paris in black and white and the Riviera in color. But it's supposed to be about possessive love, destructiveness and moral decadence, while in reality they are designer clothes, shots from the Riveria, lots of expensive cars and music and dance interludes that suggest Vincente Minnelli on one of his days rest. Watchable, but a remarkable example of desperate and obscure plot material and of a luxurious style that goes in opposite directions. (Was this the model of "The Talented Mister Ripley?" Does anyone perceive an affinity between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)
