I usually like comedy movies. I really like them. But in reality I didn't understand "Envy". I mean, it has a boring content / topic, and it's not very funny. <br /> <br /> Although acting is generally good, it is not enough for the film to become at least a bit interesting. Stiller and Black do not show all their talent in this film. <br /> <br /> So if you're about to rent a play, I suggest you don't go for it. Unless you're getting bored, and I can see that I'm not the only one with this opinion, because even Jack Black apologized for that (take a look at Trivia).
