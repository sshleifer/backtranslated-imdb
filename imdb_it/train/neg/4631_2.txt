Although Misty Ayers (the burlesque extractor) is certainly as attractive as the protagonist of the blonde, this film is just an excuse to let her undress to underwear a few times (no nudity in 1954 when this film was produced, not in 1965) . > <br /> The boy who hires her to work in a brothel recalls Bud Abbott of Abbott and Costello. Most other women are unattractive, and the drunk woman is semi-funny in a creepy way. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10. Mrs. Ayers has a curvaceous body, but one cannot judge any actor's talent because the WHOLE movie is post-dubbed. Some of these "exploit films", usually made later than this, are interesting in some ways, but this is really a boring party. Sid Melton (MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY) direct. There are some facial expressions similar to Samurai and interesting apartments, but there is NOTHING here.
