I saw this movie for the first time today and I've never heard of it before, probably because of its poor message. <br /> <br /> First of all, the direction is pretty good, the actors played well and the CGI (I'm not a CGI fan) is great. But this alone does not make a film. No story, no message behind the beautiful talents exploited. <br /> <br /> Or I have to remind people, a director's art is not just your vision, but knowing how to tell a story. And that's what the 7 minutes are missing. <br /> <br /> There is a simple vote of 4.
