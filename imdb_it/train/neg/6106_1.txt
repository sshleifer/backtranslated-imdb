It was just awful, the plot was fine, but the rest was bad. I mean, come on Marionette and then they even tried to make the movie digital and that made it even worse! Normally I would like a low-cost movie, but this was just a waste of time and almost made me want to return the set that came out. I have about ten low-budget films with about 6-8 films and I should say that this is the worst film of them all. Even the wording is turned off and they use a fake plastic machete that doesn't even seem real, they could use one that even seemed a little close to the real one, so save time and money and don't watch horror movies
