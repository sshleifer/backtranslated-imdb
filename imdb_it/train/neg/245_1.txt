Beyond the shadow of the doubt Mysterious Planet is one of the worst films ever made, but retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and its incredible sound track in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest is all of which you need to see) combine to create something that is hilarious. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in 'space' is almost as incomprehensible as cinematography, while bottles of washing liquid pass your eyes in dialogue. Before you have had the time to figure out if you are the one who went mad, the credits roll and action fights for life. <br /> <br /> And apart from the two-headed plasticine snail that terrifies our heroes, you also get the double added bonus of simultaneously having the voices of the original actors AND the voices dubbed. Pure genius. <br /> <br /> The sad thing for fans of this sort of thing is that I've only seen one copy, so it's very unlikely that you can see it for yourself. Perhaps I have the only existing copy. <br /> <br />
