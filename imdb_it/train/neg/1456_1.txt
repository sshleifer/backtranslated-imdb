In a nutshell, this is a simplistic and one-dimensional film. The title, The Rise to Evil, should tell you that this won't try to be something profound or to do much with the character of Hitler. Rather, from the first few minutes of the film in which we see little Hitler looking wicked with the evil music playing in the background, we are given a vision of Hitler who presents him as a cartoonist superintendent, apparently torn from a Saturday morning television program. The film REALLY wants to prove that Hitler was evil but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was bad? In the end, making him a bit of a goddamn one-dimensional character is both boring and confused (one must wonder how the inept, fetish-cold character of the film ever persuaded a nation to follow him or become the man of Time's year). This film had a great opportunity to take a figure who committed some of the most horrific acts of the 20th century, and try to deepen his mind. Instead, he simply says: "Hey, Hitler was evil! I just thought you would like to know ..." again and again. The great irony is that the film has still been attacked to present a too nice view of the character. Give me a break.
