I would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it wasn't for ms. The performance by Claudine Barretto. and I will take this time to overlook that Kris Aquino is here. and end. <br /> <br /> I really avoid watching Pinoy horror films because the stories lack originality and I really think that (some) writers don't pay enough attention to the characters (and their progression) in their stories (redundant ?? ). it was as if they had "pushed" the film forward when their narration stank. and my goodness, creative exhaustion led them to snatch more films. why?? why did this movie have a good review ?? I wouldn't give it much credit. the film was KIND OF scary, but the film seemed stranger because it deals with Filipino folklore ... it enters my list of "most likely to happen" category. I just wish they spent more time improving the narrative lines and fixing those flashback sequences, it doesn't matter if the lighting was sucked in, it wouldn't be very important if the content blew you away .. SAYANG.
