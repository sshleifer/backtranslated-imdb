All you need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene, where a boy falls into a lake and is eaten. So they start pulling the headlines: see "Slugs!" in large letters, followed shortly after by "The Movie". Wow! I was worried about accidentally tuning in to "Slugs: The Musical" or "Slugs: The Game Show". However, from there the film deteriorates and becomes a killer. You see a boy cut his hand because he had bullets in his gardening glove, two people are attacked by snails while having sex, and a girl who falls on her back in an underground passage is stung by murder bullets. It is a rather stupid film, which falls into the "so bad-is-good" category. He also turned so badly with a film so grainy that you're shocked to know that it was made in 1988 (my hypothesis was in 1974). I am VERY surprised that he received the highest score he has here, because most people here do not offer any kind of love to those types of movies. But if you want a movie that tries to be scary but ends up being ridiculous, this is one of your best candidates.
