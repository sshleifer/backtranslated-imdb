After seeing KHAKEE I heard that I could see another good movie, but unfortunately the film is a joke and actually trying to present Aryeman Afterall his father Keshu is the producer <br /> <br /> RKS spoke so well of the films during the promotions, saying that the film has different flesh from the movies released that time, I wonder what movies he was talking about <br /> <br /> The film is actually a typical Masala movie with a lot of comedy, romance , all confused action <br /> <br /> The ease with which children kidnap the family, is one of the funniest parts of all time, Imagine the children who kidnap the Dawood family <br /> <br /> The end is a complete muttering with sudden characterization change <br /> <br /> RKS gives his weakest film to date, except for some Bachchan scenes the film is boring <br /> <br /> The music is boring <br /> <br /> Amitabh tries to give the role to her everything, she does her part well, even if it's not the best, even if you twist too much when you pull a trigger and make a strange look while smoking the cigar H also the dubbing is not correctly matched sometimes <br /> <br /> Akshay is there for a few minutes and he only repeats his act and his hams Aryeman seems inexpressive, he tries too much but tears him in some scenes <br /> <br /> Bhumika emerges the best of the lot <br /> <br /> The rest is fine
