Economical and manipulative. This film has no heart. <br /> <br /> It also has a terrible dialogue, unconvincing characters and an absurd, or rather non-existent, story. It moves from bad to worse in a cynical effort to snatch some kind of emotion from an insincere and non-engaging hysteric -fest! <br /> <br /> And the HEDGEHOG !!!! How many cheap shots can a movie take? The porcupine, by the way, gave the most convincing and watchable performance in this ninety-minute cringe-athon. <br /> <br /> If you've thought about watching this movie, don't do it. I'm sorry but I can't find a single redemption feature in this movie. With me he marks a big and big ZERO. Strictly for the by-products of the under-dogma. Yawneroony! <br /> <br /> However, if you liked Dancing In The Dark ... <br /> <br />
