Jeremy Northam fights against a clone script of "Total Recall" and a romantic throwaway game to give life to a confused character. Lucy Liu graduates her acting from a wooden start to a worker finish. You can't not laugh when you read his interviews on the DVD when he uses the term "Femme fatal" and "Romance". She is not a French film-noir actress and lack chemistry together. <br /> <br /> This film fails, not in the plot or in the action sequences, but in the lack of attention to detail in film photography and in the insanity representation of the world of technology that surrounds the main protagonists. Few attempts are made to dress the scenery to represent any contiguous landscape or period. Cars are very '90s and the architecture is just modern with open plans that suggest a limited budget rather than conscious dressing techniques. <br /> <br /> Technology is positively exhilarating. The massive "2001: A Space Odyssey" mainframes powered by portable CD-ROMs with data collected for some inexplicable reason, despite the proliferating communications network that even the most naive technologist of today would obviously be aware of. There is a clear lack of research done here and given the open-source nature of the cyber community, research would have cost little more than a bulletin board and personal time. <br /> <br /> DVD interviews also reveal the original the name of the film was "Company Man", but this was probably abandoned to collect the Matrix hype. The title "Cypher" has only the slightest link to the film. Terry Gilliam would have done miracles with this concept; and has completely rewritten the Decalogue. <br /> <br /> This is the quality of the Tele film and extremely disappointing for a feature film production. It may have created a good subplot for "Alias".
