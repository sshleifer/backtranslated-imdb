Where to start ... Oh yes, Message to the bad guys: When you first find the person you followed (to kill) who saw a crime you committed, don't waste time talking to her so that she still has another opportunity to escape. Message to the victim: when the thugs speak to each other and fight, take the opportunity to "run away", do not sit and watch them until you make noise. Message to the manager: if someone has an advantage of 5 or 10 minutes in a vehicle or on foot, it is not possible to have the bad guys at their heels immediately! time and movement don't work that way. It would also be nice to think that a woman should not brutally kill (4) men to authorize herself to leave a violent relationship at home.
