This film is not only boring, but it is also very badly done. The graphics are so ugly, they are not even second-rate - they are terrible. The characters do not show any facial expression, the vocal acting is empty and lacking in soul, and the plot absolutely misses ... well ... everything and nothing. At 5, I like it - but think it's a bit boring. I agree with him.
