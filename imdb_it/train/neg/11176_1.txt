I saw this movie in preview, and I can't stress enough how bad I thought this movie was. From the beginning, the public complained about the tremendous southern accent of Pacino. Poor Al looked really, really upset, and I can't decide if this was purposely part of his addictive advertising role, or maybe he didn't fall asleep before coming to the set. Much worse than the close-ups of Pacino, however, is the wretched excuse for a plot. At the beginning of the film we are given the clue that Pacino's character is gay, and I suspect that this is what the writer originally intended. Later, however, we should suspend our disbelief and believe that both Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both sleepwalkers through lame roles) desire this old, half-dead man, with an effeminate appearance with a ridiculous accent. The worst part overall was the main plot, which had to do with some corporate espionage that was never completely explained and never interested us, under any circumstances. Since this was a preview, I reserve my final judgment, due to the possibility of filming and retouching, but you can bet I won't pay a penny to see it in theaters.
