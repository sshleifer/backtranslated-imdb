Yikes. This is pretty bad. The script is not exceptional, and the decision to transfer it to the cinema does not do favors, especially because Peploe does not decide how to treat the theatrical origins of the material (we get occasional glances from an observer theater audience, etc.) and has decided to adopt a style of sober editing that aims to remind you that you are watching a movie, while in reality it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director who is overwhelmed by his material. Mira Sorvino's central performance is incredibly poor: theatrical and fanciful, as if she were playing the part through the opera Merchant Ivory by Helena Bonham-Carter. Only Fiona Shaw offers a performance of note - and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means that she is the best able to handle the material - but it is difficult to watch a film for a single performance, even if that performance is light, truthful and whole like that of Shaw. Ben Kingsley turns into a mean and disengaged turn, and Diana Rigg's daughter, Rachel Stirling, plays her supporting role just like this. Unfortunately, none of Bertolucci's magic has been erased by his wife if this film were to be the proof.
