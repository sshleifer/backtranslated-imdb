From the beginning of the film I had the feeling that it was a film about another Jason on Friday 13. And it's ... Dispute that the film starts interesting. But like the times goes by it's just a useless film about the silent, supernatural, silent serial killer. I mean he goes under the boy's bed without making any sound, not seen by anyone. He had to be blind after the failed execution, but he walks and kills people like he did. I'm tired of it. It's all the same to me. <br /> <br /> In other words - unreal. Too many mistakes and confusing information. <br /> <br /> The scene with the trendy woman was impressive, but only for the first time:} For that and for intriguing intro 2 stars.
