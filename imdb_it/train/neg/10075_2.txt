I'm sorry, but even TJ Hooker's Adrian Zmed couldn't save this sequel. I went through half of the film thinking it was a parody of the original. Then came that scene of wild and extravagant motion (note that this is the only film directed by Patricia Birch); and I realized sadly that they were trying to be serious. I was shaken by the fact that the opposing band, having lost the "wheels" due to their gambling habits in the original Grease, was forced to use the bikes in the second movie. Being ashamed by Carrington's putz character, I'd hate to see what to do later: maybe mopeds? <br /> <br /> I also never bought the chopped theme: hunky-Australian-boy-can't-in-out-outsider-dominated-school-ergo-goes-for-laughing-boy-with-stupid biker-helmet-look. The history of Disney has gone terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> So, it looks like you can ruin a good thing by putting a bubble-gum that pops Michelle Pfeiffer into a musical. The only thing I removed from this film was the idea of ​​how many points out of ten have succeeded.
