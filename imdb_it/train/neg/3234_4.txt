Well, how do you rate a movie like this? Does it really have cinematic value? It is a film that tries to get as close as possible to a snuff movie. Basically the whole movie is purely a group of guys torturing a girl. It is not very tempting and moreover it is not so realistic. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the film has tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible. However, the film is too fake to make it work as expected. The slap and the stock are all soft and fake, besides looking. Often they just kick the floor, rather than the girl, of course. Even the way the girl responds to all the torments is quite meek. I mean if it was real, surely he would have screamed it. There are more moans that scream in this though. <br /> <br /> The film is obviously low on budget and is a valiant attempt to try to get something shocking and realistic as well as original and provocative, with very limited resources. I don't really think that this film had a noticeable impact at the time of release, although it must have done something good, since a total of six sequels were released after this. <br /> <br /> Fan of shock and most likely the gore will be disappointed with this movie, although there are still some fetish people out there who will kick themselves out of this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
