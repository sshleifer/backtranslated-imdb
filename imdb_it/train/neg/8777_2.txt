Ok, I struggled to put aside the fact that selling EVP as true the movie was practically lying to me from the beginning. I reasoned in hell, I don't believe in vampires, but I've always liked Dracula, so I could live with that. <br /> <br /> However, even if accepted, the film is not very good. It is done and acted competently, but in reality it does not catch you at all. There are several "jumping" moments, and I just looked at them and thought "yes, I didn't expect it" without skipping a little. <br /> <br /> Even the resolution doesn't make sense. If the strength behind this is able to do the things it seems to be, then why the hell does it need to use a proxy? Furthermore, the caption was absurd. Obviously they put it there as part of the "credibility of the film claiming it's all true", but to make it work it must really be at the beginning. But they can't put it at first because then they leave the plot ... attacking it eventually made it stick out like a sore thumb.
