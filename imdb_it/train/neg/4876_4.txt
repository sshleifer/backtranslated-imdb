... when he redid the Broadway BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950). The recasting of Bing Crosby in the role of DAN BROOKS did not help a script that was "dated" in 34 let alone 50. This sad film has entire scenes raised from the original with many of the supporting casts repeating their roles, unless they were not dead. Although being older does not seem to matter to the Director. Nor that the cars and clothes in the 1934 bottom slabs did not seem up to the standards of the 1950s. Not even the song of 'der Bingel' can redeem this effort. <br /> <br /> We reviewed both the original and the IMDb Four **** Stars remake. Frank's touch had long since disappeared and all that was left was CAPRA-CORN. But he did not stop Mr. Capra. After destroying the 50s with some educational documentaries, he ended his career in remaking LADY FOR A DAY (1933) as POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (1961). Once again a refined cast was disappointed on that of IMDb Six ****** Star compared to the original Eight ******** Stars. Sometimes it is better to stop while you were still ahead, immediately after STATE OF THE UNION (1948).
