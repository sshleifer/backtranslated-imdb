Before this release, Neil LaBute said this on the 1973 original: "It's surprising how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack." I'm like, come on! Maybe you won't like the new one, but if it's your favorite soundtrack, I don't know if I * want * you like my movie ". <br /> <br /> Neil, a word. You might want to sit down for that too; as Lord Summerisle says, the shocks are absorbed much better with the knees bent in. See, Neil, the thing about the original, is that the soundtrack by Paul Giovanni is one of the most famous things about it: the directors themselves consider it a musical virtual. Together with Richard, Danny Thompson and Bert Jansch, he practically started the Folk New Wave of the 1970s. Finding out is like imagining Jaws without John Williams, or The Buddy Holly Story without Buddy Holly. incredible and extravagant remakes of a British cult classic from Get Carter by Sly Stallone. <br /> <br /> The original seemed to have left Nicolas Cage "disturbed for about two weeks", so upset, during the window of fifteen days , which launched the idea of re-imagining one of the most nuanced films on the interreligious struggle ever conceived for a writer-director previously known for his completely male and sexist depictions. It's like a parlor game: what would you get if Sam Peckinpah hired Bambi? O Gaspar "Irreversible" Noe actually made love again? (Actually, I'd love to see it). Unfortunately someone has taken this parlor game seriously: all that LaBute has managed to do is tear the bowels of the original while killing it with its personal and stupid concerns about the Sex War. <br /> <br /> After failing to save a girl and her mother from a fatal car accident, Cage's police officer turns into a medicated slumber. Then he receives a letter from ex-girlfriend Willow Woodward (this exchanges for compliments), does he now live in the private community of Summersisle ?? that 'extra' stands for 'superfluous' ?? and he wants Edward to help locate his missing Rowan daughter. <br /> <br /> Summersisle, shines through, is an articulation dominated by women, conceived as a refuge for oppressed women and refugees from the Salem witch trials. Here, the matriarchs observe the ways of the Ancients, and the few males are mutes of an almost mute breed. It's like the large-scale Lilith Fair. The main export of Summersisle is honey ?? a symbolic and literal headache for Edward, as he is allergic to bees. "Beekeepers!" crying Edward. "They seem to be everywhere on this island!" Well, it's probably because the main export of Summersisle is honey. <br /> <br /> While investigating, Edward overhears an upcoming Mayday ritual called "the hour of death and rebirth". He finds out that the previous year's harvest has failed; almost dies from bee stings; and finally comes to the conclusion (a conclusion that, obviously, could not be more evident if the locals had tattooed a calendar of events on the backs of their hands) that the Rowan would have been burned alive in a pagan ritual to ensure an abundant harvest. He also meets the queen Ape of the hive, Sister Summersisle (Burstyn), who has his plans to involve the homonymous wicker man: "The drone must die". <br /> <br /> Firstly, the good news: any worries that Cage will be flown by Wicker's flaming man at the last minute by a fleet of black CIA helicopters can be put to rest: toasts. That's all for the good news. "This is a story whose chapters have been carefully written" intones Burstyn with sublime irony. While maintaining the basic premise of the cat and the mouse (and the credit typography), what has left the original subjects to a policy of scorched earth. <br /> <br /> The original script of Crucial to Shaffer was that of his Christian copper, according to ritual, did he come to the island of his own volition ?? and, more importantly, she was a virgin; the perfect sacrifice. In reducing issues to a struggle for sexual power, unlike the religious one, LaBute presents the weakest qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice. When Cage found out he was the bait, you didn't care less. <br /> <br /> And Cage is one of the worst things about this; a heavy and drawling donkey ?? an arsewit whose tongue seems slightly too big for his mouth. "Damn" he complains after hallucinating a drowned Rowan, with all the mental torments of a man who set his morning alarm half an hour too soon. It is hoped that his character's appeal to the pills that have reduced him to this state is frequent? alternately tired, so full of vim preppy, overbearing. If so, it is a beautiful portrait of an undisputed IQ submerged in antidepressants. Otherwise ?? he can't stand thinking. Like Willow, Beahan with the eyes on the saucer is equally terrible, presenting his lines as if he were competing with Cage for the most disgusting delivery. While Burstyn completely misses the mercurial threat to convince. Who's afraid of Naomi Wolf? <br /> <br /> Any element that made the great original ?? the lovingly detailed representations of popular customs, the ingenious soundtrack, the (majestic "The Lord did it splendidly!" dialogue has been replaced with the less attractive "you did it excellently!" Whoah, friend!) ?? they have been replaced by a tortuous bustle of sex battles with occasional blows to the wall. Namely, hardened women; this is a blow from LaBute, after all. Cage's assault by Sage Beech is just one of the most embarrassing episodes; powerless little men will play happily for how those hippie kids finally got what was about to happen, hyuk hyuk. The final queue sees the whole rotten mess collapse under the weight of the clich√© genre: in a bar, two boys come across a couple of Summersisle virgins on leave from the ground, fishing for flirty for fresh martyrs. At the time of their successful pick-up, you expect women to turn around and make an exaggerated wink and a thumb up at the camera. <br /> <br /> Another thing: acute credit observers may have noticed that films showing unusually high numbers of producers (anything up to 10) tend to be not very cop. The Wicker Man has 18 producers in total.
