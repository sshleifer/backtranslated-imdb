Honestly, this is easily in the top 5 of the worst movies I've ever seen. In part, because he takes himself so seriously, in contrast to the normal light junk, this film wants you to be emotionally involved, to feel for the characters and to worry about the alleged conspiracy. None of this ever comes close to the event. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER MILD ****** <br /> <br /> There are 3 main reasons why this movie is so terrible: 1.) Incoherent and totally non-sensory plot . 2.) Annoying "MTV" style camera over substance. 3.) Moral characters and holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> Allow me to elaborate. <br /> <br /> 1. Apparently, when these films were made, they could not decide whether to make a film about ecclesiastical conspiracies, stigmata or possession. So guess what? They have combined them! An atheist is possessed by a dead person, who then exposes her to the stigmata to expose an ecclesiastical conspiracy. How a normal person is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary is never explained or even discussed. Now, instead of saying what he wants to say, he gives her the Stigmata. WHY? Why not spit it out? Instead, we deal with screaming scenes of harsh voices, cutting out cryptic messages on machines and writing messages on the walls. Apparently this priest was also a violent boy, because even the possessed young woman masquerades as one of the characters, while speaking with that harsh, "possessed" voice that we all have heard countless times. This too begins to bind to my second complaint, because whenever the young woman receives the stigmata, she also challenges the laws of gravity by floating in the air, and throwing everything and everyone around her as if they were in an earthquake? Why does it happen? Who knows!?! My hypothesis is that the director thought he was "cool". <br /> <br /> 2.) This film contains dozens of slow-motion shots, of course, of birds popping out of nowhere and flying away, and the most annoying, of dripping water. This woman's apartment is constantly dripping water! CONSTANTLY! Logically, the place would probably have collapsed with this many holes. To sum up this complaint, towards the end, and for absolutely no reason, the camera cuts with water dripping, in slow motion, on the contrary !! WHY!?! I have no idea! It has no relevance for anything and, once again, I bet it's because the director thought it was "cool". <br /> <br /> 3.) One of the main characters says he became a priest to explain holes in science. This makes no sense to me. I would think that going to church would be enough, but no, it has to go through the whole set to become a priest. I just don't buy it. Secondly, there are a lot of holes in the plot, some of which I'll go into later. For beginners, when he first receives stigmata, the scene ends with her lying unconscious, bleeding. Later, he is in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? Another is towards the end, when the previously mentioned "scientific priest" character is speaking to the spirit who is possessing the girl. He says: "Take me as your messenger!" Not a word by word, but you have the idea. His answer? "You have no faith, only doubt!" So for this, he has an aetheist! An aetist has no faith, much less than any scientific priest! And then, there is the fact that the object of the conspiracy of this film, this Lost Gospel (by San Tommaso, I believe) is available in local bookstores. The characters are willing to kill to suppress this document, but you could go to a book store and buy it. Perhaps this should happen in an alternative story, in which it is not very well known, but the film never tries to tell us, or even suggest that it is an alternative event of the discovery of that document. <br /> <br /> In closing, this film is terribly spectacular. He is my archenemy, I feel the need to insult every chance I get. I hate it. Final grade: F
