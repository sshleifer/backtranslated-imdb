What a terrible movie. He sucked. It was terrible. I don't know what to say about this movie, but DinoCrap, which I stole from some reviewer with a nail in the ass. AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sigh .. It's not Roger Corman that I hate, it's a terrible movie. Well, really? But what can you expect from a Homoeric movie with computer graphics? Which is another thing, the CGI sucked noisily; I hate this movie terribly. This is undoubtedly the worst Roger Corman B-Movie, and probably also the most gay B-Movie. It's --- it's --- DINOCRAP! I'm sorry, I must have offended some nerds in these moments. It's just a terrible movie ... 0 / 1,000
