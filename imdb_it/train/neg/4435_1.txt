Gods, I haven't seen such a horrible film in a long time. Maybe not from "The New Guy" or various films by Freddie Prinze Jr. Yes, it's incredibly terrible. Mira Sorvino's white and wood acting must surely have been inspired by Freddie. The staging of the film was embarrassing (like a comedy, rather, and that feeling of confinement does NOT work well on the film). The actors had no idea what they were doing, especially Sorvino. His accent was horrible and his sex appeal was non-existent, so it was painful to see his "seductive" characters and "fall" for it. And what was it with the occidental shots of a live audience on deck chairs? Incomprehensible! I had to turn off the DVD player, it would have been a pain inflicted to finish this film.
