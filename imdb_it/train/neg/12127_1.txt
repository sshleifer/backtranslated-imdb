Sorry Fulci fans, but I couldn't get over this. The soundtrack was as annoying as they were, the acting was childish, the story was over and the direction was non-existent. <br /> <br /> The massacre honestly looked like a children's movie. But I've seen some of these, and they actually look better than this! It seems to have been so underfunded that they couldn't afford ... NOTHING! Not a director of photography, not a director, no one who even remotely had any idea what acting was like. It was a very poor cinema experience; one of my worst. <br /> <br /> This was the worst party I've ever seen, alongside Terror Toons, which is second only to the Killer Klowns of Outer Space. I have nothing else to say about it. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 0.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
