Imagine that the real Hitler, who was a master of propaganda and speech, would have been a murmuring idiot like Carlyle played in this film. No one would follow him, not even a desperate, unemployed boy in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> This is just a piece of Hollywood cardboard propaganda, disguised as a "true story". <br /> <br /> Too bad for everyone who really believed in something about this show. Carlyle and the producers have not understood any of this. <br /> <br /> Why was Hitler able to win so many people, an entire county for his ideas if we were such a sausage? Why did people follow him to death? Considering him a real loser, they make their film absolutely incredible. This film is a mixture of the old World War II propaganda and MTV's urban myths about one of the most important people of the last century. Imagine a film about Churchill in which the director only shows him as a drunkard for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This film is a disgrace and I wonder how they can talk about an actor like Carlyle in this madness.
