I have to admit that this "re-imagination" of the original 1968 film was a huge disappointment. Especially when you consider that this is a Tim Burton film. He is certainly one of the most original and, I might say, cool Hollywood directors. <br /> <br /> Personally I'm a big fan of his work, but obviously something went wrong with his latest film, The Planet of the Apes. I really liked the original film. When people came out for the first time, they only expected another Cheezie sci-fi movie from the 70s, but a real surprise showed totally that the theory was wrong. He really had a clear message. An obvious anti-war message. The fear of the cold war, where the world was taking place and the fear of the use of nuclear weapons played an important role in the minds of the directors. These reasons meant that the film was above all expectations and became an instant classic. Even if the new film, the "re-do" or whatever, leaves us with nothing. No message, no ideal behind it. It's just another successful summer hit. <br /> <br /> Tim Burton visually does not disappoint you. The dark and gruesome settings were excellent and, of course, the make-up was exceptional. <br /> <br /> Obviously it's not enough to get people into a movie. There must be an exciting storyline or plot. In this film the plot is very uninteresting and is extremely ill-conceived. The script is very lame and full of gaps. It seems that this film was written in great haste. The explanation of why the monkeys where they were there, and why the ruled planet was indeed very stupid, demonstrated the ignorance of the writers. <br /> <br /> He raised a lot of questions, to which no reasonable answers were given. <br /> <br /> For example; Why do monkeys speak English? Because on the planet there were other species of monkeys that apes (since there were only chimpanzees in the spaceship that crashed on the planet) Where the hell were all those humans coming from? How some chimpanzees have managed to evolve into a huge surge of all types of monkeys in a few thousand years. (I mean it took a couple of million years for us to evolve from ape to a man!) <br /> <br /> And finally, the nasty surprise ending was just plain dumb. He was probably thrown just because the original film had such an end, so they felt that the public expected the same kind of ending. The ending also raises many questions, which I know, I have no intelligent answers. Did Theid learn to work on the spaceship ?, which was without energy, and learned to go back in time and take over the land alone ?, and, what did it do, breed with all women? And let's say it will happen, I strongly doubt that the story will remain the same, as if Washington were built exactly as it is today! (I mean, won't there be a huge banana instead of the memorial?) <br /> <br /> Well, just to say something positive about the film. Some of the casts were fantastic. The character of Helen Bonham Carter was interesting and well acted, as for Tim Roth as Theid. He was very good, a little exaggerated in some parts of the film. Michael Clark Duncan was fine too. I was not happy with Marc Whalberg. He's not very actor, and he plays a very macho color-macho character here. Very unparalleled and is nothing compared to the character of Hestons in the original. And the main female character had no reason or place in the film. It had just been chosen for the look. I hardly said a word throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Well, I think that in the future, when people think of Planet of the Apes, they will think of the original one. The last one will soon be forgotten.
