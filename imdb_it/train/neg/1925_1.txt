Did Ron Howard direct this? The 1966 cartoon is fascinating, teaching children a simple lesson using a simple plot. In this film, Howard gives us a Whoville full of greedy, manipulative, self-centered Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I guess the script required the worst person imaginable, so Carrey channeled Tom Green and the result is a magical movie. Just like Danny Devito's Penguin in Batman Returns, Carrey's Grinch is so utterly unlikely that any degree of comedy that could be extracted from his character simply evaporates. Where the 1966 cartoon showed a Grinch with which we all identify, Carrey's Grinch is that angry and soulless old man we all saw sometime, sitting in a parked car muttering to himself or stumbling children at the supermarket with his stick. This Grinch is completely devoid of any degree of humanity, humor or insight whatsoever, and his redemption at the end of the film sounds false. The whole movie sounds fake: there is some stupid Christmas light contest, a failed attempt to explain why the Grinch is such an idiot digging in his childhood, and an indecipherable mystery about why some of the Whos have that strange extension of the lips and some of them no. Unlike the 1966 comic, I imagine that children would find this film boring, irritating and full of contradictory messages. Did we really have to see Slutty Smurf, aka Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? Furthermore, Ron Howard has filled the cast with his relatives without talent. Throw the required jokes, joke jokes, sex jokes and other obligatory low-charismatic humor, and you have a film that is further away from George W. Bush's 1966 cartoon (or the book that inspired him) rational thinking , glossy. Thumbs down on this big fat turkey.
