Where to start, there is so wrong and horrible in this film that I don't know where to start. Ok, the two stooges who wrote this process. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton, in the first place could not invent their so-called minds for a name. I think they split the difference, that's why the main title is BRAIN THAT YOU DON'T MOVE, but the final screen says HEAD THAT IT DON'T MOVE. Neither of them knows anything about the medical profession. After all, the doctors swear to "do no harm". Killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered "harmful". Also, a small thing called blood and tissue correspondence. The refusal would mean Jan's death in the pan. Plus whoever keeps a working patch monster. Which medical school did Bill, FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY graduate? Old FU or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster had no name, which bothered me. Also, doesn't the brilliant surgeon Doctor Bill Cortner know how to keep a patient sedated? All in all a film disaster, it's incredibly stupid and unwatchable, except on MST3K. I give him the TURKEY THAT THANKS.
