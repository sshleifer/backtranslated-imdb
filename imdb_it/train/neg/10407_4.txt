I found Tremors 4: The Legend Begins, to be boring and boring. All the action scenes were stupid. The so-called "GRABOIDS" are reduced to the size of a modern domestic cat, if not smaller. The acting was horrendous, and this film was just an unnecessary film in the Tremor saga, because even though it tells the story of how graboids were formed, the plot is so stupid and useless. Also, if you want to tell a story back in time, make sure you use SAME ACTOR (Michael Gross), to be someone in the past, when someone is present in other Tremor films. Geez ... If you haven't seen this movie, don't waste your time. Stick to Tremors, 1, 2 and 3, for a good time. However, make sure the remote is sitting right next to you with the button. STOP that works for a quick withdrawal away from this nonsense.
