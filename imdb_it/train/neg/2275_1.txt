A remake of Abre los Ojos by Alejandro Amenabar, but this time with a living and breathing mask as the protagonist. For the dubious advantage of an English soundtrack, we endure the soulless performance of Tom Cruise, as usual, without depth. Yes, the character is identified with his person, but we are usually given a character below that to maintain our interest. His empty posture denies any erotic energy that may have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz. There is an acting exercise that involves the use of masks to free the actor to enrich his presentation of the character through the verbal body and the body language means. Cruise's masking only painfully emphasizes his inadequacy as an actor. See the original 1997 Amenabar Open Your Eyes!
