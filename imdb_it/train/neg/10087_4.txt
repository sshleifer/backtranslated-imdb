This is probably the first entry in the detective series "Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keat"; in later O'Leary films, he was played by much younger actors than Guy Kibbee. <br /> <br /> A group of relatives (all played by well-known actors) gather in an old house (on a rainy night, of course!) to talk to a wealthy relative who goes into a coma. <br /> <br /> While waiting for him to recover, all sorts of mysterious events happen, including a couple of murders. <br /> <br /> A disturbing film; worth seeing!
