I just finished watching, I can't say I was impressed. <br /> <br /> It starts quite well, the image and the atmosphere give a disturbing feeling as this type of film should be. But it all ends when Lordi's first monster appears. Not only do you recognize them from the gross band, but they are seriously misplaced in the film. Doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings are so 80s. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it starts as similar horror movies, people trapped in a hell hole. But there is no clear story about why and what is happening. The viewer has launched some lines on possible motives, but the lines never meet and end up in all but a disaster. <br /> <br /> With all the money spent on this film, with an intriguing start and some good effects, I thought someone would take better care of the product. I wonder if Lordi made this film just to show that their show costumes could be scary (except they aren't). <br /> <br /> So the film becomes credible for the images, I guess the money has to go somewhere. But the rest is an embarrassing attempt by a rock band to make their aliases of scary monsters on stage.
