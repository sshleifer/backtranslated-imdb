A serial killer dies in a snowstorm and is turned into the evil twin of Frosty the Snowman. So keep on partying. Interesting plot It looks scary. And it's scary. If you are five. Otherwise, it's a kind of cheese. I saw it on cable and I'm glad I didn't pay to see it. It has all the charm and style of a low-budget film that could become a cult film. I'm sure he has a loyal fan base somewhere. I'm not here. Although I didn't like the film as a whole, there were some scenes that I found funny. Like the bathtub scene and the post-explosion scene with the reference Picasso. It was also fun to watch the many ways heroes try to kill Jack and he doesn't seem to want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good low-budget B-movie comedy, but a bad low-budget horror movie.
