Although nothing can be compared to Vampires vs. Zombies ... in every realm of cinema I will try to judge this film. <br /> <br /> First of all, the special effects were breathtaking. When there was an explosion on the TV screen I thought that my whole house would explode, and when automatic machine guns were fired I thought the bullets were landing on the floor right next to me. Simply amazing my friends. <br /> <br /> But the scene where the black jack looks like the worst monologue I've ever heard has almost killed me, but don't worry since it became the movie it can pass its terrible acting in "I have to be high ". Seriously, he must have looked at himself without thinking about chatting about non-congruent thoughts that make absolutely no sense and just added that he must be "tall" to justify his horrible acting. Well, if you can say that to excuse the terrible acting, if you talked to writers, directors, executive producers, sponsors, you will probably have the same answer ... seriously. <br /> <br /> With a production team called "Shock-o-rama" I was shocked that I didn't put a shotgun in my mouth and I ended my life after this terribly terrible excuse for a film it was played. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, then you should be killed <br /> <br /> Yours faithfully, <br /> <br /> The General
