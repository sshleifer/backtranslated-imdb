Really, I can't believe I spent $ 5 on this movie. I'm a big zombie fanatic and I thought the movie couldn't be that bad. He had zombies, right? I was wrong! To be honest, the film had moments ... I thought it was nice when the boy got his head screwed, but it was all about it. Overall, I think it would be more fun to slide a lobster-shaped slide down my naked peanut into a vat of vinegar and then watch this movie again. The film could have been better if we could see some tits but I had to watch the trailers for the other films produced by this company to see it. Attention to the buyer ... unless you are a masochism.
