LOL! It's not a bad way to start it. I thought it was original, but then I discovered it was a clone of the 1976 KING KONG remake. I've never seen KING KONG until the age of 15. I saw this movie when I was 9 years old. The film's disco-funky music will remain etched in your head! Not to mention the soundtrack of the film of the Jews. This is the worst creature effect I've ever seen. At the same time, this film remains a holy grail of B-movies. Memorable quotes: "Take a tranquilizer and go to bed". "Put the Yeti in your tank and you have the power of the Yeti." I remember seeing this movie on MOVIE MACRABE hosted by Elvira. There is a scene where he was like KING KONG in reverse! A KING KONG grabs the girl and goes up to the building, but in this film the building goes up and grabs the girl (who was falling)! Also around that year there was another clone of KONG, MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977), from Hong Kong. There are many opaque traveling scenes and motorized body parts. This movie will make you laugh. It's like I said, just another KING KONG clone. PG rating for violence, language, thematic elements and scary scenes.
