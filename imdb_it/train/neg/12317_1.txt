I'm sorry for the fans of this movie, but it's the worst thing I've ever seen. Slow, misinterpreted and misinterpreted is a film that tries to escape the dead rhombuses of recent years and failing! McDonald and Parker seem incapable of transmitting real emotions and are lifeless. They seem to be in this for the paid checks they receive and not because they thought it was a good idea. The plot is DULL !! i love big chick movies as much as the next girl and this is not one !! If you avoid a movie this year ... let it be
