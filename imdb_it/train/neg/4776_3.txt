I had to write a review of this film after reading another comment saying that this is Sidney Poitier's best film. Poitier had just returned from over a decade of break in film acting and is clearly creaky here. 11 of his films are mentioned in Wikipedia and do not include this. 5 of his films are on the AFI list of the 100 best inspiring films, also in this case, excluding this. Berenger and Poitier, rube and city slicker decided to hunt down a dangerous psychopath before crossing the border into Canada. Some of the comedy attempts in this film clearly fail and the connection between Berenger and Poitier is cringeworthy and embarrassing (not helped by a completely bland script). Kirstie Alley (hostage) was underutilized and almost completely ignored when he was on screen. Some suspense attempts are made, for example when trying to guess which of the 5 men on a fishing trip is the murderer (all are cast-type villains). I understand that this is the whole appeal to most fans out there. I guessed who he was and I wasn't really trying hard. <br /> <br /> If you are a Berenger fan, look at the Sniper (1993), you can even see Billy Zane start playing his stuff. It is much better. All in all I would give Shoot to Kill 3/10. It's not bold, and it's just too simple for me.
