Doris Day never lets a bad script make her fall. Even in the most difficult situations, Day gives 100% and usually comes out unscathed. This comedy, perhaps inspired by a black-out in real life in New York in 1965, but actually adapted to a French drama by Claude Magnier from the late 1950s, gives Doris little to do but ruin his image with good luck and, in the second half, being comically sedated (which is fun because of the spin Day that gives the situation). There are some funny lines here, yet the seasonality of the material has obviously been transferred from the game ... and instead of evoking some funny episodes inside the Big Apple, we remain stuck in the suburbs. The co-stars of Doris (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse and Terry-Thomas) are not very suitable for her, nor is the shapeless hairstyle that made them wear. However, it is not terrible, it presents some great laughs and for Day lovers it is a must see. ** from ****
