I think the biggest failure of something can be boring. Bad is actually better than boring. This thing has no breath. It has the interesting fact of taking place in Cambodia. How many American films made in the 1930s take place in Cambodia. However, the conflict is a bit difficult to understand. Even the troop movements are a bit confused. What drags him to a resounding arrest is the love story. Because those two guys are so totally paralyzed by the dippy blonde I don't know. I thought he should continue to use his Zombies (like them) and forget everything about her. The film simply follows. The perfect microcosm is where one of the main characters follows a Cambodian priest through the water to reach the secret place where hieroglyphics (or whatever) are kept explaining how to turn people into zombies. I thought they would never get there. A boy takes two steps. He stops. You look around. The other boy hides behind some columns. He takes two steps. He stops. You look around. The other guy is hiding behind some bushes. This is the film in a nutshell. Then there is bad acting and insipid dialogue. Actually I have a lot of patience when it comes to movie B. This is unbearable. By the way, a more suitable title would be Revolt of the Hypnotized.
