I have always said that some comedies by their very nature cannot be translated into films, and this is a fine example. <br /> <br /> As a drama, this is a very funny satire farce of the Catholic church, with a witty razor and a central character that is so incredibly unreal that we have to cheer for her even when she starts killing her parishioners ( one of whom made the fatal mistake of admitting that he hadn't sinned since his last confession, so she feels she's sending him straight to the sky). <br /> <br /> This is just an example of how far the show is outside reality, and in making the theater world believe it works. However, that kind of intensified reality rarely works on the film, and certainly not here. Director Marshall Brickman has assembled a fine cast that does a great job, but by presenting all this nonsense in a realistic world fashion becomes a tragedy and you are left with an empty feeling in your stomach. <br /> <br /> Look for a production of the theatrical performance instead, you will not be disappointed.
