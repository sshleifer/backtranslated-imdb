What will they do now? <br /> <br /> Does it sound familiar? <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a combination of the acting workshop, the "indie" film and the theater. <br /> <br /> It is the kind of thing that actors love - it's a bit like a seminar or a play, because it consists mainly of focusing on the actors who act ... behaving in an angry, tense way, scared, conversing, planning, planning - giving the actors a lot of free space to kill it all. <br /> <br /> A trio of scammers, a leader, a goon, a brother, devises a grand robbery plan. .. and a wrench is thrown into the works. Finally, there is a bit of "fender" and one of the criminals in the middle of the back of the windshield. <br /> <br /> The cops are queuing and stumbling into a poetically (and leadenly) called "Dino's Last Chance." <br /> <br /> Spacey, as a director, tries to keep the focus on the performance of the actors and the distribution of the dialouge. He approaches a bright red cigarette of steaming and steaming Bogart passion. And it keeps all the violence off the screen, really. <br /> <br /> I think it was a mistake. Focusing on intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the film some advantage. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that it moves too slowly and suffers from discrepancies in almost all roles. Matt Dillon ("Drugstore Cowboy" and "Wild Things") seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang. <br /> <br /> Gary Sinese seems to be thoughtful and thoughtful to be a backbone tag with these guys and Joe Mantaga is as effective as the traditional mad lieutenant police officer who does all the thumbs, but is given nothing for really do it here. <br /> <br /> William Fischter is the only actor who is credible in his role as a brainless grunt that just wants to shed blood. <br /> <br /> And the criminals are in a situation of tension in which they go to prison or try to think of a way out of this. <br /> <br /> Spacey does not have the capacity to create a lot of tension and move on. The characters mostly chat, try to think of a plan ... and they must be calm and too articulate. There is also a scene where criminals play billiards with a whole swarm of armed policemen right outside, ready to strike. At one point, one of the criminals also calls the police who are right outside the bar. Oh brother. Oh, that bother. <br /> <br /> These policemen will leave or send them away or block them. Shouldn't the crooks be a little scared, a little uncomfortable? Meanwhile, all the real action is happening inside. <br /> <br /> Someone pulls out a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to a nasty confrontation off the screen and there is another victim who happens to be ... well, sad enough. But ... <br /> <br /> Even Faye Dunaway would have had to spend more time with a dialectal trainer, improving her New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich is fine in a smaller part. <br /> <br /> A policeman listening for a pack of games at the absolute worst time is good looking. And so it is a scene where someone passes through the rear windshield. <br /> <br /> The dialouge is obviously looking for a David Mamet approach and is profane but never realistic or insightful. <br /> <br /> The film seems too much of what it really is ... a really low budget film with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that "is not bad, but has need a little more rewriting ". Spacey shows that he is not a terrible director, but he lacks some sort of feeling for "shaping a film" and he seems to be filming only actors. <br /> <br /> These actors are all talented and could work with the material, but they all feel out of place. As I said before, the film really suffers from disasters. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that wrong actors have been chosen. I think they found the right cast, but they put them in all the wrong roles. I think changing some of the roles would have helped immensely. <br /> <br /> The veteran actor Joe Mantagna plays the group leader, Gary Sinese as the police lieutenant angry out on his megaphone who gives orders and barks at his troops, keeping Fischter in his "thirsty for blood "and Matt Dillion as the sacrificial lamb. It would have been a great improvement. <br /> <br /> When some actors direct, it works. They can even win Oscars for this. But very often, when actors direct, they tend to focus only on performances. Just turn the actors acting. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it works ... but they need a good showcase for this. An excuse for this. <br /> <br /> The hostage situations are practically the same in real life, just like the growth stories, so it is natural that even the films on them go from point A to point B. <br /> <br /> There are some really great voices in this genre. "Spacey himself appeared in a similar film about hostage situations:" The Negotiator ". <br /> <br /> This certainly won't become a cult classic, let alone one of AFI's 100. However, it has some good moments and personal touches, but in the end, it is immediately forgettable and the kind of film that would sound best on normal TV. It is not worth going out of your way to see. <br /> <br /> Give a 3 up 10. <br /> <br /> Spacey's other directorial credit, "Beyond The Sea" was reported to be a better effort. Hmmm ... maybe it's true. You must fail before you succeed. <br /> < br /> by Dane Youssef
