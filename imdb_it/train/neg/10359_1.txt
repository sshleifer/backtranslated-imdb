The series of books "Wrinkle in Time" is my favorite series since childhood. I have read and reread more times than I can count in the last 35 years. The characters, with all their virtues and flaws, are close and dear to my heart. This adaptation contained very few wonderful, magical and spiritual stories that I love so much. To say that I was disappointed in this film would have been an understatement. <br /> <br /> If you've never read the book (s), I guess you'll like the movie. Acting is acceptable, special effects are well made for a TV movie, and the story is interesting. However, if you love books, avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I found this statement on the novel's Wikipedia page: "In an interview with Newsweek, L'Engle said of the film," I expected it to go wrong, and that's it. " > <br /> I, like another reviewer here, feel the need to read the book again to dispel this film from my mind.
