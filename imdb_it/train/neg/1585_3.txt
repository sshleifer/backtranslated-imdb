::: SPOILER ALERT ::: <br /> <br /> Soooo, Arnie is really a good guy, but after an accident with some helicopter fights and some disobedience to orders, he is sent to prison (or rather a kind of field of work). He escapes, but after a while he is captured once more. This time he ends up in a bizarre reality show where he should run for a while by a bunch of tough guys with different themes, and eventually die. But we all know Arnie, and we all know he's harder than the toughest. <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie so much, being a fan of Arnie and all that. However, "The Running Man" contains too many flaws that really annoy me. For example. The reconstruction of Arnie's struggle inside the helicopter, where the shocked public shows a brief summary of the accident, complete with 5-10 different angles of shooting. This means that the military helicopter in which Arnie was flying was equipped with nearly 10 cameras that shot crew members, one of which is the eye of one of the crew members Arnie beats. <br /> <br /> There are also other flaws, and the plot, which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative, works for a while, then creates a pool of stupidity and unrealism in which it drowns. <br /> <br /> Acting can't really be said to be something better than sub par, with Arnie in the lead role, doing an average performance of Arnie. The rest of the cast goes on without being particularly good or bad. <br /> <br /> The special effects are OK, without being impressive. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3/10
