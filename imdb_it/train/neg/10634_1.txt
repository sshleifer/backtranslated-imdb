The writer / director Bart Sibrel bases his work on a can of film which, according to him, was transmitted to him by mistake by NASA. He says he shows astronauts simulating television footage of their trip to the moon using camera tricks. The astronauts were in orbit around the Earth all the time, and the editors on the ground composed this raw footage in a few seconds of finished film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sibrel's research has slipped so much that he is not aware of her. The "backstage" film is largely taken from the 30-minute live television broadcast (even on that reel) that was seen by millions of people, not hidden in NASA's stores as suggested. And we have to ask ourselves why Sibrel puts his own conspiracy narrative on the audio of the astronauts in the movie, because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly explains that the astronauts were just testing the camera, not faking footage. <br /> <br /> Finally, anyone can see the movie for themselves without having to buy the hacked version of Sibrel. (He shows you more of Zapruder's film about the murder of JFK than his "smoking gun".) Sibrel thinks he's the only one to see it. What is most revealing are the clips taken from that rough movie that Sibrel chose NOT to use, such as those that clearly show the Earth appropriately distant eclipsed by the window frames and so on, destroying its claim that mats and transparencies have been placed in the windows of the spaceship to create the illusion of a distant Earth. <br /> <br /> As with most films of this type, Sibrel relies on insinuations, inexperienced hypotheses, misleading comments and selective quotations to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of evidence real.
