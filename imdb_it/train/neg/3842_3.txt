Our teacher showed us this film in first grade. I haven't seen it since I just saw the trailer though. Does it look like a top quality movie? I don't think so. I was so horrified by this movie, I could barely look at it. It was mostly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with the ketchup! I've been crazy about this movie. Today, at 20, I probably wouldn't feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe little kids shouldn't see this movie, even if it's PG. Be aware of the possible results of showing this to children. I don't even remember what it was, once it was enough!
