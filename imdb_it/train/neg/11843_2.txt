Just because an event really happened doesn't mean it will make a good script / film. The Cat's Meow, by Peter Bogdanovich, claims to be based on real events that happened on a cruise hosted by William Randolph Hurst. The writer paid more attention to creating a cast of bizarre characters than to take time to create a story for the bizarre characters that inhabit. The key moments in the story seem implausible; for example, when Hurst accidentally shoots the producer, believing it is Chaplin. Basing a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is trivial and artificial. The story tries to be a dark comedy, but The Cat's Meow misses an important piece of this equation, comedy. There is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters. It matters little who is hit, who is killed, who is guilty and who is innocent. There is no strong character to cheer. As a result, conflicts are difficult to cure and the final outcome is incidental.
