The Ugly coyote may have been much more effective if the filmmakers made it a guilty film of R-rated / exploitation (with a lot of nudity.) But since the PG-13 rating is what all studios want these days, we end up with a movie like this: a "tease" PG-13 movie that is not allowed to go anywhere until the movie should have gone. <br /> <br /> The script has become generic that it is easy to guess what will be the plot point that will occur 15 minutes before it actually occurs. The acting is adequate, but the characters are so skinny that nothing could be done with them. There were also many points where it seemed that I was watching a music video rather than a movie. <br /> <br /> The only resources of the film are the beautiful female leads. We can see them in some extremely tight and rather revealing outfits ..... but only so much could be shown due to the PG-13 constraints. There is a lot of necklines and toned bodies, which move around doing well choreographed dance numbers, but there is no nakedness or sex to talk about. Tyra Banks (continues to be even more incredibly beautiful with age) is also in the film for a very short time. The sexy newcomer Piper Perabo is also very easy on the eye (and has a killer smile) and shows some acting potential. <br /> <br /> The only people I could see this movie are the pre-pubescent kids who are not yet allowed to watch films with R classification. That audience could draw a lot from it, but the adult audience will feel bored and deceived. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: the film-1 the women-10
