Robert Forster, usually a very strong character, is lost at sea here in the cast like a New York family man seeking revenge on the thugs who murdered his son and attacked his wife in a domestic invasion. Scary themes exploited for cheapjack chills in the vein of the "Death of Death". It is not difficult to deride this tender process: dialogue is full of screams, crime statistics are irrevocably dated, and secondary characters are ridiculously overwritten (especially a contemptible judge who allows a murderer accused of walking to the right of court). Low income production is contemptible in its self-righteousness, especially since the violence in our cities has only increased. * from ****
