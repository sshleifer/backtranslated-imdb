I just watched this movie in high definition on television. I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and I like to watch the few films made on people with physical disabilities. At first I found the main character somewhat noble and appealing. His message about the disabled and the life he spent fighting to have disabled people recognized and integrated into the main company's labor market is great. And my problem is not with the real person who did these things. He was a great man. But this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching, which I found offensive. <br /> <br /> First of all, they have not cast anyone in a leading role with an actual physical disability. Surely they were competent actors, but it seems completely dishonest to preach on the employment of the disabled and therefore in reality NOT ABANDON THE DISABLED for something in the film. Further aggravated by the fact that in a scene in the middle of the film a man is seen walking on a podium with crutches, with the appearance of having only one leg. But the CGI in this scene is so obvious that it is shameful. What? Couldn't they find a real amputee anywhere for the movie? For a 5 second shot was it more economically viable to make CGI effects than only HIRE an ACTUAL amputee? At that point in the film I found him so fraudulent and completely against the message he was trying to convey that I came here to whine and moan like the pathetic cripple I am. <br /> <br /> Understand it.
