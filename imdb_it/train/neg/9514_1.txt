Please spare me these films that teach us that crime is fun and justified. A couple with a blank screenplay with an intense desire to be a Farrelly or Coen brother, in addition to the lives of ANOTHER group of alleged school-age people who recite their adolescent Dawson Creek brand anxiety complete with a GenXYZ soundtrack which painfully tries to make the film "feel" cool and, we satire intensely and painfully inept. <br /> <br /> This is not even "Ferris Bueller" watered down ... I prefer to watch a traffic light change. <br /> <br /> Only one scene stands out as the admission price is everywhere: when Betty Masked's girls meet a masked friend of Richard Nixon. It is a surreal moment. Virtually priceless. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, I'd prefer toothache. At least I can apply some Benzocaine (tm) to stop the pain.
