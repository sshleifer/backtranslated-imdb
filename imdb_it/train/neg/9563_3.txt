This is freely based on the ideas of the original 80s success. It is set in modern times when we see a base in Afghanistan that is destroyed by a UAV in the beginning. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly where the movie skips the shark. UAVs are not armed. They could be but I don't think it's ever really been tried. We will see the computer that created this operation, called R.I.P.L.E.Y. We are introduced to the "hacker" Will Farmer (he is good at chemistry and electronics that does not make him an IT hacker) and his love interest, Annie) and Will's first hacking attempt is not only a complete failure, his IP address is also logged in and Annie guessed who she was. We also meet Wills mom who works for a chemical company. <br /> <br /> Acquiring money from your bank account (Massude) is not a hack (it helped create the account), so we get a nod to the original movie where they decide not to play Global Thermonuclear War and play The Dead Code. The track that RIPLEY's office is shooting is NOT about Will but on Massude's PC, so all the evidence they were collecting was useless against Will. <br /> <br /> Exactly why RIPLEY has closed Will's car is not explained (is he just playing an online game?) and also because he felt the need to have to turn off all the electricity in the entire block in which he lived . For a counterterrorism agency to consider it a viable goal is extremely questionable. What about RIPLEY who activates his cell phone? I think not, it wasn't connected to the PC and the message didn't work if it didn't actually answer the phone, so even there there are more bad "hacking" techniques. <br /> <br /> RIPLEY's agents arrive at Massude's house, take him away and Will is given an envelope that turns out to contain a lot of money. Finding the license plate of the car that Massude has completed is not a "trick" as it is never seen breaking into the DMV computer. RIPLEY agents who grab Dennis at the airport while he is looking for Will have no authority to arrest or detain him. Even Will's mother had not "stolen chemicals and biological agents". And even if he did, they had no right to arrest or detain Dennis. Patriot Act or not. <br /> <br /> I don't know why Will was worried about being arrested for any crime in Canada because it's a totally different country with different laws in the United States. <br /> <br /> The computer has become a thief and all the action taken against Will, his mother and Dennis has not been sanctioned by a government agency. The phreak of the phone we see is the first show of any hacking ability in the movie, but we also have a trick on RIPLEY that seemed too easy for such a powerful system. <br /> <br /> The "boy" who ran to Annie at the airport and even looked at them on the street had nothing to do with RIPLEY and the laughable notion that RIPLEY could trace a cell phone while the underground was as stupid as the idea that a computer could read the lips. <br /> <br /> Another reference to the original film when they mention Stephen Falken as the replaced RIPLEY system designer, the Joshua Project. We find out that the "guy" who ran into Annie is Falken (not played by the actor sadly) who faked his death. <br /> <br /> We will also see WOPR as "what will help them" beat RIPLEY and have kept the same voice used then. Falken and WOPR are destroyed too quickly after being almost completely used (the same explosion should kill Will, Annie and the Russian. It is also unlikely to create an autonomous computer system that has the ability to destroy or drop chemical weapons on the country in which it operates. <br /> <br /> The entire plot and the idea of ​​"Decontamination" are absolutely incredible: this type of orders should go through the President or the Joint Chiefs of Staff, so yet another ridiculous and incredible the idea. <br /> <br /> IP hackers against RIPLEY are not made by Will, merely contacting one of his friends who suggests and implements the idea. It is excessively ridiculous that Will would only gain access by increasing RIPLEY temperature operation Having Joshua as a backdoor in RIPLEY (especially after being blown up) is an incredible cop and the screams of a very desperate writer who had no ideas and wanted to finish and this movie. /> <br /> There is something terrible in which RIPLE Y is playing Dead Code and we see a countdown (say 17 minutes), so RIPLEY says "Decontamination in 30 minutes", how crap is when not can't even keep up with your timer? RIPLEY's attack mission against Philadelphia is blocked (too easily in my opinion) and he decides to attack Joshua in his internal circuits and hijack the missile to point a Philly to Washington where RIPLEY is stationed. The idea of ​​nuclear exchange to make RIPLEY understand what he is doing will not work (surely he would have already known if Joshua had insider it as he had already learned this lesson in the original film?) It is yet another nod to the original film. <br /> <br /> Having RIPLEY by repeating exactly the same words as Joshua at the end of the original film only shows how many original ideas they could not find. <br /> <br /> If you want to point fingers at bad and stolen ideas, the men to blame are Randall Badat and Rob Kerchner. This is a terrible film and it is better to avoid it.
