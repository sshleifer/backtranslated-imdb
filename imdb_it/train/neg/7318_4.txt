This is a depressingly superficial, naive and mostly unpleasant look in an incredibly unlikely relationship between Brooks' psychotic film publisher and Harold, his dull girlfriend. The two have a ZERO chemistry together - mainly because Harold is incapable of doing anything besides looking cute at this stage of his career; but also because the character of Brooks is neither interesting nor funny. There are 15 minutes static and heartbreaking at the beginning where Brooks, having just broken up with Harold, stumbles into his apartment in a depressed and drugged state - unbearable. <br /> <br /> Nicely and without fantasy closed by Joe Cocker's "You are so beautiful", here there simply isn't enough material for a feature film. There is almost nothing happening on the periphery of their relationship to give the impression that these people exist in a real world. I am sure that Brooks's intent was to make a glowing reflector shine on the matter and, in a sense, deconstruct it; but if you do, writing and acting must be much better than what I am here.
