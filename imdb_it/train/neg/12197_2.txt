Beast Wars is a show that is overcrowded, exaggerated and overrated. We meet the characters of this unpleasant show whose creators must have been on acid to try to make a show like this. <br /> <br /> Cheetor- Seriously, they need to have censorship bars on this type. Why didn't you introduce the spectators with the same voice as little Taz? (at least Razzoff from Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is voiced by Slip & Slide) Action Blast- If you want a line of shows that sucks, take G4 Tranceformers Cybertron- A show that should go to the bathroom. Good Job Creators (Sarcasm) Show self delayed and boring (at least Super Mario games are better) This show has had many followers who say they bring it back, but I think it was canceled for its own good.
