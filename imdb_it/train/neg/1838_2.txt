"Envy" is bad for a number of reasons. Yes, there are unlikely characters. This is not the problem. They are unlikely and we are not interested at all. "The War of the Roses" presented improbable characters, but due to the right introductions we almost found ourselves interested in their destiny, while in "Envy" the introduction is subtle, the characters are never credible and the plot makes things worse. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller is simply repulsive in his role and I'm a fan of his work most of the time. Stiller has campaigned to post this video directly on the video and now I understand why. The film proposes to be "the best friends" of Jack Black, but from the first five minutes we are given a movie that seems to indicate that Stiller hates Black. I thought this would turn into a sort of unilateral relationship (to "The Cable Guy") but it never does, instead Stiller insists he is his "best friend" and I felt confused as he seemed to be dealing Black like, well, "poop." The plot of the film is ridiculous, but it doesn't matter, because it should be an exaggerated moral tale. Unfortunately the message is lost in chaos. Walken gives a good performance, but black is off-key and annoying (and I usually find it very funny). No, it's not a horrible movie, but I still can't believe that Barry Levinson ("Rain Man", "Sleepers") is responsible for it - it's not one of the worst films of all time, but it could certainly be much better. I wish there was Va-Poo-Rize - so we could make this movie disappear forever ....
