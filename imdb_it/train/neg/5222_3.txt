This is really a bad movie. Why? First of all, the story is ugly. It is an artificial story that combines all sorts of things that makes no sense. It sounds like a wrong experiment. Secondly, the actors cannot play in a realistic way. They can't even talk like an actor should. Why did I buy this movie? And what should I do now?
