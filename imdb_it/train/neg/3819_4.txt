T.Z. Post, a university professor, receives a false letter stating that he inherited $ 750,000. Now with financial means, he withdraws the savings of $ 4000 and decides to go out and live. After sending his luggage on a train to Chicago, he meets a traveling vaudeville crew, and decides it's good enough for him to put on a show on Broadway. On the night of the show, poor Prof. Post must hide from his creditors, solve relationship problems between girlfriend Pansy and & floozy diva Eleanor, and make sure the show continues. After seeing many of Keaton's silent gems, this is a pain to endure, but I felt it could have been much worse. The supporting cast Durante, Todd and Selwyn prove to be very boring at times, but still nice. A pre-Charlie Chan Toler is as good as the frustrated show director. 90% of the script is poorly written while MGM is trying to pass this film as a poor Marx Bros. movie in which many of the gags of sight fall flat from the start. Compiled with Keaton's alcohol problems at the time, this film is just a sad moment in Buster's life. Rating- 3.
