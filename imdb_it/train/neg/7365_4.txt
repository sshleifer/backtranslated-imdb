A film of robbery not bad but also not so great. Kirk Douglas was recently released by the prison criminal who, after refusing an offer from the Mob, decides to withdraw it by himself. Recruit the circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Chaos follows. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves persecuted by the goon mafia Romano Puppo and entangled in a really stupid love triangle with Douglas's infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). The director Michele Lupo keeps the fast pace and there is at least one sequence of excellent and creative car chases involving Puppo & Gemma. Despite an Italian production, most of the shooting seems to have been done in Germany. Douglas is fine, not only does he abandon him in a yellow quickie. The surprising Bolkan offers exceptional performance. The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
