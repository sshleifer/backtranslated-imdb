Absolutely amazing. <br /> <br /> Now, before a legion of cinema purists suffocate on their latt√©s, let me elaborate. As much as I liked it, this is simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen and it's definitely the worst movie I've ever seen at the cinema (an impressive statement, as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen). The two protagonists (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were not convincing and in the worst case they were even terrible. Naturally, they were not helped by a script that had the same emotional depth as a single Daphne & Celeste and a characterization as convincing as the GU's defense. The plot (to slightly extend the term) was subtle to non-existent and the "eddy" scenes, though undoubtedly brutal, were irrelevant and ridiculously formulas. What plot is there around a twenty-year-old model (Cuthbert) who is kidnapped, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical. The torture scenes look like disconnected pieces and the emphasis was on shocking rather than frightening the audience. Although there are very few, very few positive elements to be drawn from this film, its positive traits are precisely the flaws that make it such a terrible film. I have never heard a vocal audience in a cinema. In twenty minutes, the whole cinema was in points and stayed that way all the time. For my part, I came out red with laughter, backed up by a film that had risen to the height of the frightening film production. Whichever way you look at it, this is really a cinematic goal and a project for future aspiring directors who detail in detail how not to make a film. <br /> <br /> P.S. I failed to mention that I managed to get into the film for free ... so I can afford to laugh at it. I was still tempted to ask for my money back ... it was really that bad.
