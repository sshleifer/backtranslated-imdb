I can't understand Al Pacino. I look at it in the Godfather, Scarface, Carlito's Way, and I think I observe one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years. Then I see it in Twopicks, One Sunday and a Revolution, and I wonder what he is thinking. <br /> <br /> I ran into Revolution a few nights ago, and I thought I'd invest the next two hours on this. Here's a flash news: do you want the prisoners to talk? Make them see it over and over ... confess everything. <br /> <br /> I don't want to redo the plot because there isn't a coherent plot, but it takes place during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated farmer who doesn't want to get involved, but he does it eventually. While he has no money, he has no education and he dresses like a caveman, a very hot Natasha Kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason, since they only have two minutes of dialogue together. <br /> <br /> Frankly, if "Al Smith" was acting in this film, instead of "Al Pacino", it would have ruined their career. The script was horrible, but Pacino's demotivated performance and obvious false accent made it even worse. Donald Sutherland's role was ridiculous. I really can't describe it. Natasha Kinski is a main character, but has 5 lines in the film. In fact, nobody talks a lot in this film. <br /> <br /> One of the film's most ridiculous premises is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this mysterious ability to meet continuously on the battlefield. It's like the whole Northeast is a Starbucks. "Hey, it's fun to see you back here on ANOTHER battlefield 100 miles away ... see you in a few months." <br /> <br /> I am obliged to give this star from IMDb, since there is nothing here for a negative score.
