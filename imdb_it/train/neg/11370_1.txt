This video contains an astute way to confuse and manipulate Americans about Islam. It is a pity that the people who did it really believe that the American people are so stupid to believe it, perhaps, as an American citizen, every person must protest against this kind of crap. If you want to know the truth about Islam, don't let anyone tell you ... THE QURAN IS PUBLIC! you can read it by yourself and decide if what they say is true or false ... <br /> <br /> The video uses many audiovisual strategies aimed at manipulating and associating things that are not even related. The music used in some places prepares the audience to hate what they see, even if they do not really understand what is happening there. They use images that are out of place from their original content. <br /> <br /> To finish the comment I'd like to make a reflection ... Don't you think you can make the same exact movie with every religion in the world?
