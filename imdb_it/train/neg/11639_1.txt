SPOILERS: I'm always surprised by how many people gave this game good reviews. It was terrible. The script and the acting voice alone ruined it. Gabriel and Grace are the most unlikely characters in the game. You almost pray for their death. And worst of all, there are fewer vampires in this game than were the werewolves in The Beast Within. <br /> <br /> The lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing. If you expect a sort of Anne Rice-style vampire story, forget it. The story of this game has very little to do with vampires. You won't even see until the end and even then, you won't have to fight against them. <br /> <br /> The plot has a radical and almost blasphemous vision of Christianity. I'm surprised he came out of the drawing board. I'm not even a Christian and I found it offensive. Mostly, the story revolves around the search for the Holy Grail and the buried treasure. The kidnapping of a real child, which should have been the goal, is really put aside. There is no sense of urgency for Gabriel to find the child. In fact, he almost never asks anyone about the child after the first blocks of time. <br /> <br /> The graphics are rather ugly. The characters move at a snail's pace even on the best systems. They are large and obsolete. And it's hard to go from The Beast Within FMV to this horrible Blood of the Sacred game engine. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Gabriel and Grace also takes a terrible turn. I really don't know why he was so horribly rushed, but sleep together. And it's not funny. Gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend Mosely how he thinks of Grace as more than a sister and doesn't think he's the right person for him. And he seems really disgusted to have slept together. But it's so unlikely during the game, that at that point you don't even care. His dialogue was the worst in the game. And he constantly made stupid sexual allusions to everything that was feminine in the whole game. At the end of the game, Grace leaves him with what looks like a letter from Dear John. I guess she was tired of him like most players. <br /> <br /> I found the story boring and boring. I expected to play a story about a real child abducted by vampires. And I expected to see and fight vampires, maybe even Gabriel or Grace become one. But no. Instead, the story focuses on the distorted view of the author of Christianity. What a pity. Here they had the elements for a great adventure, and instead we got this. <br /> <br /> For me, the only interesting parts of the game were actually at the end. In the end we get some action style puzzles. But it wasn't worth suffering all the way to get to them. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend this game. I recovered it when it came out, years ago, and I hated the game engine that I set aside for years. Only recently I dusted off to see what I was missing. And now, I'm really sorry I did it. My favorite characters have been ruined. I hope there will be a fourth game just to redeem the series. And I hope that they will resume it next time. It would be a real shame to finish the series with this episode.
