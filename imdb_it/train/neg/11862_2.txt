This film probably had a potential for something; my bewilderment is how these very prosaic unfunny themes continue to do so in theaters, it is as if ideas were recycled only because generations are. Truly the decerebred idiots behind most films are like dogs, they come back to ingest their own vomit. Well, now they have 19 bucks richer thanks to me. This was not at all imaginative, there was not a moment of salvation, something remotely funny was shown in the trailer (and nothing funny was in the trailer), the performances were tense (especially those of Molly, totally unconvincing). What was supposed to be some comic relief was the homoerotic friend with a penchant for Disney movies; none of his analogies struck home, his moral speeches were flat, I was literally waiting for them to continue to say something meaningful, only to find out he had finished. The so-called "hard 10" is the most insipid plastic creature there is (apart from having a horse face with a strange smile); Honestly, I found her friend Patty (hereafter "Hamburglar") much more beautiful than her. But then again, gentlemen prefer brunettes;) Well, however, the whole premise is that society is superficial and if love is true it transcends all social facades; the way they showed it, with one guy shaving the scrotum of another and the routine of premature ejaculation of millions of times mutilated and crushed to death (with obvious allusions to American Pie and Happiness - the latter in disgusting scene involving the family dog). I feel like the movie was like a story of ridiculous jokes in a miserable ball of raw sewage. It goes to show that marketing can push anything out there, shine whatever fetid mass and call it gold, people will come (it worked for me). Done with pull.
