I will never be a member of any club that would have me, <br /> <br /> in particular this. <br /> <br /> Starr Andreeff is a single / stripper mom who is attacked by a female <br /> vampire and left for dead. He begins to have a desire for blood, and meets John Savage, who looks like he's <br /> <br /> wondering where he left Michael Cimino's phone number. Savage <br /> <br /> is also a vampire and wants to bring Andreef into his small vampire family <br /> <br />, which consists of a British vamp, the blond vampire who <br /> <br /> attacked Starr and a dwarf with green hair (I'm not doing this <br /> <br /> on). <br /> <br /> The family does not want Starr, so they try to kill Savage and Starr <br /> and Starr's son. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell John Savage that this was a drama. <br /> <br /> spends most of his time on the screen exhibiting more facial tics than <br /> <br /> Hugh Grant on a bolt by Jolt Cola, and reads all his lines as <br /> <br /> is making a Farrelly Brothers movie. Andreeff tries to make the <br /> <br /> part of a badly written role, but writer / director Ruben goes <br /> for all the vampire clich√©s, like Starr eating the domestic hamster his son <br /> <br /> and buying a bag of raw meat to fight blood lust. Even the little boy <br /> <br /> is stunned a lot, for those who think that looking at violence against children is really fun. <br /> <br /> The film is very gory, but not wild, above "Killer <br /> <br /> Tongue". Here, the blood is gross and never justified, it occurs only. <br /> <br /> It is only in the budget. Most of the R rating goes to colleagues at <br /> <br /> of Andreeff, who are subjected to embarrassing striping procedures in the context of <br /> <br /> conversation scenes. The budget doesn't include the vampire's tusks <br />! All vampires here must stab their prey to eat. <br /> <br /> Nifty idea, unless you've already seen George Romero's <br /> <br /> "Martin". <br /> <br /> Even at 77 minutes and once you've launched Ruben's attempts at art direction (skewed frames, blurred scenes), this is a boring, boring and dirty race. <br /> <br /> Leave this club and take a shower, <br /> <br /> you will need it. <br /> <br /> This is classified (R) for violent physical violence, armed violence, sexual violence <br /> <br /> violence, strong ferocity, strong obscenities, female nudity, sexual references <br />, abuse of drugs and adult situations. <br /> <br />
