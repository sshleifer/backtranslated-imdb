I won't go into the plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and there is almost no storyline, anyway. I've seen several reviewers call ISOYG an "anti-rape" movie or even a feminist statement, and I just have to grapple with the irritating hypocrisy of these statements. <br /> <br /> First of all, what do we do on the cover of this movie? Exactly: behind a curvy woman. That it was Zarchi's attempt to make an anti-rape declaration - and I absolutely don't think it was - is completely out of place. The film is sex marketing and the titillation of sexual violence and the material is so graphic (everything except real penetration is shown) that NO ONE, but the crowd of hard core exploitation will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Rape (s) in the film is uncomfortable, brutal and difficult to watch. There is something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason why this scene would continue for 30 minutes apparently, none. There was also a small development of the victim's character and only one of the rapists is slightly developed (a few moments before he is killed), so the scene is not emotionally engaging at all. In fact, it is just presented to show extreme sexual violence and from the movies we can say that ISOYG is associated with IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) which only attracts the exploitation crowd. <br /> <br /> Finally, some reviewers praised Zarchi's so-called documentary style and the lack of a soundtrack. But considering how inept the rest of the film is (acting, screenplay, etc.), I suspect that these are financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because it has literally positioned a camera and let its porn caliber actors do the their thing. /> <br /> I'm not going to drop everything on my high horse talking about the content of ISOYG. I am all for exploitation / horror and love for video. In fact, I'm giving this film three stars just because it really pushes the envelope a lot farther than other movies. However, it is also badly done and after the rape, it is simply boring for the rest of the film as we watch a lot of murders, mostly horrible murders and wait for the credits to launch. <br /> <br /> It is probably worth looking at it once if you are a fan of the exploits of the 70s, but I'm telling you that, on the whole, the film is pretty ugly and not worth its notorious reputation.
