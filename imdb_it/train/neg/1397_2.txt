Let's see, here are the "highlights" of The Brain Machine: 15 which set up shots of a pool and a house; 15 establishing shots of an anonymous office building; 5 countdowns from a technical bland; 7 close-ups of a threatening guard; and a myriad of technical chatter to show us this is a high-tech experiment. <br /> <br /> Various posters have commented on the discrepancy between the 1972 copyright date and the release date shown on the 1977 DVD packaging. It is easy to explain. This dog simply sat on the unpublished shelf for five years, until someone dusted it off, thinking it would fit perfectly with the post-Watergate mood of distrust in the government. After seeing The Brain Machine now, my only wonder is that it has ever been released!
