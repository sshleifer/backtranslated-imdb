Why a title so generic? Santa Claus??? So bland and unpredictable. The films first tried to collect the Christmas spirit, in particular 'Santa Claus conquers the Martians', at least it was fun to look at because of the campy, and all the repertoire material used ... for some reason, which seemed happy for myself. But this movie simply shoves Christmas in the ass and captivates the joy of all the children. Santa Claus lives in space? Is your enemy a devil named Pitch? Does Santa get help from Merlin the Wizard? How random is this? Well, since it was made in Mexico, some of you might understand how the film was made. I had to admit that some of the effects were just extravagant for the time. It was a real mass of madness! Despite, despite all the problems with the film, it still looks like a Christmas movie. The good wins the evil, and Christmas still plays a part of our heart of every good girl or boy in the world, or perhaps of the universe, thanks to Santa Claus Conquering the Martians ... apparently. So, I think you should give it a try, even if it's one of the worst vacation movies of all time ... although it should make you smile every day.
