I suppose it's nice and fashionable to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a film like this. With the sometimes useless excesses of many Hollywood movies, we can relax and enjoy an explosion-free scene, vulgar language and insignificant jokes. Minimalism has its place and can be very effective if used correctly. However, this film is not one of those cases. <br /> <br /> Take long scenes without dialogues and desolate and scattered landscapes. I'm sure they must have great meaning and intuition, because the implicit message is wrapped in bewilderment. The acting is poor ... bland and pedestrian ... and presents one of the worst crying scenes in history (at the end of the film, if you can sit up to the end). The scenery is grim, and the incredibly long sequence of the girl walking through the dry park is as pleasant as having a tooth pulled. I would call it anticlimatic, but since the film didn't produce any kind of climax ... even in the "erotic" scenes ... it wouldn't be true. I'm sure that during the shooting there was a script, but with the amount of dialogue, I think it could have been written on a cocktail napkin. Basically, this film offers nothing to interest or amaze ... no great story, no extraordinary intuition, no visual drama, no excitement. In addition to two or three funny moments, this film is a waste of two hours. A tragically boring and boring film.
