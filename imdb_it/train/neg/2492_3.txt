I think I've seen worse movies, so I'm giving a 3, but it's a struggle to remember what they could have been !! Maybe Xtro (ugly and boring) or maybe Creep (simply trivial), but it's a struggle to think of something worse. It's hard to know where to start. Let's just say he's an under siege of a poor man, with Jean Claude Van Damme, an even poorer man. The only thing he saved was to see Casper Van Dien - I always wondered what had happened to him after Starship Troopers. Yes, it was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know. <br /> <br /> Judging from this site, it was stuck in a hellish TV movie .... Casper, be more selective .... please !! !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I just filmed and there's a decent movie called Criminal Law ...... I'm starting to get very upset for the last 1.5 hours now !!!
