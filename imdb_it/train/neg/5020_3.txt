This is the most screwed up voice on IMDb that I have yet to run into. All previous reviewers act like this is the movie. This is NOT the movie. Rather it is simply a featurette which is an extra on the DVD of the movie "The One". It is nowhere near the 90th that is listed here as. Actually it's just over 13 minutes since Jet Li can do martial arts. and his reflections on the film. So yes, this IMDb entry is a bit fucked up. Don't listen to any of the other reviews because they are ALL the wrong ones. You can trust me, because I never feed you, dear reader, BS. <br /> <br /> and this is the truth. I guess you can say that you are the "One" reviewer that counts.
