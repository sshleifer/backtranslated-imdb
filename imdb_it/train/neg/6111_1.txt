Miles O'Keeffe, who played at least Tarzan, would have embarked on a long and enjoyable career in cinema B and Richard Harris can put him behind after his recent actor triumphs, but Bo and John Derek never recovered from this fiasco and from future collaborations between the two has served to show why his career as a director and his acting career died in the first place. <br /> <br /> And how did the orangutan arrive in Africa?
