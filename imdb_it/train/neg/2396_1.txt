I just watched this movie on TV and I have to admit I was a little surprised that it was up too. There were so many tricks, confusion and bad tweaks that an old episode of Sesame Street would have been better to watch. The acting was OK, but please, you can really feel the sensation of "Straight to Video". The cast / crew made this film a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the film, but wait only ten minutes before the finale to hear it. Trust me, you wouldn't even say the difference.
