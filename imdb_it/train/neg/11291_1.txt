Sheesh! What a terrible movie. Dodgy chamber work, a screenplay with more Kellogg's corn, and acting so well that you could open a pig farm with it. <br /> <br /> Finally, he doesn't know which audience to target - we have Cornel Wilde - or is it Corny Wilde? - put his soap box on the risks of smoking every time someone lights a cigarette, dear oh dear, and in another embarrassing scene we have the villain, Lobo, forcing his, er, if you will, "male friend" to make a striptease dressed in a bikini. Try explaining it to the kids ... <br /> <br /> Throw an overly elaborate plot of Treasure Island-cum-Jaws, and the result is such an unintentionally funny movie, it's fun - I shouldn't expect a special edition DVD anytime soon, anyway.
