Rebar is an astronaut who participates in the first space mission in the world with Saturn, but obviously being a horror movie things get ugly and come back to earth as the only survivor. Struck by some bizarre condition that makes him melt and slowly lose his mind unless he regularly consumes human flesh, he kills what is apparently the only nurse in the hospital and flees to the nearby city to pursue other victims. <br /> <br /> I liked the premise and the monster and the effects of the gore are actually quite good, but the space scenes have just been glued together on NASA footage and the hospital curiously looks like a warehouse. A very weak script, poor character development and poor general acting prevent this from rising above a mediocre slasher with the novelty of having a living candle as a murderer, and more or less has only its gore effects for hold your interest. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, strictly for fans of the toughest monster movies.
