Despite the mysteriously positive reviews and the high rating, this is a terrible movie. Pretty horrible, I feel obliged to warn you how serious it is. <br /> <br /> The film is set in the last period of the Raj, during the period of India's struggle for independence. What follows in the ridiculous plot fills me with disbelief. What the characters do and how they behave does not persuade me that the characters exist at that time. <br /> <br /> For example, young Hindu married people, waitresses in the local village, have an affair with their married English Master, knowing full well that the discovery of the deal would probably mean absolute social exclusion and shame if not the deadly punishment? Unlikely, but maybe maybe. However, the same young Hindu waitress, in the conservative society of India at that time, continues as half Britney Spears in heat, participating in a hot outdoor sex during open daylight, where they could be discovered in any time? This is not only damn improbable, it is a delayed plot line. <br /> <br /> Such idiocies combined with poor acting led me to leave the cinema an hour in the film, so I didn't see the second part of the film. One could only hope that the ending is more intelligible than what I saw in the first half.
