Seriously lousy movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film begins with a policeman and his companion parked outside a warehouse / furniture store. The "bad" cop takes a girl, who they had dragged, into the attic of the warehouse, while the novice policeman sits outside and reflects on what could happen up there. The "bad" cop eventually returns with a heavy bag, and the novice policeman does not think there are any problems, but he still wonders what was in the bag, so he asks, gets a crap answer, and then thinks of everything it's OK (for now). <br /> <br /> The "bad" cop repeats this process, and even once with a great tit scene (made slightly better). But in the end people start to catch on, which took some time considering how obvious I was. A girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her in case she dies, like you. Now, the "bad" cop eventually kills this magically protected whore, and then gets rid of the body in his bag. <br /> <br /> Given that the magic of the oogey-boogey put it, come back with a lot of eye shadows on, which should indicate that you could be a zombie ... besides, the magic curse causes that all the other girls become "eye shadow monsters". Some of the girls meet with a guy, who is apparently a currency expert, and offers them a ride (apparently they seem normal). But when the girls see other people, such as the husband of one of the girls, he is out of his mind because he is horrible (some people go crazy, but others do not notice) .... huge hole in the plot. <br /> <br /> So, to conclude, the eye shadow monsters kill the "bad" cop, who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene. It was as if they were trying to prepare us for a sequel! As anyone would like to see part 2 of this cow fall.
