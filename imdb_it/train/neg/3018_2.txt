What you get when you mix a lump of clichés with a rhythm without direction and a group of characters that you don't care about and a failed attempt to create an eye-catching visual style and an even bigger lump of clichés and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget? Why, get one of the most intolerably intractable movies ever made! I refer, of course, to Domino. <br /> <br /> Here are some things people might say when watching this movie: <br /> <br /> "Ooh, wow, the plot is called out of sequence, which was not done a billion of times before. And much more skillfully than in this movie. "<br /> <br />" Wow, look at all the flashing lights and the grainy texture of the film and processed transitions! The director is trying so hard to make the artistic things and to establish a visual style! It is simply a pity that none of these effects add anything to the film or make sense with the scenes in which they are found, and it is also too bad that most of them are irritating! " /> <br /> "I've already heard about this exchange of dialogues in about twenty thousand movies!" <br /> <br /> "I've seen this scene in about thirty thousand films before!" <br /> <br /> "This too!" <br /> <br /> "Uh, they didn't reveal this 'twist' about half an hour ago? That should be surprising?" <br /> <br /> "If this f ilm should be showing a "tough girl" who goes around kicking her ass ... when she doesn't do it much? "<br /> <br />" I can't believe how unpopular this dialogue is. "> <br />" How long is this thing? I seem to have already looked at it for over four hours. "<br /> <br />" I have no idea what just happened, but besides, I don't feel particularly motivated to try to understand it. "<br /> <br />" Is it already over? <br /> <br /> "I want my money back." <br /> <br /> "The songs on this soundtrack are so abused here." <br /> <br /> "It is ironic that all the curses they use actually diminish the impact of each." <br /> <br /> "UGH." <br /> <br /> And finally: "I may have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this film to me." <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film is a failure in almost every respect. Avoid watching it at all costs If your house is on fire and this movie is playing in the only room that is not flammable, you should seriously consider being burned alive. <br /> <br /> (If I look bitter, it's because I just spent over two hours watching this movie and, uh, I didn't like it very much.)
