The plot has been remodeled a number of times; "a breath of life in the nursing home". Several plays, films, novels, stories, poems and newspaper articles have broken the topic to no end, but it is still an excellent platform for character studies. <br /> <br /> If "Gideon" were made with more enthusiasm, it could be brilliant, but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely invaded by clich√©s (including the subtitle and the summary of "simple wisdom" by Gideon they almost made me laugh in its ineffectiveness). The mostly indifferent acting is the last straw for this weak movie, but the rest is pretty bland to make the actors' lack of concentration almost irrelevant.
