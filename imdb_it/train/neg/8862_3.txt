From the moment Christopher Lee wears a pair of punk sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club, you know you have a stinker in your hand! This film had potential. Under all the muds there are the remains of what could have been realized in a decent film, if not interesting. The final product is a real mess, however. Apart from free nudity and some very attractive women, Howling II turns out to be a ludicrous excuse for a horror movie. Christopher Lee gives him a nugget of credibility, but even he can't raise it above the shit level. <br /> <br /> Having never seen any of the other films in this series, this critic will be forced to accept on the face that this is a true continuation of the events in the first part. We begin a funeral for one of the characters of the original, and in the first ten minutes we are in Transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to fight a congregation of werewolves. The film is set quite well, and there are not too many dead spots. The action is there; it simply is not turned well. A bright spot is the music of a punk band called Babel. Although their song is played quite often, it is quite catchy. <br /> <br /> The problems with this film are fantastic. First of all, acting is worse than pitiful. Christopher Lee is pretty good, but that's where it ends. The two protagonists of Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe miss practically everything you want for characters like that. Writing is miserable, redundant editing and amateur management. There are a couple of fun special effects, but the more elaborate ones outnumber them. Sybil Danning is nice to look at, but her acting performance is not satisfactory. Judd Omen plays the part he plays, but his voice and acting are not convincing to say the least. Much of the dialog box is in an incomprehensible language that may or may not be in Latin. <br /> <br /> I liked the general idea of ​​the story. I always like the stories of true believers to fight apparently invincible forces of evil. A scene where a small group of good guys is going through a dark forest and tearing down a group of werewolves is even exciting. Guy. Perhaps a bigger budget or a better director would have made the rest of the film a little more compelling. 3 of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound. <br /> <br /> Side note: at the time of writing, the censors on youtube.com have not yet removed the credits with Sybil Danning rips off its top several times while Babel's song is playing! Take it while you can!
