ba ba ba boring ...... this is close to the land of battle in the laziness of science fiction. genie francis (aka general hospital laura) has a small role as a reporter and this in itself should tell you that this film must be bad .... ben kingsley (an actor acclaimed by the academy) in this stinker and few other decent actors. You have to ask yourself what you owned them to decide to make this horrible movie. The music goes dramatically up and down as if it were a great dramatic story. Even if you pay attention, the plot is impossible to follow. The effects are also mediocre and really look dated. All actors speak in a monotonous voice and have no realism in their dialogues. I could go on and on about how this is a bad movie. At least with Battlefield Earth it's so ugly that it's fun, but that's just b or r i n g. Avoid unless you want to be lulled into sleep.
