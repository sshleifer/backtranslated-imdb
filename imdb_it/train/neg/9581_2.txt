This is the only thing I can say positive about this film. Cleveland is the star, I've been there and I've never seen the city look so beautiful. Beautiful river and urban landscapes. <br /> <br /> This film proceeds at a pace that hopes you won't notice the lack of relevance in the real world. People who run and shoot guns without any consequences. For example, there's a shooting at Rob Lowe's house - two cars are stolen, yet the cops don't show up until much later in the movie. The rental murder has never seemed so implausible. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has written this film should be the recipient of an infinite number of stray bullets. Many of the actors in this film are much better than this. I check the film date just to make sure it wasn't written during the writers' strike, but unfortunately it wasn't the case. This film is currently spinning on Universal's HD channel - unless you want to drool over Overe there's no reason to watch it.
