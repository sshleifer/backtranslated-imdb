I consider this film a 3 as it is worse than cult films that deserve a fair 2. Doesn't it make sense to you? Well, it doesn't have to. This is another vampire movie with a stupid plot, no, let me rephrase, an incredibly idiotic plot, where space cowboys (complete with cowboy hats) fight a space race of moron vampires. <br /> <br /> Is it worse than this? The only good thing about this film was Natassia Malthe, with her beautiful Norwegian beauty. God, I wish Michael Ironside and the DeLuise brothers would stop accepting stupid roles in stupid movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was nice! I know Mr. Ironside from many movies, he starred in 164 films on this date !! It is true that he was rarely in an important role, but still!
