Again (again) in Scotland, Lassie is (again) on trial for his life. Since the faithful dog sleeps on his master's grave, he must be put to death, according to the law. Strangely, it also explains that Lassie did not have a "legal" owner, which is, apparently, even against an old Scottish law. If, after three days, no owner is found, the dogs must be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (as John Traill) defends the Lassie case, which leads to an extensive flashback, showing Donald Crisp's adoption of Lassie (as John "Jock" Gray). <br /> <br /> Although based on an interesting and original story ("Greyfriars Bobby"), "Challenge to Lassie" revisits several previous Lassie situations; and it doesn't improve on them. Comparatively speaking, this is sloppy and not very exciting; e, is a disappointing following for "The Sun Comes Up" (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (like Susan Brown) and many other artists can be fascinating, but they can't elevate this. Little Jimmy Hawkins (from "It's a Wonderful life") is among the important children who support Lassie; much later, he will grow up to marry "Dark Shadows" "bewitching" Angelique "(Lara Parker).
