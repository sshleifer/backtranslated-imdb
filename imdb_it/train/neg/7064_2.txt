"The son of John Hughes wrote a high school drama! Wow!" I thought while watching the movie information here on IMDb, late on Saturday night, after finding myself looking at the credits on BBC2. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching it, and unfortunately it was going downhill there. You probably can't ruin such a poor movie, but I'll leave the spoilers out of this review ... <br /> <br /> C 'it's a lot of style on very little substance: unfortunately the style hasn't dated too well in the eight years since its release. As for the substance, the film tries to take an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school life; but under the glossy veneer, a remotely significant or relevant topic does not materialize. The characters are painted in childish widths, falling into the kind of generic stereotypes that the writer's father tried to question in Breakfast Club. <br /> <br /> Director Kyle Cooper does a decent job keeping pace (maybe relying a little too much on editing information, which soon becomes a strenuous device, but at least pushes the story forward), but his efforts do not sufficiently detract from the bizarre script and casting (as someone should stand with 'Maddox' when Blake Shields tears to pieces and makes his way through the part, I can't understand), not to mention the numerous gaping hole pots (they are all for the creative license, but when the "bad guys" know the identities of the "good guys" who make their lives a misery, but they can't act in any way to stop them, you really have to ask me why this script was not subjected to other releases before production - he also read it p APA? <br /> <br /> I'm sure a younger audience could get pleasure from this movie (and all the power to them), but it's much better to stick to Hughes Sr.'s school production and if the idea of ​​the school rebellion is what makes Appelli, the 1968 classic "Se ..." is a much more satisfying exam than the subject.
