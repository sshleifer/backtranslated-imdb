I'm sorry for Jean, after having had an original film so good that he was perhaps followed by his worst career film. This film was terribly cut down by horrible acting jobs from Goldbeg (Romeo) and from whatever name the computer was called. Also, some scenes may have been just a little anonymous. Really, bad movie.
