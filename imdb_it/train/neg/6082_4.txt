Although there are many familiar "television" names associated with "A Man Called Sledge", there is nothing extraordinary in the film itself or in any of the performances. In fact, the only thing that sets him apart from a television series of the 60s and 70s like "The Rat Patrol" is a bigger and much more violent cast. <br /> <br /> James Garner is the greatest star and apparently thought he should have tried to break away from all the light things he had done ("Maverick", "Support your local sheriff" - "Gunfighter" etc. ). Unfortunately his earthly sympathy works against him, since Sledge is a character without humor written to cash in on the popularity of Clint Eastwood's western spaghetti character. But Eastwood's things were not so flat and uninteresting. I suppose "A Man Called Sledge" can be classified as a spaghetti western although the pace is too slow to really fit this subgenus. Fans of the slow-paced television series "Combat" will hear an instant connection as Vic Morrow directs the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Frank Kowalski. Throws slow-mo and cross-dissolving shots, then fashionable, that call attention to themselves rather than serving a narrative purpose. <br /> <br /> The plot is the standard thing about the "big robbery" (enter "The War Wagon" here) with Sledge plotting a $ 300,000 gold expedition. His band includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that while on the move the expedition is guarded by 40 riders and while it is stopped it is locked in a vault inside the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" with the same plot. <br /> <br /> The plot would be a decent hour of television, but it ages very quickly as a very padded feature film. Garner does not reveal any of his charm in his characterization and the film does not generate enough suspense to maintain the interest of a spectator. <br /> <br /> The thing eventually crashes and burns shortly after the robbery when the band engages an invented and totally illogical card game. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
