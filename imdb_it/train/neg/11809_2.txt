Bought this movie in the business basket at Rogers' video store for $ 2. I enjoy a good B movie from time to time and thought it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> The film is quite clich√© about the 70s and is quite groovy for that. Unfortunately the plot is difficult to follow and not much happens in the film. In fact, I turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and imagined a week later that I should watch the whole thing, no matter how slow it was. <br /> <br /> The film has some positive aspects, but you have to wait and wait and wait ....... for them. <br /> <br /> If you like B movies, this may be just for you, just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens, and I mentioned not much plot ... > <br />
