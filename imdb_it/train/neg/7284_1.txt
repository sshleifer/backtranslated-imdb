Wow. I read about this film and it seemed so terrible that I had to see it, and my god, I feel it in St Louis. Where do I start? National Lampoons was trying to follow 5 years after the success of Animal House, but they completely lost their mark. I will go in chronological order with these short films. <br /> <br /> Short film n. 1 <br /> <br /> Poor Peter Riegert (Boon from Animal House). Apparently, he didn't work then, so the guys from National Lampoons probably called and said "hey, we're doing a porn movie, do you want to be there?" Peter was like "well, I'm not doing much these days, why not?" He was a great Animal House character, but he couldn't bring this unpleasant flop for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILER The premise is quite funny, with Jason Cooper (Riegert) telling his wife to leave him, she needs to find herself. It's too weird that they are really in a happy marriage. So you chase it away, and Cooper is in charge of the children. This, of course, leads him to burn the house, lose many of the children and sleep with an assortment of New York bimbos (including an ever-young Diane Lane). Then the wife returns, she wants the children, and the film ends with a coin flip that will decide the fate of the children. The idea was actually a bit smart, but the director stank. All the characters seem to fall asleep, they must be drugged. Sorry Boon, your legacy has been overshadowed by this flop. <br /> <br /> Short Film # 2 <br /> <br /> MORE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Join Dominique Corsaire. Beautiful girl, just graduated, not knowing what to do with her life. So she becomes a whore, starts sleeping around with some rich mega, takes their money when they die, and she doesn't stop until she hatches the most powerful man in the world, Fred Willard (Ooops, I mean the president of the United States ). Once again, it could have been fun, and although I was happy that Corsaire (Ann Dusenberry in real life) wasn't afraid to strip everything, his acting was horrible. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Short film n. 3 <br /> <br /> I can't believe I made it that far. Here is the novice policeman Brent Falcone (Robby Benson) with veteran Stan Nagurski (Richard Widmark). Falcone is young, naive, he thinks he can really help people, even if he becomes cynical after being hit several thousand times. Nagurski, in fact, has just given up on the cure. Look at the insults, the assaults, call him and he never intervenes. Imagine that the world is lawless and will probably be reported if it does something. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of the Taxi race) goes into action, getting the police called him, committing a crime, but having his lawyer there to protect him. God bless America !! <br /> <br /> Once again, it could have been fun, the performances were intentionally campy, but the goodness, no energy whatsoever. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi should be ashamed to have their names on this schlock. I think the writing wasn't bad, the ideas were there, but the execution was pulled out as well as the rescue attempt in the Iranian hostage crisis. If I had been part of this film, I would like my name removed, it's horrible. Then again, that's why I looked at it. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this garbage is that Dr John made the soundtrack of the movie (repeating "Going to the Movies" again and again) and the film isn't much more than a hour and a half. Show this in cinema courses with the heading "What you should NEVER do in filming". This script should have been left on the shelf because yes, it's that bad.
