I gave this show (I only saw seven episodes) four stars because most of its lines / set-ups seem to fail. Some are not fun outright, but some are fun - in a 12-year-old boy. It reminds me of that New York painter who throws paint on a canvas, calls it art and sells it for a lot of money. Silverman throws out what he has, including the kitchen sink, while he prays that some things will stick to the wall in his effort to be fun but different. <br /> <br /> However, what he "got" is often not enough, as if he lacked the kind of follow-through that a good comedian needs to succeed. <br /> <br /> The whole business is like a finished potato.
