A very weak film, mainly due to a bad story, but also a poor acting in the case of Robert Downey Jr. and an irrational behavior of many of the characters. If you are a person who likes to take your mind off and simply watch a movie for your creativity or acting criteria, then you will like this movie. Personally I can't do it with a drama and I find it too far-fetched. <br /> <br /> I am particularly irritated when a main character, who should be an intelligent person, acts continuously as a complete imbecile. In this film, if the main character played as a person would normally play in these situations, there would be no movie. <br /> <br /> The first highly unlikely act is when the main character, a successful lawyer named Magruder, played by Kenneth Branagh, is leaving a party and succeeding a girl, Mallory Doss played by Embeth Davidtz, who is shouting that his car was stolen. They are standing in a tropical storm while forcing her to accept a ride home. <br /> <br /> She tells him about her strange father who belongs to a sort of bizarre sect and does crazy things. When they arrive at his dilapidated shack in the poorest part of the city, they realize that his car is in the driveway. Even the lights in the house are on and some objects in the house have been broken. <br /> <br /> Things are very strange, she's weird (looks like a tramp, she strips in front of him until he's completely naked ?? oh yes!). Also, the father is strange, the house is a disaster - everything should have told Magruder, "hey, this is too weird for me, I'm out of here!" But not Magruder, he sleeps with her and then, motivated by his story and his sex, he takes up the case of trying to get his father engaged. Everything slowly! <br /> <br /> So, being the best, the lawyer warns, arrives late at the office wearing the same shirt he had the night before (a fact that all women in the office notice). Is it likely that a successful lawyer behaves like a 16-year-old? Magruder upset the police in some of his cases, so when he goes to the police claiming, with ample evidence, that his father is terrorizing them, the police ignore him. I could have thought I would ask for help without help. not at all - not likely! <br /> <br /> It's just too unlikely.
