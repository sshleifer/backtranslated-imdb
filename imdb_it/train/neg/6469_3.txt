When I was younger, I thought the first movie was really nice in childhood, so I decided to see the sequel. This is an example of why some films should not have sequels, because the first film is usually the best, and it is. Basically now that Ariel and Eric are married they have a daughter who is not allowed to leave the house because they are worried about Ursula's sister (the octopus with the bad legs), Morgana who comes close to her. When the child comes out, he asks Ursula's sister to turn her into a mermaid, like her mother did. This brings Ariel back to the sea to find her. The same good artists of the voice, it is only the story that could have had a little more reflection. Adequate!
