I cannot say that I am all that I experienced in the misty Mundae films after seeing only a handful of them, but it is obvious that this was done with little money, and while it would have been respectable that the filmmakers could make a copy Tomb Raider Outside a garage, it's not because it's completely obvious that this is what they were doing. The film only lasts forty-five minutes, and this is certainly a good thing because there is not enough plot here to extend it much longer. It has something to do with an evil Nazi scientist (who looks as evil as a porn star who plays a Nazi scientist), a mummy, who is clearly a man wrapped in toilet paper and Misty - the version of this Tomb Raider film , which maintains its peak for much less time than Angelina Jolie in the economic version. I must say that, despite its shortcomings, this film could have been better. He has Misty Mundae to start with, and even better than that if you ask me is the fact that he is also the hottest Darian Caine. The couple falls in love with all the lesbian sex one would expect from a Seduction Cinema film and this is at the expense of the non-existent plot, even if it's not really a bad thing. Obviously, this is a junk movie - but the fact that it's short is about her, and if you're looking for some lesbian sex, you could do worse.
