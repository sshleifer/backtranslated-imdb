It was a beautiful story, but not very well told. I liked the themes and the main plot, which was not as clear as it could have been. Perhaps there were too many things going on and a lack of ability to reign everything. The acting was ok to do the cheesy, some were stronger than others and even the strongest actors had their acting moments of inferior quality. It took me a couple of months to complete the entire movie because it didn't hold my attention and the flow was just ugly. I just finished watching it and I'm glad I did it because the film finally moves and has a certain continuity towards the end. Again, a good story, but the delivery was sub par. I would recommend it for the plot and maybe a bit of eye candy, and I mean, a little.
