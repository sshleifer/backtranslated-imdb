This show stinks. For parents, they usually want their children to look good for them. It is usually educational, fun and brilliant. <br /> <br /> Is it educational? No. Doodlebops just sing. Usually they sing about themselves, they don't try to teach anything. <br /> <br /> Is it fun? No. Doodlebops say something that is not intended as a joke, and they laugh at it. <br /> <br /> Is it bright? It's so bright, it's painful. As for the color, everything is extremely bright, so it's fine. But NOTHING is ever wrong in the world of Doodlebop. Therefore, they are always happy. a child in distress will become depressed because he has never been exposed to being sad. <br /> <br /> The show is also extremely poor. Each syllable is called the highest level of exaggeration and very trivial. It's excessive. <br /> <br /> For children, it's fun, but after the age of 2 you won't want your children to see it. They will never know how to grow.
