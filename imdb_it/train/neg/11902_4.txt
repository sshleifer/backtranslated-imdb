The hysterical thing about this film is that, according to the director, he finds it difficult to find a distributor in the United States because most of those who saw it could not reconcile the seemingly conflicting messages between Christianity and American anguish. The thought that anyone sees it as a religious film in any case is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Why does a mission minister pray with the homeless or want someone "Godspeed" this makes him a "Christian" movie? It could be interpreted that in reality it is mocking religion in the "Land of Abundance" with all its material excess, the best an organized mission can do is distribute a bowl of soup and a Bible verse. Maybe a lot of unfortunate or oppressed? A lot of useless homeless missions? What about many Vietnam veterans? As a delusional survivor of "pink" mess agents, do we have to think that America is a "land of plenty" of paranoid patriots? Maybe we have a lot of psychiatric patients? We certainly don't have many people worried about Palestinian politics based on the telephone conversation of the main characters in the film. Of course, if you worked in a German homeless shelter, the unfortunate would be much more worried about peace in a distant land than for his own personal survival, as the world knows how Europe is the "continent of abundance" when it's about sophistication. /> <br /> In fact I agree with the title, in the end, given that the United States is the "Land of Plenty" and in this specific case it refers to the abundance of poor screenplays, amateur acting and dispassionately direct films . Life is too short and one, even an American, does not have "much time" to lose by looking at this piece.
