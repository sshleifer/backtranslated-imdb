This film was a disappointment. I couldn't wait to see a good movie. I'm the kind of person who starts a movie and doesn't turn it off until the end, but I forced myself not to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't turn it off is because I'm a big Christian Slater fan and I wanted to see him play. I was really speechless after I finished watching the movie. <br /> <br /> This film was one of the worst movies I saw in my life. Thank you Christian Slater for giving us some humor. If I had not been in this film, I would have been bored to death. <br /> <br /> I also agree that Anthony Hopkins needs to stick to acting. When the film is finished, I didn't even understand the plot. I was confused and annoyed at the same time.
