Normally I have no problems with free oaths in the movies, but this really annoyed me. All they did was swear. For the whole movie. (And, as someone else noticed, he got cancer) It was boring, rambling and pretentious. I wouldn't do it if I were you. <br /> <br /> It is also not that I do not like films that, like most people who like to claim "look at life". I love Eat Drink Man Woman, and all that happens is that a load of Taiwanese leads their lives. But I could identify with them. I have never met anyone who has sworn as much as the "actors" in this film, and I worked at a construction site. So go figure it out. That said, William H. Macy made me smile. One time. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid, unless you like boredom.
