... so I thought about adding a few words about William McNamara. It's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in his tighty-whities - it's obvious he pumped for this role and he looks really damn good at them - or not. There is an extended sequence in a cave where he has to undress to his underwear. There's a lot where he has to chase Miss Eleniak in the buff, with only his hands cupped on his groin. William McNamara is naturally a little thin, but he has a nice, generous handful of booty. Also, there is a moment when you get out of bed that if you stop the action at the right time you can see the whole enchilada. If you are inclined to do it, come on, half of the people who choose to watch a movie on Navy men on a "road trip" are. I would just like to thank Dennis Hopper for his free equal opportunity nudity. Can William McNamara act? Damn if I know.
