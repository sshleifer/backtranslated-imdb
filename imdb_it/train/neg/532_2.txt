This is just PPV. I don't want to waste too much time on this because most of the posters here put it better than I could ever have, but I wanted to say a few things. <br /> <br /> I didn't know which was more fun: Redgrave chased small moths and stumbled into his nurse; Wailing scream that his "precious" boy (whom she and Mr. had decided to be a drunken loser) was turned into a roadkill; that Ann was sweetened by Peggy Lee; or the horrible CGI of Crypt Keeper Annie staring at his younger self! <br /> <br /> I never bought Danes like the young Redgrave. I didn't buy Richardson and Collette as sisters either. If Meryl Streep's daughter wants to be an actress, it's better for her to give her some lessons! I had no idea why no girl (or Buddy) would make fun of herself for the stupid stud du jour Harris! Ann's daughters are as lucid and reckless as she is, Luc is a retarded late on crack, and I didn't do any of them rotten! In the evening he gives Chick Flicks a bad name!
