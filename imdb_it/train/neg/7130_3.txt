This movie should have been called Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who have not played games, Need For Speed ​​is based mainly on hot cars and beautiful women and almost no storyline. This applies perfectly to Redline. The only thing about this movie that was A-Level was the machines. The acting seemed forced and dramatized, the premise was fragile, and the plot was almost non-existent. I really saw this movie just to see how bad it was and, while it was pretty bad, it could have been worse. And at least it was fun. I just hope they showed Eddie Griffin crashing into Enzo somewhere in the movie. All in all, don't pay for it, don't go out of your way to see it, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and there's nothing else, it's a decent distraction.
