There was a Bugs Bunny comic called "Baby Buggy Bunny" which was EXACTLY this plot. Child-faced Finster robbed a bank and the money in the carriage rolled away and fell into Bug's rabbit hole. He disguised himself as a child to enter Bugg's hole to recover the money. The scene of "Little Man" in which he looks in the bathroom mirror while shaving with a cigar in his mouth is directly from the cardboard. This was a hilarious 5-minute cartoon; not so much an entire movie. If you are really interested in this, buy the Bugs Bunny DVD. It was much more original the first time (1954). You will also get many more classic Bugs Bunny comics to boot!
