Well, at first I was excited to download an open source animated film, only to be spoiled by a demo reel. The animation is excellent, the lip-synching is terrible and you continue to watch the film hoping to understand what is happening, only to realize that nothing is happening. You don't feel emotion for the characters, just pity for the creators for wasting time. I've seen short films with twice the emotions in half the time! This could be an excellent short film, if they had just taken the time to hire a real director. I'm sure all Blender users are excited to showcase their software and rendering capabilities, but I'm sorry that the storytelling is what makes a movie.
