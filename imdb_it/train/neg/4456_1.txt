This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. The fact that he has a slight plot is pretty ugly, which linked it to the issue of football violence makes it 100 times worse. <br /> <br /> I had serious doubts about the premise of this movie before I started watching, but I had an open mind enough to accept the way writers see fit to introduce the character of Elijah Wood Matt into the scene of hooligans. <br /> <br /> But the film throws the imprecision after the inaccuracy, to the point that in the middle of the film everyone makes you shiver more than before. <br /> <br /> Explain a few things: hooligans do not tend to destroy their pub before a run of the mill league game; they do not prepare to kill each other; they are NOT wearing ONLY Stone Island (and others in the crowd, thugs or not, they do). Certainly they do not, when they have taken the exception for a new member of society, they move to the territory of their rival companies for the cake and the puree. And I'd like to meet the guy who would go to the top boy of his company for the rival company. (Even if you can scratch what I've said about the setting, kill each other if it exists). <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I have yet to see a movie on the subject that doesn't do t contain any fanciful whims, but this is on par with The Firm for its inability. <br /> <br /> I found it ironic that Wood's American nemesis is morally condemned by his character to be a cocaine user, when it is in part and parcel of the British hooligan scene. The film chooses not to challenge Wood's morality and instead moves away from any company that uses coca. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think I understand what I want to do. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it's highly unimaginative, and I'm sure if I hadn't spent the whole movie complaining about the points, and more done above then I would have guessed what was happening before how I didn't do it. And believe me, I was in front of me. <br /> <br /> I have the distinct impression that this film is for men, with the hope that women will enjoy the injection of emotional problems that are raised. <br /> <br /> If I'm right, the producers have failed completely. It is too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows the scene, and I can't believe that the type of woman looking for emotional movies doesn't give a damn about the characters because of their violent tendencies. <br /> <br /> Are there good points? Maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and shot, but I'm rarely hit by the slow-motion action, certainly not when it comes to fighting, because the point is that a ruck is pretty exciting anyway. <br /> <br /> There are some fun, if not realistic, moments. Wood's trip to school made me smile. But some slightly amusing moments hardly compensate for the vision of two hours of complete slag. <br /> <br /> If you are a Brit you avoid like the plague, if not just to further develop misconceptions about the scene, if you're not in the know. If you are American, you can enjoy it, as it is clearly adapted to the market. But no one can deny that the plot is fragile, predictable and, ultimately, over the top.
