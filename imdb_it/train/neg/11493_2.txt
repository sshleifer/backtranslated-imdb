Störtebeker is truly one of the worst TV mini-series ever made on this planet. <br /> <br /> The acting is unbearable and the historical background is mostly meaningless: just two examples: Visby was shown as a village of three houses. Instead, it was an important city right now, the best days have already passed. Secondly, Hamburg would never have been the city that dealt with pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea, the main city at that time was Lübeck. <br /> <br /> But worse than all this: the direction! How can an amateur like this be allowed to direct a film like this? Impossible! There was not a single credible scene, the fights were ridiculous and I could not suppress the laughter in the most severe scenes. <br /> <br /> I can't understand how a large TV station could be so incompetent.
