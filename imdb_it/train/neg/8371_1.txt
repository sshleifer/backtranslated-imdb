I think it's pretty safe to say that this is the worst movie ever made, when I saw the trailer on TV I already knew from the second one that it would be a piece of **** and it would be better to avoid it, but somehow I was dragged into see this from some friends, I entered the cinema with low expectations but I was hoping there would be a couple of economic laughs to keep me awake during this movie. The so-called "jokes" in this film bring a hint to the face, they are mostly made up of people who hit the face and the balls, the child seems strange and behaves like a horny gangsta and the typical jokes of the breed that we see so often in today's garbage comedies. The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe, but also predictable and boring. The characters are extremely annoying and strongly stereotyped. I never want to see this movie again ****, I'd rather take a bullet in the foot than be exposed to this piece of pussy again. If someone I see says he liked it, I'll physically punish them in the face
