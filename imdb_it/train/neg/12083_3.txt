Yay! ... I think. It's hard to say. It is difficult to have an emotion for a film that has no emotions. This film is as sterile as a surgeon's scalpel. For an environment, it has some stone pillars, some stone places, a couple of stone crosses and some stone actors. They have no emotion! The only thing that saves this film is the fact that it is Hamlet, and Hamlet is an extraordinarily written piece of literature. The dubbing really wasn't that bad. The voices were faithful to the dull, gloomy, dark atmosphere that sucked the life the film had produced. I saw this version of Hamlet on the fabulous Mystery Science Theater 3000 three times, and each of the three times, I was on the verge of turning off the TV, despite being MST 3K. <br /> <br /> Not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better.
