From time to time, a group of friends, with a minimal budget but bags of enthusiasm and talent, will create a low-budget masterpiece that takes the world of horror by storm. Raimi and co. he did it with The Evil Dead, Jackson and friends succeeded with Bad Taste; and Myrick and Sanchez have become mental with The Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> The director Todd Sheets and his friends, however, are destined to bask forever in relative darkness if Zombie Bloodbath is something to follow. A lesson on how not to make a cheapo horror, this miserable effort (on a plague of carnivorous zombies? Natch) serves as a reminder that, while many people these days have access to a video camera, most should not take that as their own cue to try out a feature film. <br /> <br /> It's not that Sheets doesn't have an eye for a well-framed shot (some of his camera angles and movements are actually pretty good), but rather that a) has a disgusting script b) has a poor cast, and c) doesn't realize he has a bad script and a cast. Which means that the final film is amateur to the extreme and unlikely to be viewed in its entirety by anyone who is not a zombie of completist films (like me) or cast and crew members (like those who gave the film favorable comments ). <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath is obviously aimed at indiscriminate hunting dogs, and Sheets (who currently has an incredible 34 titles at his head as a director) certainly does his best to settle for buckets of offal and blood thrown in every occasion. But while these moments are undeniably unfortunate, they are not particularly convincing, and soon they become rather boring. <br /> <br /> So to sum up, this is a really bad film, with almost no saving features. Except for two: <br /> <br /> First, it features the biggest single mullet in the film's history, as demonstrated by Jerry Angell, who plays Larry (as well as several zombies). The magnificence of his barnet (combined with an attractive whisker) is the only reason to watch this film. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it has "pathetic invisible zombies": carnivorous corpses waiting for unfortunate victims to wander, before jumping from their hiding place to launch a weak attack, which requires almost no effort to escape. Best known for hiding behind a door for hours waiting for someone to open it, "pathetic furtive zombies" occasionally hide behind low walls, or sit in churches that present themselves as members of the congregation. <br /> <br /> Normally a film this bad would have gotten 1/10 for me, but, to celebrate the flowing locks of Jerry Angell, I will generously generate my vote at 2/10.
