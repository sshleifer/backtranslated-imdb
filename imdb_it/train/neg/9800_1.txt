The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came out in 1993, presumably based on the Japanese TV show I started in the 1970s. Now as a fan of Japanese action films and series, you'd think I'd like to kick this show. <br /> <br /> You could not be more wrong. What worked in the Japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with powerful Mino power rangers. <br /> <br /> MMPR is based on five teenagers who gain powers to become costumed superheroes with robotic dinosaurs that form an even bigger robot. <br /> <br /> Now this premise is more far-fetched and more laughable than any other in both Transformers movies, however, the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> It was followed by two evils, and I mean, really bad movie knock offs, and the actors in this series, completely disappeared from the scene. <br /> <br /> If you have to choose, try looking at the Japanese Zyuranger series instead. <br /> <br /> Also, what happens with the horrible 90s long cuts and all the boys' earrings? It makes them all look feminine!
