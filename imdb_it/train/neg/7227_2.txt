While others might argue that looking at other Bilal works, you will appreciate this film better, failing in an important way. It is not alone. The plot is a mixture that confuses symbolism with substance. Here is an idea that starts with a defined story. So it creates the symbolism around it. We start with two different narratives, this female who is somehow becoming human, a "god" who for some reason is judged, but who gets a last adventure on Earth, and this mysterious character of John who seems to be developing a sort of "resort" "just beyond the city limits. Why? None of these questions has an answer. But we care, no. There is no development that wants us to empathize with any character in the story, the closer we get Jill and also then development is questionable at best. Unfortunately the film is captured by the whole visual aspect (which it is), but at the expense of motivational development.I would like to see this rewritten by someone who could distance themselves a bit from the material and not have to hear each image must be in the photo.
