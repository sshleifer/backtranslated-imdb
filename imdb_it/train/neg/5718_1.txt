There was no characterization in this film and it really shows how much this talented talent who directed this needs to learn his craft. All of his characters in this movie were so unlikely and I could care less. The best point in this film was the end credits and the long shower time after this cause I felt so damn dirty that I wasted money on this stinky load. Hey genius ... triads and yakuza come from two different places to learn something about Asian culture. The scene of the dog in this I felt so attached and useless. This DVD proves useful I love my new coaster. <br /> <br /> So the kids don't waste your money on this lousy hostel.
