Very witty, and rightly degrading, adaptation to the classic children's story, not only does he lack the charm of his ancestor, but lacks talent as ever. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance which is a clear rip-off of what Jim Carrey has done, but should give up acting all together. It's so annoying that you'd like to beat him if you can jump into the movie. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor. I've seen a lot of bad movies this year, but this not only takes the cake, but it's undoubtedly one of the worst films ever made.
