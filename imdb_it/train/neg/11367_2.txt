Greg Davis and Bryan Daly take some crazy statements of terrorists, add some comments from a group of extreme right-wing reactionaries, attribute the most extreme positions of the most fundamentalist Muslims on the planet to anyone who calls himself a Muslim and present him as the theology of Islam . Perhaps their next film will involve interviews with Fred Phelps and the congregation of the Westboro Baptist Church, adding comments by some militant "scholars" atheists and calling their film "What the world needs to know about Christianity". After all, this film suffers from poor production values ​​and lack of attention to the most basic standards of journalism. Don't waste time and money, just turn on the AM radio and listen to Rush Limbaugh for a couple of days for free and you will receive the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis.
