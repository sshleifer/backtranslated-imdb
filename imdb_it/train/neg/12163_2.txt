The absolutely putrid slasher film does not have a redeemable quality. He has camp counselor Angela (Pamela Anderson ... as horrible as the killer, his jokes when people are wasted are not even funny) on the warpath that kills teenagers who do the slightest bad or resist his pleas for a good behavior. We run the range of boring killings, clich√©s like the throat cut for a child in search of his clawed Freddy glove, a child who gets a chainsaw, a girl who gets punctured, one who is pushed into the toilet (full of leeches), one which is roasted, etc. <br /> <br /> It has no original idea to offer and is simply a waste of time. This unless you want to see Valerie Hartmen's tits (who plays the slut Ally). Most violence occurs off-screen, so even that doesn't satisfy.
