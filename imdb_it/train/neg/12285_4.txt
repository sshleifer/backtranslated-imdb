The plot is absurd and lame, and even performance and dialogue are difficult to keep open. I advise you to have a caffeinated friend on hand to wake you up in time for a couple of Gore effects. Why do they bring Alcatraz? In this case, it becomes increasingly difficult to swallow. All the while, I was wondering who this movie aimed at? Chock full of blade subtrames (such as cannibalism captain of the US military) This is low level in every aspect. This film is forbidden in Germany !!
