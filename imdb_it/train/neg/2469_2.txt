I suppose if you like an endless dialogue that does not convey the story and flashy visual effects like the transitions of the scene in the television program _Angel_, you will enjoy the movie. Myself? All I wanted was a good story, and it wasn't there. The rhythm was practically set back, the plot points were buried under a sea of ​​unnecessary dialogue, and there was absolutely no sense of terror, or tension, or ANYTHING. <br /> <br /> Is it the redneck? Is it the Wendigo? No, he is a speed cameraman. It's not scary. It does not generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you are afraid of MTV. Like those reviewers before me, I too noticed that in the end the film calls for derisive laughter from the public. <br /> <br /> Terrible film.
