The trailer for this film interested me enough to justify the DVD rental. However, the resulting film is absolutely terrible! Of course, this is not the worst movie ever made, or the worst movie of this year, but it came damn close! <br /> <br /> The main problem is the film that doesn't know what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? The story is interesting, as it addresses the pitfalls of mail order brides, but the film is a disaster. What begins as a slightly interesting "comedy" (a word I use in the most free terms possible), then goes completely backwards and degenerates into a very dark and disgusting misogynist thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better and Ben Chaplin is wasted! As are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, which I can only presume to have done this for the money. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie in just about every single aspect. It's not funny, it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for all he did, and the dramatic elements are definitely bad. A film to avoid, unless it is absolutely necessary to see Kidman or Chaplin in each of their films!
