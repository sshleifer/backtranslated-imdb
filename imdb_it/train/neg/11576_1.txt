I saw him at the UCSB reel festival and he was * shocked * that he won the Golden Reel Award. I was not the only one, considering that the public had mixed reactions to the piece. I thought there were many other better films, but then I learned that the judges were strongly rooted in the area of ​​film theory and other artistic nonsense. While cinematography and editing are on par with many other short films, storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece. It seems that films for "serious" students must include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle and possible suicide: the cops Nick and Kate go out and include all three. Please be more original! <br /> <br /> Oh, and it could be my outsider's opinion, but the montecito guy seems a bit fake. Is anyone else like this?
