Much worse than the original. Actually it was * painful * to sit down, and he was barely interested in six years. <br /> <br /> The introduction of some new Pokemon is marginally interesting, but the plot is very thin, the dialogue is still bad and the music is mediocre. Watch the TV show instead: it's much better.
