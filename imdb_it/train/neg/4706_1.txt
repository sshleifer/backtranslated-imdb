That's right, you heard me this movie is a fucking 'ABOMINATION. First of all, the band, who the hell is going to see or listen to a band called "THE NAKED BROTHERS BAND"?!?! Not only is the name terrible, but so are the musicians, they don't even know how to play! Furthermore, the lead singer looks more feminine than Geddy Lee, and even more his voice is horrible! They are not just terrible musicians, but they are terrible actors. Guided by a filthy director and subtle plot, this is the stupidest film ever. I would like this website to allow you to use a vote of ZERO OR UNDER 10, because giving a little dirt to the 1/10 is too generous. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure you could call this a comedy movie. If you are looking for a comedy with music, go to that guy "Weird Al" Yankovic because he does it much better than these tween with no talent.
