For Daniel Auteuil, `Queen Margot 'was much better. For Nastassja Kinski, `Paris, Texas' was much better. The biggest disappointments were Chris Menges ("CrissCross" and "A World Apart" can't even be compared to this), and Goran Bregovic for using a version of the same "Queen Margot" theme for this film ( Attention to the end of the film). If this was an American pop movie, I wouldn't feel surprised; but for a European film with independent actors and directors, such a common approach to child abuse without original insights is very simple and disappointing. There are those villains who kidnap and sell minors. There are those poor children who hate the people who sell them and expect to be saved by someone. And finally, there is that great hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from the bad ones. Each character is shown in simple black and white terms: good versus evil. Moreover, from the beginning, I could understand how the story would end. Is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse? I believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and pedophilia is much more complex than it is represented in this not very original film. I think this film was not disturbing, but very disappointing.
