A family with dad Louis (Dale Midkiff), mom Rachel (Denise Crosby), 10-year-old Eileen (Blaze Berdalh and about 3 years Gage (Miko Hughes) move to this beautiful Maine home - apparently unaware of the semi-final that roars along 'Highway in front of their house about every 90 seconds! The neighbor (the wonderful Fred Gwynne) makes them feel at home ... and shows them a pet cemetery where the children bury their pets. that can bring the dead back to life ... but the dead come back in a bad mood. <br /> <br /> "" DEFINITE SPOILERS ** Stephen King's novel was good - it was but he developed characters and situations that they made you worry about what happened.This movie downloads ALL the development of the character and plays only on blood and violence.The animals are killed on camera (I know it's fake but it's still repulsive), hit by a seed and the his box set a pre during funerals (in a totally sick scene), he is brought back to life and attacks and kills people including his mother (I wonder how a 3 year old child was able to hang her); a ghostly jogger (don't ask) tries to help the family for no reason ... The film simply acts on the audience pushing every gruesome death or violence on your face. Do everything to surprise you. ** DO SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Acting is not helpful. Midkiff is as horrible as his father: he is handsome and funny but totally inexpressive. Crosby is not much better. The two children are just annoying. Only Gwynne alone saves this image with its good, effortless acting. <br /> <br /> This photo shows a total disregard for the public that is making great strides in logic and making incredibly stupid characters (especially Midkiff at the end). This film was (inexplicably) a huge box office success in 1989 that led to the even worse sequel of 1992. I saw it in a theater at the time and it upset me that the public continued to cheer for violence and he was simply horrified by what I saw. A repulsive and sick horror film. A 1 all the way. <br /> <br /> When you think it's all over and can't get worse, the Ramones sing a song of the title !!!!!! ("I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery"). Really incredible.
