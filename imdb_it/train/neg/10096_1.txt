This film must be the worst I've ever seen. The title of the film deceives the public into thinking that perhaps there is hope. The plot of the film is ridiculous at most, with the acting so poor that you just have to shudder. The title "Zombie Nation" implies a mass of zombies when in reality there are six in total. This cannot be classified as a horror movie due to the introduction of 80's music when the zombie attack. Zombies actually talk and behave like human beings in the film with the only difference being that it looks like a La Roux video. If you ever get the chance to buy this movie, do it, then burn the copy.
