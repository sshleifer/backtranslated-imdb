I just saw this movie and I didn't read the book. The positive thing about the film is that in some parts you are reminded of the spiritual subject, evolution, synchronicity and your part in the world for a while. <br /> <br /> However, the immersion of the film breaks easily and there is very little relationship between the viewer and the characters. It is very clear that the book loses a lot in this film version. The events that had to show the ongoing synchronicity are almost unrecognizable. A lot of reasoning must be done to see that the scene indicates a coincidence, and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a bigger purpose. <br /> <br /> The Enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create the best feeling they should have. Do you remember enlightenment with Keanu Reeves (in the Little Buddha)? Well, this is nothing of the kind. <br /> <br /> Most of the scenes are poorly executed. There are many scenes that do not actually develop the story and do not help create an atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The best actors in this film, namely Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow, cannot save her. The first 2 seem to have gotten more scenes of their characters in an attempt to save the film, and because they have been paid more, but that doesn't work. Most scenes are not really necessary and they do not help the story at all. <br /> <br /> Jürgen does good in his scenes and sells like a villain (as always), but the script doesn't help everyone. The scene in which he tries to convince John (Matthew Settle) to join him for the first time is just a bad script. The execution of the scene when it dies in an explosion is absurdly evil. Flashbacks of the whole film cannot even be commented. <br /> <br /> Overall this film is a great waistline, read the book! I haven't read it, but it's probably a billion times better than this, it has to be. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I had to write my first comment in IMDb.
