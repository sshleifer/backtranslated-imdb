This film is ridiculous. Anyone who says that acting is exceptional and that the casting is superb has never even seen a mediocre cinema. The acting is obviously terrible in the first 5 characters you meet. Boring. I feel like all the other "soaring" comments must have been made by people associated with the directors. I wasn't very impressed with the plot, but I just wanted to see some beautiful Oregon countryside, and there was a decent cinematography - but the casting was all BUT It was inspired. I think this film is also a mockery of the general noble suggestion that something profound in Amerindian culture has been ignored and perhaps lost and that revitalizing it is useful and possible. He puts jokes in the wrong and too obvious places, and makes me think that it was written by the State Department or something. Back to the drawing board. Even to suggest that this film deserves a place in the same vicinity as classics like Harold and Maude is absolutely delayed, and along the same line of begging and pretense and "joke" as is rampant in this film.
