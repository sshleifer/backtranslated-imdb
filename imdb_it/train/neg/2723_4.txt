Claire Denis's films appear to fall into one of two categories: the violent and the bloody or the quiet and intimate. "L'Intrus" definitely falls into the first category, but it's not as horrible as "Trouble Every Day" or "J'ai pas sommeil." <br /> <br /> Now, since I saw "Chocolat", I decided to see every new movie that Denis does. And I've always been disappointed. "The Intrus" was no exception. He has not yet made a personal and moving film like his first film. <br /> <br /> You have many of Denis's regulars: a more mature but still magnificent Béatrice Dalle who seems to be in the film only to show his full lips, the gap between his teeth, his wide neckline and a pair of beautiful coats; the black guy from "Trouble Every Day" and "J'ai pas sommeil", Grégoire Colin, and that Lithuanian or Russian girl. The character of Michel Subor was quite interesting, but the camera focused on him so much that I was annoyed by that curly tuft of hair hanging over his forehead and raised me when, somewhere in Korea, I think , he finally cut it. <br /> <br /> There was certainly a bit of action - gruesome murders, the search for a man for a child - and there may even have been a plot, but a vision was not enough to understand it and two visions are , I'm afraid, out of the question. First, the score was unpleasant and intrusive (as in "Beau Travail"). For another, the seasons have changed too abruptly, leaving you even more confused about what was happening. Oh, there have been some good shots, and if you liked "Friday Evening" with its pleats in heavy drapes and sheets, you might appreciate the "L'Intrus" aesthetic. Otherwise, keep <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in French and it is possible that I missed something crucial. But the dialogue in a film by Denis rarely exceeds five pages, with double spacing and wide margins. In "Chocolat" silence is sublime; in "The Intrus", it's simply boring.
