During a sleepless night, I was going through the canals and found this embarrassment for a movie. What were they thinking? <br /> <br /> If this is life after "Remote Control" for Kari (Wuhrer) Salin, it's no wonder she hasn't gone anywhere. <br /> <br /> And why did David Keith take this? role? It's pathetic! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I turned the movie towards the end, so I didn't get much of the plot. But this must have been the best part. This nerdy college boy takes this dominatrix girl home ... this scene came straight out of the comics - or from cheap porn movies. Call the anal mother retentive and kiss the father "Oh, I didn't expect the tongue!" Great lines! <br /> <br /> After this, I had to see how it turned out .. <br /> <br /> Well of course, this bitch of hell has a helluva past, so the SWAT team is upstairs . And yes ... they surround it! AND YES YES! The boy blows her brains out !!!! AHAHHAHAHAHA !! <br /> <br /> This is a must see TV. <br /> <br />
