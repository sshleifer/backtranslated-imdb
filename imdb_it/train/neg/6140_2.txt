This film is hilarious. The problem is that it is not a comedy. A classic scene requires that Kurt Thomas is just about to find a horse with handles in the middle of a village square (he uses to hit the bad guys). Another is trekking in the "Villaggio dei Pazzi". Too bad this movie wasn't made to be a farce, or it got better grades.
