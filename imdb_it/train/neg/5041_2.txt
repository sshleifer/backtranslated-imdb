Ye Lou's film, Purple Butterfly, hosts a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against Japanese forces in the war torn in Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and his former lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance encounter. <br /> <br /> I agree with the Paris reviewer. The film replaces a contorted and semi-historical conflict for a plot, without giving the public a single reason to worry about the characters or their causes. The sudden shift of time does not help things as it appears completely unjustified and useless. Normally I don't care about obscure films, but the absence of light, the footage with flickering bones and bad filmmaking techniques really make this movie hard to watch and stay interested. I also agree with the viewer from Georgia that this film "has a chaotic editing style and a claustrophobic cinematography", but I don't think this helps the film. The background of the film is one of the most powerful events of the 20th century and I don't think we can do justice by modifying it as if it were a Michael Bay film. Excessively melodramatic moments do not increase its veracity. <br /> <br /> The actors are all adequately melancholy. Zhang Ziyi once again proves to have an exceptionally limited range of acting while he spends the entire movie doing what he seems to do best in all his films, mulling over and generally looking annoyed. However, at least she adds a bit of variety to this role with chains cinema and engaging in the worst love scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very disappointing film, especially seen as it comes from the director of Suzhou He. 2/10
