What was it supposed to be? A Fisher King remake? Why do we care about Sandler's character? What a slow, sad, boring movie that gives a lot of people !!! Simply painful to sit down, I turned it off before it was finished. It's so obvious that Cheadle needs help as much as Sandler; as I said: can you say "Fisher King"? And how does this psychotic character work in his daily life? We shouldn't think so deeply, I guess. Why does Cheadle continue to give Sandler the opportunity to become violent with him? If they were such good friends, how did they split up? If Cheadle is so in control, why do you keep looking for the shrink advice on the street? We have never been told. That's why Fisher King was a better film on so many levels and why this sucks. Almost 8 out of 10 average score? I disagree Not at all. Even the best films are lucky to have such a high average score, and this shit doesn't deserve to be in the same universe with them.
