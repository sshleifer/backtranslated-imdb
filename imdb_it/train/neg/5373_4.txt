This is a classic example of a growing problem with movies. Why is the background noise and the soundtrack dramatically stronger than the dialogue? What does it mean? This film is not alone. Most movies seem to do it now. For 2 years, I wondered if it was just something wrong with my TV, but then I had a new TV and here it is again. The background noise that could be set in a block behind the actors suffocates the dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this film it was even more annoying because, in the English version, the woman constantly mumbles. I kept hoping that Jean Reno would say "Excuse me, you would talk or you will get the marbles out of your mouth". If you watch it on DVD and you even have high school French, I recommend the French version with subtitles. <br /> <br /> I dedicate 4 because Reno was so good in Leon. People are enthusiastic about the landscape, but I saw it on a TV and lived in the Rockies for a few years, then "Enh".
