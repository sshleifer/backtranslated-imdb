Kareena Kapoor in bikini hmmmmmmmm. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar ... <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor .... <br /> <br /> Maybe Saif .... <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Good banner .. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in bikini ..... <br /> <br /> There is no good reason for not seeing this movie .... Or so I thought ........ These people did not do JBJ ... <br /> <br /> Why or Why I forgot it. <br /> <br /> For all the criticism the first half of the film is not so bad ... <br /> <br /> There are some intrigue and YOU FEEL AN ORDER OF MIXED IRRITATION WITH EXCITEMENT I HAVE FELT WHEN I SEE THE BOY RITCHIE MOVIE LIKE LOCK STOCK AND SNATCH. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor is sizzling in a very thin type of model. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar as only he can be. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is annoying but funny, YOU FORGET ALMOST OF THE MAXIMUM THAT YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND HIM. <br /> <br /> Saif is sidey ala Main Khiladi .. again. <br /> <br /> There is some laughter and some laughter, and some goose bumps during the love affair kareena-saif (kareena in the rain, behind me on my bike hmmmmmmm) . <br /> <br /> BUT A LOT OF THIS MEANS PROMISED MORE THAN DELIVERY ..... <br /> <br /> THAT MAKES THE SECOND HALF EVERYTHING THE MOST UNSTABLE .... <br /> <br / > There was almost applause when the break came not only because of the wet kareena due to what people thought was things to come. <br /> <br /> INSTEAD THEY WERE TREATED TO MIND THE NUMERATION TORTURE THAT IS DIFFICULT TO PUT INTO WORDS. <br /> <br /> Saif suddenly sewn up like a comedian ... <br /> <br /> SUDDENLY THE SEXY KAREENA IS ALSO OBTAINED THAT EVEN THE LAST FLOOR IS NOW EMPTY AND ITS FRONT WATCHES BIG FOR HIS BODY (only girls can see this and point out to other boys that the second last floor was my observation). <br /> <br /> ANIL KAPOOR AND ITS SIDEKICKS GET YOUR NERVES. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the only one to complete the madness, but even after a while it becomes intolerable. <br /> <br /> EVERYTHING IS SUBJECT TO ABSURITY AFTER THE OTHER. <br /> <br /> WHY ?? !! WHAT??!!! WHEN?!!! WHERE IS IT?!!! WHAT I DID TO DESERVE THIS ... <br /> <br /> A collective panting crossed the audience before every song of the second half, which was normal even without the film that surrounds it. <br /> <br /> It is no longer possible to alleviate the trauma .... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION. <br /> <br /> THIS FILM STARTS FROM A BUZZ THAT FEEL YOU MAY ALSO MAKE ON A HIGH BUT IT SLOWLY MOVES TOWARDS A MYSTERY AND THEN QUICKLY TURNS INTO A FULL BLOOD ATTACK. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie for any other reason than the academic interest. <br /> <br /> + s Cast, Akshay Kumar, first half. <br /> <br /> +/- s what, when, how, who to much confusion. (Need a book to fill this). <br /> <br /> + cast, the whole second half (many pages are needed to fill this). <br /> <br /> total 3/10 (I'm trying to avoid even the 1s and 2s don't seem extreme but I'm not mistaken this film is unwatchable, no matter how decent the first half is).
