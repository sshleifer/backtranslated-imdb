I think I was attracted to this film both for the sound of the story and for the main actor, so I gave it a chance, from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is the police, in particular Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), he is forced to run on the run forming a gang and going against them to erase his and his family names. That's all I can say about the story, because I wasn't paying close attention to being honest. He also starred as Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick , Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger does a good performance, for what it's worth, and the film has its captivating moments, especially with a shooting towards the end, but I can't say I enjoyed it since I didn't watch everything. All right!
