Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea to start with. The last film was a mediocre effort. Put it next to this load, it's a comedy classic. While the second part was full of dated humor and cheap shots, at least it was fun. There is nothing funny about forced humor. The jokes, the pratfalls and the gags of sight should be naturally amusing. Hitting the viewer on the head with tired jokes is not nice. The humor of this film is aimed at young idiots who will laugh at anything. When they addressed the public of middle schools, every sense of self-respect was thrown out of the window. The parodies of the rings are not funny. I've seen them in plays since 1998. They are so dated. Even Michael Jackson's jokes are not good. What is even worse is that making fun of two failures was "performer" whose best days were NEVER. <br /> <br /> The death of American cinema has been slow. Movies like this are the nails that are hammered into his coffin. Whatever happened to true humor? I haven't laughed aloud in a cinema for a long time. Too many bad movies rot the brain. Do you want proof? Go to your local video rental store and see what's on the shelves. This movie is bad. Don't believe the hype. I'd rather watch Scary Movie 2 in a continuous loop than suffer again with this excuse of a play! <br /> <br /> Definitely not recommended (unless you have a handful of brain cells).
