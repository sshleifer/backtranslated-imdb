(spoiler) <br /> <br /> I should have imagined it. The DVD didn't even show the time or how long it was. I thought Wild Cardz was the worst anime movie I had ever seen. This is much worse. It does not make sense. Plot thrown together. Everything so we can see the oversized breasts on a figure that does not support them. <br /> <br /> It was supposed to be a student film. This got quality C <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 1/10 Entertainment: 6/10 (until I found out it wouldn't be finished). the end makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Replayable: 0/10
