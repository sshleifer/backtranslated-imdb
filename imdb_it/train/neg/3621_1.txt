I hated this show when I was a child. That was the day when the children show that the characters really have accents, not just the bland, generic, general American dialect we're used to. Jack Wild had a British accent and that of Pufnstuf was southern. As one of the others mentioned, however, I never really understood what was the agreement with the witch who wanted the flute. It always seemed strange to me, probably because the flute only bothered me and I would have had no problem taking it away! <br /> <br /> Just a comment on Pufnstuf's resemblance to McDonalds' 70s commercials that others have mentioned: Pufnstuf snatched McDonalds away. At the height of McDonalds' popularity, the TV show (or rather, their creators) tried to fire the McDonald characters for their show, but when McDonalds declined the TV show, he changed the characters slightly and passed them on. They even hired former employees of the McDonalds advertising agency and voice actors to make TV programs. McDonalds sued and won. Look for the cause of Pufnstuf McDonaldland and you will find many articles about it.
