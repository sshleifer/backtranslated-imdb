This film is a calculated attempt to cash in on the success of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. In fact, if they had called Sex at a Funeral, they could have done better at the box office. <br /> <br /> But the film falls between two stools and can't get up. The characters unleash an improbably luminous dialogue, but they never act in any way remotely recognizable as human. An arbitrary, senseless action follows another to advance what passes through a plot, and soon gets tired of the falsity of the whole enterprise. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell gets points for playing his little heart, but the honors of the shows are stolen by Imelda Staunton, like all things, a police detective (don't they have a height requirement there?) . Mrs Staunton seems unable to make a false move. We could say the same about the writer and director. <br /> <br /> If Notting Hill has bothered you like a fake, stay away from this. Phonus bolognus on the half-shell.
