This long lost thought is sometimes available on the web. So he bought me a copy. Well, obviously the acting is terrible and the plot is childish but it has its moments. I think the people who tried it also know the background. It was made by a grindhouse cinema owner for an extremely low budget. But for me it certainly didn't ruin the money on props but on makeup. The trick is for that kind of well-made film. The zombies are watchable and the blood is intact. The only problem with that type of film is the quality of the film. It's terrible, luckily no hiss on the sound, but sometimes it's too dark. So you have to look clearly to see the blood. In a fun way they tried to actually sell this not for the finicky. A voiceover tells the beginning of the film to pay attention to a sign and a man who appears with green flashes, telling you that there is a gore on the road. Of course it doesn't work, it made me think of Cannibal Girls, it had that annoying bell when red things started to flow. They had the original idea, Cannibal Girls was created a year earlier. Don't go for the plot, go for the zombies and notice a continuity error. When the girl and the boy make love first take the bra, then they make love and suddenly her panties are back ... try to do it, or I'm getting a little offline, ... you eat ugly corpses
