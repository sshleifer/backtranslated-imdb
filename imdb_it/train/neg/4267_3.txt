I saw this film at the Rotterdam Festival, as presumably all other voters. The director was present and seemed to have worked very hard and worked hard on the project, which explains the reception and the above-average vote. It is very similar to an episode of "Round the Twist" feature film by Australian children, but it takes itself too seriously to have that saving feature too. The film itself is perhaps worth seeing if you are looking to do a world film tour by visiting all member states of the United Nations, since I can't think of another Fijian film, but on the whole it was generic, ill interpreted (even if by an amateur cast) and prey to the subaltern mentality. The moral of the story seemed to be that the native islanders will try to ruin each other, but as long as there is an essentially decent white governor to intervene, all problems can be solved (leaving the island).
