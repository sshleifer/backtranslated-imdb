Right away, this film was ridiculous. Not that it didn't have positive aspects? For example, the best thing about this film was the beautiful background scenery. Anyone who does not live on the east coast should know that the South does not have beautiful mountains like those found in the West. I knew it was Utah, but maybe Dalton couldn't suppress his English accent, so they had to excuse him saying it was a southern city. Subverting his accent in a southern one was easier. Of course, the film has twists, but its false sense of place was something I could not overcome. It's not that Utah doesn't have meth labs ... so why writers thought it was necessary to pretend it was in the South is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Another thing in the action images always annoys me. Why do they always make the "cocking" sound effect when the character draws an automatic pistol? It seemed that every other sound effect in this film was a "chuk-chich" meaning that a 9mm was loaded and ready to fire. Obviously, the weapons already had the bombs closed, so it wasn't necessary. <br /> <br /> Finally, the fireworks were WAY over the top. But, hey, this movie was aimed at a certain "market segment", I suppose ... It's too bad. Each of the actors can act, but this film was lame.
