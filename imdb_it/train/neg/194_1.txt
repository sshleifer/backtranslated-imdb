This movie, The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory, is absolutely rubbish. The acting is horrible, it's too patriotic and its historical accuracy is not always at its best (historians would have a field day). It has some good moments but not enough to keep the interest because it's too long. Rating * on **********.
