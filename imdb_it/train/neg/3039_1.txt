I can always tell when something will be a success. I see it or feel it and feel a good feeling. I didn't have a good feeling watching the preview. I was not at all enthusiastic about this film, and it does not surprise me at all that it is classified as one of the worst 100 films. In fact, I proved myself right. <br /> <br /> The first thing that threw me out was the title. Not that I have a problem with ebonics (I'm black, by the way), but for a movie they could have used a better title, and for now use a title that doesn't have a bad grammar. I listened to the dialogue, seeing the acting and all I could do was make faces. I also think the theme of dance film is exaggerated. At least "You Got Served" was better than this in my opinion. Even the soundtrack didn't excite me.
