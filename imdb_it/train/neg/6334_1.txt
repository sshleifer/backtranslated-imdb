I saw this film in 1979, I was 17 or 18 when it was released. The theater was perhaps 1/4 full when the film started. Ten minutes from the movie, me and the friend who went with me to watch the movie were the only two people in the theater. The film was really weird and had no plot or reason for its script and people were asking for their money back. We decided to stay for ALL the movie .... why put up with this torture? ... Here because. We wanted to be true film critics ... having a standard to base all the other films on it is hard to justify by saying that you've seen the best movie (at 10) that always come up with something better. But it's easy to be able to base all the other films of the worst movie ever made (and this is ... a maximum of 1). There may be other films out there that really qualify as 1, but I have yet to see them. Now I base all the films I see on a scale based on this worst .... I AM A REAL FILM CRITIC ... he he.
