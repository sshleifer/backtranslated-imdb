This is actually a pretty bad movie. The ideology is not as perverse as in those films that Collins did later. However, my main doubts about the film are that it is implausible and frankly boring for a long time. The whole concept of a former SAS man who joins terrorists for no particular reason is not very convincing and one cannot help but wonder why a group of highly organized terrorists (who will later become rather ignorant) fall in love with it. The film begins with a rather powerful scene, but then winds for quite some time towards the grand finale. Overall, I think that Who dares wins may have been an interesting 45-minute episode of The Professionals, but the story doesn't have a feature film. Although it was fairly successful at the time when this film began the disappearance of Collins' career, which in the eighties made especially cheap and dubious films of fortune soldiers or the army. Too bad, because in reality he is a rather versatile actor, but at the end of the day Martin Shaw has chosen his roles more carefully and has a career that is still successful.
