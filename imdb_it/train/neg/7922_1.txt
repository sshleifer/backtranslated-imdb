In a distant galaxy there is a planet called Ceta. Native people love cats. But dog people make war on these loving, feline people and have no choice but to go to Earth and grind people for food. This is one of the stupidest ideas of # @ k! Ng for a movie I saw. Leave it to Ted Mikels to make a film more incompetent than the already low standard it had in previous films. It is as if he enjoyed playing in a celluloid limbo game. How low can it go? The only losers in the scenario are the United States. Mr. Mikels and his stupid handlebar mustaches actually have people who STILL buy this shit. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: comment by Ted Mikels; the story behind the realization of (9 and a half minutes); 17 minutes, 15 seconds of footage of Behind the scenes; Filmography of Ted Mikels; and trailer for "The Worm Eaters" "Girl in golden boots", "The doll team", "Ten violent women" (with nudity), "Devil's blood orgy" and "The corpses"
