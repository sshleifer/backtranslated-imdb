I bought this film because this was the debut of Shah rukh khan. And I also enjoyed seeing how he would do it. I must say that he is excellent in his role. Divya Bharathi is superb in this film. Rishi does a wonderful job. Well, Alok nath was good at his role. Amrish and Mohnish also did their parts well. David was also good in his small role. The actors shine in a mediocre film. The management is average. The assembly is poor. History is boring. He talks about Ravi, a famous pop singer. He has a lot of female fans. One of them is Kaajal. Ravi and Kaajal fall in love and get married. Ravi is killed by his cousins. Kaajal becomes a widow ... To escape from Cugini Ravis. They will go to Bombay. You will come across Raja. He falls in love with her and marries. Ravi returns. The story is predictable. The climax is predictable. The first half of the year. And it drags a lot. The second half entertains. The music is catchy with some beautiful songs. Cinematography seems obsolete in the first part but seems unimaginable. The images of the songs are boring except for "Sochenge Tumhe Pyar" and a rain song. The costumes are obsolete. Any way of looking at this only for actors and music. Rating-4/10
