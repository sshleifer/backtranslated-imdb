The classic of the original exploitation - although far from pleasant at almost all levels of some guys who turn cats into human flesh by eating monsters because the cat food they make is made with people has been redone with added scifi elements. Cats never get enough and when meat-tainted food runs out, cats light up their owners. Misunderstood on almost all levels, this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that used to be played in cinemas at the beginning of the 70s, updated with alien breeds of dogs and cats fighting for supremacy. The director Ted Mikel is a hack, but he is such a lovable person (I generally like the guy thanks to his smile that induces interviews and traces of comments) that you can practically excuse the garbage he has mostly discovered. Mikels wanted to make films and didn't care how they behaved until he produced something. More power for him, but I wish he wouldn't submit to his films at home
