There is a lot of good that can be said for this cartoon; the backgrounds are rich, colorful and rich in well-made art deco details. The animation is up to the usual standards of study of the time, which are unquestionably higher than the current ones. However, I find it boring for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> The Music: Definitely not up to the usual standards of Scott Bradley. Although it should probably be evocative of a setting of "Grande Gatsby", it ends up being sad, sleepy, repetitive and monotonous (repetitive and monotonous are not the same, as attested by Beethoven's 5th Symphony). Since most people (including me) tend to close their eyes when they yawn, there is a lot of visual part of the cardboard that the average spectator will miss. <br /> <br /> The Storyline: I'm not giving away all the secrets that are not already in the plot summary - good country, bad city. This is a common theme in movies, both animated and live, from this era. It is a misplaced nostalgia for a non-existent rural idyll, which, in our day, is reflected in a similar nostalgia for "values" that have never been.
