I saw it in the theater when it came out, and just yesterday I saw it again on cable. This was able to regain the feeling of how revolting this film is. The whole group of characters is a narcissistic self-absorption preeners. Worse, it reinforces every negative stereotype of 20-something dating, even if it claims to celebrate people "being". The good guys end up last, the boys shoot great, the most fantastic guys do better. Girls are all toy whores. Only one character ("Wendy") is seen doing something remotely useful to society, and dispenses with her long-saved virginity in a shitty one-night shootout, in a filmed scene we should think is romantic. What it really is is the Hollywood concept of young America: permissive, detached, promiscuous, presumptuous.
