I saw the film as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became the spread of a family joke. If the ranking had a zero, this movie would have understood. The dinosaurs were horrible. The plot was ridiculous. Actually, acting doesn't qualify to be called acting. The only reason I remember the movie's name so well is because my family still talks about how BAD really was.
