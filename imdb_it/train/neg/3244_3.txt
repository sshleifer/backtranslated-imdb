The effect achieved in this story by a psychiatrist who is entertained by scammers is so polite that I have to assume that that was the desired intent. The sets are artificial and at no time did I hear that I was watching a movie. It seemed that the actors were simply reading their lines, rather than answering each other. While the film has elements of the first film noir (except that it is in color) the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre. <br /> <br /> Since the presentation had no appeal to me, I expected at least a compelling story. I'm usually pretty slow on absorption when it comes to stories with twists, but you can see what was coming here within the first fifteen minutes. At the time of the "Gee, I forgot the $ 80,000", I thought to myself that this thing is really ridiculous. For a psychiatrist with experience declared in gambling addictions, behaving so foolishly is beyond imagination. If at any time she behaved like a normal intelligent person, the whole story would have collapsed. <br /> <br /> This wood production left me cold.
