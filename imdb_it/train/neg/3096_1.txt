To begin with, "Hobgoblins" tries to mimic the most successful "Gremlins". It's bad enough, but they don't even try to create something that looks like a movie here. Rather, it is more like a business basement, all that needs to be cleared of embarrassing scenes, inappropriate sound effects, acting like a tasteless and insipid tapioca and a script that keeps everything that humans consider sacred in their films and throws them in the old tube -aroo. <br /> <br /> The plot? Grrrr .... The children of Meddling trace gremlin-like creatures from the scene of the movie before they kill people by projecting their fantasies. Sounds great, right? Well, do you see that wall on the other side of your room? Run right, top speed, face first. See, THAT is more beautiful than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do you have the courage to doubt? Quick, give a name to something else one of the contacts has been in over this. What other scripts did the authors from "Hobgoblin"? Name another Rick Sloane directorial attempt. How many "Hobgoblin" action numbers do you have? To see? THANK YOU. <br /> <br /> I can't believe I took so long to write about such a horrible movie. I'd rather write about more important things; like the separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, that kind of thing. But no, "Hobgoblin" is and is ugly - as bad as your grandparents' background, bad as pink flamingos on your lawn, bad as underwear that says "The Whopper's house" ... and I think we'll stop there. <br /> <br /> Well, Mike and the robots fight bravely but, no matter how they try, they can only do so much with the "Hobgoblin" before they realize that, yes, the director needs to be kicked in the shin. <br /> <br /> Real, real hard. <br /> <br /> A star for "Hobgoblins", seven stars for the MST3K version.
