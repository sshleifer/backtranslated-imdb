I have to admit I took this a couple of times on the US network. There's just something in the stupidity of this movie, which makes me want to watch it every time it happens. Yes, you're right about comparable acting, the plot that only a seven-year-old could like, etc. But I can't help but feel sympathy for some of the actors. Then again, some of these actors registered for the even more atrocious sequel.
