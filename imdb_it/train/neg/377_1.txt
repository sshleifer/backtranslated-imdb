Don't even ask me why I saw this! The only excuse I can imagine is that I was suffering from bronchitis and too weak to change channels. :) It's too terrible for words, the movie that it is, not the bronchitis. The acting is deplorable, Richard Grieco sums it up as an unnaturally happy serial gunman, armed with a gun, with a weakness for the cops. Nick Mancuso phones in a performance like the cop on his tracks and Nancy Allen manages to put the only sympathetic role in the whole movie. The screenplay is mournful, dotted with cliche lines, "Are you ready, Pardner?" purrs Richard Grieco to each of his victims. To say. To avoid.
