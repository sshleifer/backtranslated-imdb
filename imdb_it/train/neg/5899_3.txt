Of all the people who are rooting Miike and his job. Tonight I sat through this movie. I thought, if it's half as good as Ringu, as I suggested from these comments, it could be, that my time will be worth it. <br /> <br /> I have not had such luck. <br /> <br /> I am ready to find the next great director (or writer), but I don't think Miike is the only one. I don't have a Masters in Fine Arts from NYU, but I know a lot: a horror film must have rhythm. It must also give the viewer more credulity than that movie. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of this film made me shake my head. Some scenes at the end were dragged so badly, I went to the fridge and I stopped there while Kou Shibasaki stared at the camera for apparently minute minutes, with his eyes wide open and his mouth open. A famous director once made the complaint, and I'm paraphrasing, a movie could be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it roll. Kou is not an actress good enough to do that job. She sets paralyzed the undead girl for more scenes than I care to remember. And she is not the only one to make a representation of a deer in the headlights; it seems that other cast members feel the need to imitate this non-performance. The script gives them little space to do much for too long. <br /> <br /> I like Asian cinema. The Hong Kong action films of the last 30 years, the Korean horror film like "Phone" and "Koma", the work of Ang Lee, some of the coolest but funny Filipino movies with free sex and fighting, as well as others. Chakushin Ari I could have done without.
