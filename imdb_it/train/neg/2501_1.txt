Did I see it on TV the other night ?? or rather I jumped on another channel every so often to watch the ads when I couldn't stand to watch it. It was bad. Really, really bad. It's not "so ugly is good", but it's simply wrong. How was it funded? Who thought it was a good idea? An actor friend of mine did an audition and was told that he wasn't good enough to play a villain, but I think what they wanted to say was "save and escape from this steaming pile of @ # $%". I bet the rest of the cast had been given the option. To be honest, acting was hard to judge due to the terrible American ascensions. The shooting was dullllllllllllll. The action was embarrassing and rigged. The dialogue was in vain. By far the saddest thing was the ship. In real life the Interislander ferry is a squalid boat and does not dry well on the film. Instead of trying unsuccessfully to make a new ship look like bits of frill wrapped around rusted bores, no joke, they could change the script to explain or even celebrate misery. Scemo, scemo, scemo. Don't watch this movie, not even as a joke.
