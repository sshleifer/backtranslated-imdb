Let's see ... I'm trying to practice finding the positive in everything, so what can I say about the hanger? <br /> <br /> I know! The performances were - no, it won't work as they managed to drain the whole personality from Gwyneth Paltrow, usually so lively, and ended up creating caricatures by Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey ... <br /> <br /> Oh - how's the story - no. It won't fly either, since it was indecent. What was the genre anyway? It wasn't funny, this excludes comedy. It wasn't interesting enough to be dramatic. Was it a love story between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I have to ask, because I'm not sure, let's call it "losers in a similar way". I'm sure those behind this film started from a vision, I mean, they must have one to present to the studio seeds, but I need help finding it. <br /> <br /> Even if I were a patient person Who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story, I could not in good conscience recommend a film that allows a boy to participate in a professional job interview in a windbreaker and hair filthy, soft and stupid. Speaking of hair - should we be amused by the deliberate black roots and platinum padlocks worn by Hershey? <br /> <br /> What am I doing? I have already lost 97 unrecoverable minutes in the real vision of the film - I cannot devote more time to this loser.
