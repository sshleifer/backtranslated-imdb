I'll be brusque. I'm not one for politically correct films in which the woman plays the bad ass who has no intention of taking a crap from anyone. If any of the cast members wanted to do it, he could take it out in a flash. It was fun on MST 3K, but not renting the real version. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
