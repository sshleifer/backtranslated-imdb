** CONTAINS SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Sean Young, truly exquisite (who in some scenes, with untidy hair, looks like Elizabeth Taylor) hits in his early moments in this film. Sitting in the back of a police car waiting to report a bust, his face and body are tense and distracted. Unfortunately, once the bust is over, Young's behavior never changes. This is a fatally inhibited actress. <br /> <br /> One only has to compare Young with the performer who plays his colleague and best friend, Arnetia Walker, to capture what Young is missing. Walker is open, emotional and at ease at all times ... in the sense that there is no apparent barrier between what she might try and her expression. She is an open book. Young, on the other hand, acts shyly and is aware that you might expect your neighbor to act when he is suddenly projected into a movie. Basically, she has no idea. <br /> <br /> With this great void looming at the center of the film, we are left to reflect on the implausibility of history. For example, after Miss Young is kidnapped by the criminal who is chasing and locked in a closet, she brings down the door when she is left alone. Sure, she's dressed only with a bra and panties, but in a similar situation, with a psychopath who should come back at any time, you would go to the door ... or take the time to go through her dresser, take off some clothes and clothes? I imagine that this and other scenes are trying to suggest a sort of mixture of emotions that the character of Miss Young is experiencing, but Young cannot convey this kind of complexity. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting moments in the film, such as brief police interviews with previous victims of the criminal, but overall this is a pointless endeavor. It is a pity that Miss Young was replaced while she was filming the comic-style movie pair that could have exploited her limitations with a certain amount of humor (BATMAN and DICK TRACY), because her wandering around trying to play real people is strangely moving. Watching Miss Young try to act, at least in this "thriller", is a sad sight.
