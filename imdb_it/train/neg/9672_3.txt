While most of the film is very amateur, the scene of the Kosher massacre is reproduced, but not false. The kosher law states that an animal must be conscious when the blade touches its skin. The scene of the Kosher massacre is accurate, as anyone knows who has seen it, or has seen the film Peta showing a Kosher massacre, in which the animal's throat is cut and the esophagus is cut out while still alive, conscious and obviously suffering. We must remember that the story is written by the winners. Is it even permissible to think that perhaps the Nazis were right? <br /> <br /> Does it not say anything that the Nazis have outlawed this vicious religious massacre, and the Jews are still practicing it today?
