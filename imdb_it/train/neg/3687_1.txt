It's not just that this is a bad movie; it's not just that four of the "best" Mexican directors are in this film; and it's not just that the script is terrible. It's just ... this movie sucks ... big time. These people are wasting money on terrible scripts. He should criticize Mexican society but we are tired of this kind of film. Is bad language supposed to be fun? I don't understand Mexican cinema is in great difficulty if this type of film continues to play (and will be written and produced). <br /> <br /> Please do not think that this type of film is well received in Mexico: we hate them and they do not reflect us.
