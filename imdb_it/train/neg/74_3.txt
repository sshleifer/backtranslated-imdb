They built this as a kind of fantasy. Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance guy, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe can play with high-class talent, the young bored wives of the rich elderly. OK, there are many myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also many well-documented facts that still leave room for artistic creativity in producing good historical dramatization. I mean, this is not the story of Robin Hood, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not a person whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many centuries ago that every recreation of their life and times is 99% of conjectures. It's just a couple of lives ago. My grandparents were already school age when Ned was hanged. <br /> <br /> So it is foolish of me to imagine myself fantastically that this film was a serious attempt to tell the story of Kelly. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel "The True History of the Kelly Gang", I had been looking forward to this being the same way. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's 1970 Kelly was probably much closer to reality, and a better film as a whole, which doesn't mean much. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it only costs me two dollars to rent the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's just because some of the beautiful shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.
