I gave these two stars for the incredible sharpness of DV, which lends to the cold and dark sterility of his character. He was generous, I know. <br /> <br /> This film fails on all accounts. I cannot recommend it, because it is neither poetic nor direct. Neither dramatic nor suspenseful. Neither controversial nor ordinary. It's just a miserable piece of trash that no fan of horror or exploitation can recommend in good faith. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this, whoever you are. . Please stay away from this horrible product. <br /> <br /> Thanks.
