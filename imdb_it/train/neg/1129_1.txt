I saw this film because I did it (my work includes watching movies of all kinds). I couldn't stop thinking "who gave the money to make such a horrible film and also presented it at the Cannes Film Festival!" It wasn't just boring, the actors were horrible too. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
