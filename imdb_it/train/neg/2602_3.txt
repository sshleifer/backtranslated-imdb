Drew Barrymore continues to see his alter-ego throughout the city and is starting to become a real headache. <br /> <br /> After Dee rents an apartment of a hacker writer, his encounters with "the other Drew" become more frequent. Writer-dude believes it is her responsibility to take "the real Drew" out of her torpor, so she does everything she can to help her including seducing her as soon as she has some free time. Not very interesting, and even less scary, but Drew is sexy as usual, especially when he gives a finger to a group of rude construction workers, his finger ... yes Drew, it's hot! <br /> <br /> The best scene could be one in which Drew stabbed his real mom, Jaid, with a big kitchen knife ... hmmm ... and how was the day?
