Santa cow, what piece of this film is. I have no idea how these directors can take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie. I guess they didn't even know it! I don't remember any flips or belching in the book, do I? <br /> <br /> They've taken this classic all the time, added some farts, belching and sexual stuff, and they prostituted it in a KAKA joke. This should give you an idea of ​​what these Hollywood producers think. I must say that visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story is ruined by the humor of the toilet (if you think that kind of thing is funny) I DON'T WANT the children I know to think it is. <Br /> <br /> Don't take your kids to see, don't rent the DVD. I hope the ghost of Dr. Suess' ghost comes and persecutes the people who made this film.
