This film is also a big step forward compared to the typical Bollywood cuisine. The performances were horrible. Even Boman Irani, who always manages to shine, becomes completely OTT as the villain. The soundtrack is not even memorable. And despite the tough attempt, female voices can't be "sexy". Vivek Oberoi is able to accomplish far better projects while Fardeen Khan appears to be stuck in a similar tariff for the moment. But this monstrosity is even below its limited capacity as an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are horrible in the clich√© roles written poorly. The time has come for Indra Kumar to hang his director's hat. I hope he never directs another eyesore like this. The future of Hindi movies is in better hands now. To summarize, stay away from celluloid waste.
