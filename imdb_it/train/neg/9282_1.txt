This film is unworthy of the title of Omen. It is so serious that it has damaged the classic nature of the first three. It should never have been done, they should change the title. <br /> <br /> Don't even write the name of Damien Thorn correctly !!!! And there are no daggers, the most important element of all Omen's films. Pull it from the shelves and burn it.
