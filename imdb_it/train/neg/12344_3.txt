Strained comedy, a sort of theatrical sketch that was initially a vehicle to show the radio star of a time, Jack Pearl, but is now remembered as the American introduction to The Three Stooges. In fact, Larry, Curly and Moe are billed alongside comedian Ted Healy as Ted Healy and his Three Stooges. Although the supporting cast includes Jimmy Durante (who is completely wasted on obscure material) and ZaSu Pitts, the only audience for the film these days are the addicts of Stooges, and they too won't find much to applaud here. Incredibly loud and overbearing, it shows how far Hollywood has had to go to reach a certain level of slapstick sophistication. * 1/2 from ****
