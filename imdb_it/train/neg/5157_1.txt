I really despised this movie when I saw it at the age of about 6 or 7 as I was a big fan of Robin Williams and nothing he could do was bad. Up to this. This complete garbage has ruined Robin for me for a long time. Recently I am recovering only with his fun but serious part on Father's Day, but then he continued to create another mistake, the bicentennial man that I think was called but the point is. Robin should get much better jobs now and now he has returned to the slime that originated with this "classic".
