This must be the worst, and I mean the worst biker movie ever made! And that says a lot because the line of smelly is long and smelly! <br /> <br /> Now we know at least what happened to Ginger after she was rescued from Gilligan's Island! A frightened Tina Louise (she probably feared someone would see this mess!) Is a stranded motorist who is tormented by the most repugnant band of bikers in the history of cinema. But don't worry, fans! Batman, I mean Adam West as a provincial doctor who comes to the rescue! Pow! Crush! Boom! Holy Toledo Batman! <br /> <br /> The only positive points of this "bomb" are some pretty women, some brawls fighting scenes, and the still "sexy" Tina Louise!
