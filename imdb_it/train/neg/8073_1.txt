If the writer / director is reading this (and I imagine you have been since you should be out of work), then I have to tell you: I've seen some bad movies in my time, but this has the distinction of having the worst premise I've ever heard . <br /> <br /> SPOILERS - Nothing happens! <br /> <br /> A total waste of time. I laughed out loud at the end. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTES - (if the whole movie was her in a coma, then does the scene where she sleeps with that guy mean someone raped her while she was knocked out?) <br /> <br /> Absolutely rubbish.
