Many days after seeing Conceiving Ada, I am still intimidated by the fact that any group of people spend so much time making a film so atrocious. <br /> <br /> No one should see this film in the hope of learning something accordingly about Ada Lovelock, her colleagues or the product of her efforts. <br /> <br /> Likewise, nobody should see this movie in the hope of being entertained. <br /> <br /> As a science fiction film, this would undoubtedly be a horrendous failure. Somehow, the main character manages to bring the past back to life and interact with it on his personal computer - with the encouraging words and advice of Timothy Leary. I doubt anyone could suspend their disbelief enough not to sound absolutely absurd. <br /> <br /> As a dramatic film, this would undoubtedly be a horrendous failure. Somehow, the writer / director manages to fill eighty-five minutes with a constant, useless, annoying and banal drama about essentially nothing. I doubt anyone would think that the whole drama of the film only serves as an annoying distraction. <br /> <br /> I find it difficult to fully express my contempt for Conceiving Ada. The circumstances in which I saw it prevented me from leaving the theater, but there is no doubt that I would have otherwise. I'm still angry because I've lost the time to see it. Only I could criticize this film more effectively, I wish you were more articulate.
