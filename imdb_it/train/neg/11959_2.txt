This film is a twisted nonsense of a film, set in Japan about a dysfunctional family that ends with a strange violent guest who sits down and watches the 4 family members at their worst. Nothing is sacred in this film, with sexual drugs and violence aimed at such a limit I am surprised that it has passed the censors. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it will only appeal to those we should not be encouraging, rather than any supposedly underlying message that comes out for the rest of us. A film that favors the worst element of society and is nevertheless a total gash ... A disappointment on the part of a man who made the sublime Dead or Alive and Audition films.
