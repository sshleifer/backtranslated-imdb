I had to give this movie a 1 because it's so ugly, but don't think I didn't like watching, because I laughed and laughed, and I also had some questions. So for half the time I was laughing, for half the time I was saying "what the hell is going on?" or "why would anyone do that?" etc. I especially liked the terrible fog effects, the 1980s nude / battle / dialogue / nude scene, and the way the warrior's swords flutter in the wind as they ride their horses. And there are some effects of the lousy pattern (those shouldn't be real trees, right?) And I still don't understand this guy they find in the cave, what the hell is he? A friend of mine told me about these films and I thought I would try, and basically I liked the film as people like Ed Wood's movies, I didn't really enjoy what the movie had to be, I look at it in my hilarious way. So don't let this distract you if you really think it's an action movie, it's just that I liked it for other reasons. It's much, much worse than the Evil Dead, so it can really make you think you're wasting your life looking at it (which came to my mind a few times). I guess the best thing for most people is to have a few drinks, have friends around and laugh at this movie. Maybe this is a bit harsh, but I don't think so, rent it and you'll see. Yo.
