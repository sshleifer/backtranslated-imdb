I gave this 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories are open and left unexplained, and for the nauseating scenes of someone who eats in an extremely disgusting way, in addition to scenes of a decomposing corpse. <br /> <br /> None of the above had to be shown graphically. <br /> <br /> The film's plot, as it is, covers three freely interconnected stories, none of which satisfactorily concludes. <br /> <br /> The bounty hunter, played by Bruce Dern, is the character that connects all three vignettes. <br /> <br /> First we have Dylan McDermott, who looks damn good looking, like a wanted criminal who is escaping to Mexico to escape the law and the bounty hunter, when he crosses a border town and sees a sad-faced girl played by Helen Hunt. <br /> <br /> Then we have one of Hemingway's girls. I don't know which one, playing a western wife on the solitary frontier who goes to see a nearby woman, an attractive redhead, whom we soon realize was a little too long in gullies. <br /> <br /> The conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him, with the final scene of the film that is completely beyond rational understanding.
