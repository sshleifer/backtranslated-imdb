Did you probably hear this sentence when it comes to this movie ?? "Herbie: Fully Loaded with crap" and yes it is true. This film is really terrible and totally lame. <br /> <br /> This was the second worst movie Lindsey has ever been in confession with the Drama Queen. The only positive thing about this film seems to be the cast of talent that is far better than the film millions of times and is the only strength of the film. I don't see how such a respected actor as Matt Dillon can be part of this film, didn't he read that horrible script before signing to be there? <br /> <br /> What I didn't like about this movie is also the basis on how Herbie is surreal and fantastic as an extraordinary skill and getting on the wall and going faster than a race car, after all it's just a Beatle. I know it's a children's movie, but they went through with it and it turned out to be more foolish than funny. Little realism is needed and the story is too predictable. <br /> <br /> Final Words: Unless the children are actually 5 to 12 years old, I strongly doubt that anyone can enjoy this meaningless film. What a waste of my money. I feel like being tricked. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 (Rating: F)
