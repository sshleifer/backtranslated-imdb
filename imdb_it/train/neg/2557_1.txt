Actually I like kindergarten movies. I got into the habit of seeing as many as possible. Even the rip-offs they did were fantastic like the EXORCISM AND WHEN A KILLER ASKS. This is simply lame. I can't believe that even the very people who created DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA'S CURSE have made this film !!! It's not even ridiculous like JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which, by the way, are pretty ugly). This is simply BAD! I mean, I can appreciate and / or forgive bad acting or lame special effects in a kindergarten movie, but this movie takes itself too seriously. I really hope that SNAKES ON A TRAIN is better. This is a film I can't wait to see.
