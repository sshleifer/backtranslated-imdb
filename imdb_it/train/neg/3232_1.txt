this film has no plot, character development and budget. it really sucks to put it in short terms. Since there is no development for the film, you can't really even look at it as if it were trying to be artistic or trying to make a statement against torture. Which leaves two other reasons for looking at it. Be shocked or come down on it like a sick little monster. Well, that's not good here either. The girl's reactions seem stupid. it is extremely easy to say that it is false (honestly professional wrestling seems more realistic than the crap they try to get away with in this movie. They throw them inside the guts, but for the most part it's asleep, so it's just a little stupid. really useful is the end when you cut quickly from one scene to another just before the needle enters his eyes, but honestly the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly false, except for the eye. to see Hostel and Hostel 2. Not only do both contain realistic violence, but there is also a real plot that attracts you and makes you worry about people. In addition, trailer films really work at a deeper level considering issues like American fears of foreigners, problems of morality, testing to what extent a person can go, human instincts against civilization and many other things, and they are carefully written and counted. or good humor when the plot is not focused on v Violence. These are much better choices on this piece of shit
