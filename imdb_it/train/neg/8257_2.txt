"A Gentleman's Game" uses the game of golf in a country club to illustrate a teenager's discovery about honesty, prejudice and other life lessons. Several times I thought I knew where this film was directed, only to be denied. Unfortunately, I'm not so sure that the directors ever knew where it was heading. The decisive moment in this film is probably the scene in which Gary Sinise teases "The Karate Kid" and denies any idea that he will become a mentor for the teenage golfer. In a sense, it is refreshing that this film refuses to follow most of the simplistic and overly elaborate cinematic formulas. However, too many things are still invented. When a hat falls, people abandon all pretensions to civilization, or fail to resist the things they believe in, or are exposed to something far less respectable than their position in society supposes. Unfortunately, there is often no solution to these moments. And except for the fact that the club acts as a background for them, there is no real continuity or connection between them. It is a pity that screenwriters and directors failed to save a better film, especially considering some of the talented actors and setup potential.
