An exceptionally horrible story that I can barely put into words. The best part of the film was when one of the victims of the murder came to the end, alive and well, only to be slaughtered again. There is the possibility that I missed some crucial elements of the plot from the moment I could find myself in a slight coma during the time this child was active. The box in which the film arrives shows scenes that are never even in the film. I was attracted by the crude images of slavery torture and the promises of a "sexy and euro-trash horror movie". I have the feeling that this was the version of the budget and about a quarter of the film was excluded. All good things more than likely. I received the addition for PG-13 which had the same meaning as the end of the new movie "Planet of the Apes". Watch this with a friend and a bottle of hard stuff. You will need it.
