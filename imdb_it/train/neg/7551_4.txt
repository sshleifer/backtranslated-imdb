Well, I finally saw the remake of last night in London, unintentionally exhilarating, asexual and devoid of any real humor. I really don't know where to start, while I was entertained by this strange homage, it didn't really touch me. The acting is screaming, there is no original music, the costumes are too "Disney", there is a ridiculous "six months later" after the burning of Nic Cage (who did not arrive early enough for my taste) Il bite with Cage in the bear costume had the audience suppressing the joy like the comedy that was punched by various "villains" on the island. It's such a strange remake that I can't believe I saw it, it reminded me of something the Comic Strip presents in the eighties, kind of like their Hollywood interpretation of Miner's Strike, very strange!
