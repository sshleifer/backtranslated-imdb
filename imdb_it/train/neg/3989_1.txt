Who in their right mind plays a lyric song and at the same time portrays an emotional scene between two people? When Flipper confronts his offended wife in the locker room, the song sung with lyrical content is as strong as dialogue, so nobody can be heard, diluting any emotional impact that the scene may have had. The scenes of Annabella being beaten by her father with fists, a lamp and then a belt was so as to be a cartoon to seem absurd. The whole film is a cartoon, the rampant prejudice against whites is literally stunning. The discussion of black women after Flipper's wife discovers she has betrayed her with a white woman - as if it were a discussion of an Oxford debate team, is ridiculous. The rampant racism could be tolerable, but the soundtrack and the sound that are mixed during this "film" are too many. It was a technically bad film. There is no understanding of the basic craft of film creation, the soundtrack, the editing and the desperate attempt of great actors trying to keep this film afloat. Actually I was sorry for Anthony Quinn, wondering why he had accepted a role in this film: his appearance in this is painful. This is the first film I saw from this director and it will be the last.
