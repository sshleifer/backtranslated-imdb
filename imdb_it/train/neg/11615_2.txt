Although I am not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised when I saw his name in the closing credits in the opening of "Joshua". Hell, I wasn't even aware that he was in 'Joshua' until I started the movie. So it's obvious that I was watching the film based on the film, not the leads. A sort of "Rosemary's Baby", "The Omen" or any other demonic children's film "Joshua" has been published. Unfortunately, he fell flat. Slow, incredibly slow and flat. However, I continued to see how this would be solved, hoping beyond imagination, the final climax would shed light on the subject. Ok, I admit it, it did (a little) but that stale closure. And what a low-budget movie, or so they designed it. A person falls ?? you don't see the drop, you see someone lying in what appears to be blood. Is a person hit by a taxi? you don't see it, you see someone complaining, holding a bike. I'm not sure it's called "style" or laziness or simply lack of funds for special effects. We have a "rich" family with a crazy mother, a workaholic father who tries to balance everything, a child ?? Joshua, who may / may not be the antichrist and a newborn baby who cries a lot. She cries as much as we see how many days she is alive? and what was it? Are there mice on it or is it Joshua? Is your mother crazy? Is Joshua crazy? Is he simply jealous of the newcomer to the family? Will it grow to be Michael Myers? Or are you driving your family to the brink? I don't think so. They were crazy before and no "so-called" acting could make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, all questions were answered, almost no door open. I'm sure it could have been the idea, but for Pete's sake, give me something. Nothing. There are many better films to explore. Joshua is more like the Antichrist Mini-Me.
