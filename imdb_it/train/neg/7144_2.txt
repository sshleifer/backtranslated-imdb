It was almost worth it to sit through all this terrible "movie" just to know that I could never experience anything as bad as this. Acting - 0, screenplay - 0, fighting scenes - 0, male lead - 0 (eight-mile cheddar bob as a suave war hero who gets the girl), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (She is beautiful and not a terrible actress) . This is the criterion I used to average about two. I lost count, but I never think the clich√© of a film has ever been in this movie. When the driver who supposedly killed his father miraculously shows up at the end to run against her, from nothing he cemented the previous statement. Furthermore, it appears only for no reason. It has never been mentioned before. I don't know what else to say here. Watch it when it comes out on TV in a couple of years. At least in this way some of them will be modified for advertisements.
