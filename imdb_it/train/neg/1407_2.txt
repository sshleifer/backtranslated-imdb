After life it's a miracle, I didn't expect much. It is hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as Do You Remember Dolly Bell, for example. Zavet is two hours of stupid antics without history. Underground's wild and unbridled humor seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoon here. It seems that Kusturica has been constantly going downhill since he started making life-affirming comedies, starting with Black Cat, White Cat, which I think was great, but already had some disturbing signs of dementia. I liked his first films so much, and that's why it's particularly disappointing to see something like that. We hope the next one is fantastic.
