If you like movies that wander around with a little storyline spiced up with vicious sex, this movie is for you. Among the positive aspects, the protagonist / actress (transsexual new entry) has an interesting presence on the screen, but not enough to add much more than a slightly interesting film - if so. Essentially this film is about 3 social outcasts (transsexual prostitute, drug dealer of male and Russian and gay immigrants) who have somehow developed a bond. Because it is not clear. It is expected that we accept these misfits are the basic honest people who have the ability to love while they traffic their body on the street. Right!! And Anna Nicole Smith was really in love with her sweet ninety year old! The filmmaker shows a more unpleasant and unpleasant side of life, while he wants us to believe that below all these seriously damaged people are really normal to the extent that they have a menage a trois that helps them in life. Rather a fantasy, but unfortunately portrayed here as a true aspect of life on the wild side. In summary, no plot, no truth and no real reason to spend much time here. Unless, of course, you don't like having fun in the kink !!!
