German director Ulli Lommel managed a task that many horror fans thought was impossible: former partner Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of the director of the worst horror film ever made. <br /> <br /> Lommel really is the Ed Wood of the new millennium. This movie is poor and laughable as the worst of EW. I'm both proud and embarrassed to say that I saw it in its entirety, morbidly fascinated by seeing only the minimum level of the bar could be set. The answer is: underground; Lommel dug a pit and buried it. <br /> <br /> The fun begins with the cast of international nobles. Only someone who lived in Los Angeles, where every mechanic, doctor and postman is an actor or scriptwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many aspiring actors willing to throw up his ridiculous face-to-face dialogue serious. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, an evil cop, is played by a German actor with a strong German accent. Besides being a serial killer, he's also the oldest cop in Los Angeles. Despite stopping innocent women drivers and taking them into custody, he then drags them into his home (which is inexplicably the top floor of a furniture warehouse), and does all this in plain sight of his debutants, the LAPD refuses to investigate , going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja-style raid in his apartment. <br /> <br /> The sets are terribly ugly. The set designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint "Precinct 707" on a cardboard wall. <br /> <br /> Because the actors were obviously not unpaid professionals - a sad assortment of European emigrants (perhaps deported if they were acting in their native lands), bimbos, mimbos and desperate middle-aged women - and seen that little or no money has been spent on sets, special efxes, locations or other production values, it is fair to mention that they have sprung up for some genuine looking police uniforms. Unfortunately, they could not afford a police car; uniformed policemen walk the streets in a sparkling new Mercury rental. <br /> <br /> More than half of the story focuses on the filthy actions of our deranged German LAPD officer and the useless efforts of two young rookies to stop him. One of these young actors is particularly pitiful because he is the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague revival of a real career in the movies. The other fits perfectly, with a rockabilly hairstyle and a Brando pose that must be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> The last part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killers are resurrected after killing a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell on her. Don't ask why a girl from Romania resort to voodooism waiting to be murdered, accept Lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride. <br /> <br /> After long and laborious claws from the straw-covered tombs, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance. They look exactly like before death, perhaps even prettier, with the glamorous black makeup generously airbrushed around the eyes. They don't look like zombies at all, they look more like high fashion models ready for the catwalk. <br /> <br /> At this point in the film, Lommel borrows a creative note from his illustrious compatriot Boll, and injects large doses of Euro-trash techno cheese into the soundtrack. We are talking about prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise. Things that could have played in an Ibiza nightclub when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty. <br /> <br /> Unlike other zombies, Lommel's girls speak and function normally ... er, I mean, as they did before becoming zombified. This offers our author ample opportunities to flood us more with his golden dialogue. Yes, it's a golden rain. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil anything by revealing the final shock. All I can say is that it is perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece. The spirit of Ed Wood lives ... or should I say his geist.
