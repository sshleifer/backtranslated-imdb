Former pack actor and talented boyfriend Rob Lowe stars in a film set in a high-security American prison. I had the feeling that his character would be popular for all the wrong reasons like Tobias in the first series of OZ, but PROXIMITY is not that kind of film, it's more like a "Man on the run" movie like THE FUGITIVE. He also hints at the issues of punishment and justice with James Coburn making a cameo as a spokesman for justice for the victim's advocacy group but any intelligent discussion of how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into old clich√©s tired of shootings and car chases
