Although this film was made before Dogme emerged as the predominant method for making a film, and before digital triumphed it overwhelmed this. Get the point. This 1991 masterpiece clearly anticipated these developments. Corin Nemec is simply exceptional as I am not at all, author and narrator. The pace is slow, but so elegant, because cinematography is so beautiful. Register it the next time it is on T.V., because I guarantee you will never see a better made-for-T.V rip-off nostalgia. movie. Direct-to-video has never been this good!
