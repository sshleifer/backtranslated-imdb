I sincerely want the last 30 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The only person who is suitable for watching this film is Helen Keller. I kept telling myself that this has to improve, this has to improve. br /> <br /> Then finally the zombies showed up and had some raccoon paint on their eyes. <br /> <br /> They spoke like normal people. <br /> <br /> One drove a car. <br /> <br /> A voodoo woman asked what one of the "zombies" wanted and the "zombie" said (I want to dance) <br /> <br /> (that was) the movie came out I could no longer take it I can sue for half an hour of my life ?????
