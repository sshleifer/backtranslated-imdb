"Shinobi" is one of those films that think that killing a character automatically brings a sense of gravity or emotion to the story. Unfortunately, for the public to really care about the people who die, you have to develop the characters, otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. The problem is particularly complicated when you have tons of characters, all of whom die. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you can't be bothered to make characters memorable or understanding in any way, you can at least make REASONS for the reason of their plausible death, right? No. Here we have a war between two ninja clans, without either of them really knowing WHY they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says so. And yet, even after it becomes evident that the emperor wants EVERYONE to be dead, they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions. It's not stubborn ... it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, well! There is no character development, and the plot does not provide rational reason to fight. At least they die fighting in cool action scenes, right? Once again, NO! In fact, many of the struggles are not fights at all: super ninja that the film has spent so much time and effort to introduce death suddenly (and, in my opinion, barely). I'm talking about things like, "Lalala, I'm walking and I- * the neck is cut *." THE END for that character. Not even in the middle of the film, I threw my hands in frustration at his ridiculousness.
