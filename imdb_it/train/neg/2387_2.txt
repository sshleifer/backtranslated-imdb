I couldn't believe how lame and useless he was. Basically there is nothing to laugh about in the film, almost no scene to interest you in the rest of the film. This film attracted big stars but they were all wasted in my opinion. I think Keanu Reeves took some acting lessons a few years after this movie, before he stared at The Matrix. Uma Thurman seemed very simple and humble. Fortunately I took this film at a very low price because it is certainly not a movie to remember for good reasons. I won't write anything about the story of the film, but how you should know that she is destined to be the most famous hitchhiker in all of America thanks to her huge thumb. I would give this film a 2 / 10. Before watching this film I was wondering why this movie only had a 4.0 / 10, and now I know why. A very disappointing film. Don't buy it even if you see it for less than $ 5.
