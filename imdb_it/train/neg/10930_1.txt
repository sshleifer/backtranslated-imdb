This film is a total dog. I found myself trying to find something to laugh about, so I didn't feel like I completely lost my money - and my time. The writing of this film is absolutely terrible. It's a shame not to be up to the rest of Hale Storm's films. <br /> <br /> They would have had to save money to get D-list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spend the money working on the script until it was right. Gary Coleman was also not used correctly for his role. <br /> <br /> This movie leaves you wondering what was the point of most of the plot - including the subplots. After watching this film, I was left with the impression that the producers hoped to capture a sort of Neapolitan humor similar to dynamite, where the lines and the character are not so much the jokes. Unfortunately, this film fails to deliver the lines, characters, delivery or humor. I should have gone to the dentist!
