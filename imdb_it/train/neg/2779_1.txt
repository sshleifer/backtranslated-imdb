Obviously when you offer enough money to an actor, they will do anything. I'm not sure how much John Rys-Daves got, but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an excuse for even joining a ROTTEN movie. The special effects were worse than the effects of the films of the fifties and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse. As for how badly acting was a child he gave the second best performance in my opinion. The English was terribly stressed and I think nobody really could even speak English, but they just memorized how words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character both "realistic" and real.
