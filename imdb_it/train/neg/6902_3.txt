Despite the enthusiastic reviews that this film has gathered in New Zealand, every advertising campaign surrounding the production is sadly undeserved. Apart from a plot just for clichés, the film is disappointed by some faint acting, accents and general lack of tension. <br /> <br /> Despite having the general aspect of a large budget (for New Zealand), the feeling is definitely provincial Kiwi ... <br /> <br /> Has someone not seen The Brothers? ? (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) Those who have chosen the similarities immediately ... I have heard comments that scenes like boys playing basketball etc. they were shot to hit the cliché "guys who talk" shit ", but you see yourself forced ... <br /> <br /> I think Oscar Keightley considers himself profoundly ironic, but again his delivery always seems vaguely self-conscious. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has doubts about the culture of Samoans-living-in-New Zealand has been deeply, hopefully not permanently, influenced by discourse, by American culture, and everything between them will surely have their invented minds at the end of this film. <br /> Robbie magasiva always looks good on the screen, but is disappointed with the script. <br /> <br /> It always bothers me when a "comedy" has scenes that are You are created in such an obvious way, you feel like you have a good moan to the cliche of the cliché - you see the desire to be a white boy ... <br /> <br /> I know someone who found this movement It's hilarious - anyway, that person has the brain of a tadpole, and he would have a hard time writing his own name if it offered a million dollars .... <br /> <br /> That guy sums up the mindset of this movie, OK but not great, funny but not funny ..... Wake up NZ - this is NOT a 5-star movie despite all the guilt (middle class white guilt? :-)) reviews .... <br /> <br /> My advice? if you look at it, get drunk first !!!
