Oh dear, this movie has been bad for various reasons. I expected to see a very low score for this film and was a little surprised by the overall score. Excuse me, but evaluate this as many have, it's a joke! Once the film's black-and-white joke, which was a good idea, was overcome, the film dragged on, even in a run time of just 66 minutes. The sequence of credits was so annoying at the beginning! In the van the boys suffer from a flat tire and change the wheel, wow, that was necessary in history! How slow were the boys to chase and actually managing to hurt Campbell ?? They didn't seem to worry about continuing to chase him ... I sigh ... I'm just glad I released him with a special edition of Evil Dead !!
