Some things need to be clarified. The image of Mark Ferris is not the Mark Ferris who starred in this film. I know because he was my father. Please remove that photo. Furthermore, Mark Ferris was the writer, at least one of them. I tried to find a copy or a way to see this movie again. It's been years and if anyone can tell me the direction to get a copy, it would be great. The film was not so bad, and trying to compare it to today's world of Star Wars and other high tech sci-tech is useless. If you look at it, enjoy it only for the ridicule and humor it has. Turn on being a movie snob and enjoy some less creative and innovative films.
