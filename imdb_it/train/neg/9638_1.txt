"Boom" has earned a reputation. With heavyweights Taylor, Burton, Noel Coward, Tennessee Williams and Joseph Losey, one might be tempted to think, how bad could it be? Well, it's a lot worse than you can imagine. <br /> <br /> The sad and disturbing fact of "Boom" is that it seems to signal the decline and fall of the heavyweights mentioned above. It was only director Joseph Losey who, with "Modesty Blaise" and "Boom" (which some may want to add "Secret Ceremony"), managed to recover and in 1970 created his best work, the wonderful "Go-Between ". <br /> <br /> The saddest of all is the work of Tennesee Williams. From the mid-forties to the early sixties, Williams wrote a number of plays that have acquired a classic status, remaining in the theatrical repertoire of the world, many of which have become highly praised films. When William's muse left him, probably because of his notorious substance abuse, he abandoned him for good. Williams at his best is the dream of an actor who offers many unforgettable performances. (Ava Gardner or Deborah Kerr were always better than in "Night of the Iguana"?) Taylor in particular, shone in both "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and "Suddenly Last Summer". There is an anecdote in which, apparently, Taylor asks John Gielgud if he would teach her to play Shakespeare, to which he replied "if you will teach me to play Tennessee Williams". If Gielgud saw "Boom", he would have held his tongue. Taylor has simply never been worse, turning a provocative performance. Despite his well-photographed face, he is definitely sloppy. In addition to physical decline, from this moment on she would lose credibility as a serious actress with a series of completely forgettable (and worst) roles in her credit. <br /> <br /> The same could be said of Burton. After his brief theatrical notoriety, he won fame and fortune in Hollywood. But the body of his work from that moment on (1968) would be nothing short of irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward had long since ceased to be a force in the theater where his parlor comedies had been replaced by the likes of Williams and the British "angry young men". He seems to have fun having fun, but he can barely amuse the one from the man who said such talent. <br /> <br /> The only member of the cast to maintain his dignity is the young Joanna Shimkus, who in a few years would have given up a promising film career to become Mrs. Sidney Poitier. <br /> <br /> "Boom" smells of self-indulgence; it's just out of control. A rather sad suggestion for bad careers rather than a camp party as some have suggested.
