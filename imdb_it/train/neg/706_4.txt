The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard is fantastic. She really did a first-class performance, and the girl who played her sister was really fantastic and wonderful. Seriously, I thought it was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can't say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He's one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I'm currently reading the Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book. This is a little too "real" for me. I prefer the small jokes of Lestat and Louis to the struggles of the slaves. Eartha Kitt was so disturbing and after his character did what he did The film was ruined for me; I could barely look at the rest of the show. (sorry for the ambiguity, but I don't want to give anything) Sorry, but it's not my kind of show.
