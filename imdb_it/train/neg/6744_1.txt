As you all know, JIGSAW didn't come to Blackbuster because of a Full Moon staff member, Devin Hamilton. Devin is the one who sells to all the chains of videos. He recently released a film, BLEED, which he sold to Blackbuster simultaneously with JIGSAW. He convinced the Blackbuster buyer not to take JIGSAW and double the number of BLEEDs. The result is that JIGSAW looks like a flop and BLEED seems a success. The main problem is that BLEED is one of the worst films ever and, as we all know, JIGSAW is, well, gold. I invite all of you to visit the BLEED page on the Internet and vote for the film that is wrong for JIGSAW and all your talents. Likewise, you should go to the JIGSAW page and cast high marks (if you don't already have it). We need to get JIGSAW up to at least an 8 or 8.5, and BLEED up to about a 2 (so putting it in the list of the 100 worst movies on the internet). Also, try to convince friends and relatives to do the same. <br /> <br /> I hope you're all right, - Matt
