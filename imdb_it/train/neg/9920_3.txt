I love the music of Clash and I love the music of Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros. I went to this movie hoping to know the man behind most of this. But I left the theater without knowing much more about Joe than I already did after reading the entry on Wikipedia. The film never really comes to the person, to his thoughts and feelings. What they did was collect the little material they had, flickering and confusing videos and interviewing some people on Joe Strummer at a campfire. It turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all, and that the director only wanted them in the film to have other celebrities who said, "Oh, it was a great inspiration to us all." Like Bono or Johnny Depp (who apparently asked to maintain his pirate costume to benefit from his current success in Pirates of the Caribbean). It seems that the director could not even wait for the body to be cold before jumping to sell his version of "the greatest punk rocker and hippie in the heart" that ever existed, sanctifying the person without really knowing him. <Br /> <br /> Of course, being a fan I enjoyed seeing the images of the band, listening to the anecdotes behind the songs and so on, but in the end it seemed to me what remained as the portrait of Joe Strummer would could be easily told in 60 -90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Go see the movie if you are a fan, otherwise listen better to the music of the Clash or even better the undeservedly unknown Mescaleros, where Joe Strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death, merging all its rich influences together with a surprising sound.
