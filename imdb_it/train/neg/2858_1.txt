This must be one of the worst movies of all time. The graphics were horrendous, the acting was b-movie and the effects were simply qualified Nintendo 64. You would think that they will put a little more effort into it. Of course, this is a film on the Scifi channel so you have to expect it to be cheap, but this takes the cake. Hell, I'm still laughing. So, to shake your head in disbelief, this is good. <br /> <br /> Although it seems to have "known" actors and actresses in this, it is difficult for me to believe that they do not realize that the quality of this film is worth their time and their efforts. <br /> <br /> The graphics may have been good in the 60s or even in the early 70s, but come on, this is 2009! I won't say spoiler, let's just say that if you played "Jurassic Park" on the Nintendo 64 you will be very familiar with what you see in this movie <br /> <br /> It is definitely not worth the 2 hours it took to sit through the thing
