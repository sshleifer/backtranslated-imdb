I saw this movie two weeks ago at the "festival des nouvelles images du Japon" in Paris. Although I did not expect much from this, I must say that I was disappointed just like many people in the audience ... if I wanted to summarize how I felt, I would say that I compared it to princess mononoke and nausicaa from beginning to end. Of course it's silly. But I couldn't help it. The stories are very different, but the worlds in the picture are very similar. And from this point of view, "a palm tree" cannot possibly compare with Miyazaki's masterpieces. Even if it's technically good enough, the boredom remains ... in the end his total lack of originality advises me not to worry about looking at him. I rated it 2 out of 10 (a bit harsh, I think you deserve 3 or 4)
