This film features two of my favorite actors at Kilmer and Downey. It also boasts the always pleasant Larry Miller in a too small part. Despite this, I found it almost invisible. Michelle Monaghan may be nice but she is almost devoid of charisma and the reasons for Downey's character obsession with his character are not at all understandable in terms of the information the film presents or the way it is portrayed. The ending seems pretentious and even if the intention seems to be that the public should join the nod and wink at the film, as we were not able to take us on the side of its protagonists, it leaves us unwilling or unable to do so. <br /> <Fans of the film say that those who disagree simply "don't understand". I don't think so. The plot was not complicated or beyond comprehension. It was simply not engaging and awkward and obviously produced. Capito ". I did not like" The Went Down "by Paddy Breathnach and" Snatch "and" Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels "by Guy Ritchie are much more realized examples of the type of film production that director Shane Black fails to reach. <br /> <br /> I share a birthday with Shane Black but a look at his credits (mainly as a screenwriter) makes me want to disassociate myself from any other connection.
