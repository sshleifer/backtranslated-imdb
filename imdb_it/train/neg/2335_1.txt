A film so insecure that the creators perhaps hoped to milk a classic film noir original title, "Farewell My Lovely", thinking that the gullible would interpret it as a remake. The characters are so disgusting and unattractive that they deserved his cool reception at the first outing. Time only increases its absurdity. Having nothing of the deception, cinematography, desperation or despair of the classic noir, it was based instead on a twisted and senseless criminal plot that would easily have led to several arrests in a few hours. As if this were not enough, he threw a completely eroticized attempt at eroticism in which at least one of the participants had not bothered to bathe in several days. This made this mess even more painful to watch. Find a good classic noir movie from the forties or fifties instead of wasting two hours on this failure.
