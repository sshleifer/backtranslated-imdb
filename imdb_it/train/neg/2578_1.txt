To summarize this film: Without a true plot, this film consists of 80 minutes of unbalanced characters who drink or make bad jokes. The music is just awful, the humor is not funny and all the female figures are slutty idiots or total geeks. It seems to me that the film was written by a 14-year-old boy who thinks drinking is good, that women are designed to please men and that everything that opposes that view is geek. Furthermore, the film has nothing to do with the original American Pie films, apart from a few names and Mr. Levenstein who is a minor character in this. The only good thing about this movie is the pretty girls. Don't watch this movie and don't be fooled by the 5.4 rating, because obviously overrated and worth nothing above 2.
