I'm starting to see a pattern in the movies I give 1. They are almost all films that my wife made me watch. Maybe I should stop believing in his tastes in movies. However, this is a typical drivel aimed at pre-teen girls, but even more evil than usual. Once again, the writer broke the cardinal rule of each film. It made the main character unlikely. He begins to be a complete wand for his friend at the beginning, and then discovers when he is 30, which is basically a very intelligent person (who has business, etc.). Why would the F want to try for this person? OK, let's say we can overcome that. Jennifer Garner is more attractive than you can get without some sort of deformity. I don't know if it's his fault or that of a writer, but his character goes well beyond my threshold for annoyance. Here's a tip for future filmmakers: 13 year olds are NOT fun, they are boring. By far the most embarrassing moment of the film came when they danced with "Thriller". Holy shit that was painful. He showed her that he practiced that dance at the beginning. This explains why he knows, but a whole club full of people?!? Argh !!! The Macarena would be more credible! All of a sudden he is completely incompetent and has no idea how to do his job and nobody notices it? At least the character of Tom Hanks on "Big" had a job that made sense to a child. These baby / body switching films that become adult night movies are really getting out of hand, and this is by far the worst.
