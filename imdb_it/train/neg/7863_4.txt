THHE2 is fun because you'll laugh a lot and shiver and you'll probably say "oh sh * t!" and "pull your face away from that damn dumb hole ** s" or something like that but I don't know if it's really worth it to see it- I was very annoyed for the whole wholeness with the horrible military characters who don't seem to know first thing about fighting. <br /> <br /> Yes, there was more violence, blood and a higher number of bodies than the first, but I'm still debating whether this erases my feeling during the whole film about how ridiculous it is (and not a good ridiculous like Dead Alive or Feast). My time would have been better spent watching the remake of Aja for the fifth time. <br /> <br /> So go get some laugh, or go for some blood, but don't hope to get out of it.
