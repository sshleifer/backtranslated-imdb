I question its importance for Queer cinema because it seems to be more of a homosexual encounter through violent behavior than clear statements about homosexuality and violence. <br /> <br /> The three stories intertwine in a rather sloppy manner. I found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes, which alone didn't fit me well. The weaknesses of the plot have been repeated ad infinitum as if we could not have obtained it the first 10 times. <br /> <br /> There was a feeling of padded dialogue throughout the film. More like a 45-minute short of Boy's Brief than an integral feature film. He had a certain erotic style, male nudity and sex appeal, but overall the sum was not equal to his parts. <br /> <br /> The first part: The Boxer / Stalker plot was the strongest and yet it seemed too thin. Has Bob followed Tim for four years and is only now facing him? I felt like their cat-mouse game hadn't been developed enough to deserve its conclusion. We needed more information about them and less scenes from Parking Lot / Locker with Tim relentlessly saying "What do you want?" <br /> <br /> Second part: Danny wants his friend, Tony, to beat him while he jacks-off. Tony doesn't seem to mind, but he doesn't even seem interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby - even after doing it in the nude. This story does not have the all-important passage from "I'm a straight guy who makes my friend slap for fun" to "I think I could be gay and hit him because I'd like to spread his ass and make him S / M style." A very important thing to be excluded. <br /> <br /> Clearly these stories could have expressed their points in half the time. The third part with the man and woman slapping each other adds to that thought. Furthermore, it was not necessary and did not add anything to the film. Yes, the actors did a good job under these circumstances and the four male protagonists were very sexy. The make-up (bruises and cuts) was however on a par with a grammar school talent show. <br /> <br /> There was not enough meat for this story to have an impact on gay politics. The film made no statements, wasted time and is not engaging enough or worthy of a considered investment. His fatal flaw is his amateur approach, which ultimately makes it impossible to take it seriously.
