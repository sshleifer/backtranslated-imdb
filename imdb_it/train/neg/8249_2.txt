Hiya people, <br /> <br /> Well, this movie really sucks. Think "Love Actually" in reverse. Nothing is fine, nothing is coherent, and certainly nothing makes you laugh. Love is rare in this film. <br /> <br /> It's a total flop. As indicated however, there are three points of redemption on this potential distorted of a film. <br /> <br /> A) With Jennifer Love Hewitt's star billing, there will be hordes of kids who will submit gracefully to the vision of this just to catch a glimpse of the tiny Hewitt with tight-fitting clothes. To tell you guys now ... there are some promising scenes ... but it's really a pleasure for the eyes. The "possibilities" here are watered down. Nevertheless, I saw the whole thing attempted by the next scene of Sai cosa ..... titillating! <br /> <br /> B) The ending is romantic and positive. That it is contrary and "over the top" is relevant ..... yet for me it was still a positive point. <br /> <br /> C) Dougray Scott plays a friendly and lovable boy ........ REFRESHING! THANK YOU! <br /> <br /> 2/5, not worthy of your 10 or so dollars. <br /> <br /> 2/3 of everything, I was convinced that Jennifer Love Hewitt became the next softcore legend. Even if I take it for now ..... it's very important for his next film. <br /> <br /> Oh, and his sister is very stupid. Her husband is very stupid ... and what the hell, she's really stupid. <br /> <br /> Next time. I can't wait for the next Love Actually with JLH!
