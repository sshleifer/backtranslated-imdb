LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE is one of Elvis's strangest films. Part slapstick, part fluff, surreal part and strange part. Elvis meets with a very off-beat girl with an annoying voice. Looks like Jennifer Aniston. The story doesn't make much sense, as is the case with most of Elvis Presley's films, and there are a lot of strange characters galore. Not a lot of music in this, but what I do I liked, although no one is memorable. Strange continuity. Elvis and Michelle Carey enter her beach house at night, but a few minutes later a bellboy arrives and the sun goes down !! What?? This is the essence of the film. What?? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks great and B) the dog steals the show.
