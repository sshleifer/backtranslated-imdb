I have just returned from this free screening, and this "Osama Witch Project" is the worst passive film I have seen this year, worse than "Catwoman" - which has had the decency to pass at least for itself as a fiction. <br /> <br /> In "September Tapes", a "film crew" of "documentary journalists" goes to Afghanistan - despite being completely unprepared for the journey, the conditions and, oh yes, the psychotic and ridiculous revenge of them the chief filmmaker to avenge his wife's death on September 11th - to track down Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br /> They "made" eight tapes on their journey, which now "document" their travels and, of course, their attempts to kill the terrorist leader. (The eight tapes, fortunately, all end up in significant points of the narration, which is convenient for a "documentary".) <br /> <br /> The psychotic and idiotic protagonist - who is given to long and meaningful speeches that he he probably learned to look at "MacGyver" - he doesn't care about his own life or the life of his innocent team while making them go further and further into danger through a series of completely stupid setbacks. I don't know why he didn't just wear a sign on his back that said "Shoot me". <br /> <br /> The crew translator, presumably their reasonable voice-of-reason, does little more than complain and remains baffled while the idiot hero leads them to ruin. <br /> <br /> Maybe they had brought someone on their journey to call them all morons. <br /> <br /> Around "Tape 4", I started rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew.
