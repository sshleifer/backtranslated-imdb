The unknown Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives in the studio of the fraudster collector of antiques Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious companion and poison specialist Jamie (Valeria Golino) who is Jack's brother. Jamie doesn't buy his story, he dominates Jack and ties him to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack proposes US $ 100,000.00 for each of them to protect him in a negotiation of the "Spanish Judges" of antiquity with a wealthy and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid acquaintance Piece (Mark Boone Junior), who comes with his retarded girlfriend who he believes to be from Mars, to compose the reserve team. However, Jack crosses the collector and then intrigues Jack, Jamie and Piece. <br /> <br /> The low budget "Spanish Judges" is a film with a reasonable script with a terrible conclusion that wastes a good cast. Valeria Golino is extraordinarily beautiful but together with the good actor Vincent D'Onofrio, I am not able to save the stupid story. Also, the scenes that should be fun are unfortunately not working, and are actually stupid and not fun. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All For Money")
