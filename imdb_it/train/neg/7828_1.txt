Along with 2 days in the Valley, I think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Just another of the long series of Tarantino imitations that emerged from Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere that the film creates is fun for the first five minutes, but then the directors commit the unforgivable error of allowing useless and grotesque violence to increase the "fashionable" quotient. You better skip this one.
