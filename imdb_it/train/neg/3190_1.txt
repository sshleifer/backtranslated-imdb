Jimmy Dean could not have been more mellifluous or absurdly talkative. Hysterical when viewed through the eyes of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, which I consider to be 10. I mean, the sight of this obese, corn-fed pig beating around Malta should be enough to send you vomiting if you do it far in the film. This ugly hysterical farce should be placed with the likes of "Booty Call", "Pumpkinhead", "Swarm" and "The Smurfs go to Bangladesh". A -gulp- films like this shows that sometimes actors, writers, producers, etc. They put their mortgage behind them, or they get stoned to death. The question arises "who was stupid enough to finance such a whale?" But then common sense prevailed and "Final Justice" was never, so we wouldn't have the delightful parody in "Mystery Science Theater 3000"!
