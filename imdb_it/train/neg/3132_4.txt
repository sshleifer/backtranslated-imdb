I haven't seen such fantastic ratings on IMDb, but I went to see it anyway, because I'm a big fan of Bible-related material. The first thing that bothered me was a bit too much Indiana Jones movie, but it also seemed that Casper Van Dien didn't see those Jones movies through (but he should). I think he did his best, but the script is simply smelly. The music also tried to be Jones style. Great job, but for a film like that it seemed too much work, as the video part didn't deserve all that great music. Robert Wagner gave his best acting skills, did a good job, but somehow the script was reducing everything. "Jokes" are old school, somewhere 20 years old; they just brought a cynical smile to my face. There are some really bad camera angels, SFX seems homemade and unrealistic. Kevin VanHook probably had a good idea in the story (in my opinion, but I love these stories), but in the end things didn't work out. Maybe he should have put it on paper when it was still fresh in his head. When I (in the first few minutes) saw that the film would be one of those "low budget" films, I hoped that at least "heard" a good story, but sometimes the films simply disappoint.
