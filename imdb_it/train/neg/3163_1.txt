Well, this is the first post I'm commenting on IMDb. You understand, this film made me come to warn all the good souls that will never stop experimenting with movies. <br /> <br /> Like most of them I gave their comments I thought I would watch this movie because it looked like it had decent actors (even though I had read the worst critics against this film), I thought I'd try it by assuming that it was a comedy movie., well, it all started well with some ahem., comedies .... then it all started getting pathetic ... man you can believe yourself, you feel like you're going and slamming every time the pathetic woman called the heroine of the film is rendered impotent. ..Huh ~~ Well, how much can a person digest a patient of all the POSSESSIVE witches a ghost trying to do everything possible to irritate you and stop you from what you are doing. <br /> <br /> The next worst thing about the film is, the hero "ZOMBIE", yes, while he loses his boyfriend he wanders like a goat, with black marks minus his eyes., and with his sister " terribly stupid "of the hero ... you're bleeding from head to toe if you've tried and managed to completely watch this movie ~!
