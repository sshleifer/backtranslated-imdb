This movie clunker sets a new standard for bad cinema. Jared Rushton offers an adequate performance of a character very badly done in an unlucky movie, thus creating a net effect of a very bad film. The main thrust of the film is how the temporary excursion of a boy in Canadian nature after surviving a plane crash alone allowed the adolescent to face his anguish to discover his mother's extramarital affair. Unfortunately it turns into a bizarre collage of random "survival events" (including two particularly engaging scenes involving a bear) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid will sit in an alley somewhere in the pot dreaming of this whole movie (and what a nightmare it is!). Furthermore, despite the signalers of some reviewers of the film's family visibility, there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or the family's vision, including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded. > <br /> All in all, a terrible film that no one should be subjected to, much less innocent children.
