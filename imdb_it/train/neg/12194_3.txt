The film begins with a voice that tells the audience where they are, and who the characters are. And this is when I started to hate the movie. With all the endless possibilities that a director has in hand, I really find a very simple and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice that says it all. I truly believe that voiceovers are betrayals to the concept of film making. <br /> <br /> I hate to hear from a voice that says where we are, what date we are, and especially what the characters think and think. I believe that a director should find a visual way to convey the characters' feelings and thoughts to the public. <br /> <br /> But after the introduction of the negative influence, a very surprising film begins that lasts long enough. The lives of a middle class family and all members individually are represented in a realistically perfect way. I think the director has a talent for capturing real-life situations. For example, a father who has to make his private calls from the bathroom might seem abnormal at first, but life itself brings us some situations that might seem abnormal but also very normal. I think the director is an excellent observer on real life. <br /> <br /> But it is so. After a while the realism in the film begins to sacrifice the story. I really felt like I had a severe headache because of the non-stop talking characters. It was as if the actors and the actresses had been given the subject and were allowed to improvise the dialogues. It's really realistic, but the characters always ask "really, it's like that" etc. Each other, or the characters that say "no" or "you're listening to me", ten times when I say it only once is enough for me to have a headache. <br /> <br /> I also think that the practice play and book reading scenes are more than they should be. I understand that the game and the book of the film are very tied to the plot, but I think the director lost the point where he should have stopped showing these scenes.
