As a youth pastor I have heard good things about this film. Then I looked at him. Acting was not the best. This is forgivable. It is the message that it is not: give Jesus your life and everything will change - you will face better, you will realize amazing catches, you will stop tinkering, you will start making touchdowns and even making the playoffs. All because Jesus magically transforms horrible undersized weaknesses into All-American athletes. I laughed out loud when a coach cited the scriptures to explain to the footballer why he lacked goals on the field. But wait, that's not all. You will get a brand new truck, a $ 6000 raise, and you and your wife's infertility fight will end up pregnant, twice. THEN you will win the state championship because God helps a weak football to conquer the winning field 12 meters further than it ever did before - and in the wind, not less - all because "God wanted him to do it". Then you will win the state championship again next year. None of these good things would have happened if the team had not chosen to follow Jesus with all their heart. <br /> <br /> Here's what I took away from the movie: God can do whatever he wants to do whenever he wants to - and it's all to make our lives better, easier and more enjoyable. Choose your favorite team and help them win games. What bible is this story based on? I bet that Santo Stefano wanted to know the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned. Someone should have made this film before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following Jesus. He would have saved them all a lot of problems.
