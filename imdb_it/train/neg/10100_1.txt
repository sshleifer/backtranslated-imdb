I usually support independent art and try to be very understanding and tolerant ... I tend to support everyone, because their efforts are worth ... <br /> <br /> but this film moves away from any understanding and tolerance limits ! <br /> <br /> imagine the following situation: <br /> <br /> 1. think of the REALLY WORST horror movie you've ever seen in your life so far. <br /> <br /> 2. think of a fantastic and attractive Art for the DVD box of that movie ... and a promising storyline ... <br /> <br /> 3. Here it is! you have ZOMBIE NATION. <br /> <br /> see it only if you really have nothing else to do. SOMETHING is better.
