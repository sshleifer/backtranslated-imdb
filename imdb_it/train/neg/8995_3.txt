I missed the beginning but saw most of it. A friend took it on DVD in FYE's economic room. <br /> <br /> The scenes are all very short, yet most of them are still too long. Most of them seem to have forgotten they had something fun! A lot of racist / sexist / "homophobic" humor, stereotypical sketches, or skits that use racist terms for people. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to remember everything that I thought was fun in it and I'm having problems .... The logo for the Tunnel Vision network is a lipstick mouth with an eyeball. The mouth opens and closes over the eyes like eyelids. A bit creepy. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Most of the actors have made things better, and it's fortunate that this bomb didn't hold them up.
