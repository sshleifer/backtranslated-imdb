Boy-girl love story / sequel with songs, only this time it's the punkette and he's the straight arrow. Do movie fans out there really like this movie? Do you have fans? I must say that the mind falters ... "Grease 2" is a truly lame enterprise that does not even have the courage, courage or courage to take the memory of its burning predecessor (like "Jaws 2" or "Exorcist II "). No, he whines in slow motion and often just plays dead. It looks and seems cheap, with a large cast lost in a messy direction and blurry management. This was the first time that an important public had seen Michelle Pfeiffer and, even if she is not embarrassed, it is a role that is worth forgetting. Failure to ignite at the lowest level. NO STARS from ****
