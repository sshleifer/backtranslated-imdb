This film, by Oscar Petersson, is unique. Its uniqueness is not in history, since many Hollywood productions have served us relatively miserable plots, but rather in the complete way in which a complete and complete business in one aspect is combined with the e-commerce in all other aspects. /> <br /> Dialogue is worse than embarrassing. The marching acting and the abyssal direction are thrown into the mix. Bosnians who speak English with heavy Swedish accents add an involuntary element of humor. A flash without inspiration and the work with the camera are the icing on the cake of cinema in Turkey. As a kind of surprise for the public, there are some completely unmotivated slow-motion sequences in which you least expect them. To add insult to injury, the whole thing is cut by someone without any timing. <br /> <br /> The "bad guy henchman turns out well after hearing a good boy's speech" scene in the church, is the point at which it is time to dethrone Ed Wood from the position of worst director of all times; Move on to Ed Wood - here comes Oscar Petersson!
