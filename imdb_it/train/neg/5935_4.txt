The saddest thing about this "tribute" is that almost all the singers (including the otherwise incredibly talented Nick Cave) seem to have lost the point where Cohen's intensity is: distributing his lines in an almost timeless balance, Cohen transmits the full measure of his poetry, his irony, his all-round humanity, laughter and tears in one. <br /> <br /> Seeing some of these singers make twisted suffering faces, throwing their pathetic squeaks in the patented effort to shout "I'm a singer!" is a real pain. It's the same feeling that many of you have probably heard in some hideous operatic versions of simple songs like "Imagine" by Lennon. Nothing, simply nothing comes close to the simplicity and linearity of the original. If there is an art form that does not need embellishment, it is Cohen's art. Embellishments throw it down the street resembling the insipid makeup of sex for sale. <br /> <br /> In this tribute of Cohen I found myself suffering and suffering through pitiful tributes and terrible reinterpretations, all completely devoid of the master's original irony and, to tell the truth, many of these singers sounded as if they had been recruited into some kindergarten talent show. It is Cohen who pays tribute to them by letting him sing his material, in reality, not the other way around: they could have been friends, or his daughter, he could have become very tender at heart and in the mood for a gift. Too bad he didn't stay in the family. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, but only at the end, Cohen himself performed his majestic "Song Tower", but even that flower was ruined by the totally incongruous background of U2, all with the expression that children they are bored when they visit their poor grandfather in the nursing home. <br /> <br /> A sad show, really, and sadder if you really love Cohen like I do.
