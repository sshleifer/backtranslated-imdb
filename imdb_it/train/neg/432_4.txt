This film had the potential to be much more than it was. But not only does it fail to complete, but at the same time it leads to the authoritarian sermon nausea. <br /> <br /> John Cusack is even flatter than he was at Midnight of the Garden of Good and Evil. The difference is that this time it is supposed to have a southern accent, which evidently loses every scene several times. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino does his shtick but looks like he is walking through this movie and collecting a salary. He is good as usual, but hardly emerging. <br /> <br /> Support the cast - launch a feminine romantic interest that has added little, if anything, to the story. About the story, a complicated story of "who really cares" in which Cusack is the presumptuous mayor's boy who only has to look for "the right thing" to do. <br /> <br /> People don't act this way. The character of Cusack loses all credibility in the end, of which without revealing it is the sermon and nausea. The final scene makes the penultimate stupidity seemingly profound. It is also completely inaccurate, but I will not enter the field. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie of the numbers. It sounds interesting for the first 40 minutes and then it's really a preaching, proselytizing and hypocrisy movie for the last hour. Better with this senseless rubbish pile.
