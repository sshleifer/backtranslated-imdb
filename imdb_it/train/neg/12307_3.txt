When I say "Doctor Who" you could conjure up an image of Tom Baker, or Jon Pertwee or maybe Peter Davison. When I say "James Bond" you will almost certainly conjure up an image of Sean Connery while a small handful of people might think of Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan. But when I say "Sgt Bilko", everyone will think of Phil Silvers. Unlike Doctor Who or James Bond, the role belongs exclusively to an actor. And this is the problem with this film version, I wish you continually to watch the old black and white show. In fact, the idea of ​​making a film version of BILKO without Silvers in the title role comes close to sacrilaggio
