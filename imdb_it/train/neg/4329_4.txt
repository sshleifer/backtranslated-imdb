I will never forget the wit and the great comedy of the movie ORIGINAL Vacation! The lines, the rhythm and timing of the events in that film are exceptional! However, this European holiday sequel is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, the Griswalds win a European vacation in a game. The problem is that many of the jokes in the film are little more than mild "ha-ha" laughter. For example, a flight attendant on a plane asks Clark: "Do you want your Coca-Cola in the jar?" Clark replies, "No, I have it right here." This is really the only line that is fun in this movie. <br /> <br /> The humor of European holidays is tense. As if the writers borrowed all the lines of the first film, they tried to redo a script that had already been done before, and they relied on a ridiculous series of slap-chasing scenes towards the end of the picture just to kill the time. /> <br /> Worse still, comedy natural comics like Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie and the original kids who played Rusty and Audrey from the first movie were never found. Their replacements are not fun, they can't act and they just seem to be going through the motions most of the time. There are also some jokes and comments about sex that are not only fun, they are in bad taste. <br /> <br /> The Griswald should have stayed at Wally World. The place that made them legends! Don't join them in this terrible European adventure. Viewers should review Vacation's original film instead of this one! You'll be glad you did.
