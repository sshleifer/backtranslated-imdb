I was babysitting a family of three young children for one night and their mother gave me this to show that they had just grabbed them at Wal-Mart earlier in the week. All three children became physically ill while watching him. I'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate, or something they'd all picked up from school, but actually it could have been this movie. Absolutely disgusting. How anyone can produce this caliber of junk is beyond me. Fortunately, I turned the film off when I noticed that the children were not responding and acting strangely. For all the parents out there, I strongly advise you not to let the children see this movie.
