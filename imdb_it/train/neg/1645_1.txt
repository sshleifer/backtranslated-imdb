I just saw this movie last night, and I had to put a warning to anyone else who thought they saw this movie. In a word - no. I seriously feel that this is something that a script student would have written in a phase of Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy, that is, every other word was a dirty word. I have no problem with profuse curses, as in "Good Will Hunting", as long as you help dig more into the characters. In this case it was just empty words with the attempt to attract a * breath * or occasional laughter from the audience. The three main characters are all their unique stereotype, the Wall Street asshole, the coffee jerk and the "I'm-Gay-Just-In-Touch-With-My-Feminine-Side" side a little less than one-click. You don't care about any of them! They are all shallow and irredeemable losers that you want to see lose. For those who dare, this film has a couple of funny moments, the beginning and the end. The toilet / vibrator scene is fun in a sick way "Uh, yes". Really, I would like to recommend this film only to my worst enemies.
