The film is rather confusing and ridiculous. The plot is terrible ... but on the positive side the acting is pretty good, with some good shouts and gasps. Sharon Stone is OK this time ... not even half is as good as the original mind. Even the murders are not as bloody as the first, which is a pity. It is not the unpredictable disorder that everyone says it is anyway. Sex is rather graphic at times while others it is clear that it is false (they are completely clothed). The script is weak most of the time, but the joke scenes and arguments between Dr.Glass and Washburn are highlights. The plot bends a few times, but the ending is terrible. The tension is always constant with a huge amount of "Oh my God!" The sequences of chases are brilliantly directed, and the shots and camera angles are impressive and bring some class into an otherwise indirect film. Sharon's stone is a bit old for that too. The parts in which we see her breasts were, in the first, delights. This time, they are too horrible to describe. The film is pretty mediocre, but it's worth a try. Especially because the film deserves a bit of buzz ... with the opening sequence which is a highlight. Don't be critical, but if you liked the first one - leave this one. Don't ruin the race. You will be happy that you have abandoned this stone.
