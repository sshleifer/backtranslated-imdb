Williamson's accent is difficult to cross. He talks incredibly fast, as if he were in a hurry to get over the lines. During the soliloquies he acts as if he were talking to someone, when he should talk to himself. All this and his bald spot only bothered me. He was too old for this role. Reading other stories from Williamson, perhaps he got this role because he was crazy and the director decided to do some imitation of life, art or forced acting. When the actors declare that Hamlet is crazy, you believe it! Marianne Faithful is a stunning beauty and could compromise the role of Ophelia and still get a ride. The set is obscure and omen, but it looks like it was shot in a real castle, especially in the tunnel / corridor scenes where the dead king shines like a great light in the sky.
