[I saw this movie once late on a public television station, so I don't know if it's on video or not.] <br /> <br /> This is one of the "Baby Burlesks" (sic) that Shirley Temple made in early 30s. It's hard to believe that someone would leave their daughter in this little racy movie that today could only be considered this side of "kiddie porn". <br /> <br /> Shirley Temple is the protagonist of a cast that probably has an average of 5 years. They are all in diapers and are in a saloon that serves milk instead of alcohol. "Cash" is in the form of a lollipop. <br /> <br /> Shirley playing a "femme fatale" sashays up to the bar and talking to the soldiers who make suggestive comments about her (!). But Shirley doesn't really need their lollipops / money because her bag is full of those of other "men". <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a black kid does a suggestive dance on a nearby table (!). <br /> <br /> What a strange film. . . children who use a lively dialogue playing adult roles in a sedan. Who invented this stuff somehow?
