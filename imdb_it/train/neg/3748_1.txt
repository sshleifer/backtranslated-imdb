... but this does not work and I am surprised to see how many people consider it good. On what basis? There are some loose suggestions here and there, but the whole material is self-indulgent and unconvincing. Lynch's films are generally intriguing because they create a sense of confusion and yet, they are very playful when they do it. There is a bit of visual sense, there are some subplots, characters, ideas, etc. But this is boring and yes, useless. Because whatever there is to be explored is either "small", or too far-fetched, or simply stated earlier in a higher way. It's just Lynch exploring DV, so nothing more should be treated this way. 1/10
