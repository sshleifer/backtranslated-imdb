I think the scarecrows are creepy, so it's a shame that this movie doesn't produce more. <br /> <br /> A group of robbers perform an emergency parachute from a plane in a huge field with scarecrows. One of them disappears with the loot and so the rest pursues him while he is pursued by frighteningly inexplicable scarecrows. Acting is the hammy and non-impressive scarecrows (when they move). On the positive side, the director gets some suspense from the static scarecrows. It is as Alfred Hitchcock says: "A bomb under a table goes off, and this is a surprise: we know that the bomb is under the table but not when it goes out, and this is suspense".
