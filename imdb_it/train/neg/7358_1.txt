This Lifetime-style movie takes the middle-aged divorced victim who eventually fights the genre to new depths of cartoon-like absurdity. <br /> <br /> Here is the 40 something former housewife wife of a successful lawyer protagonist (daughter away in college) is starting a new life after divorce, helped by a female college friend in opening a new clothing store as a kind of franchise expansion agreement. He also started a friendship with his attractive landscape architect / gardener, perhaps a little younger (who is black). But then the horror of the horrors of middle-aged women, ANOTHER 20 something feminine that she hired as a tenant to leave a room, begins to "take over" her life. <br /> <br /> What this new threat to young women really does is slightly flirt with the gardener and offer him a glass of wine that * gasped * really belonged to the divorced !! Run your bills without lowering the thermostat !! And back off on the toilet! And leave the old food gone bad in the fridge! And hang his pieces of artwork (African) in the living room !! And so on. Well, he could have killed the cat too. Yes, ok, the extent to which this does these things is bad enough but it's more than a little ridiculous, especially when it turns into a campaign. The reality of the character is that any small part of it will drive this particularly crazy woman ( So why did he rent the room - and to the horror of the horrors, a much younger woman?) <br /> <br /> It is assumed that this increasingly arrogant young woman has a mania to take control. And our brave 40 something must learn to fight against this evil (and erotically hot, of course) something. But there is this problem. Every time something 20 starts to get into trouble she uses her power - and flirts or has sex with a boy, and escapes the consequences. (Well, actually there is something in this capacity of 20 interesting things. It is not * generally * used this way.) <br /> <br /> The premise is moved from the device of the 20 something that reproached the divorce to formalize the rental contract of their room with a written contract produced by her. Obviously, something 40 does not know about these things, and something 20 has helped. The rental contract actually gives the younger woman the same right to the whole house during the rental period, with utilities thrown at the fixed price. Even if an eviction proceeding is soon suspended, something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman, presumably because she threatened something 20. You know, the judge is sympathetic to all the pain of the sweet and sexy young thing. Finally begins the "heroic" battle of 40 something for THE HOUSE. Woopie !! <br /> <br /> The only realistic or perceptive thing in this film is how incredibly easy the TROs (or protection orders) for women to get nothing more than their unfounded claims state, even if generally they are just so easy against men. Sometimes they are just as unjustified and just as motivated to take control of a home as it is here. Indeed, girlfriends who have moved with their boyfriends can often have them evicted from their homes or condominiums on the basis of no evidence, but only a claim unfounded with threats, and sometimes without even hearing their part. Even when there is a hearing, it is normally impossible to refute the claims of threats (to prove a negativity), when the burden of proof is actually on the accused, rather than on the accuser. (This is one of the few areas of American law where this is true - and it is a sign of outrage against the feminists, and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller.) Of course it is not likely to be the subject of any Movies for life in this life. <br /> <br /> The absurd basic premise of this film is based on the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic and is not taking its medicine. Even so it doesn't make sense. He is not looking for the ex-husband of a successful lawyer, although with his help (with the fury of his ex-wife) he succeeds in his search. He is looking for THE HOUSE (technically, to rule out divorce during the rental period). This second younger woman is after EVERYTHING WHO LEFT after her divorce, after business with 20 other people STOLE her husband !! (The ex-husband seems aloof and fundamentally considerate after his escapade - it doesn't matter, he's still deviated !!!) <br /> <br /> The main character is pretty good looking for his age. But her vision, attitude and concentration are so petty, frugal and completely devoid of imagination or life force that it is impossible to take care of her. Well, a major group of Lifetime fans care, I guess, judging by the average score that the small number of evaluators gave. (I just kept looking at him because he was extremely ugly and cartoonish who had a field charm. I couldn't help but see just how far they would take him.) <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** (if one thing such is possible with this film). <br /> <br /> Well, here's a clue. The film ends with 20 of something that is put in prison by the prison promising to "listen" to its 20 male collaborators and sometimes a lover, and "do whatever it says" and "let it take care of it" (intends to get her to continue taking her medication) - and then deceive him and return to THE HOUSE. There he climbs the stairs with a knife, demonically following his nemesis 40, who is bathing by candlelight, sure in the thought that the younger woman is out of his life. There is a struggle - and 40 something the mother wins - attacking 20 with a hypodermic needle full of antipsychotic drugs she had found. Then he begins to caress her, mother, and the two women have a bond, a moment of female solidarity !!! How sweet.
