Personally, I really liked "The Prophecy" in 1995. Christopher Walken was, as always, very good, and even though the film was not flawless, it was a creepy and very original horror / fantasy film that he enjoyed immensely. This lower 1998 sequel is still worth looking at, but mainly because of Walken. Walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and he is again exceptional in the role of the fallen Archangel Gabriel, who he plays for the second time here. Once again, the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth. Gabriel returns to prevent the birth of a child, namely the son of the angel Danyael (Russel Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war ... As I said above, Christopher Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel. Besides Gabriel, however, "The Prophecy II" also includes a lot of terribly annoying characters. Valerie's character was quite annoying, and Danayel bothered me even more. The biggest pain in the ass, however, was the character of Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who didn't want to shut up. However, Walken's performance is not the only saving quality of the film. The whole film is rather sad, and well shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. The resurrection scene of Gabriel at the beginning is also quite impressive and one of the most beautiful moments in all the films of "Prophecy". "The Prophecy II" is however the weakest of the three "Prophecy" films with Walken. Definitely a Christopher Walken one-man show, fun, but nothing more.
