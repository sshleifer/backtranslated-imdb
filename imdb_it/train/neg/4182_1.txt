This film is not as horrible as most of the Sci-Fi Channel movies. I'm used to seeing CGI gray spots and amateur special effects like fake blood close-ups that make it very obvious that blood is strawberry syrup or some other syrup variation. However, I thought I had seen all the possible minimums that the Sci-Fi channel could hit. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine a hand inside a rubberized sock that is frosted with syrup? These are the main Alien Vampires in this film. You can clearly see the fingers inside the rubbery sock puppets. A speaking hand comes out of the guts of the victims, and the Vampire who is in the Vampire Hunter team can talk to these Rubber Sock puppets in Transylvania. How did Alien Vampires learn Transylvania? And isn't it Transylvania in Romania? So shouldn't they speak Romanian? Why should some small cities have their own language? If you can suspend the vomit reflex and pass the talking rubber socks with your fingers moving clearly inside the Aliens' heads; then you have to deal with the other alien vampires. There are the "Leatherfaces" who like to wear the faces of their victims. Then there are the simply ugly ones that seem to have many scars on their faces. Then there are the annoying Valley Girls and their boyfriends who are human traitors and sneak into the space colonies so they can sabotage the defense systems so that these Space Vampires can attack. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you think everything The above is fun and worth a laugh, you have to face the third-party cast of Network TV scraps that make up this team of stereotyped angry heroes who constantly fight each other. Why do almost all Sci-Fi Channel movies have to use annoying, abrasive, rough or just totally nasty headers? I found myself hoping that the talking rubber socks would win.
