A slavery, a humiliation, an S & M show and not much else. The plot is flat, in reality only a trivial installation for elegantly depraved set-sets. The host of the aforementioned show, a stupid little man who shoots like crazy while wandering around the stage with clothes, was just as painful and distracted by attempts at creative editing. The dream ending seemed out of date. Thanks to the film, Aya Sugimoto was quite convincing as a tortured leader. Flower and Snake has been compared to Eyes Wide Shut but, apart from some minor superficial similarities, Kubrick is easily the most stratified, artistic and atmospheric image.
