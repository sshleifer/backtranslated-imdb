An obvious b-grade effort to collect the buzz of the hostel / saw, my expectations for this film were low (really low!) And yet still managed to disappoint at all levels. The acting is so serious that it's not even funny, the plot is non-existent and the only fright was to realize that I had wasted 1 hour and 21 minutes watching it! I'm surprised to see that 34 people gave a 10-star rating. I can only suspect that 33 of these are Cast and Crew. Is the 34th the mother of the directors? - although I'm sure she'd have a hard time getting over 2! Extra DVDs include a one-hour "making of" feature. Which raises the question, "Why?" (although perhaps it serves to show what not to do!). Avoid at all costs.
