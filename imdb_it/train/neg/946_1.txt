Why is this show so popular? It is beyond me because people like it. I think it's one of the worst sitcoms out there. <br /> <br /> Because it's so popular, I've tried watching it more than once and can't get past an entire episode. <br /> <br /> First of all, acting is horrible. Everyone is exaggerating to the point where it's annoying to watch. They speak with unnatural voices, use unnatural tones and have an unnatural body language. I saw him play better in a kindergarten school play. <br /> <br /> For another thing, IT IS NOT FUN. The plots are boring. They are not creative, intelligent or FUNNY. Shouldn't a sitcom be fun ?? Why am I not laughing? <br /> <br /> Finally, what are the seventies of this? It is almost authentic to the seventies as "Happy Days" was the fifties. <br /> <br /> OH and what happens to Ashton Kutcher? Who launched this dweeb without talent? And now he's making movies ?? Oh, save us all! <br /> <br /> If people think this is quality television, it worries me.
