This Cannon Movie Tale is the worst, and it's positive proof that a five-minute fairy tale doesn't make a full-length movie. Poor Sid Caesar as the vain emperor, he is made to look so stupid, it's hard to look at him. Like the cunning tailor, Robert Morse does not have an ounce of charm. Not even his unfortunate nephew (Jason Carter) The "songs" are scary and only slow down what is of the plot. The management is practically non-existent and the supporting characters add very little. Lysette Anthony is as pretty as the emperor's daughter, but her voice was obviously nicknamed for some reason, a fate shared by many of the minor players. And the film strips at a snail's pace. Hans Christian Andersen must have done somersaults in the grave when he appeared. You can honestly say, at least in this story, it's no surprise that he went straight to the video oblivion.
