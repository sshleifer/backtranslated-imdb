I saw this movie on an American Airlines flight heading west. It was so ugly that it actually made the flight look longer. The plot had potential (who wouldn't love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every Elvis imitator she meets?) But it's been ruined a million times by really bad writing. Towards the end it is an ugly embarrassing scene in which a band of Elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino that sends back the sky thinking that it will come back, so a group of stars moves together to form an "Elvis" constellation, which immediately fires of lightning to the imitators, sending them to crash on the roof. Bad ... REALLY bad. What is the theme of the whole film. I would avoid this at all costs.
