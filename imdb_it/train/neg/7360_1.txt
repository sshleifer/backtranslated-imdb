This is one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. This is largely due to factual implausibility (like an obvious agent who presents himself as a bank loan officer while making it clear that he is talking to someone through a thread or scene in which scientists assume it is safe to enter a room where a virus has been released even if "it has not found a viable host" does not mean it will never find one), the economic sets (the bank seems poorly built to look like a dungeon) and bad acting. It is the story of an organized criminal group that successfully stole a deadly virus capsule. However, the head honcho who decides to remove him from a bank safe, does so at the same time a bank shot is going down, the same FBI agents have been informed of this, and at the same time a terrible earthquake breaks out . Needless to say, the consequences of the earthquake are messy in more than one way. However, the results are not an enticing action film, but one that was obviously first class junk since the beginning of the film. (Perhaps this is why some of the screenshots capture the appearance of the package to be created with computer graphics rather than the actual capture of the screen from various sequences of the film). What the hell was Ron Perlman doing in this, I have no idea. I wonder if he was embarrassed to be in it as if I'd seen it.
