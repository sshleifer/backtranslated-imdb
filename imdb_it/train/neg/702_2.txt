Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher, and the light fades quickly. If not you, what other reason to see it. five college children are enrolled to prepare an old dormitory for its demolition expiration date. The problems occur automatically when a bizarre homeless person is soliciting, and the group is short of a few people. So a killer is on the loose. I honestly wanted to say that I would have liked this. He had a good set up, or maybe there was only Daphne Zuniga. The film is too slow and almost silent like a library. Most of the acting is below average, and the "point of view" moments are so old news. The acclaimed composer Christopher Young of films like "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment" marked this, in a repetitive line of demarcation that was best done for a TV movie. However, it looks higher than the film deserves. So, besides Young and Zuniga, this scrapes the bottom of the cane.
