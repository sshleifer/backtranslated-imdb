Both my wife and I thought this film was a smaller version of the BBC Murder Mystery, made especially for TV (BBC) ... which is good in itself but not great. The plot has little interpersonal or chemical tension, and not a lot of plot. Woody Allen's character is just kind of wandering around in the mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson don't have much else to do. It is rather disappointing, I must say. Ian McShane's role is only an expanded cameo aspect. <br /> <br /> The first thing that came to my mind was "I wonder how much the BBC had to pay Woody Allen to get him away from Manhatttan?" He must have needed the money, and must have needed his appeal to expand his audience beyond the two-star youth market. I'm giving this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it's an insolent background noise. If you want something to wear while knitting or sorting your stamp collection, this will do the job. I wouldn't pay to rent it again.
