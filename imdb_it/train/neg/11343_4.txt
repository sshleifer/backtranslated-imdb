1st watched on 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Jim Kammerud and Brian Smith): the alleged Drab sequel and non-spectacular '101 Dalmatian'. Yes, the film continues where it ended up in the first, but the problem is that it looks very similar to the original. One of the great things about the original was the rhythm of the story, which it does not have. Animation is also not very spectacular for Disney and all we get is that the same characters go through the same kind of story all over again. When Disney will stop boring us with sequels and re-do etc. Etc. Probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare they put out.
