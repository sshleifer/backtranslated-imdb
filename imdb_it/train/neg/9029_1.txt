This film virtually wastes the talents of every actor in what could best be called a "potboiler". <br /> <br /> Despite the action-packed opening of Top Gun, it's all downhill from there with lots of stereotypes and unlikely situations following each other until you try to choke on your popcorn . <br /> <br /> There are so many dead-end plots in this movie that I was guessing at some point that it was made by tying together a discarded TV series. <br /> <br /> The role of Quinn's Mexican drug lord is ridiculous and his "comrades" snatched by a Quinn-Martin cop from the 1970s. Costner's character is made of wood and gives us no reason to believe he fell in love with Mendez's wife. Nor are we convincingly convinced that we believe the wife is in pain for the company and will miss the first hot body that arrives. <br /> <br /> Definitely a "B" movie at best and a huge waste of time for everyone involved.
