Seriously reworked and often confused, the original version of Man On Fire was at least ten years old no longer updated when it was produced and the years passed have not improved. This is the kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience do to attract attention and all the others do just to pay for their extraordinary food or their drug dealer, with Scott Glenn's bodyguard coming out on a limb to save his 12-year-old charge, the kidnapped daughter of a rich Italian family. An interesting cast - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Pryce - have done everything better, the action is slow and sparse and only the exceptionally fine soundtrack by John Scott (part of which appeared on the last reel of Die Hard) makes a positive impression A case where the remake (made by Tony Scott, the director's original choice for this version) is an improvement.
