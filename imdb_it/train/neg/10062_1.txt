Nintendo !!! YOU #% $ @ ERS !!! How could you do this to me? I can't believe it ... this movie is actually worse than the first. I went to see him at the theater with my brother because my mother forced me to tag ... oh God ... where do I start? The SUCKED plot. The reciting voice SUCK. SUCKED animation. The ending is REALLY SUCCESS. If you enjoyed this movie, YOU ARE ALSO YOU. And at Futuramafan1987, who said that this was the greatest film of all time, you are a TOOL, UNIQUE AND SIMPLE. This is not a movie for anyone except the ten-year-old sleeping with the Game Boys who think Pikachu is God. I'm still crying until today thinking about that horrendous movie movie ... and then there was the adventure Pikachu ... don't even get me started on that horrible movie mess. It is, indeed, one of the most boring experiences of my whole life. Don't go and look at this at any cost. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: exit, find all the copies of this movie you can and burn it. Burn all and then proceed to rent a GOOD movie, like Aliens ... or Bowling For Columbine ... or even Back to the Future!
