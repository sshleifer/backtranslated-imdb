This film is really bad, so bad that even Christopher Lee can't save it. A poor story, an even poorer script and a simple bad direction make this horror film truly exceptional, the exceptional part is that it is the only horror film I can honestly say I would never watch again. This garbage makes plan nine appear from outerspace as an oscar material.
