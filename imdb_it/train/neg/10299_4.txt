I must admit that I blocked this by thinking that something should have happened, besides the corpse in the first scenes ... and at his disposal of him. I was wrong. It was a real Betty hits cinema the Beach enclosed for the first part by Mordant Morven. I really don't care what young Scottish girls do today, who their lives are, what drugs they take. Visually, the walk through the Cabo de Gata in Andalusia was pleasant and certainly the highest point for me. The nadir was the store for his dead boyfriend. While the film was closing I had two thoughts ... 1. Is this all there is? 2. Now I understand why his boyfriend killed himself. Rename it. "Bare Bitch Boredom, or what I did during my trip to Spain." I'm so crazy they attack these things.
