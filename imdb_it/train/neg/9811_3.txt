What can I say??? This film was so stupid and stupid that I thought it was a psychic DRAG comedy - They should rename it "Bitching Pregnant Cat Fight!" What a stupid waste of time, if you want to see (DEATH TO DIE !!! "I WANT YOUR QUEEN OF THE CHILD) Jennifer Tilly is her Freaky self, so she rents one of the" Chucky ", oh ya," The Bride Of Chucky "movies. "It's more fun to watch Chelly's two plastic" Ugly "dolls (one of them Jennifer Tilly turned into the female version of Ugo), while watching Daryl Hannah being pregnant, stupid and stupid and Jennifer Tilly grinding Husbang into a robot kitchen reminded me that my mother was trying to do the housework! OK, it's just BAD !!!
