So don't even think about renting it from stores, because this is a damn bad movie. You'd think JJ Abrahams wrote this film. Basically, a mouse is thrown into the toilet and somehow has to go back. Fans of the terrible "Shrek" could have fun, but "Wallace & Gromit" fans will probably walk away disgusted. Also, why didn't they do it in clay or clay? I mean, CGI animation ?? For an AARDMAN film ?? !! Obviously, Aardman looked around as they let Dreamworks do everything. Wrong, wrong, WRONG !!! Almost every single character is horrible, except for that freaky frog guy, which is perfect for a movie villain. But the rest of the film is DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I almost fell asleep watching the movie. No, wait, really, I fell asleep watching the movie. It's just terrible. But fortunately, it's not as bad as "Shrek".
