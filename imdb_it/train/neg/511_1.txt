I was one of the many extras in this big bomb. I happened to be in the right place to work safely for the A.I.R. as it was known in those days. Thank goodness, my scene is in the first minutes of the film and I don't have to sit for the whole thing. It was more like a big party than a movie set but hey, the pay was good. Attention to detail was not a strength for this, but who would know. The funny thing was to see the cars on the track at really low speed and then in the movie it accelerated to what was near normal speed. Many scenes have been changed while they were being shot, I guess I have to shave costs and times. But everyone was having so much fun!
