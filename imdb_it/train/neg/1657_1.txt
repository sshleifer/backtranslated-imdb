This film was worth five punches on my "hurter card". I saw him while I was in Virginia in the mid-70s. I saw it alone, so I wasn't distracted while watching it. He sucked. It was the most ridiculous, total waste of celluloid I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I know that others who have reviewed this film thought it was great. I offer you this: if it was so fantastic, how was the box office? End of the discussion.
