This was the worst Christmas movie I've ever seen. I took my two young children to see this. It was the darkest and sadest plot - the family has no money, the mother loses her job, the father is killed in the bank, the robber steals a family car with both children in the back and after a high-speed chase, he leaves the bridge and drowns them in the river. Mom is left alone. No wonder his Christmas spirit is over. Christmas angels do not save drowned children and Santa Claus does not report dead fathers! I thought this was the worst message to send children. Better to tell them there is NO Santa Claus than to show them a movie like this !!
