This film is something like a sequel to "White Zombie", since it is produced by the same man (Halperin) and features zombies. Halperin, the George A. Romero of his time, fails to deliver with this, however. <br /> <br /> We have a man who can control the minds of people in Cambodia and a quest to destroy the source of his power so that zombies can be sent for free. Also, a love interest for the evil man. <br /> <br /> Where this film really excels is in the images. The Cambodian temples and dancers are very beautiful and the zombies seem very powerful in their large numbers. Unfortunately, we don't really see much of the zombies in action and the romance seems to play a role too big for a horror movie (although this has a valid reason for the plot later). <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see zombies from the 1930s attacking defenseless people in the city, but this film has not been published. And no strong villain (like Bela Lugosi) was waiting to fight against our heroes. And the use of Lugosi's eyes? A nice effect, but misleading like never in the film ... why not recreate this with the eyes of the new actor? Overall, a film that could be a great one with a small reworking script and could be a powerful remake in the future (especially if they keep it in the same post-war period). Heck, if they can fix "The Hills Have Eyes" then this movie has hope.
