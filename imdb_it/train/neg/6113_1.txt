I started crying because seeing this film was my first film experience ever at 13 months. I remember it was incredibly bloodthirsty and made me angry. I watched it again on TV a few years ago. Big mistake - the acting is made of wood, the plot does not exist and the film lacks merit, unless T & A's 23rd and 23rd is what makes you go ... 0 / ****
