Well, to answer a person's question of "why nobody remembers this movie?" it is because in reality, not many people have seen it in 1978 and since then it has not been shown on TV. (If it's on the video that would be new to me!) Even in the era of the sometimes senseless comedies that were the 70s, film-goers had the intelligence to avoid this movie. Unless they love Billy Crytal, Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers "that" so much! <br /> <br /> Paul Lynde was more fun than "Witches" or "Hollywood Squares" up here. Joan Rivers at this point in her career was having a laugh making cruel jokes about the weightlessness of singer Karen Carpenter! Har-har Joan! It also seems that every "a little" famous name of the time is in the cast. (The most surprising is Doris Roberts following "Everybody Loves Raymond".) <br /> <br /> However, a good idea for a plot, a man who gets pregnant instead of a woman goes to waste here. With the help of a male friend, Crystal prepares with a prostitute to lose her virginity for good, but since she is "at the top" in her place, she becomes pregnant! (A comment on women taking positions of power away from men). <br /> <br /> Crystal's stomach grows, passes through all female emotions and related feelings. Unfortunately, it is now a socially misunderstood outcast! He is attacked by a crowd that wants him swept away (I think). <br /> <br /> He is forced to go in solitude to have his baby ... in a barn. Or if you want, a manger (God knows where it might have come from! Ewwww!) It turns out (no wonder) to be a girl! <br /> <br /> All the rest of this film is useless and forgettable, humor is of a higher or lower level. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for a good idea and some nice touching and relevant moments w / Billy Crystal. Ignore the rest of the Rabitt Test, everything falls apart! <br /> <br /> I can't believe Roddy McDowell has signed! (END)
