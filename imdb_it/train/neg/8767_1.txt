Is this the movie ??? Is this what the Indians are trying to show ?? I think this is an extra effort on the part of a sick director to overthrow the Pakistani soldiers and actually the country ... but what we Pakistanis know is that we are always in front of India in every part of our lives ... not only in armed counters. <br /> <br /> Well ... this is a bad movie like Border's at the beginning of 1997 ... and the director and the writer have just tried to overcome the shame of the defeat in Kargil by the forces Pakistani armies, creating films like these .. <br /> <br /> One thing is very clear ... Every time there is a meeting between Pakistan and India ... we will win .... !!! So Mr. Dutta tries to make good films instead of Nonsense movies like this
