Devil's Experiment: 1/10: Hard porn movies fall into two categories those with a semblance of plot (Gee who is a lucky pizza guy) and those without (Anal Amateurs 36). The devil's experiment falls firmly into the latter category. <br /> <br /> Obviously it's the horror version of hardcore porn. A plot almost completely minus 43 minutes of waiting for the money fired. Shot on video in 1985, it consists of three relatively un descriptive Japanese boys who torture a rather unattractive Japanese girl. The tortures range from the trivial (slapping her 50 times, giving her a kick to a hundred), the fool (tying her to an office chair and turning her), the fear factor (a bath of larvae and guts of sheep) and finally the money shot. (A successful piercing of the eyeball). <br /> <br /> Here, no plot, no motive, only tree shots and Blair Witch torture. The girl seems bored and with the exception of screaming, "no one expects the Spanish inquisition" during the scene of the office chair I was bored. Staring at the screen in amazement, waiting for the money shot. Just like hardcore porn.
