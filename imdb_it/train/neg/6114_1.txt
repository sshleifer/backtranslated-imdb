Because that's all he does through the whole film, he strips for good reason. When Tarzan gets bitten by a snake, he suddenly removes his clothes. When is a poisonous boa constrictor? How did Tarzan poison himself, by the way? The whole movie is ruined. They couldn't get the animal species for this movie. What does an Orangutang wander around those chimpanzees? He must have wandered on the set of a much better movie. The group of men of the cannibal tribe seems Why did Bo and his father paint, if they were to be eaten later? It was probably just a stupid excuse to show her breasts and curves again. His father hunted, approached and fooled around a bull elephant standing too close. A true African elephant that was not of the circus, he would have trodden the ass of this idiot. A smart hunter would start shooting as soon as he saw it. And I can't help but wonder if the camera was on LSD, because it kept showing various scenes that went in slow motion, for no good reason. It made absolutely no sense. The boa constrictor with which Tarzan fought in the water, looks like one of those 12 Ft rubber snakes that you can buy in a Spencer Gifts shop. Tarzan was strangely sp Eechless in this movie, maybe from Bo who shows so much. I'm sorry, but this is a rip off of a classic Tarzan movie in black and white, with a similar but better story. We are not talking about the plot. There is a scene in this I saw that everyone forgot to mention it. * (SPOILERS ALERT) * The scene in which he is trying to save Jane and his father, makes him stand too close to running water. He made it look like he's urinating on someone below him. Eww! Moreover, he and Jane are joking on a beach, with perverted monkeys jumping and clapping their hands. Certainly he did well when his father died. * (END OF THE SPOILERS) * There should be a warning from the Surgeon General about this film. seeing Bo naked too much in this movie will make you blind.
