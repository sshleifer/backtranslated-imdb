I am surprised by the many female voters who also give better grades to this film. My thought on this film is that the target audience is adult and male. Whipped and tortured women, ruthless revenge and a high number of corpses are typical ingredients, introduced in the history of cinema by the subgenre of spaghetti. Opening and destruction by hand are repercussions of DJANGO. The SHOOTER however lacks the style of eg DJANGO. Scoring, acting and cinematography are mediocre, but if you're looking for the ingredients mentioned above, you're in the right place. And the actors don't have an Italian accent. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
