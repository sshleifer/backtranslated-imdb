I honestly can't understand why this movie is so good here, nor why Bakshi thought it was his best movie. I'm a big fan of Bakshi's previous works - in particular "Heavy Traffic" and "Wizards", but frankly "Wizards" (1977) was the last film he made. After that he turned to the mainstream, starting with the diabolical 'The Lord of the Rings' and then working on the heavyweight sword and sorcery Frank Frazetta, for 'Fire and Ice'. <br /> <br /> What can I say? The story is childish, the animation is of television quality - I insist that it is considerably worse than its stuff in the 70s - and that 'Wizards' had real imagination, extravagance, a splendid background art, and an underground sensibility, for adults, 'Fire and ice' has just been designed for 14-year-olds, and has the intellectual weight of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you liked Gor's books, you might like them. In my opinion, this was just another blip in the quality of the slides after "Wizards" from which Bakshi never recovered (although he did some fairly recent TV content) <br /> <br /> 4.5 on 10
