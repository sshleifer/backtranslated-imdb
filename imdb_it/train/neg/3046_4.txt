I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 10 years old. My mom bought it at our local Kmart because it was on sale for $ 5 on VHS. He thought it would be a good Christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch. This film, however, scared the hell out of me. Perhaps you are wondering, how could a movie about Santa Clause scare someone? The film's plot revolves around Satan sending one of his servants, Pitch, to earth in an attempt to kill Santa and ruin Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a demon from hell to kill Santa. Pitch chases Father Christmas all Christmas night, trying to trap him on the ground when the sun comes up on Christmas day, because if Santa can't get back to his home in space, he turns to dust. Don't get me wrong, the film is fun and quite funny, however, the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell (which occurs at the beginning of the film) is simply disturbing.
