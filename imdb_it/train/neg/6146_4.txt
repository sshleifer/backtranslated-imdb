How this film escaped the wrath of MST3K I'll never know. "Gymkata" is a ridiculous action film, full (or is it empty?) With very thin plots, stupid characters and absurd situations. But take it from me, if you like watching poor but stupid movies, you'll have a lot of fun with "Gymkata". <br /> <br /> The action centers around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents (at least I think they were government agents) to become a spy. You see that his father was another quasi-government agent, who disappeared in competition in this game, eloquently called "The Game". So the gymnast (played blandly by Kurt Thomas) trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to her lost dad. <br /> <br /> It looks promising right? Ok, so it doesn't, but the fact that the bare bones represent the sypnopsis doesn't begin to describe the joys of this film. They can be found in the strange details of the film. Like the mysterious Asian girl of the gymnast, who doesn't talk for the first half hour of the movie, then suddenly starts talking, and doesn't shut up for the rest of the time! Or the tough tough tough guy who likes to create and break the non-existent rules of "The Game" whenever he likes. And of course there is the delicious game of our hero through the "Villaggio dei Pazzi" (evidently this is the real name of the place!). Nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there. <br /> <br /> But where the film really shines are the action scenes. Since our protagonist is a gymnast, the director thought it wise to stick gym equipment in the alleys and squares of Middle Eastern cities, so that our Gymkata master could better use his gymnast skills to fight the scourge of evil in parallel bars and pummel horses. Must be seen to believe it. <br /> <br /> An interesting thing to note. A lot, I'd say about half of the cast, dies from being hit by an arrow. Interesting because the arrows are the only credible effects or actions in the whole film. If these were really effects, my only important note of compliment to anyone who has come up with these very realistic arrow wounds. More likely, this was the film's way of not paying extra. Nevertheless, "Gymkata" deserves a look if you can see it without paying and look for some nonsense that is an easy target for riffing. <br /> <br />
