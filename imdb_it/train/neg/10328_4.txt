I think the show had a good concept to work with. But the execution was poor. The script is poor and acting is bad. There were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way, such as the protest against gay marriage or finding the cemetery. The show cannot be properly defined as a comedy show because it lacks miserable humor. I should say that this show has just succeeded in putting the life of the Muslim community to some extent. <br /> <br /> So far the second season is worse than the first one. I had my hopes for this show, but I was a little disappointed. I still appreciate CBC for putting this concept in front of the spectators. However, I wish good luck for the future.
