This film is really disturbing. Unfortunately, not for the reasons film producers would have hoped for. <br /> <br /> There's also a fantasy serial killer, but it's not even disturbing. It's just your bad comic book classic, a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Freddie Kruger, albeit with nothing particularly cool to add to either of them. Incidentally, even for the most vile and most reprehensible criminals, can they be held in chains in a position of stress, standing, with their arms open 24 hours a day, week after week? I suppose that in the world that Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay gave us, everything is possible. <br /> <br /> No, what is really disturbing about this film is the main character, Danny. This unattractive young man, helped and favored is true by some ridiculously ridiculous security agreements and a doctor completely devoid of any idea of ​​professional ethics or patient privacy, wanders into the hospital room occupied by what can only be described as a vulnerable and defenseless young woman, and on the basis of nothing (her chronic sleep precludes being able to give something as informed consent) she imagines herself having a kind of special relationship with her. <br /> <br /> Apparently in a few days, he claimed for himself the right to kidnap her, believing (completely falsely, as we find out) that he is better able to take care of her than anyone else, and within minutes of bring her back to her apartment, sexually harassing her even if she is (again because of her drowsiness) completely unable to consent or resist. <br /> <br /> Our suspicions about why you would hear this connection are soon confirmed. Obviously he is more or less incapable of forming mature adult friendships, not to mention sexual relations, so instead falls on this essentially infantile woman, who due to her permanent sleep has a mental age corresponding to a lived experience of a few years. The scene in which he discovers the ice cream is particularly scowling, and the timidly gentle look she gives him when he says with joy of having to clean it again causes a particular shudder of horror. But again, I fear, not that shudder of horror that filmmakers hoped for, but a spasm of repulsion much more direct. We can all see clearly what's at the end of our forks here - it's the perfect dream of pedophile innocence, sexual conformity and total dependence. Horrible, horrible, horrible. <br /> <br /> What else do we have in this mixture? Dreamlike twisted landscapes not quite similar to those of the Taurus. The obligatory argument "You have to go to the police", where the protagonist always has a reason not to do it, even if it is the only reasonable course of action. The sequence of automata, highly praised in the comments here, although completely and utterly useless ("It serves no purpose!", As Sigourney Weaver memorably memorized in Galaxy Quest) and looking at me just like the Abominable Doctor Phibes did in Saw the derivatives. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Combs does his best though, so a star for that, and another pair because you have to keep a lower score for movies that are even worse than this, and in general this is well-shot and performed competently.
