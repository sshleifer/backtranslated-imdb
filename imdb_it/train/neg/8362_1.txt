This is a really bad movie. I tormented my brain and can't find a positive comment to make. The acting is atrocious. I have seen more credible cable access performance. The plot is ridiculous. Stolen diamonds, secret recordings of the president and a shark that attacks everything that comes close to him should have done for cheese fun in the worst case. The night of the sharks is not even that bad it's okay. The dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it had been written a few seconds before it was shot. And to top it off, Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard. I'm surprised my ears didn't start bleeding from the techno sounds synthesized in the 80s that someone took the trouble to record. <br /> <br /> From all I read, the Italian film industry had died in 1987. Night of the sharks are like a final nail in the coffin.
