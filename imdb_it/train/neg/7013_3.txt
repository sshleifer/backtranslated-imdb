Unfortunately this film, 54 was a pathetic attempt at the true "Studio 54" story. The only thing that was positive in the picture was "Mike Myers", which was a joy to see. 'Neve Cambpell', even though his role was small, unfortunately it was ugly. The bottom line is that this film lacked a good performance by the actors, except one and that the conversion of the true story was a desperate attempt at a good script.
