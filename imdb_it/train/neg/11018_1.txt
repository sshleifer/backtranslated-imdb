I purchased this rather cheap ex-rental video, thinking that the cover was very pretty. And it was nice, but the movie is rubbish. I can handle B-grade, sometimes I also enjoy a good B romp (for example 'Surf Nazis Must Die' is a classic example of how fun the genre can be), but this was simply bland. Incredibly boring scenes were broken too poorly by good cheap porn and entertaining dreamy horror sequences. This film has very little to offer.
