An OK film, set in Mexico, about a successful man (Scott Glenn) who walks around with the struggling American writer and his Mexican girlfriend after a hit. Does he pay them to take him to the border? but things get out of hand. <br /> <br /> It starts pretty well, but quickly gets upset and dies. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Any relationship the twist is badly set up and hard to believe. An absence of passion, and basically no reasoning behind her that left one man for another, made him ridiculous - and the ending was predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> ** FINE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel is the US agent in the wake of successes, but he seems a little confused about how tedious and slow the script is ...
