I also saw this film, and although it is very well done, I found it a heartbreaker and I would not recommend it to women who have small children .. The terror on this mother's face when she sees her child about to be hit by a train is really heartbreaking. And the sad thing is - internally dies. In the end he returns to the Applacian Mountains. All the money in the world that makes making dolls does not hide the pain he has. I remember his desperate face as he pulled money out of his clothes to try to heal his son. I'm surprised this movie takes place in Detroit, because when I looked at it I thought people had come to Cincinnati, Ohio. This too was a journey for the poor of the mountains.
