Well, if it weren't for Ethel Waters and Sammy Davis, 7-year-old Jr. (here without the Jr.), Rufus Jones for the President would be one of the worst representations of the African-American stereotypes I've seen since the early days of the talkie era and it wouldn't have been worth seeing for that. Ms. Waters is excellent here singing "Am I Blue?" and "Underneath Our Harlem Moon" while Mr. Davis shows us how his childhood experience in the entertainment world has prepared him for his adult superstar status. He's so good at tap-dancing here that for a while I thought he was a small person with decades of experience. So if you are willing to ignore the negative connotations here, Rufus Jones for the president should offer some fun. Post scriptum This marks the fourth time today that I have seen and heard the song "I'll Be Glad When You're Dead You Rascal You", performed on film, this time by Davis. It must have been a very popular song at this time.
