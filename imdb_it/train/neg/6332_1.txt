I couldn't wait to see this movie when it came out, as I was a big SNL fan. When my boyfriend and I went to see him, the people coming out of the initial show screamed, "Don't waste your money!" But of course we had to find out for ourselves. <br /> <br /> While there were some funny bits (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), most seemed to have been modified in a seriously fun 1-hour show. It was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> When the opera singer arrived, many people got up and left. This made me laugh, because I realized that O'Donoghue was pressing the buttons of the people on purpose with this film. Or he was simply crazy. Whatever - it's not necessary to waste time looking at it, it's so bad.
