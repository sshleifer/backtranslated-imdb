What made the French connection work so well was the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In this catastrophe directed by Frankenheimer (which also brought us gems like Raindeer Games and Dr. Moreau's island), the film focuses on Doyle and his unique obsession with capturing Charnier (Rey). The fictitious idea that the NYPD would allow Doyle to travel to Marseille to find Charnier with the help of local French authorities is a fun laugh. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Charnier doesn't jump the city with 65 pounds of pure slap !!! A street value of 32 million, but yes, we send Doyle to find this guy, it was his grip after all. Please!!! The story was weak. The acting was terrible (with the sole exception of Hackman, who completely exaggerated his part). The management was everywhere. Even the cuts between the scenes were terrible. Do yourself a favor and watch the first episode twice and skip this one.
