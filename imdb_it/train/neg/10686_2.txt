Please help the economy - spend your money elsewhere! The synopsis of the film is: the First Lady murdered her husband because he was cheating on her. That's all. Unidentified by anyone except Cuba and Angie, he designs and implements a vast murderous conspiracy that nobody knows about ... and leaves completely free. <br /> <br /> Some specific points are particularly hilarious: standing in front of the president, Cuba rejects the murderer's bullet ... which then enters the back of the president's head. <br /> <br /> Cuba and Angie watch movies from a camera, and see ... a clue. They do everything to protect the film, believing they are the only people who have a copy of this very public film. <br /> <br /> Cuba speaks with a member of the presidential staff. PSM comments that there was no conspiracy. Cuba states that there was more than one person involved. The PSM then insinuates that the conspiracy includes the FBI, the CIA and the NSA. Why, I wonder if the PSM is involved. <br /> <br /> Ms Archer, the First Lady, is a bizarre artist. Cuba cannot decipher a picture and says "You are too close ... stand back ... look at it from a different perspective, look at it from my perspective". Can anyone miss this clue?
