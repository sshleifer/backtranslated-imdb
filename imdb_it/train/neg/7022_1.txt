In over 70 years of watching movies, this is one of the worst comedies ever made. Mel Brooks, Mike Meyers and a few others have made very bad comedies, but this is the absolute bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> It's not much fun since the first opening, on the beat during the credits. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton, who I usually like, must have needed her salary. He desperately needs to re-learn his trade. <br /> <br /> Dax Shepard (I don't know who he is) needs a better director to show him how to behave. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler is not up to her role. <br /> <br /> Mike White needs to find another character, he did this same person a couple of times too. <br /> <br /> Ken Howard who started years ago as a top-level actor, even though he wasn't as good as before. <br /> <br /> There is nothing decent I can say in this film comedy attempt. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (out of 4) points 25 (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
