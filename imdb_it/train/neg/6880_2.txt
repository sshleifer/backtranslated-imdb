I was excited that someone had made a documentary about what it was to be Puerto Rican. When I heard it was Rosie Perez, I wondered ... maybe he could know what it really means to be Puerto Rican. As far as I knew ... she was a Nuyorican. Well, anyway, I sat anxiously looking at my popcorn. I realized 10 minutes that my first apprehension was right. Rosie Perez has little knowledge of what it means to be Puerto Rican. This "documentary" is more of a first-hand account, very very personal about what it means to be a Nuyorican ... and all that this entails. She (like most Nuyoricans I know) has a watered-down, partial, and sometimes twisted sense of history. (How could they not ... live here.) Yes, everyone is proud. How they should be! But many do not know the background of true culture, history, political background or language for the most part. Everything became very very evident with his participation in the Vieques issue. Regardless of my personal intent it is on this subject ... at least I know what the hell I fight for. She is arrested for something she knew little about ... and who participated only because she was a "Puerto Rican cause". I really don't understand how embarrassed I am to admit it. For those of you who are not Puerto Ricans, please consider this as a partial account of a woman's journey of self-discovery and acceptance. Don't take this as a gospel ... much isn't even true. Please consider the source. Rosie is an actress; not a historian. This film is not and should never be, for other Nuyoricans, the basis for their information. Instead, just a step towards finding more information, learning and debating what is reality. Not just the one coming from this woman's eyes.
