A rather obvious number thriller, in which the only possible turning point turns out to be a hiding place for nothing. I was mainly looking at Isabelle Huppert's performance in English. It wasn't great, but then it was a strange role. I wouldn't be surprised if half of his contribution was left on the cutting room floor along with many rewrites from the last few minutes. <br /> <br /> Acting is the least attractive thing about this movie. Steve Guttenburg seems to be trying to enrich his role with the charm that everyone has told him to have. There is an incredibly stupid sequence in which it is suggested that her sexual ability will be able to help treat PTSD. It is an uninteresting performance. Elizabeth McGovern is more an attraction with genuine charm and character but it is a small consolation. 3/10
