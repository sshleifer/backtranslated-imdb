A terrible amateur filmmaker (no, not Todd Sheets), his new friend and sister explore a cave. The friend and sister return and are saved. Meanwhile a band of horribly recited girls defend their 'ground'. Whatever the hell it means. This film and I use the term VERY vaguely so ugly it is .. well bad. Humor is painfully little fun, "action" is simply sad. Now I've seen some horrendously horrendous "horrors" movies in my time and I couldn't get tired of my approach to watching low budget movies, yet I still cry openly for anyone who chooses to sit through it. ONLY for the most hardened masks among you. but the rest escapes FAST !! <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
