This was really a waste of time ... the film has a weak plot, the story is fragmented and ends very abruptly with many gaps ... even if the animation is top notch. <br /> <br /> Once the film started, I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt by telling me that it might be interesting in the next phase, but it was never unique. This same plot was repeated over and over again, but what made it worse was that the main hole in the plot was the whole story of how to kill the bad guys ... The writer could have done much more with the whole concept but it seemed that he or she didn't have their heart in it and they wanted to close the movie as soon as it started. <br /> <br /> Overall, too much hype but not able to provide.
