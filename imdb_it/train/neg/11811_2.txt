Do you know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life story, and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and leave? Well, I had a similar feeling while watching this movie. Ok, actually I chose to go see April, and I knew the taste of Nanni Moretti for becoming the only star of Dear Diary, but after about half an hour of this latest episode of his memoirs I wanted to give Moretti the mother of all the slaps. Dear Diary was fun, unusual, and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways. In April, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so that all you hear for an hour and a half is an acute lament about how his politics is the best, or what eccentric piece of popular culture is tickling his fantasy at the moment. He also finds time to throw films that he doesn't like, something I thought was for losers like me. Surely being in a position like his, you would think he would try to make a point about cinema a little smarter than that. Making a suitable film maybe, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that isn't completely dominated by its annoying voice. And when he started flattering his newborn baby, I just wanted to go with a normal director, preferably not obsessed with me with a strange inclination for vulgar music. The next time someone you don't know tries to tell you their life story, slap it. Every hit will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism.
