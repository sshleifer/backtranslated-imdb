This movie is so horrible. So bad that I can't stand spending anything other than a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> None of the details of the crimes are properly reproduced. Lots of slaughter movies. Strange cuts and changes. No continuity to the plot. Acting is absolutely the most amateur I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This film bomb was obviously made to make money without regard to the accuracy of its content. Camera work is blurred at times and always shaky. Looks like it was shot on video. <br /> <br /> In fact, now that they have Dennis Rader in prison, I would like them to put the guys who made this horrible movie in prison too. <br /> <br /> Seriously, don't even think about looking at this. I would give a negative star if I could.
