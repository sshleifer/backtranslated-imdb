I stayed overnight and got extremely bored around 2:00, so I flipped through the channels aimlessly and ran into H.B.O. where this "classic" was playing. Initially I was happy to have caught something at the beginning, but my happiness faded for about two minutes in the film. The entire film was centered around an unattractive man who was afraid of females, four beautiful but leisurely women who worked as a waiter to his uncle and his enormously fat and extremely miserable cousin who also works in the restaurant. There are some strange twists in this film that make it a little interesting, but certainly not worth watching. Basically, if you have nothing to do a few nights or just can't sleep the drugs work much better. However guys there is a lot of skin so it might be ok to look without audio, but even that can be annoying
