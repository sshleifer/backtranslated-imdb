Occasionally a new entrée of foreign films is served. This is their big attraction. They take from life and serve it raw. American films, rarely the courage to touch the prohibited subjects of society. Too many hang-ups and a morbid fear of financial failure. The almighty dollar determines their selections. Something that invites European directors. Furthermore, audiences around the world remain hungry for "different" films, especially those that offer a salty bite to the wretched and suffering body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many viewers want the beauty, poetry and pristine taste of life. This is what the film "To the left of the Father" offers to the curious public. A family closed in the belief that the unity of the family derives from the unity of its obedience to tradition. However, when the patriarch of a family forgets that its members are flesh-and-blood humans, full of wild, unbridled dreams and dark passions, the two set off against themselves. Selton Mello plays André a son who tries to control his inner passions with his father's stagnant philosophy. Raul Cortez plays his father. Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman who tries to satisfy a thirst forbidden by family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the elder brother. The film offers a lot, but it requires an excessive amount of time to say it. ***
