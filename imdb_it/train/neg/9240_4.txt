The idea of ​​making a miniseries on the Berlin airlift seemed to me one of the most interesting German war films (post). It is a topic that has not yet been explored much. However, the creators of this series have filled it with clichés. It already starts with the cover of the DVD movie, which is a direct copy of the cover of 'Pearl Harbor'. <br /> <br /> Luise Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) learns that her husband, who is a doctor, (Ulrich Noethen) died in Russia and is struggling to survive after the war. He gets a job at the American base, he works for the coolest high-ranking officer (Heino Ferch) in the city, falls in love with me, gets pregnant and suddenly his husband returns. Come on!!! We saw it once too often. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen interpret their role quite well; But Bettina Zimmermann never seems to really convince. For some reason it always seems to be a little too late in giving the right emotional reaction to the scenes. It didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> Action scenes with planes and aerial lifting, sometimes we are exciting, often not. Bad things always seemed to happen to the same pilot. <br /> <br /> If you are not a big fan of WWII movies, I suggest you spend your money on something else: chocolate ice cream brings much more satisfaction! <br /> <br /> 4 out 10!
