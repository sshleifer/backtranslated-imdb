This is the only film I saw made by Uwe Boll, I knew that it is probably the worst director ever that always makes movies based on video games, also that "House of the Dead" is one of the IMDb in the lower 100. But I wanted still see it because I'm a big fan of the game and wanted to see what the movie did that makes it so bad. After seeing it I agree that it's crap, the film has no history. In the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains around (for a moment I was wondering if the zombies died in the brain or the girls are?) Then at night the zombies jumped out out of nowhere and started attacking people after a woman started shooting her. I mean it takes you to one place, the other every 5 minutes. Should it be a comedy? Or a horror? or both? Before I knew it, I fell asleep in the second half and woke up during the credits, so I couldn't see everything, which is a good thing! The film is a real insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll, please don't make any more movies. Thank you!
