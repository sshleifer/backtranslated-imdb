Every so often a film arrives that will be so terrible that I feel obliged to warn people. If I work all my days and I can save a single soul by watching this movie, how great my joy will be. <br /> <br /> Where to begin my discussion on pain. To begin with, there was a musical montage every five minutes. There was no character development. Each character was a stereotype. We swore a guy, a fat guy who eats donuts, an idiot foreign type, etc. The script seemed like it was written while the movie was being shot. The production value was so incredibly low that it seemed to me to be watching a junior video presentation. The directors, producers, etc. Have they ever seen a movie before? Halestorm is getting worse with every new item. The concept of this film seemed so funny. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of legitimate actors. But believe me when I say this, things went wrong, VERY WRONG.
