I don't know how to describe this film. It is certainly one of the strangest films I've seen in a long time. Sometimes it is very disturbing, but also boring in other places. The scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and can attract anyone with blood problems and splashes. I found myself gritting my teeth during some of the scenes mentioned above. The clever thing about the film is that it plays with our fears and The Dentist is therefore quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> The film's humor is somewhat hidden and may not be recognized by everyone. But if you are a fan of strange and strange amusements and powder-piercing teeth this is just the movie you were looking for. <br /> <br /> If you read the comment and feel attracted to this type of entertainment, try it! <br /> <br /> My vote: 4/10 (maybe a little too strange for my taste)
