Horrible ending - and I can't believe that Moore spent a year inventing it. It stinks of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs, whom Hubbard claimed to act in just three weeks. This was disappointing enough for me to throw my records from the first 3.5 years. Now, the first 1.5 hours were full of action, even if absurd in the premise, and then deteriorated into a slow, painful, sophisticated dissolution of the series. Unbelievable how slow he was and pulled out that last hour. Should we have thought more deeply? If I wanted a lesson in materialism, I would re-read Ishmael by Daniel Quinn. Absurd to think that 38K people would give up everything for a "new beginning". Absurd throwing a Kara in danger of extinction and a Baltar and Six about to reappear. Absurd to throw mitochondria into the night. Absurd.
