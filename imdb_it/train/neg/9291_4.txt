I can't believe that ANY of the official reviews for this film warns people that it contains two rather shocking scenes of sexual violence. It is as if our culture accepted this kind of behavior simply as sexual but not violent. My biggest problem with the film is that it does not seem to condemn these assaults - as in, the woman who is repeatedly assaulted and under pressure never holds the men responsible for their actions, or even someone else. A man is prevented from completing the assault when someone throws a dagger at him, but is only scolded with "you can't force a woman to love you" rather than "you should never force a woman sexually, you idiot" ... a woman's point of view, the film is a disappointment. It's a kind of "throwing a bone" at women in allowing them to be both skilled fighters and leaders, but the film is much more defined by romanticism - which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must lead to an imbalance of power, with men who dominate the woman they love This incredible martial arts fighter does not use any of his fighting skills to try to repel his attackers. He never excuses her, on the contrary, he seems to apologize. Overall, a depressing and shocking film, with good cinematography and some interesting fight scenes, but not as good as Hero by a long shot.
