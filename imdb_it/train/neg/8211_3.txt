I read Heinrich Harrer's book "7 Years in Tibet" and was fascinated by it. then I immediately grabbed the DVD and started watching the movie. I remember the first time I saw it in 98, I liked it. Well, now I've looked at it again with full knowledge of the book it is based on. and I soon realized how WRONG it was said: <br /> <br /> when they enter Lhasa people start to take their tongue out of their mouths and Thewlis and Pitt have the impression that it is the way to greet in Tibet, so they greet back ... in the book that Harrer explains, that attacking the language is a sign of absolute humility and loyalty in Tibet and can do so in front of the Dalai Lama but certainly not for these two Europeans! not only the mother but also the Dalai Lama himself wore glasses to the public. in the book Harrer mentions that no one in Tibet wore glasses until then (sorry if they forgot, but it is also explained in the book). The young Dalai Lama did, but only when he was alone and no one could see him! and what about Mao tse tung similar, which destroys the mandala in front of the young "living Buddha" ?? childish ... and the tailoring made of clothes in Tibetan by Harrer and Aufschnaiter is not a European designer dress! why are so many events really happened that have been eliminated from history, only to fill the time with a fake love interest (the female dressmaker ...) that is completely irrelevant? just like the whole story of son harrers, rolf. not even a word is mentioned about him or any member of the harrer's family in the book. but for me it was fine, because "7 years in Tibet" is not a book about the person of the harrers. it's about Tibet. I am very disappointed with this "adaptation" of the famous book. and I bet Heinrich Harrer was ... 3 stars, just for cinematography.
