I can't understand all the hype about this movie. OK, if you like cheap splatter, you'll love this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors, don't watch it. Personally I don't really like the actors in this film, they seem to be hired directly from the street. The Dialogues are completely flat and you always know what will happen next. The overall quality of this film lacks the very low hypothetical budget. When we saw this film (me and 3 other people) we all had in mind, that this film was made by some people who had to do it, just to get a diploma in a film school, with minimal effort. Another problem that really reduces the whole experience is the bad cam (very agitation) and the bad sound, the whole movie seems to be recorded with only one microphone.
