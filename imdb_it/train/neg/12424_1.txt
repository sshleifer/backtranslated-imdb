If you want to laugh like crazy, rent Cage. Cage talks about two war heroes, Billy and Scott, who are the best friends. When Billy is filmed in Vietnam, he can't take care of himself, so Scott takes him inside. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a movie with more gay references to the two main characters. Billy and Scott love to "fight" and Scott tells Billy that he is "still sore from last night", among other things. <br /> <br /> Wonderful catch phrases like "Shut the sh! T up" and "Ping Pang Pong, cut the t!" will make you laugh for hours. The Native Americans who should play the members of the Mexican gang are first rate. As they say, it is "time for celebration right now. Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba". I could go on forever, but watch this movie and laugh at your money. It was so funny that I went out and bought the DVD for $ 5.99
