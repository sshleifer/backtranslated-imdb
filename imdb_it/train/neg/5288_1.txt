My God, was this the adaptation of Persuasion "Run, Lola, Run"? It was horrible. Bad enough that the "writer" (and I use the term very freely) cuts and glues the dialogue from one character to another, often completely out of context and hastening the story: but Anne Elliott runs from one place to another Wentworth's pursuit towards the end of the piece was an abomination! Austen must turn to his grave. No respectable young woman would have acted so atrociously. And the actress who played Mary? Horrors. Needless to say, if the rest of Austen's remakes are so bad, they will turn off a new generation of observers. <br /> <br /> If you want to see an impeccable version of this wonderful (otherwise) novel, take the direction of Roger Michell from 1995 with Amanda Root (whose expressions speak for themselves) and Ciaran Hinds. It's superb
