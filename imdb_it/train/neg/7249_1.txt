This film rivals "Plan 9" as one of the most stupid films ever made. Always be concerned when the same person is: <br /> <br /> 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Writer 5. Stuntman and 6. Editor. Unfortunately, Justin Kreinbrink did all 6 jobs! IMDb shows that he and his father were Western "stuntmen". So maybe that was the problem. <br /> <br /> Here is just one example of the film: in the film the sheriff has to take a baton in another city to protect himself. Of course, the bad guys find out and are waiting for them. What's happening? Good guys are riding and a shot rings out and hits a tree next to them. When the camera shows us the bad guys, they are all sitting on a log, chatting. What's wrong with this picture? <br /> <br /> I could go on Perhaps this film was intended as a comedy. If so, it didn't go so well.
