Having seen this film on the SciFi channel, I can only conclude that this film was made by a group of amateurs who have never seen a film in their lives. The film is an endless sequence of bizarre events, or "delights" as the friend who is reading me on his shoulders tells me. The plot does not really deserve to be commented upon, but basically a plane carrying football players crashes into the Yeti territory. Before the film ends, we are offered to chase away the hearts, but he moves in search of a race before jumping 50 meters, yet they tear his legs and beat him with them, a woman who kills a rabbit at 30 meters with a javelin, a yeti survived several bullets and set on fire without apparent damage, a yeti dangling from a cliff holding onto a man's shoe, but then jumping off, and a whole collection of further, bizarre events. Basically, if you don't stop on Saturday for the stated purpose of watching the worst of the original SciFi channel movies, avoid this movie like the plague. Or how my friend who reads me on his shoulder says, "It's the best movie I've ever seen." To which the friend on my right says: "Fighting only techno music could have made it better".
