STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Only the Mark is missing *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br /> <br /> In this debut for the beloved man of Nick Park and the dog, are forced to fly to the moon when good old Wallace ends up with cheese. <br /> <br /> In addition to being the shortest feature in just 22 minutes, this W / G adventure is also the first and shows a little. The plasticine animation is a little creaky and fun here, a sort of reminiscence of Mork's animation on the little man in the box. <br /> <br /> Admirable even though the art behind it is, I've never really been involved Wallace & Gromit (maybe a little too clean and traditional for someone of my generation). The only one that I really liked is The Wrong Trousers (and this was more since I was younger and less aware, say, of the more serious pleasures of life). I was driven to actively seek this first effort because of the resurgence of popularity as a result of the recent highly successful film adaptation. <br /> <br /> Technically impressive as the first two (all things considered!) this lacks the emotional angle that the successors had to possess. That being said, it's pretty funny first thing and definitely sets the standard for bigger things to come. Two stars, but good two stars. **
