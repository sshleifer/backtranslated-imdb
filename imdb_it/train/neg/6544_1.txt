I paid a dollar for this DVD and at the beginning I felt screwed, but then I started thinking about it and I should be grateful. I found a Holy Grail, a real touchstone for bad cinema. If you think the first dramatic shots of an empty stadium are successful with the awkward monologue of Evel's camera address, then wait for the credits to roll onto the driver's bottom. The script seems to be glued together by press clippings and ESL textbooks. But ... I can't believe how bad George Hamilton is. It seems that he has absolutely no connection with what he says, the only internal monologue I can detect is "damn, I bet they think I'm cute, really cute!" This is an illumination! Now I know how bad it can be.
