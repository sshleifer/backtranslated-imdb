I really hate this show! I had seen an episode and knew that this show is really terrible. The jokes are written and performed badly and the jokes are really bad ... I mean, it's just a rip-off of Dexter's Laboratory and Johnny Quest, "a hateful boy with flamed blond hair and his twin sister and talking dog, a daddy homemaker and a clever, super-busy mom ... like oh-my-flippin'-God! Their daddy is a crazy crazy-fake homemade, he's not so gay! If my dad is a home producer, I'd die personally! Shame it is ... I would really do it. <br /> <br /> I have nothing else on this ... this parody but only 3 words; count 3 words to describe it: <br /> <br /> · Lame, · Stupid, and above all ... · F ** K UP! That's all I could say, folks, it's definitely my list of the worst EV-ER animation series! If I had one that's it.
