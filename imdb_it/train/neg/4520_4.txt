Irwin Allen was great. All his TV shows have had a great pilot, or first episode. the rest was basically a rip-off of his other shows. Some episodes of Swiss Family Robinson have been overwhelmed by his old television programs. An episode of Swiss Family is identical to an episode of Land Of The Giants when a member of the group needs an appendix operation. The show was high-budget and too expensive to continue. Irwin lost contact with TV programs after the 1960s. The acting is strong with Martin Milner. The children's stars started with this show as Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. a bright spot is when Irwin Allen incorporates his disastrous scenes as a typhoon and a volcanic eruption that nicknamed him the "Master of Disaster"
