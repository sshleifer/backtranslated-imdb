Leslie Sands' drama "Deadlock" becomes a vehicle of poor choice for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, immediately after their joint success in "All About Eve". After killing his wife, an intriguing woman is visited by her husband's best friend, who pretends to be her husband when the others start to stop near the house. Irving Rapper, one of Bette's best directors since his peak years, is unfortunately not able to elevate this ridiculous material, in which Davis is strangely detached and held up to the outrageous ending (where luckily she pulls out all the stops). Production and support cast strictly second choice; only for Bette Davis completists. * 1/2 from ****
