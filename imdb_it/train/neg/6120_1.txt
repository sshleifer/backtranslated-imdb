There are three types of negative films: cheap, boring and tasteless. the only really bad movies are boring and insipid. <br /> <br /> boring movies are simply, well, boring - if you don't quit fast enough, you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> insignificant films actually have their defenders; but the fact remains that they are masturbatory aids for very sick people. <br /> <br /> only bad economic films are really fun, because the filmmakers wanted to make their films so desperately, exceeded available skills and resources. <br /> <br /> Bo Derek is simply dull and bland; fortunately, destiny and the lack of funds and abilities redeem it making it seem cheap. this movie is hilarious and could be the last really funny and bad movie ever made. <br /> <br /> I saw him for the first time in a theater, may God forgive me; I was laughing so hard that I was rolling down my seat, and so was most of the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Derek and her husband-promoter, have conceived this film as, in part, a satire; unfortunately, the Dereks clearly lacked the resources needed to get him out; consequently, the "satirical" element comes out as the impression of a young girl of the humor of a young homosexual impression of frank gorshin on the eniguer in batman trying to pretend to be a thief - he does not fly over our heads he has no idea where any human head could be. <br /> <br /> on the other hand, there are some apparently serious moments in this film - it is supposed to be an action movie, remember - that they are so incredibly mischievous, one wonders if anyone squirted the spoiled milk under the eyes. <br /> <br /> like Derek's infamous tendency to reveal his breast - I can't imagine a less erotic photographic display of nudity, she's so strange that she looks with those broad shoulders, I can Imagine what no one has never seen in her. <br /> <br /> as for the plot - as it is - well, it isn't; Derek chases Africa and God knows why. then his father - Harris - pretends to act in a manic puppet show, and then, of course, there is the guy who seems to have questioned himself from advertising without knowing that the subject has changed - probably because he didn't see a script - apparently no one has. <br /> <br /> negligible photographic work, poor editing - if it weren't for the 3-way chimpanzee, the film would be unbearable - <br /> <br /> as it is, it's a real hoot.
