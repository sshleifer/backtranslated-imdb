Based on the novel by Michael Chabon, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is about the young son of a notorious gangster who spends his last summer as a teenager walking around with two friends. The year is 1983, and the young Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) is at a crossroads. Completely contrary to his father's lifestyle, Art intends to become a stockbroker. Visually built with painful attempts to create beautiful hip-indie cinematography, the entire film feels like the director - whose previous Dodgeball effort was fun if he was an advertiser - desperately seeks indie credibility by putting together aspects of other indie films but spraying him with stars like Mena Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like so many of the star-filled previews at Sundance this year, it seemed that this was a studio-sponsored vanity project to help the director gain indie credibility points - he failed that way and as a stand-alone movie.
