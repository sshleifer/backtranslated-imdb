... through the similar antics of Eric Stanze. A not particularly talented director directed a not particularly beautiful film, yet I found myself still sitting at the end credits, if only to see what will happen next. <br /> <br /> A rapist escapes from prison and calls his old flame. After capturing her (even though she came willingly) and threatening to have sex (another event she was also willing to do), she reveals that she has kidnapped three types of people who have offended her in the past. So he decides to kill her (eh?) But he is foiled and dies instead. Take the girl's mind (or something) and bring out her anger on the unfortunate chap in the cellar. <br /> <br /> Ok, the script sucks: it's long, full of ten-cent words, and that's WAY too much. <br /> <br /> Acting sucks: what a minute, what acting? <br /> <br /> Filming sucks: home videos are bad enough, but 20 minutes of cemetery videos are just a damn insult. <br /> <br /> And the budget is a joke: take it ... 'budget', this was the final joke. <br /> <br /> Yet there was a fascination with it. In the 70s this type of film was released in theaters with current budgets and talent, not on this day though. If you want to see this kind of violent and sexually exploitable garbage (don't lie, some of us do), that's all you would get nowadays. <br /> <br /> Some short hardcore shots in a sex scene, fecal material torture, ax fun, anal rape with broom and a long shot of the crazy chick masturbating with the same broomstick are some of the best items on the menu. <br /> <br /> Not good and will not be remembered, but not since the golden days of Joe D'amato, people have made films like this. <br /> <br /> 4/10
