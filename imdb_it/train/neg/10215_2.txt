A film horribly useless and, worse, boring. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything, no character beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes, and relies on a clumsy central concept that is neither particularly original nor addressed in a vaguely innovative way. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell is completely wasted on what he purportedly hopes to be his response to Jim Carey's Truman Show, and replaces his usual routine at the top of his lungs (certainly a lot of fun if you discount on Talledega Nights) for , well, practically nothing. <br /> <br /> Emma Thompson is not that slightly irritating (that some reviews I've read here are talking about her for an Oscar nomination is ridiculous) while Maggie Gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing in addition to establishing her character as a former law student who left Harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy. Please. That she ended up falling in love with Ferrell's "character" is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Marc Forster's attempts to revive the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired material he must work with. > <br /> I had the chance to see The Prestige for the third time or see it. I wish I had opted for The Prestige.
