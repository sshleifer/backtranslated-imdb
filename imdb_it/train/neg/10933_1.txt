Track every stereotype and false statement you've heard about the Mormon semi-devotees, and you'll see that everyone has played this ridiculous excuse for a movie. Finally the fortunes of Kurt Hale have changed (thank goodness) and we hope that it will take a long time to see one of his films in theaters. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was amateur (I think they used a video camera for basketball scenes). The plot was lackluster and very little fun. You didn't really understand why someone did something. It was as if I had sand in my eyes, and a 300-pound lady was sitting on my face, it was so painful. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't give this film a negative score was because the scale won't let me.
