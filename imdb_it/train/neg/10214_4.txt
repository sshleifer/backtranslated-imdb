Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so good together in THE MUMMY'S HAND, return for this much less universal offer of Horror. But this time, instead of having Wallace Ford as a comic assistant "Babe", we get Fuzzy Knight replacing him as a silly friend called "Stuff". But the results are not even remotely enchanting, and the level of fear is practically nil. <br /> <br /> Dick is a businessman who has the idea of ​​conducting a treasure hunt on a remote island in an old spooky castle. Peggy is one of the gangs who arrives for the trip. But there is a tall and thin look of John Carradine in a black cloak and a big hat known as "The Phantom" that crashes into the party in search of the same buried fortune. <br /> <br /> This "ghost" is not very mysterious, and no effort is made to try to keep his rather mediocre face in the shadows to create tension or fear. It's always nice to see Moran lively, but otherwise you can create it as one of the instantly forgettable Universal misfires.
