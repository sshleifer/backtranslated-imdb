If you are under 6 or 7, then you will really like this movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when she looks at it. As an adult, I can't stand it !! I'm ready for the sequels ... when they have a decent storyline. But this is not close to the standard at all. Please forgive me for making a list of what a kid's movie is after all, but when you have to sit almost every day when your kids love it so much, you'll see why. My daughter would watch this movie over and over again the same day if we had granted it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 4 out of 10 just because it keeps my little ones entertained.
