I took this video after reading the text on the box, the story sounded good and had Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of observation, I noticed how awful his acting was, walking and talking so stupid all the time, it's fake and unconvincing. It does not end here, almost ALL the characters act so badly that it is ridiculous, the only acceptable acting was by Alan Boyce (David), but the boy commits suicide soon and you don't see him anymore, you don't even know why he has it done! Everything about this movie screams low quality, I can't believe that such a thing is released! I have been tempted many times to stop watching, in fact I did it, halfway I decided to stop watching and I turned it off, I arrived at the IMDB to check what other thought I thought, I found zero comments (not surprised ), so I decided to try hard to manage the pain and go back to finish, so come here to comment. The only positive thing (for me) was the theme of the high school Rock band, the occasional parts of guitar and singing, but it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Bad acting and directing ... Terrible film.
