Before starting to watch the show, I felt that it was fantastic and aesthetically very interesting. How deceitful, the scripts are so stupid that I'm pretty sure the authors are children and grandchildren of Scoobidoo writers. And as for SFX and colors, they are so extreme that it is painful to watch, the colors are not saturated are saturated, as the scripts are overwritten and the show is overrated. This show is like a bad cake in which a child would put only sugar and butter, thinking that since these ingredients are the best, they are enough. Unfortunately for this show, the only two ingredients of this show are finally emptiness and a total lack of credibility.
