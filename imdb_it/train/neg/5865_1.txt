I can't say enough bad things about this train disaster. It's one of the few films I've ever tried to get out of. It was a bad premise to begin with, the first pregnant female, but then they tried to make it a parody. What were all those real pregnant males spoofing ??? This was the worst movie I've ever seen. If he had enough votes, he would be on the IMDB 100 fund. If it were possible to give him a zero I would do it, and I will still feel I gave him too much credit.
