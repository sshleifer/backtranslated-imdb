This is a very unpleasant film, if maliciously done. I tried it because it plays as Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors, and because the plot - a mafia boss is about to be released from a mental institution - looked promising. The film is advertised as a comedy, kind. What we have is an endless series of shots - you should forgive the pun - of people in poorly lit and elegant environments, even if a bit surreal, shooting each other - in the head, in the stomach, in the kneecap, in the foot , in the heart (no part of the anatomy is avoided, it seems) while pronouncing a vague and cryptic dialogue, some of which are evidently considered humorous in a sort of postmodern. Goldblum's entire film dialogue could fit into a 3x5 card, and wear only one facial expression - a sardonic grin - all the time. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines do the best they can. Burt Reynolds makes a cameo. The end titles Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but somehow I lost them (good move on their part). The whole is cold, sterile, mechanical and unpleasant; a suspect heir to the style of "Pulp Fiction", "Fargo" and "Natural Born Killers". If you liked them, you will probably like them.
