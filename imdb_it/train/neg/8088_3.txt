To make a good movie you need excellent actors or an excellent director. You need at least one of the two. We have none in this Eye of the Needle. <br /> <br /> I don't even remember the director's name. He must not have done much in his career. I really like Donald Sutherland but he can't possibly be the main actor in a film. It is not up to it. Sutherland is excellent in a movie when it appears for no more than 15 minutes. I would say for example that Sutherland was excellent in Oliver Stone's JFK when he talked to Kevin Costner on a park bench for 10 minutes without interruption without even taking a breath. Wonderful. But Sutherland is the main actor in a film is not good. <br /> <br /> Kate Nelligan? Probably good for TV series. The DVD is terrible. Terrible colors Terrible light. I could not even appreciate the scenery of Storm Island as bad as photography was. <br /> <br /> This story by Ken Follett was good but it's a shame that they turned it into an uninteresting film.
