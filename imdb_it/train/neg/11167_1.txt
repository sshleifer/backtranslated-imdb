Jack Black usually manages to make me giggle just by breathing, but in this film ... <br /> <br /> Beyond directing, writing, lack of plot, constant aggression (helped and favored by continuous direct shooting) and an average of .050 lines was still a complete waste of time. The idea seems promising, but what potential has been wasted with an absolute lack of comedy and some of the worst directions in which I saw this side of you-tube. <br /> <br /> I kept hearing that this film was played very negatively. While this is undoubtedly true, I really don't think this movie is meant to be racist. I think it's more a result of a "creative" team that desperately tries to find something fun in this mess. You can almost hear them shouting from behind the camera: "Hey look, he's an ugly Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, for the love of all tenacious things, LAUGH!" <br /> <br /> But put racism charges aside. When you get down, it's someone who has thrown down money and time to watch this pile of advanced refried beans that should be offended, IMO.
