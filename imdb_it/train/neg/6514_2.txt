The film attempts to be a mockumentary, shot in documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts, but fails to provide the public with any character to create the illusion of the mockumentary. Furthermore, the film aims to find true love in Los Angeles, but it is nothing more than an uninteresting look at an amateur director who tries to make his first "great film".
