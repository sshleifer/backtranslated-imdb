This 30-minute documentary made by Bu単uel in the early 1930s about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. Firstly, let's say that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring its own problems, such as excessive individualism and consumerism, although wealth is a matter of course far better conditions than the extreme poverty portrayed here). And if poverty diminished in Spain, it was not exactly the kind of socialism favored by Bu単uel, but Western-style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the film is this: in one scene, the narrator reproaches that at school children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching math to the poor, horror! The short-sightedness of Bu単uel is most striking here, not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technologies that will help the poor overcome their situation. What is he proposing? Are children taught exactly what at school? Doesn't Bu単uel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that made them poorer than other people?
