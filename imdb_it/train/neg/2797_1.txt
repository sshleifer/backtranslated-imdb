I'm a big fan of the horror genre! I love horror / slasher / gore movies of all kinds. Some of my favorites are the really "good" horror movies. But this movie has NOTHING to guarantee that it is watching !! I'm not going to spend much time talking about everything that's wrong. <br /> <br /> The script is horrible. The acting is horrible. FX is not even worth discussing. The "set" is a real joke !! The sad thing is that I think there could be real potential in a couple of actors, but this vehicle left them NOTHING to work with !!! <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that I saw it for "free" and I feel I was robbed !! The time when you watched WASTE would be better to spend your cat with dental floss.
