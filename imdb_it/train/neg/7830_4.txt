So far Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been irregular and disappointing. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, may have offered little in terms of revolutionary storytelling or real fear, but at least it was well directed, suspenseful and visually interesting, with a solid acting of William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini series. <br /> <br /> However, the second story of the series was simply terrible, and not in the best way. The script is very bad, and requires superficial and unlikely characters to behave in an illogical way to move the plot and have characters that wander to infinity for an unpleasant and useless exposure. The acting is exaggerated and unconvincing, and I felt much more empathy for a cold-blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second. The director used a million tricks to try to make the narrative spooky, but with acting and amateur writing, the end result looks like a freshman year school project, with the camera shooting for themselves and a little of plot or tension. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the series continues like this, I will be sadly disappointed. I look forward to the episode of William H. Macy, and I hope he will become a decent director and screenwriter for his segment. So far the quality is too inconsistent to predict in both ways.
