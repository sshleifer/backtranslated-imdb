Set in the 1970s, "Seed" focuses on the serial killer Max Seed (Will Sanderson), which killed 666 people in 6 years. He is sentenced to death, but does not die in the electric chair, even after being shocked three times. <br /> <br /> Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Par√©) and other officers cover this secret by burying Seed alive. The seed explodes and chases the people who put it in its living coffin. <br /> <br /> Filmed by the worst director in the world (Uwe Boll), "Seed" is nothing more than a film about trying to extend the envelope of the decent company and fails to provide in any aspect of a plot. And he said that this is based on true events because if a person survives the electric chair after being shocked three times, he will be released. This is an urban legend and it would never happen. Just like the other Boll abominations ("Alone in the Dark" for one), "Seed" is simply horrendous.
