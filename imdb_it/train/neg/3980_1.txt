No, I'm not kidding. If they propose a cinematic idea, they should be driven out of the studio. I'm serious. Their films are exactly the same in all, and consist only of traveling to foreign places, with a problem that they easily solve, hoping to be popular and to have new boyfriends. Think about it. If you've ever seen a movie that saw them with a different storyline, contact me and tell me your name. These "films" are excuses for being on TV and going to other countries. There's a reason why movies never go to theaters. I'm sure when they were really young and they did a little bit of O.K. movies, some studio bosses have bought all their rights for 15 years, or something like that, so now that they are, what, 17, they can make movies in other countries whenever they want to use the studio money. Let me advise you, STAY AWAY FROM MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY! IT'S FOR YOUR GOOD WELL!
