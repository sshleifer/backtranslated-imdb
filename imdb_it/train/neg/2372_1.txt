Unimaginably stupid, redundant and humiliating closure to the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series! Part 6 is so incompetent that it seems that director Rachel Talalay intentionally wanted to turn Wes Craven's initial premise into a big, tasteless bad joke. This is not only the worst entry in the "Elm Street" saga; it's also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and definitely offends fans of the genre! The story is stupid, the characters' drawings are ridiculous, the structure is completely murky and ?? mostly ?? special and visual effects are reminiscent of a Tom & Jerry comic. The sequences in which Freddy Krueger kills his victims are endless and very uninteresting. Should we have been petrified when a freak Freddy turned Breckin Meyer into a video game character and the pogo stuck to the walls of a house? The story takes us back to Springwood and it seems that Freddy suddenly has a middle-aged daughter. Would you think that you mention it on one of his previous adventures, but no? There is only one teenager who survived Springwood and Krueger uses it to get in touch with his long-lost daughter. Another reason why this final installment is so terrible is the completely illogical structure. The John Doe-boy is presented as a protagonist but then suddenly dies and the plot continues to rotate on two adults! How about this: Freddy Krueger, who spent five whole films killing nothing but teenagers, is finally beaten by two adults with 3D glasses! A bit like ruining the whole essence, isn't it? As far as I'm concerned, "Nightmare on Elm Street" has always been a terribly overrated series but, until now, even the weakest voices had at least some positive elements. "Freddy's Dead", however, is simply unbearable and no one should waste their precious time looking at it.
