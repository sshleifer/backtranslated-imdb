I saw his film at the Annbor Film Festival. I'm a film student at the University of Michigan, so I know a few things about cinema. And Crispin Glover's film is outrageous. Practically exploits the mentally challenged people. Shirly Temple is not only the anti-Christ (which I admit is a bit strange) that tells the mentally challenged to kill each other, but there is an obsession to kill snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of ​​being in love with one of his actors which is how they are all, mentally challenged. PETA and human rights should be everywhere on this thing. It is not "counter-culture" as Crispin stated at the Annbor Film Festival, it is exploitation.
