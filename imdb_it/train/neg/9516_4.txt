Frank Sinatra plays a former no-goodnik soldier and a frustrated, hard and drinking writer, who returns to his hometown of the Midwest and reunites with his alien brother (Arthur Kennedy), who is now the city with a disinterested wife and daughter stubborn. Frank gets involved with gambler Dean Martin, the uneducated ludicrous Shirley MacLaine, and has some clash with the law, but what he really wants is to write and settle down with a good woman. A very simple drama that borders on the soap opera, with a role for MacLaine that is excessively "colorful" and embarrassingly sentimental (his drunken song on "After You Have Gone" is still the highlight of the film, and is wisely managed). The director Vincente Minnelli supervises him directly, but he is surprisingly angry and most of the big scenes are flat or dense. The image looks incredibly beautiful in widescreen, with a keen eye for detail and composition, but the story and these characters are stuck in the dregs. ** from ****
