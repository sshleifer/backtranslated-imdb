I will never forget the night I saw this movie. We were on a submarine patrolling the North Atlantic and this was the movie of the evening. WE HAVE ALL renounced after the second reel. They didn't even try to show it at midnight showing. Opting for a replica instead ...... This is all I have to say, but they have this stupid rule that my comment must contain ten lines. I should not buffer the comment with random words, so I will continue to digress until I have my ten lines of BS. I couldn't find George Goble listed in the credits, but I remember him in the movie. The sining was terrible and the songs even worse.
