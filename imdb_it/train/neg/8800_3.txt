A collection of deleted scenes and alternate outlets, modified together and with added vocal comments to make it appear after the events of the first. A nice idea, but the deleted scenes are left on the floor of the editing room for a reason and this is further proof. Since it's not as funny as "Anchorman", and let's face it, this movie wasn't exactly comedy gold, so you get a "movie" worse than one that was moderately fun. In my eyes, STILL places one or two notches above "Kicking and Screaming", or "Bewitched". Chross fingers that "The Wedding Crashers" is a return to the old school (no pun intended) <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
