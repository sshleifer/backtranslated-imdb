Terry West had a good idea with this film. He didn't just incarnate it. There are endless shots of eerie-looking school exteriors that go on forever and probably to fill the movie's running time. There are only 2 students in this school. Misty Mundae is good as usual but this film will always belong to Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to watch the film in the beginning). If the script was centered on his interesting character we would have a movie to watch. She is so WONDERFUL !! Good news for DVD buyers, Terry West's previous (and best) film "Blood For The Muse" is a special feature. One thing I would like to say is that this movie feels like someone who is not good at providing the punch line at the end of a long line for the ending feels the same way. Then again, look at this for Ruby LaRocca.
