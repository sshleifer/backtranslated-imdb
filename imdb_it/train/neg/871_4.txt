Nicholas Walker is Paul, the local Reverand citizen who is married to Martha (Ally Sheedy), but is also a regular womanizer and decides to fake his own death to escape with his current relationship, Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). However, in doing so, he gets an attack of amnesia (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also available as a crazy old coot pissing for the good reverend in a "Misery" shade. It's sad to see a pretty good cast wasted this way. No less important is John Savage in a terribly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator. In a film advertised as a "black comedy", it is necessary to insert BOTH elements in the said film. While this brings the first to spades, unfortunately it does not contain any of the latter. Furthermore you cannot emphasize any of the characters and therefore have absolutely no interest in them. Technically it's not a bad movie all in one but an extremely forgettable one. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dara Tomanovich becomes topless; Sally Kirkland also shows some leather <br /> <br /> My Grade: C- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Showcase
