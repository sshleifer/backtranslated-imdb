While making a strange joke, humor is generally rather dry with panel members who often pull faces or use vulgar language and wait on the crowd to applaud enough jokes. <br /> <br /> Unlike another comment says that I don't think this is the best RTE I've ever done, it's really dry and sarcastic. Sarcasm is the lowest form of intelligence, there are few really funny smart gags that will make you laugh really hard. People seem to be convinced by the famous names of comedians rather than judging the quality of the gags that are not so good. Overall it's mediocre with some good laughs to have but can often be quite mediocre. It's not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens stuff. I find Benny Hill more fun.
