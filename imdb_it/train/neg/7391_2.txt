Okay, like most Steven Seagal fans, I know I don't expect a masterpiece every time I make a film, but I expect the film to have at least a budget for sorters. The main problem with the copy I saw was the terrible dubbing, I know that in some movies this must be done and I accept it, but when I overdub with a totally different voice and continue to do it through the film, it takes magic to overdub . Even the sets seem to be built without any worries, as in a scene the sliding glass in a secret laboratory has a huge crack. I was really disappointed with this film and I only hope that Stevens' next project will be more refined before sending the film for purchase / rent. The story of this film made me think if I was watching a science fiction movie or not some parts seemed alien but they never completely explained what was happening I found very confusing.
