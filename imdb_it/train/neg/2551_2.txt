Fooled by the terrible lie on the cover, "funny as American Pie", my girlfriend and I sat in front of the TV waiting for a play ... and this is definitely not one. You probably won't laugh once if you're not one of those minds like girls like Jackass. It is not even an erotic film, which would have been at least something, given that it is sex ... <br /> <br /> So what is this? The erratic plot concerns a boy who wants to lose his virginity (zero in originality, I remember "Losing" for one) and his band of friends. The rest of the characters (ie the girls) come and go without credible reason. Come on, there are also the Dwarves (so simple: "the dwarves are fun ho ho" ...) The acting is very similar to TV (as is the video in the whole film) and decidedly amateur in the case of most of the girls ... <br /> <br /> Terrible movie. Amateur, bad product and above all NOT FUN. Children and teenagers will love watching it with friends because of sex jokes and the oath. On top of that, don't even think about renting this movie.
