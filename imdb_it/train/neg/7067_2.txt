Five passengers in a bus depot tell each other their dreadful dreams as they wait to be picked up. But is there more to these nightmares than it seems? <br /> <br /> Lucky me, five bad movies for the price of one! Each segment presents the worst in acting, special effects, makeup and music. And these had to be scary? Hmm .. I think I was more crazy during an episode of Teletubbies. I swear, you'd sit there like I was, bored with tears waiting in vain for something interesting to happen. Don't worry. It never does. In fact, I even stopped sending advertisements quickly because they were a lot more fun than the main feature. And the ending is the last outlet. Yes, none of this has ever happened. If only the same could be said for the day I set up my video recorder to record this cobbler .. 2/10
