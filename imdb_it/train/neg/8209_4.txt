The acting, despite the other reviews, was extraordinarily well done. Brad Pitt handles the role of an annoying and hateful Austrian climber quite well. The other acting is fine. The story could have been compelling, but somehow, it is missing - you never understand or care about the characters shown, and therefore the story, which could have been rather dramatic, fails to draw in this audience. <br /> <br /> Beautiful landscapes and cinematography, a truly dramatic story, important events that shaped the world we live in - but I couldn't, as much as I could, involve myself in this story. As a huge Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the 5 best actors of his generation), I expected to * love * this movie - yet, it left me cold. <br /> <br /> It could be a failure within me, but I tend to aim towards the creative end of this film - direction, script, production, editing - somehow, they lost me. It's a shame, because it could have been wonderful. <br /> <br /> Good acting, dramatic story, great shot - should have been magnificent. It wasn't. Probably worth looking at, just to think about it, but don't expect too much, and maybe you won't be disappointed as I was. Mostly, it bored me.
