If only to avoid making this kind of film in the future. This film is interesting as an experiment but does not tell a convincing story. <br /> <br /> One might feel virtuous for having sat through it because it touches so many IMPORTANT problems but does so with no discernible reason. The viewer comes out without new perspectives (unless one comes out while the mind wanders, as it will invariably do during this useless film). <br /> <br /> You could spend your time looking out of a window at a growing tree. <br /> <br />
