There is nothing new here. All the standard scenes of the romantic comedy, even up to the taxi that ran to the airport to stop the woman who flew away. The only thing that saves him is the acting of Alison Eastwood and some of the minor characters (blink and you'll miss Gabrielle Anwar), who obviously had a little fun. <br /> <br /> Turn it off when the two are in bliss, and you won't have to go through the inevitable pain of the plot.
