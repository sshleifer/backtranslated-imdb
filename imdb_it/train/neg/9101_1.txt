This film was like "Disney Channel After Dark". Eliminate the language and the "we're not boring" themes and you'll find yourself with dialogues and plot devices that insult the intelligence of anyone who doesn't describe "Saved by the Bell" as a quality television. The dialogues were so banal and wisely dirty, one might think that the script was the product of the block of Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas in a room with the order to produce an amalgamation of every evil script that each had ever had in creation. If this was Roger Kumble's intention, the mission was accomplished.
