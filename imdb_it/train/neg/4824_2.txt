I wanted this film, but many elements ruined it for me. Using a fisheye lens everywhere and uneven mounting didn't give me the feeling of being in the world of metric head, but it made me think I was watching MTV for a few brief moments. The film never seemed to go anywhere and acting was really an excellent example of acting. I love movies that give us an idea of ​​the damned underworld, but this movie couldn't decide if it was a bad horror movie or a comment even worse than the horrors of addiction.
