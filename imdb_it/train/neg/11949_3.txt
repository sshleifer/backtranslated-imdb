This stupid play really does a good job of wasting comedic talents. In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are mistreated here badly. I might have giggled once or twice during this movie, but in general, it's a boring movie, with a bit of stupidity thrown to good measure. The premise, although routine, was still not bad, but once the plot was set, the film didn't go anywhere. Don't waste your time with this failed ignition.
