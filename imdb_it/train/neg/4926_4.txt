I saw this film for 2 reasons: I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men were forced to wear a rather stupid film. I liked the idea that Dracula is actually a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot, because he explains his contempt for all things Christian, but there was so much field that this idea was not realized as it could have been. I see this film more as a way for the talented Gerard Butler to pay his dues before he is truly recognized and a way for the legendary Christopher Plummer to remind the public (me and the other 5 people who saw this film) that it still exists . Actually I appreciated the special features of the DVD more than the movie itself.
