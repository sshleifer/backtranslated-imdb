The icon of Spanish horror Paul Naschy is the protagonist of this film, one of his weakest werewolf movies ... but endured for a moment. Most people will know it with its most common TV title, THE FURY OF THE WOLF MAN, and there have been many versions of home videos over the years. If you want to be serious in giving it the right shot, the most viable edition I've seen is called THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS, and it's a new and complete European version that restores a couple of disturbing scenes and contains the original nude shots that are missing from the press of FURY. It is also in letterbox format. <br /> <br /> Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky, returning home from a trip to Tibet only to find out that he contracted a werewolf curse and that his wife had an affair. He takes care of her and her lover while in animal form, but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy doctor and her female assistant. Apparently, the doc tries to "tame" the werewolf, and there is a strange sado-masochistic love scene between her and the fanged, fanged Daninsky that is under her trance, at least in the original version. Eventually we get two werewolves for the price of one while Daninsky fights a wolf! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the film is that the director (according to Naschy) was often drunk, and the results are actually rather inconsistent. When you look at THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS copying, it is not so difficult to understand what is happening, even if the editing remains atrocious in some places. The worst thing is that occasionally the non-corresponding movie of the ravenous werewolf of Naschy passed directly from another previous film (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, aka "FRANKENSTEIN BLOODY TERROR") and mixed into this without any reasonable reason! The wolf's clothes change from black to white and vice versa, as well as his demeanor; one moment the wolf is hibernating in a FURY hypnotic trance, then he is growling and running wildly from BLOODY TERROR. Really bizarre
