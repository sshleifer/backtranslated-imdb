Well, what can I say about this movie. I'm speechless. I could go on talking about how stupid this movie is forever, even if the only thing that really struck me was the music. And to complete it, someone commented on how much he liked. For them all I have to say is that he was robbed of one of the best martial arts movies of all time Fistsof Fury played by Bruce Lee. If he were still alive and came across this film, he would be horrified. the rest of the film is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of tape. I say tape because a film like that could not have been shot on film. Now I feel dumber to waste 30 minutes of my life watching it. The only reason I saw it was because my roommate dumped it out of morbid curiosity. What the world is coming to.
