OK, this is 2 being one of the worst excuses of a movie I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Like all of Olsen's other twin films with the possible exception of New York minute, this film had no story, gaping plot holes, disgustingly putrid acting and bad shots too !!!!!!!!! in case you haven't guessed I HATE MARY KATE AND ASHLEY !!!!!! The only reason I saw it was because I was really bored and there was nothing else. I wonder if the twins will never stop making the same stereotyped films in which they have an incredible stupid adventure in an exotic location and save the day, meanwhile getting the help of two cute guys who drool over them immediately. The least they could be about having a 4 1 boy out of them or making them both fall off the same guy. The plot of this story was so stupid and simply stupid. even a child could see the flaws in it. Maybe they should split up and start making movies individually or maybe movies with a different kind of story. Anyone who has enjoyed this movie was not offensive, or really stupid, really artificial or didn't see any really good films. or maybe they are really smart and have only bad film choices. Either way, I would not recommend this movie to my worst nemesis for a good cinematic experience .. the only thing that is good 4 is some laughter breaking the ribs to pathetic attempts to be cool. if you watch the laughter it's fun. basically i give him 0 or less.
