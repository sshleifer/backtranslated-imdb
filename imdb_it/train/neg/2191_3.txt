A doctor who is trying to complete the transplant doctor's dream is secretly experimenting on the hospital corpses with varying success. His last best chance comes when he lovingly wraps his girlfriend's head in his jacket as he saves her from a burning vehicle. <br /> <br /> I was looking for cheese and with this premise I thought I had found it. It has everything the bad film hunters are looking for - chest and brain surgery with surgeons coming out with pristine white scrubs, unique camera angles (I always like to look at the wheels of rear passenger cars), stripper music with clarinet and one of the longest scenes of death in the history of cinema. But unfortunately these bad moments are able to overcome the bad that stinks. <br /> <br /> Jan in the Pan bothered me, with his monologues buzzing in a hoarse whisper, his laughter a little less than evil, and the fact that he was kept alive with a homemade Colombian coffee and 2 DD batteries. <br /> <br /> I could not even enjoy the horrible hypocrisy and moral honesty of Dr. Bill. Usually such a ham makes these films a must see in my opinion, in this case I was bored. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film in my opinion was the 60s version of the "body shopping" and I though I found myself nodding during this. <br /> <br /> Don't spend money on this - there are better bad movies out there to entertain your sick sense of humor.
