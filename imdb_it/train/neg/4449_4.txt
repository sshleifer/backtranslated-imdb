"Sleeping With the Enemy" is a predictable thriller, 'there there before before' that never seems to find inspiration, no matter how desperately the cast and crew try it. I can't believe that a group of my friends convinced me to see it at the cinema about sixteen years ago. <br /> <br /> The complete lack of originality from the screenplay by Ronald Bass (based on the Nancy Price novel) does not help, neither the bad direction of Joseph Ruben or the very average performance of Julia Roberts. The supporting cast, including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson, does not help much. <br /> <br /> Not much to say. Give it a shot. <br /> <br /> Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Center Melbourne
