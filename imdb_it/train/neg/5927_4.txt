I am a very politically correct guy, so when I say sexist I mean that he has reduced the role of female host, Dr. Miranda Jones played by Diana Muldar. despite all his supposed splendor and self-control, nothing more inside but a big, unreasoning jealous child You have prolly received the plot now, after his technical assistant Marvik, also a scorned lover, turns out when he tried to kill Medusan Ambassador Kollos, out of a jealous rage, but first saw instead. (He thinks he could have simply entered the room with his eyes closed and moved the box, too easy) takes the Enterprise into a non-navigable space outside the galaxy before the boys could subdue it. Well, the ship is stuck in limbo, at which point they could go to the liaison doctor and discuss it. "Spock has to fuse a mind with Medusan, so we can go home, I mean, like la beeer, do you want to stay adrift until we run out of supplies and die?" But the woman in true Star Trek fashion is a jealous monster who complains and cries when the idea is launched, even when her Medusan idol tells her to shut up and go with them. So the spite beetch messes up the fact that Spock got confused and made him wear the visor that drives Spock crazy. Kirk, of course, realized what a real fool she was and made her ashamed to fix Spock with his superior telepathic powers. Of course, in the end the lady and Medusan leave and everything is forgiven. You almost want the President of the Battle Star Galactica to show up to throw the witch out of a lockdown for his destructive prowess. But in the land of Star Trek, women are allowed to be totally unreasonable and cruel, but at the same time there is presumed to be sexual equality. This is what I mean by sexist.
