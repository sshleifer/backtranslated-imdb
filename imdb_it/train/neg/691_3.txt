This probably isn't in the bottom of Slasher's mediocre movie, but it's definitely a damn bad movie. <br /> <br /> The Holiday premise made it interesting but after the first few scenes the film shows that it is poor production values ​​and stupid plot. I mean, the subgenus was at that moment all about an invisible maniac who cut teenagers for no apparent reason, but it took him too far. There is absolutely no consistency in the events or anything else to add. <br /> <br /> The clichés are more than boring, the gore is minimal, and so is the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly mediocre slasher item that should not be advertised even if it has a video nastie label. <br /> <br /> I'm really disappointed with this overrated piece of garbage.
