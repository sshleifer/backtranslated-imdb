Don't get me wrong, I love action and revenge movies, I've seen many since I was a kid, including the last of Dolph Lundgren "The Mechanik" which is pretty good. And Tony Scott certainly knows how to use a camera and it could also be a brilliant film to shoot and edit. <br /> <br /> But with "Man on Fire" (and even more with "Domino"), Scott proves that rather than intelligently using his "genius" skills to make films, he uses it without pupils to show off and compensate for a lack of substance that his material does not offer him. "Man of Fire" is close to 2 and a half hours when it should have been at least an hour less. <br /> <br /> The way Scott shot and edited this film also makes you think if he really wants you (the audience) to sit through his film because his constant camera and flashes are really torture for the eyes and makes you want to leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Sometimes where the MPAA and the studios have questionable attitudes about the ratings, violence and production of PG-13 movies, I also find it suspicious that a $ 70 million movie is a script of a movie B with a character who cuts his fingers, puts a bomb in a man's ass and blows the hand of a boy with a shotgun, all this to avenge the death of a child who is NOT even dead! Go to understand why a studio will pass a better screenplay because of language or violence ...
