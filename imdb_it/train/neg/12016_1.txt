If Bob Ludlum saw this mini series, he would have cried. This was a complete waste of time and money. I read the book and although the films are not exactly what the book might be, CBS has lost time and money in this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was Ludlum's work. <br /> <br /> It could be the creator take a look at Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good that TV series was. <br /> <br /> Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign to lower themselves like this? <br /> <br /> Horrible !!
