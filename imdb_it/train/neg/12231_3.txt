I saw this movie and, at times, I was nervous about believing this movie "saw me". Munchie cheats on the 'farce' for years to come. Review Star Wars, don't look at Munchie. <br /> <br /> As a responsible parent (I speak with those who are now parents), I (you) will not allow my (your) child to ever participate in this pseudo-occult video festival. To insinuate Munchie is satanic, for a co-viewer, it is likely that a cold "duh" is illicit. He is diabolical, alien, rodent and completely evil - like the bogano man made flesh, invisible to adults, who nurses children with lifestyles they could never afford (without the income made possible by years of self-denial administration). He is a peddler of easy answers and false ideals. It is all that the morally conscious spectator is not. He is the devil of Ron Popeil. <br /> <br /> I pray (I mean literally and figuratively, with an emphasis on the first) that this film did not blow the format to the DVD. I hope this kind of 'yellow movie' died a death without mourning in the cold nights of 1994. <br /> <br /> Munchie also loves pizza. I forgot to mention it. It shows up a lot.
