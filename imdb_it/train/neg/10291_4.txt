80 minutes, and it seemed double! Brief Crossing is not short enough. In fact, the first 50 minutes or so consist almost entirely in a dialogue (more than a monologue, actually) of a woman approaching middle age, boringly buzzing with "men", disappointment, sex, aging and her recent breakup in a teenage Frenchman he met in the ship's cafeteria. <br /> <br /> The boring monologue continues as they go to the duty-free shop, and to a bar, where finally his self-involved outburst pushes him away. The "story" can't end there, of course, so she persuades him to listen to his drone more while he takes it to his cabin. <br /> <br /> What a little love story, sex, or that matter, all that this film has, as well as bitter deceptions, is just enough to justify the price of a rent, unless you be one of those who love dramas in which nothing interesting happens. Yes, the ending is very well done, but it is a poor gratification to submit to what amounts to turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whimper. <br /> <br /> Of course, some people love it. I might be wrong.
