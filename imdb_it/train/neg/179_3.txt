Return to the hut by the lake only .... it was missing. It must have a very low budget because a good part of the film must have been filmed with a normal video camera. So, within the same scene - you'll get some cinematic quality shots and simple camera shots. It makes a very strange mixture! I think they should have found a way to not make the "home video" effect! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth seeing if you saw the original CBTL because you can compare and see the differences. But if you haven't seen the original CBTL ... you wouldn't want to see it if you see it first! It will probably seem too trivial and will distance you from the one that interests you even for the original one.
