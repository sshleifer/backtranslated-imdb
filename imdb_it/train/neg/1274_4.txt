This should have been a film about Sam and his wife, the glorious Peter Falk and the equally glorious Olympia Dukakis. That would have been a movie worth seeing. Instead it is a Paul Reiser vehicle, with a small Falk thrown in. The wonderful Elizabeth Perkins is also in this film, but you hardly know it. I assume that Reiser has the impression of being a great movie star who needs an appropriate vehicle. He is not. Even more annoying is the fact that Reiser took the trouble to hire some of the best female character actresses on the screen today and then pushed them into his background. Dukakis does not appear until the last 15 minutes, but when he does, the screen lights up. The story speaks of Falk and Dukakis in reality, but we are subjected to a useless, foolish, absurd journey in which Reiser shows how cute, precious and really so profound with psychological intuition (wrong!) That can be. For example, in a restaurant scene that I imagine Reiser hoped was "Cassavetes-like" there is a ridiculous and ridiculous confrontation between Reiser and Falk that is so obviously ridiculous, I was embarrassed by Falk.
