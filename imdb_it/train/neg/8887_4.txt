Good films cannot be based solely on a beautiful garden and on top of a hill. Surprised to see him he won two awards. Extremely overrated. I saw for the first time that kind of film from China, visually stunning, but with something really fascinating to say, well, more than 10 years ago and I'm sure there will be even more. This is not one of them, I'm afraid.
