Tarzan the Ape Man is a remake of the 1932 film of the same period and, like that previous film, bears little resemblance to the literary character of Burroughs. But while the Tarzan of 1932 was reduced to the speech "Tarzan - Jane", this Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keeffe, does not speak or grunt. He makes Tarzan scream a couple of times, which seems to have been extracted from the previous film. <br /> <br /> No, Tarzan plays the second banana with Bo Derek as Jane. Or better, as Bo Derek's third banana to his left breast and his right breast. This film makes no sense but to show Derek naked. <br /> <br /> The two action scenes in the film are presented in slow motion and are really bad. Other evidence that nobody cared about. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, Tarzan has an orang soccer in this film. Perhaps he is driving from Sumatra with the Indian elephants that are also on display.
