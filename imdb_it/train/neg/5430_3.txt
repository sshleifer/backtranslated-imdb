Priyadarshan: every time a person listened to his name, his first thought would be "comedy". This is what this man is known for, or rather, was known. After giving beautiful comedies like Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train derailed slowly with films like Chupke Chupke and some others whose names I can't remember for now. Now with horrible films like Dhol, the first word that could strike our mind after listening to his name would be "torture". <br /> <br /> Dhol is a mixture of bad, unhealthy, somewhat dramatic jokes, poor suspense and idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two funny scenes, though not humorous, and secondly, except for Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandmother, the acting was decent. <br /> <br /> Speaking of acting, I heard that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were on top (if you compared them to others in the film), then Tusshar Kapoor arrived, then Tanushree and finally the two idiots of above. The flaw in Kunal Khemu was that it was noisy in his jokes and even in his acting. His grandmother looked like a ghost first, and he wasn't funny at all but rather silly. <br /> <br /> The plot was the same, seen before one. Four boys behind the girls and in need of money, but with some twist. There is a "bad" man who is absurdly stupid and stupid. And in the end, the good wins over the bad and all is well. The idea of ​​having a Dhol with a tone full of money is simply not witty. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the film is its length. After about an hour, you're exhausted and want to leave the theater. But being critical, it is my responsibility to tolerate all the two and a half hours of the film. The film goes on indefinitely and the same type of lines repeat themselves again and again and the situations are perennial only in a different place. <br /> <br /> If your mother-in-law has arrived at your home and starts teasing you for everything, then send her for this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10.
