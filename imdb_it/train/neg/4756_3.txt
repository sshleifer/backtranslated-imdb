A remake of the superb 1972 theatrical drama film, which plays Caine as his character's nemesis since the first film. But don't do anything else for nothing. <br /> <br /> An under-parr performance of the actors, Law and Caine, further diluted by the weak self-indulgent direction. <br /> <br /> The warmth of the setting in the original is abandoned for an ultramodern nostalgia. The subtle interaction between Oliver and Caine, which made the first film so watchable, has been replaced by a horrid, arrogant arrogance that immediately generates disdain in the viewer. But this is not the clever, ingenious and pleasurable to appreciate one another character that the original has promoted so well, this is an obvious OTT character assassination of both characters from the beginning. <br /> <br /> This version of Sleuth is not really worth seeing, watching the original film and being dazzled by the opening act.
