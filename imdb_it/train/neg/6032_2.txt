I am a Christian who generally believes in the theology taught in Left Behind. Having said that, I think Left Behind is one of the worst movies I've ever seen for some time. <br /> <br /> To have a good movie, you need a well-written script. Left Behind fell sadly short on this. First, it radically departs from the book. Sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page novel into a two-hour movie, but in this film I saw changes that made no sense. <br /> <br /> Another thing, the character development is zero. When the characters of the story are saved (I will not say who), the book makes it clear that it is a long process of soul searching. In the film it is fast and artificial. The book is quite decently written in which people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real, but in the film scenarios they are constantly given quick treatment with nothing substantial. In another scene where a character gets upset about being left behind (again, I won't say who), it looks artificial. <br /> <br /> I realize as a Christian that it is not very edifying for me to say that I did not like this film, but I cannot in good conscience recommend a film that I think has been done horribly. Perhaps it would have been better to do the first book in 2-3 films. In any case, Christians must realize that in order to be taken seriously as a director, we must start by putting together a film in a quality way. I realize that most likely it went into Left Behind, but that's how I see it.
