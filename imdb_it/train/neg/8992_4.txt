This is a decent effort, but the guy who wrote the script seems to be a bit in the dark about what exactly makes a cool zombie movie. No, it's not CGI bugs and software companies. I'm actually not sure if it was a software company: I saw it without subtitles, so I had to guess what they're talking about. However my point was - instead of wasting your time animating a stupid insect, why not throw more zombies and more actions. The 2/3 of the 20 minutes consist of newsletters, bugs, some kids screaming for something. And to make matters worse (more boring) most deaths occur off the screen. I realize that it's too common for films without a budget, but then there were some really impressive effects (well, kind) that left me wondering why the director (or screenwriter, whatever) chose to focus on the epidemic has begun - It's a short, nobody cares anyway.
