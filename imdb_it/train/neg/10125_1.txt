... this would have been what you got. <br /> <br /> Words alone cannot describe how bad this is. If you have trouble sleeping, pop in and I guarantee you will be out in fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> Robert Lowery was a pretty good actor in the 1940s - but he's phoning here. In an interview, Johnny "Duncan" Robin said that in one scene he and Batman had to run away from the car at home and that Lowery was doubled over the range of cameras because his belt was too tight! Duncan himself looks more like a motorcyclist than a boy: in fact he is more like a boy in his thirties waiting for Lowery to leave in order to wear his cloak. <br /> <br /> Driving a Batmobile that looks like it has broken away from the batch of cars used by Honest Al at the price of the underlying sticker - Dynamic Duo's don't try very hard to hide the fact that it's Bruce's car Wayne to drive - in fact he is noticed by several characters throughout the serial. <br /> <br /> The acting is wooden - the sets are cheap - the dialogue is horrendous and if there was even a script they were following I am sure that he read along the lines of "Batman says something here" because it seems that they are doing things as they are going forward. <br /> <br /> Batman's Utility belt is made of thin fabric with no apparent bags to hold his gadgets-- in a scene when Batman needs a life-size flashlight in which the producers notice as soon as they start the scene: they will never be seen again. His hood is so bad that he can't even see it and his ears look more like those of mopsy flopsy than the unhappy easter bunny than doing something like a bat. <br /> <br /> In one scene (I'm not making it up), Batman replaces the counterfiet's radioactive money that will burst into flames the moment it is exposed to the air as a reward for some bonnets. It's radioactive so I can track it down - the reason it's so highly flammable isn't explained. Well, unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse - we know it's a cardboard warehouse because Batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that seem to weigh about six ounces on the caps to knock them out - and soon the whole place burns to the ground. Thanks Batman! <br /> <br /> In another scene after the Batmobile was deactivated, Batman shoots down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car - letting the man wake up and tells him not to worry because if Batman destroys the car, the police will surely buy another one! Yes, you guessed it, he said the car lost its speed in a few seconds. Not that it's important for the motorist who probably died from trying to get back to Gotham City. <br /> <br /> There is a tired subplot with the Lois Lane clone Vicki Vale who is convinced that Bruce Wayne is Batman - he must have noticed the Batmobile parked outside Bruce's house-- or maybe he saw Batman and Robin running on the sidewalk in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Everything about this serial is bad - and everyone, except the younger ones in the audience, will want to throw a toast at the screen. If you are looking for a bad movie you could not find a better sign, if you want entertainment, try the Burton Batman movies, the Adam West Batman television series or the previous Lewis Wilson Batman series.
