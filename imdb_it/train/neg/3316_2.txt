This was the first Ewan McGregor film I've ever seen outside of Star Wars. Since then I've become a big fan of Ewan McGregor, but I still can't forgive the existence of this movie. <br /> <br /> My sister has always been a huge fan of Jane Austen and for this reason, I've been subjected to various classics, Emma is one of them. I've always considered them irritating, stupid and boring. However, after seeing this terrible interpretation, I was forced to admit that the original Emma was delicious and fascinating. Ewan McGregor doesn't really have a purpose in this film after he hacked and mutilated the role of Frank Churchill. Gweneth Paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is insignificant and stupid. <br /> <br /> My recommendation to anyone remotely interested in English drama ... go see the originals. If you're a fan of Ewan McGregor ... believe me, skipping this movie, you missed nothing but five minutes of collective with a silly hat and a bad haircut.
