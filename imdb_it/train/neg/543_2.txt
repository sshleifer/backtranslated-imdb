Well I can't waste time because of a big cast of actors .. I think all I could see is a bunch of talents wasting their time on a big screen with a pathetic humor that will appeal to I don't know who? some pathetic songs that will be heard by whom? some pathetically abrupt transformations justified by whom? race against time? do you mean wasting time? Okay, first of all ruin your son, then teach him a lesson, wow we're so ignorant of this fact anyone who said it's a brilliant new concept is probably some other species besides human it's okay let me come a comment how humans make movies has a nice message to give but could have been given by a stranger sitting next to you on the bus rather than going to a movie so expensive to learn that Hindi movies have already shown a lot and besides I can't waste my time writing on waste Anyway!
