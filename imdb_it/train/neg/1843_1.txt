Wow. Simply terrible. I was a fan of the original film, and sadly I witnessed part 2, 3 and improvement. 4.5 and Freddy's Dead were pretty bad. Nothing is as bad as Freddy's nightmares. Freddy acts as a guest Rod Serlingesq of this series of anthologies. <br /> <br /> I can accept how Freddy became one beat after another, but at least in the movies Freddy's attractiveness bore movies, but here they were so badly done, they looked like high school productions of a horror series. The poor actors, if you really want to define yourself that after doing this show they were obviously exactly what they paid for. I'm pretty sure this was a stopping point for two types of actors. Those who are just starting on the Hollywood scale, brand new willing to take on any part that would regret their duty to take that porn job offered last week, or experienced actors on their way to the Hollywood scale willing to take any part that would put from their porn work they were offered last week. I almost expected Dana Plato as a guest star, but she was already dead when she was in production. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase Nancy's line in the original Elm St, "What ever you try not to fall asleep watching this."
