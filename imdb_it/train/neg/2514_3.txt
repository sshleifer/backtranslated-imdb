I loved Dewaere in the Noir series. His talent is trivialized in "The Waltzers" aka "Going Places". Ok, there are a couple of guys who show off the conventions in the most absurd and irremediable ways; many people find this behavior funny. It was a boring, useless exercise designed to shock. I find the smirk on Blier's face, his face behind the camera, annoying. The Noir series was a valid expression of personal freedom and licentious behavior. From the first moment we see Patric Dewaere climbing the abandoned land, we have an idea of ​​the incredibly beautiful anti-hero with whom we will spend time for the next two hours. When we see him chasing after the unfortunate middle-aged woman with his friend Depardieu in "Going Places", we have the right warning that the two hours spent with these chaps will be draining. I have trouble eking even a "3" for this annoying distraction.
