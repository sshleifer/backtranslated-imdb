An original mediocre Sci-Fi Channel image. A little twisted, but not a lot. The U.S.S. nuclear-powered submarine Jimmy Carter is on a mission deep under the dense icy ice near the North Pole when he is attacked by giant super-charged electric eels. A crew member (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) thinks he has devised a way to communicate with monsters, but he is not given much chance for vague reasons. Among the crew there are also David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. This film could have been a little better if the eels / monsters weren't so funny.
