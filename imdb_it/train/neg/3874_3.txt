This film was so predictable, that throughout the time you hope the obvious suspect is innocent, and that there is still some other major breakthrough. However ... it is not so. Keep shivering and keep ignoring it. Did Mary find very incriminating evidence in her place, and did she still trust him? And what was "lure the trap"? There was no trap. He confronted him, said "sorry, I have to go kill someone" he left, and that was the end. They make attempts to use other suspects, (like that of an old carnival girl at the end) but they are completely underdeveloped. In reality, all the characters are underdeveloped. They have no depth and the setting is simply strange ... who hangs out in a recycling factory? His choppy and nothing is well developed. For example: when he leaves his seat after drinking beer, he finds the photos and she runs away and he takes it and they end up having sex in that car ... what was it? His reactions were not portrayed. In the car he acted scared as if it was practically a rape - but then all we see is his shower the next morning. booooooooo It could have been much better .. much better.
