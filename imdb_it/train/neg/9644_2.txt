First of all. In this genre film the first thing you need is good music, and this is where Mr. Shankar and his group fail. <br /> <br /> the music is completely pale and ineffective. On the other hand there is AJAY DEVGAN, WHO REMOVED A LETTER 'A' from his spelling, did a good job but was of no use for a bad cast film like this. <br /> <br /> ASIN is like a doll that is used to entertain the public, even if it is beautiful to look at, but its role in the film is dancing, in reality she is a member of a rock band and I don't think no rock band has a dancer as a member of the band. <br /> <br /> in walnut shell this film is a piece of shit a piece of *** t. watch it if you want to be deceived.
