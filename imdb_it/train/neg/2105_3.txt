Bela Lugosi is a disturbing mad scientist who uses orchids to woo brides to steal the essence of life from an old wife. The dwarf in this film is fun !! A lot of monsters, plus a lot of padding and no texture makes the vision of this movie a nightmare. I loved how all the pieces eventually came together in typical Hollywood fashion. The story never becomes interesting, and you feel helpless as you watch. <br /> <br /> I usually scored a header like this bass, but the dwarf only added a little creepiness and entertainment to earn a few more points.
