Joe Don Baker. He was very good at "Walking Tall" and had a good part in "Goldeneye", but here in "Final Justice" all hopes disappeared ... the dark side won. <br /> <br /> As with most of humanity, my main experience with this was on MST3K, and what an experience! Mike and the robots dig their claws into Baker's deep flesh and completely hit this shot. It is obvious that they were just starting with "Mitchell" on their anti-Joe Don football and here lies their continuation on a theme. <br /> <br /> It's a fun experience, though: there are many riffs of choice. My favorites - "John Rhys-Davies for sale", "It's" Meatloaf: Texas Ranger "", "none of them is spongy", "Because he wore his dance dress in bed", and my favorite - "" Son of a ... '? Thing? What son was he: the son of a PREACHER? <br /> <br /> Alone, "Final Justice" is, as Joe Don says in the film, "a big fat nada". But here, it actually has some entertainment value. You have a chance, take THIS version of "Final Justice". <br /> <br /> Two stars for "Final Justice". Ten only for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Oh, and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don is in town.
