Romantic fantasies directed by Clint Eastwood on the love affair that grows between an elegant hippie (Kay Lenz) and a Los Angeles real estate agent in his golden years (William Holden, surprisingly affable in this highly invented deal). The script is light, but not without some reflective passages; however, the scenario is now a middle-aged clich√© that most of the picture looks like childish. It may have worked much better with several clues: Holden and Lenz don't fit well (its stature is so light that it seems to tower over it), making their intimate scenes less moving than simply uncomfortable. Dated, blurred-romantic and mostly not memorable. ** from ****
