I will keep this brief as a film like this does not deserve a complete review. <br /> <br /> Given the setting, this film could have been something really special. It could have been another "28 days later" or even a "Blair Witch Project" <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes of the film I was really excited, directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense, even though I don't think he managed to capture the true unease of an empty London underground. <br /> <br /> The characters were a big disappointment. Our "heroine" in this film is a useless piece of shit, and you really don't care if she dies or not. As many people have said before, I was rooting for the homeless and the black guy, who managed to give me a chuckle or two (whether the writers were intentional or not). <br /> <br /> The main villain, he is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie, but when he is revealed I was really disappointed. I don't want to spoil it but just say my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match. <br /> <br /> All in all this is just another mediocre horror film that falls into the trap of following a simple Hollywood formula. This film had a lot of potential but failed to hit the mark. <br /> <br /> Just to point out how lame this film was, the characters in this movie had at least FIVE TIMES to finish and kill the main villain. INSTEAD OF GO VIA.
