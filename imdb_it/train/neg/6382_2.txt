It's hard to know what was going through Per Kristensen and Morten Lindberg when they wrote "Gayniggers from Outer Space" - the film is advertised as a comedy, yet there are no real jokes next to the names of the raw characters (Captain B. Dick , Sgt. Shaved Balls). The rest of the film is (presumably) unintentionally funny with ridiculously out of sync (with "actors" basically reading their lines without any hint), "futuristic" displays full of spelling errors and a plot that has almost no sense. <br /> <br /> Although 65% of viewers gave this movie a perfect 10 out of 10, this is the exact opposite of what is a good movie. It can be ENTERTAINMENT to watch with some friends, but this film deserves only a "2" out of ten ... slightly higher than the lowest possible rating only because of the fact that the writers have somehow managed to get some black kids into the lead in this movie.
