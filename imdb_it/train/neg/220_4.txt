"The Crush" is a romantic love film of 40 friends, quite nice, for the first two thirds or so, as it tries to be an English "Sex and the City". <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the turn-around of the young trophy whose character is not very detailed (if you think about it we have not seen all that physical flesh of him and Kenny Doughty is it worth seeing more ). <br /> <br /> Certainly they do much more business than the young / old woman than they did in reverse in both versions of "Sabrina" (neither film I like) nor indeed with Douglas / Zeta-Jones or Dion / Svengali nuptials. <br /> <br /> Surrounding Andie MacDowell as a former pat otherwise they are welcome family members of comedies and English comedies, such as Anne's Chancellor. <br /> <br /> The twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina. But it wasn't until the credits came to an end that I realized what could really be wrong. Just like with "Sex and the City", the writer / director is male, here the Scotsman John McKay, and I think he really wanted to do a script about three gays, probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and work (the characters are principals of a school, policeman and doctor), which would have been a better and more interesting film. The working title of the film was "The Sad F * cker's Club" which would have made his parallel with the gay "Broken Hearts Club" even more obvious. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 4/6/2002)
