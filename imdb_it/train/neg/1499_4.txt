Tourists travel to Ireland for a school trip to meet Druids. What they encounter is a horrible tale of cannibal killers. <br /> <br /> If I had to summarize Evil Breed, it would be a low-level fest. The film mixes Dead Alive, Evil Dead, Wrong Turn all in one. It's just a pity that the movie contains so many inconsistencies to take into account the fact that it will lose any "fun" would have looked at it. The film has a lot of random "horror" nudity ... even if the film also has four porn stars, four, so there could have been a lot more. The breed also shows a good amount of blood. <br /> <br /> Evil Breed has a horrible start, with ridiculous dialogues and horrible acting. This is a given in a horror movie directed at the video, but this takes the cake. I can't understand who the main character is, since the only female who "lives" in the end is not really in the film. Speaking of the finale, this must be one of the most casual and fake endings in the history of the film. It has no purpose with the rest of the film and totally changes the vision of the film. <br /> <br /> You have to see this movie to believe it, since there are some pretty great death scenes. There are two scenes of death that come to mind, one in which the trapped killer rips the bowel from a naked woman across his chest ... his chest, don't ask me. The other id when the guy gets his gut, once again, ripped through his asshole. Does this kill the boy? No, the killer continues to strangle the boy with his own intestine. These scenes remind me so much of Dead-Alive, with just the right amount of humor in each. I also had the sense of Evil Dead, with the useless mention of horror films and Sam Raimi. Along with Halloween, when the female character is in a closet screaming for her life with the killer who desperately tries to enter. <br /> <br /> Even if the blood and nudity are not enough for the poor quality of audio and visual quality of the film. When the teacher wakes up from his bed and goes down the stairs, his steps are so strong and hard that he looks like he's wearing boots. Really distracting. Like the continuity in the film, with only one killer ringed? Just as the character dies at that moment. I can't tell if the breast chick was Jenny or Gary's sister / cousin ... I don't remember. As well as the casual naked chick with a dead baby hanging from its body, still attached with the umbilical cord. <br /> <br /> Even the horrible assembly is distracted, the opening titles are too fast and confusing. He had a bad start and improved, but the ending brings the film back to a horrible level. If perhaps there were better production values ​​and more faith put into this film, then he would not have been horribly massacred to death. Stay away from this movie, unless you're happy with the horrible bad-budget film with good blood.
