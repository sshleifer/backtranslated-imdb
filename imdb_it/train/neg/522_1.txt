About 15 minutes, my wife was already wanting to leave. Not so much for the material, but for its lack. They decided to fill in the empty spaces where funny things should have been with so much language and utterly vulgar speeches as they could. When this stopped (very rare), we sat and watched (not laughing, mind you) and waited for the next offensive or offensive remarks. After about 35 minutes, we both got up and left. Everything we read said how beautiful it was. The trailer looked good and Roger Ebert actually called it "smart" and said it wasn't a rough sex comedy. Went to the right movie? Together with Be Cool, it's the only other film I've ever walked ... and I have no regrets. I'm sick of trying to go see comedies in America.
