Too bad indeed - very rarely I watch a movie and in the end I feel disappointed. I saw some of the adaptations of Ira Levin - "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Stepford Wives" - and I liked both, but I didn't like that. <br /> <br /> When I read plot - an award-winning playwright (Michael Caine) decides to kill one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) and steel his script for his success - I was excited. I like thrillers, Michael Caine is a good actor, Sidney Lumet is a good director and Ira Levin's work is generally good. <br /> <br /> I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but it all says there are LOADS of twists. It is so difficult to explain the plot of the film in detail, without giving it away. I enjoyed the first ... 45 minutes, before they started to turn the curves and at that point my interest and my fun began to fade. Although I have to thank Lumet for the very funny ending that made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> The main cast - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - were all brilliant in their roles. Although Worth's obvious Russian accent, gave me a little nervousness (nothing personal Irene, I think the fake accent of any actor would irritate me). I'm not sure that the Cannon character should have been annoyingly funny, but Dyan managed to annoy and entertain - at the same time. <br /> <br /> Anyone reading this - I don't want you to feel bad about it because of my points of view - giving it a chance, you might like it, you can't. These are opinions.
