I was always curious about this movie because it's so hard to find, so when I came across Ebay I forged over $ 10 and bought it, now I understand why it's so rare! This film is SO SO bad, so terribly written and hopelessly low that the end credits, which show all the cut scenes in which they tinkered their lines, are literally the highlight of the film. The film is about a psychic (Pettyjohn, cast for an obvious reason, his topless scene) who uses his powers with an experimental machine to drag objects from another dimension into this reality. When she enters a kind of box like the object, the army casually throws her into the back of a truck with a soldier to protect him, and, hell, what do you know? SURPRISE! A child in a foam rubber monster costume, kills the soldier instantly with a scratch on his face, then flees to a nearby city. But rather than deploying half of the county's armed forces to find and protect the public, those in charge leave Pettyjohn and Ray the chance to find him alone, but it doesn't matter, this film blows all its LONG credibility before then. This can barely be voted on by me just because of involuntary laughter, someone has to alert the producers of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" if they don't already know! 2 out of 10, really, REALLY bad!
