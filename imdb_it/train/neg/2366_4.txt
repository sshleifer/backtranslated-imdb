I'm a fan of the Nightmare series but this is horrible. The deaths are so fashionable. If you were to watch this 20 years later, the whole Nintendo scene is obsolete. I like flashbacks. I think they should have made a prequel on when he was still alive. It would have been more interesting. This is a movie you can take or leave. It depends on how much free time you have.
