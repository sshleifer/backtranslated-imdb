Killer Tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor: you love it or you hate it. Personally I like it, but in this fourth film the feeling is gone. Tomatoes are not the same, jokes are lame, even actors are not so funny. Because this is the only thing that should be this kind of movie - fun. <br /> <br /> So now follow the plot made to laugh, it's annoying. They really shouldn't have done the fourth part of the Killer Tomatoes trilogy.
