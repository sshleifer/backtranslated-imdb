It's been a long time since I've seen such a bad movie. Acting is very average, the story is horribly boring, and I'm running out of words about the execution. It was completely unoriginal. Or, and this is a comedy like the pregnant Schwarzenegger of Clint Eastwood! <br /> <br /> One of the first scenes (the one with the TV show - where the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80% let's face it - forgotten actors. If they were hoping for a career raise, then I think it could never happen with this on their CV! The script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who is an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor) pulled him off. Fred Durst was the only one who looked better than everyone else. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if you ever think of watching it, I highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic, because not only is it a total loss of time, but also a weak example of how bad cinema is .
