The trailers for this film were better than the film. What a waste of talent and money. I wish I would have waited for this film to come on DVD because at least I wouldn't be out $ 9. The film totally misses the brand. What could have been a GREAT movie for all the actors, turned out to be a B-movie at best. The film moved VERY slow and just when I thought it went somewhere, it did it almost but then it didn't. In this day and age, we need unpredictable twists and closures in the film, and this film did not offer either. The whole thing about how suspicious everyone is is good, however, he is not sure if it was the way it was directed, the lighting, the delivery of the lines, the writing or what, but nothing came of it. Lot of hype for nothing. I've been VERY disappointed in this movie, and I'm telling everyone NOT to see it. The sold out saxophone music has also made the film worse. And the ending had nothing to do with the rest of the film. What a disappointment.
