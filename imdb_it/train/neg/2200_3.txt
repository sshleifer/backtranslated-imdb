I love bad shark movies. I really do laugh at them hysterically. and the scifi channel was doing a marathon of them, culminating in the first of their new original film, Hammer: Shark Frenzy. based on previews, it seemed like it would be HIGHLY fun. essentially a remake of the benchley creature, really. was preceded by a projection of shark attack 3: megalodon, which is the hilarity of the shark movie at its best. I was in the right mood; I was ready to go. bring it on, hammer-scientist-man-mad! oh, god, that movie was wrong. <br /> <br /> wrong, wrong, wrong. <br /> <br /> sick. twisted. MESSED UP. <br /> <br /> this is theoretical reproduction at its worst, my friends. when a drugged girl is taken out of a suspended animation and tied to a table screaming with her head down because the hybrid human-shark fetus the absolutely insane "scientist" deliberately implanted in her belly wants OUT ... Jesus monkeys. that's what I call disturbing. <br /> <br /> that's how the plot works: hmmm, thought the mad scientist. my son died of cancer, but I brought him back to life combining his DNA with that of a hammerhead shark, because sharks do not succumb to cancer and other hammers reproduce through the placenta. Oh look! a perfect being amphibious! I created the next evolution of the human race! I KNOW! let's play it! but damn if all those shark geniuses didn't make my son bloodthirsty; instead of raping the hot girls I keep sending into his little jungle paradise, he keeps eating it. but look at this! among the random people who ended up on my research island due to some small change in the plot, she is the woman my son was engaged to before he died! I bet he will! all this leads to an extremely touching and heartfelt meeting: woman: will you fill me with me? mad scientist: no. he is. (indicates unbalanced person-shark in the tank) what sweetness. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM. never.
