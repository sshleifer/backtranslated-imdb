This is the kind of movie that wants to be good but sucks. First thing, what the hell are those punks trying to do with school? I think that children do not seem to realize the gravity of the situation. The deker boy tells the girl that they are under his responsibility when he asks him why he wants to go back for them but then gives the wheelchair user a gun and wants him to go alone and repair the phone line. Where is the responsibility there? I understand that the poor actors have to pay for their food, but why not just give them the money to make a stupid movie like that or give that money to a charity. Oh yes and none of them knows how to aim. The stupid punk guy shoots in the cafeteria nowhere like crazy. Everyone wants to look professional but they suck. Another thing I don't think is that there isn't an emergency exit in the school, the kids are trying different doors but they are all blocked. What happens if there is a fire and the security guard is over? It is illegal to not have an emergency exit to school. However there is much more to say but it would be too long. I spent some time in my life looking at shit.
