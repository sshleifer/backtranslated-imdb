I will keep this as short as possible, as this piece of shit barely deserves mention. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst films ever made - right there with the other horrible Schnaas zombie - ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films suck so badly that all those involved in their creation should be shot. Somehow I managed (barely ...) to go through ZOMBIE DOOM - but ZOMBIE 90 is so horribly inept - even compared to the other horrible film by Schnaas - that I had to perform a rapid advancement of everything after the first 10 minutes. ZERO acting ability, inept goreo, horrible camcorder-style work, ridiculous dubbing ... keep it up. I really can't find a single thing that redeems from this garbage - and I can usually find SOMETHING redeem in ANY movie. This is really one of the worst movies ever made - You've been warned ... 1/10
