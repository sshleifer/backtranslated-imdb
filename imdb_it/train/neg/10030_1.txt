Tashan: the title itself explains the nature of the film. <br /> <br /> This type of film is made for the flop. Too bad that Yash Raj Films produces films like this that are worthless of quality films C. Or even some C-level films have a better and more pleasant history than Tashan. The much hoped for and too trusting Tashan bombed the box office at the box office that certainly deserved. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the worst movie ever made by the honor banner of Yash Raj Films. Why did they run such a heavy project with the new Vijay Krishna Acharya that doesn't make sense to make an action movie? He tried to imitate the ways of Sanjay Gadhvi as a Dhoom, but in the end he suffered. Action scenes are more like comics or cartoons made to upset the audience. <br /> <br /> History also loses its meaning and substances to tenderly win the hearts of the public. In most of the scenes, Anil Kapoor reminds me of the southern Tamil star Rajnikant in his body language and expressive expressions. I'm not a fan of either Saif or Akshay, but Kareena's prize should have ended up in Saif's hand instead of Akshay. Right from the starting point I expected, but in the end I felt sorry for the culminating truth. Saif is the protagonist of the whole adventure, while Akshay joins the center. In each film, the final should be judged with all the characters in the whole story and the prize or reward should be given to the one who deserves credit. And Tashan loses this way, and unexpectedly failed to become a success. <br /> <br /> Akshay's has nothing new to show his comic talent here, but he still remembers his previous films. He seriously needs to form a new image for his fans that would impress them again and again. In the midst of Saif he did a great job in Race, and now he's back in his hilarious nature through this movie. But he fully developed himself in the field of acting. And last but not least on Kareena. She looks really sexy in a bikini dress that some people complain about as she gets too thin. But I don't think so, instead she became thin. Yes thin !!! It is a good factor for a female to attract the main people (or say, male). Next to them it is nice that Saif's son, Ibrahim, appears at the beginning and is the young Saif. I hope that he too will move forward with the goal of acting as his career. <br /> <br /> Those who love this Tashan are mentally immature or still want to return to childhood, or say they are admitted to an asylum. Thumbs up for novice director Vijay Krishna Acharya who mishandled the project offered by Yash Raj Films. In the future he should experiment and study the minimum script of 5 years before going to practical directions. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I don't like evaluating good stars for this kind of junk movie.
