I love low budget independent films and I have high hopes for this. But this film is static. No matter the value of the production, which is very noble for its budget, but the rhythm is deadly. Of course, these people get very little, but the film fails at the most basic level. That's boring. The assembly is glacial and the stalls stimulating. It should have been 65 minutes. The best thing about Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde who is not seen enough. It had the most dramatic potential. Instead we have to suffer through the Baltimore-English dithering that stutter through an endless and boring display. It looks like a backward stage show committed for the video. <br /> <br /> Noble efforts of all in the production, but such a tired story needed a kick in the pants and the original new low budget technology should have given it a new voice. Instead it is only a reconstructed lame.
