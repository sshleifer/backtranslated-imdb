There are so many negative reviews about "Stay away, Joe" in here I can't just shut up any longer and let this injustice happen. Here's a part you haven't heard yet. <br /> <br /> Elvis Presley's films are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason: they are perfect movies for pure relaxation because I don't have to think when I look at them. This means that I don't have to worry about losing a complex plot because there is never a suitable plot to start. I can just kick my shoes, grab a beer, sit down, turn off my brain and enjoy all the general strangeness and captivating rock n 'roll melodramas of the most groovic decade of them all. <br /> <br /> In my "Stay away, Joe" books it certainly falls into the "so bad is good" category. Now, if you are like me and appreciate "the value of the basket", this is the experience of the field par excellence of the 60s. It's so ugly that it's almost surreal to watch and just when you think it can't get any worse it surprises you in the most imaginable ways. In the end you are so amazed by all the new levels of stupidity that you don't know whether to laugh or cry. In short: I love it because it's so damn funny that once there was a generation that made films like that. I continue to give it 1 in 10, but once it has reached the bottom 100, it will become a classic of a bad movie.
