The worst kind of film. Basically, the United States Declaration of Independence has been replaced with a plasma screen and this has deceived the security of the museum for several days. Eh? <br /> <br /> The plasma screen that theoretically would work for less than 2 seconds off the clock battery, assuming it had an internal resistance low enough to supply the required current, which it would not be. <Br /> <br /> It would be possible with a dozen large car batteries and an inverter, but that system wouldn't fit at the cash desk. I'm sorry to be anal, but this isn't even close to being plausible. The rest of the film was not much better and I wonder why the budget could not have been donated to charity or me.
