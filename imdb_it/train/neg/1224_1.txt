Is anyone in their right mind doing something as stupid as this movie? <br /> <br /> The accidental killing of a security guard ... characters so two-dimensional that a two-year-old could have drawn by drawing them ... and better ... <br /> <br /> One red toolbox of death? Please .... <br /> <br /> The weak hypocritical thugs ... <br /> <br /> Playing from hell ... <br /> <br /> Stylistically this film moves between teenage comedy, thriller, voyeurism and ... female ... (uhm) Rambo? <br /> <br /> Incredible and an insult to any thinking person. Not looking, going away is more horrible than you can imagine ... <br /> <br /> And what's more, everything is trying to be fashionable being overly graphic in its violence ... <br /> <br /> Mrs Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and entertaining, this is just pathetic and terrible. Good luck next time. :-(
