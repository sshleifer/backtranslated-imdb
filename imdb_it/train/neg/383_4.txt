The plot of No One Sleeps is not a bad idea, and the topic is quite interesting. But, while watching this film, we were saying out loud: "These filmmakers take the trouble to find good places, the lighting is good, the makeup and hair are good ... why is the sound so bad?" Throughout the film the sound was echoy, confused and much of the dialogue was incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There is good acting in this film, and I think Jim Thalman is really a good actor. This story, with some of the same actors, would have been worth doing as a high-budget movie. <br /> <br /> I just can't say enough - if you're on a tight budget, dedicate more to good sound. The sound is as much a part of a film as the image, and it is worth doing well. I could have earned a 6.
