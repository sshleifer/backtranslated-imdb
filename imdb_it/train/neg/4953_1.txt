I've never commented on IMDb before, but I feel I have to do it after watching the animation of The Batman. His absolute crap! Warner Brothers had the perfect animation series in Batman in the early 90s, so what the hell are they doing trying to mess up the winning formula? I feel like writing a letter of complaint to WB. The original animation was dark and thoughtful, exactly as Batman must have been. WB had to ruin everything with a Batman of the Future tripe. Now they produce this drivel. The Joker looks nothing like the Joker from the DC comics. DC should sue. I urge all those who agree with me to send emails or write to WB and use people's power to resume the original formula
