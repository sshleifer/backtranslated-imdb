The Irish critics excited about this film are beyond me. Overacted by the usual band of Irish actors dragged out for every Irish film. Terrible script, with oddities forced character (brown sauce). Romanticizing everything that is bad in Dublin. The attitude of "ah, it is a dump, but it is certainly not grandiose the same". A lot of curiosity exclusively for the American public (the head of the supermarket and his horribly forced catchphrase). And the nail in the coffin was the character of Colm Meaney. A great actor forced to interpret this part that could have been written by a five-year-old child. Stuff worthy of note. The best thing about this movie is Farrell, and it's a bad thing when you have to say it. Well, at least he wasn't wearing his horrible American accent. The international public must be warned: stay at home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock. You will have a better time. The intermezzo is a walk-outside
