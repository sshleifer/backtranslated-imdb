I love Alec Guinness. And this is saying a lot after this movie. In reality, it is not bad in this. He just seems to stand apart, to be polite and his usual delightful, but to invest nada. It is obvious that the girl with whom he is paired is a featherweight, even if a young inexperienced French girl. Sir Alec would not have chosen it when he was young and obviously he is not very happy about it. <br /> <br /> The interesting character is the greedy brother of the strange "Suzanne", another idiot. "Donald" aspires to be a French Heathcliffe and I awaited in vain the source of his mystery. What deep dark secret was hiding behind that forehead? Was he in love with his father's lover? Why did he tear Suzanne's hair off when she plotted to bring the disparate parts of this turkey together to the country estate? Or maybe he had just had enough of his hateful acting. <br /> <br /> The film would have been fascinating with Guiness and the "old woman" who remembered and saw Paris together. THIS would have been a great story! Two adorable people experienced in a beautiful city after the destruction of World War II. Why did no one invent it? I suggest looking at Alec Guiness in "The Card", a little known but worthy film.
