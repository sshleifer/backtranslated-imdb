Of course, I looked at this piece with already VERY low expectations. Dieter Bohlen is a rather talented composer whose lack of talent is only surpassed by the size of his ego. <br /> <br /> This was the first cartoon movie I saw that was 100% humor free. He is rude, offensive, redneck and obviously anti-women. As such, it is a creation that suits Bohlen, but the average viewer will be rather discouraged by it. No wonder it was never shown in a cinema: it would have bombed BIG time! <br /> <br /> Not even the costs of 6.5 MegaEuros were able to save this piece of shit. Save time and money!
