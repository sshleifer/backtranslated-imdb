Based on the obscure bestseller by Ray Russell, this bust directed by John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) has little success. <br /> <br /> Even if there is no lack of bloody violence, it lacks narrative sensitivity and "characters". <br /> <br /> The title "Incubus" is a demon with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm in vaginas during sexual intercourse - or, to be more precise, rape. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes, in the moonlight of his successful directorial career, is as convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of bizarre attacks on young women. <br /> <br /> The horrible possibilities of the victims that generate demonic offspring are not considered - nor is the tolerance of the public for slow moving garbage. <br /> <br /> The reluctance of the script to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the major problems with this Big-Schlong-On-The-Loose vandal exercise.
