I've been a fan since his first album. This film is a bad service for him. The performances, with the exception of those by Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson, are simply terrible. <br /> <br /> Those of Martha Wainwright, Nick Cave, Antony and Jarvis Cocker were particularly annoying. That of the McGarrigle sisters was also ruined by the so-called Martha Wainwright harmony. <br /> <br /> I have never seen my wife get up and leave the room in a movie before and I quickly found my way through the performances to get to the few interview segments, which were also difficult to watch because of the bad camera work. <br /> <br /> Many are those who have been able to play Mr. Cohen's songs, Jennifer Warnes, KD Lang, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville and Willie Nelson, but those people selected for this show were only Hope that there will be another attempt to capture Leonard Cohen in a film that will illustrate his intuition, his talent and his intelligence. <br /> <br /> So sad
