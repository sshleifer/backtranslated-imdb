I saw this movie because I noticed that Kari Wuhrer was in the cast. I have long had a theory about her, which is a talented actress, but she never seems to be able to prove it, because she is always in this type of low budget B movie. She is still beautiful, and is still trying to act on the unfortunate material in which I always see her. It is no different. The film is often ugly and disturbing, but that doesn't make it good. George Wendt played against the guy, and this was so strident that he got recognition for his role. Another note on Mrs. Wuhrer. Her breasts seem to have shrunk considerably since I last saw her. Perhaps reduction surgery or (more likely) removal of implants. This is NOT a bad thing. He's still fine. I'd like to see it in a better movie.
