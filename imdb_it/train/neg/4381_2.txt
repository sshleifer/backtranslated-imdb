By chance, this is one of the five worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's not like they haven't tried. There was a decent writing with some elements of structure, a good cast, a good acting. I'm not sure where it went wrong, but it went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some of the elements could have been a bad structure and no substantial history, a lot of exaggerations on the part of the protagonist (which is probably much better when held back), bad direction and modification. I had enough of it at about an hour, tearing my hair about an hour and a half and very upset at the hour and fifty minutes that it worked. There was also an insincerity about this, as I was going with someone who was a heroin addict. He was agitated by the fact that it made something that had nothing good fascinating. This was reinforced by the beautiful 17-year-old girl in love with the 30-year-old drug addict. <br /> <br /> And the frenetic nature of the protagonist was strong enough. There were awkward plot points that were an attempt at a structure, but the end result was listless and endless (with irregular timelines). The characters were colorful but endless, which made me feel bad for quality actors who haven't seen enough. <br /> <br /> Jump. I figured it was a debut director in love with his own turds, but he has done it before. I am puzzled about how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money.
