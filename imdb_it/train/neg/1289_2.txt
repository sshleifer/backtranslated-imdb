This was a new historical low among the westerns. The writing is terribly ugly, the characters are impossible to emphasize and are disgusting or insignificant, the violence is frightening and technically not very convincingly executed. And Tobey Maguire shows us the flip side of his talent, he sleepwinds through his part with those expressionless eyes and his hoarse voice that here only betrays mannerism. 'Ride With the Devil' is one of my five worst cinematic experiences of all time, a western to never exceed in negative respect.
