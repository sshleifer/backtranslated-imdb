This film has some of the worst acting I've ever seen! Some scenes are as original as the nails that come through the floor. This nail trap captures these villains. The rest of the film degrades as you go. I can't believe this movie isn't even in the 100 top films of all time. Also I can't believe there are any sequels! The next shit movie I want to watch is R.O.T.O.R. Could R.O.T.O.R really be much worse than this? <br /> <br />
