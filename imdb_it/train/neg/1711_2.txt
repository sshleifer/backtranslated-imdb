Well, I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy thinking it would be an unreasonable game. This is what it is, without fun. This film is really lacking in intelligence, it is absent from any plot or character development, or from any kind of plot. The basic problem with this film is killing and cold blood. Basically, every kill seems EXACTLY the same thing. ZOmbie who tear someone apart. Yes, that's fine, but you also need original killings. I mean he became really lame, every kill looked exactly the same, filmed exactly the same way. This is what killed me. I love blood and the blood in this film did nothing for me. It was just boring. No plot, just the same limping scene over and over again with a different person. I too wanted to like this movie. I like video gore movies ... like Redneck Zombies. But I couldn't fool myself. This film has good points, but none of these is in the film. I understand that many of the "zombies" helped with the flood and there were more than 100 zombies, which is quite interesting for how they involved so many people and helped them around the world. But overall, this is a terrible film.
