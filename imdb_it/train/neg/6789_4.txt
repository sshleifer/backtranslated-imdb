The plot of this film hangs over an important point: that this killer was also a responsible, loving and caring father. Not that being a father and a murderer is impossible. But this man is shown to kill a teenager without provocation or reason and without emotion. This girl was someone's daughter. I don't think a father who cared so much about his daughter could have been so cold-blooded for someone else's daughter. Or, alternatively, he could have been so cold-blooded and yet worried and cared for his daughter. And the idea that a convicted murderer can actually ask the victim's parents to look after and care for his daughter is incredible. <br /> <br /> That said, the characters have been interpreted with conviction by the actors. I thought that changing the color of Scott Bakula's eyes made him colder and more threatening than he normally is. You couldn't see it in his eyes.
