The five or so good westerns that Mann did have no equal as a Hollywood ensemble. Even John Ford has never done so many with so much quality. The curious thing about all of them is how irregular they are. My Darling Clementine of Ford is worth about two and a half of each of them. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> Their true hero besides Mann and Stewart is Chase. Chase is responsible for the brilliant Red River. Chase wrote the distant country, the curve of the river and probably some others. But none of them ended up as My Darling Clementine, but then very few films, Western or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Each of Mann's five films has large gaps, or six, let's see. Bend, Far, Man of the West, Furies, Winchester 73 and yep, six, Naked Spur. Each has a magnificent scene after a magnificent scene, with rather obvious errors. Yet it is also Red River, which is still the single largest western ever made. So perfection is not everything. <br /> <br /> But The Far Country has huge huge holes. It's cheesy, and it really comes to life only when Stewart and Mc Entire are honking their horns. The rest is rather pedestrian, with the usual exception of Mann's camera. Mann's camera is a one-man course in cinematography. It's about a good eye of anyone who has ever been behind a strip of moving film. It is almost never in the wrong place, ever. <br /> <br /> The Far Country has a fantastic time. And as usual he comes from Stewart. No one in the history of cinema has ever received a physical punishment with the authority of that man. It is absolutely incredible: look at it in Bend, Far, Winchester and Man from Laramie: in Bend he was beaten and hung by a thread in a believable way and with such a hot hatred he looks like someone displaced by Dachau, in Far he is shot from a raft so much violence, it seems so convincing that it is whispered, and obviously when it is dragged through the fire in Man, well, you find yourself looking for signs of burns. What an actor. Not to mention the moment when Winchester was soon beaten in the hotel room, just as no one ever did. <br /> <br /> But that was Mann's territory: look at Gary Cooper fighting with Jack Lord in Man of the West. Painful like any fighting scene ever recorded. Cooper though not quite as convincing as Stewart, however it is somehow his equal in looking exhausted at the end of the fight. In short, no one but anyone, but no one has ever shown the human being in extremis and Mann. <br /> <br /> What a great, great director. <br /> <br /> See all the westerns he has ever made. They are his real monuments, even if everyone is sloppy. But then what? When he roars with his great scenes, they are as good as anyone, including Ford. And his six westerns as ensembles are the best ever made by anyone, period. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Anthony.
