This 1974 Naschy outing is directed by Leon Klimovsky, and a quick look at advertising photos and packaging may lead you to believe that this medieval ordeal is somewhere between "Inquisition" and "Sadomania". Unfortunately not. <br /> <br /> This is a strictly PG affair with domesticated torture sequences, without nudity and little margin. Naschy (of whom I am a fan) struts like Gilles de Lancre, "antiguo Mariscal de la nacion". Unfortunately it is more of a villain than anything else. One has the feeling with this film that we saw it (and did) everything before. Strictly so only for Naschy.
