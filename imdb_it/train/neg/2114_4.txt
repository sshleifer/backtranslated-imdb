Only by looking at the sets, staging and editing is it easy to say that this project lacked an adequate budget. Perhaps Bela Lugosi is designed to distract you from such things. The young brides fall dead on the altar after saying "I do". Their corpses are stolen by a famous horticulturist Dr. Lorenz (Lugosi) and a couple of his extravagant servants like his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) needs injections of the young virgin glandular fluids to stay young forever ... forever beautiful. An anxious reporter of the local puppy (Luana Walters) understands that every missing bride wore the same rare orchid at the altar; an orchid in which Dr. Lorenz would be more experienced. A typical horror movie makes a visit to Lorenz's estate a bit spooky; especially with a dwarf and a lumpy hunchback on the premises. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
