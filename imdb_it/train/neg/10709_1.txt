I can't think of much to say about this movie. <br /> <br /> This was a terrible film ... I can't even tell you what pushed me to see it. He had so few qualities of redemption that I don't even know where to start. <br /> <br /> The plot has gone from implausible to decidedly absurd. My whole body was tense for the duration of the film because I couldn't wait for the horrible thing to be over. At the end of the film, I found myself feeling relieved. <br /> <br /> The editing was poor, the acting was sub-par, and the plot was weak. Francoise Robinson was cast as a Native American, although she doesn't look much like any of the Native Americans. <br /> <br /> If a movie is so idiotic, it should be ridiculously stupid - at least. It wasn't. He was just pathetic.
