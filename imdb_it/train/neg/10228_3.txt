To be honest, I had heard that it was pretty ugly before I decided to watch it, but I'm never one that allows others to influence my visions, in fact they are more likely to look at something as a challenge! Bullwhip had something waiting for me before the vision, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those beautiful eyes were in it had interested me immediately. The image is not very good, and is actually very morally dubious, all the characters are corrupt and elusive in a shape or form, all motivated by greed or self-centered victories, that's all right if the surrounding film can do justice to a group of despicable people and create a tremendous climax. Unfortunately it is not, and while the finish fills your eyes with sugar you can't help but shout at having been tricked into watching a rather ugly movie, no one in the cast came out with any credit, with the conductor Guy Madison painfully in wood in the extreme. <br /> <br /> Not even the beautiful Rhonda can recommend it to anyone, 3/10
