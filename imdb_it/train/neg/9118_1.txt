This is, literally, the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. It could be the worst movie possible. Some movies are so bad that they are good; this film is so ugly that it passes by a funny field and becomes simply terribly horrible. It is the anti-enantiodromia. We bought it with the intent of messing around, and my whole family came together for a fun evening of intelligent observations; instead, we sat in astonished silence, pitying poor Peter Sellers. <br /> <br /> This is worse than the Lord of the Rings animated. It's worse than the Matrix sequels. It's worse than Krull. It's worse than any Batman movie. <br /> <br /> Do not, under any circumstances, allow this film to come within three meters of your TV.
