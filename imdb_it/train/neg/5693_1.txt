I can't believe the positive reviews of this film - I thought it was one of the worst, poorly performed and misinterpreted movies I've ever seen. And the plot was completely ridiculous (sp?). Are you going out with him while he's tied to the chair? puh-lease. The worst part was that it wasn't even bad in a good and ridiculous way. Simply terrible - I couldn't understand why they took the trouble to show it on HBO. I thought Belushi was ridiculously silly - really incredible as an "eccentric" killer. idk, I could go on - again, I'm shocked by the positive reviews. The only thing that kept me from looking at it is that it is fascinating to see how a film can go wrong and what makes it bad. And the ending did not disappoint even his foolishness! "live by the sword, die by the sword ..." ridiculous.
