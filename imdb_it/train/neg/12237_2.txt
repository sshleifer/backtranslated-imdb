Claymation Original Rudolph: Quite good. Frosty's original comic strip: he needs some work, but it could be worse. But Frosty and Rudolph together on the 4th of July? Come on, come on! Give me a break!!! This was a film that should not have been made. It was bad. In particular, it didn't go for any holiday, except July 4th. This made it particularly negative since Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with the Christmas period. And every movie can be ruined by too much singing. Frequent songs have made this movie look much longer than it actually was. The film tried to mix two famous Chirstmastime characters with a traditional American party (which almost seems to "limit" it in America), too many useless songs and a bad plot. The result? A bad movie that can't be seen at any time of the year. I suggest you give up this movie even if you like Frosty and Rudolph.
