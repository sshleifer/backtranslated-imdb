Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and brother both had a policy that the person who chose the film should pay. And, even if I would never pay to see some of the crap they brought me, I couldn't resist a free trip to the cinema! That's how I came to see shit like Conan's second film and NEVER SAY IT AGAIN! Now, despite being an unhappy movie, it's in some places fun to watch - in a sort of dead brain. And technically, the stunts and the work with the camera are good, so this elevates my rating to 2! So why is the film so ugly? Well, unlike the first Rambo film, this one has practically no plot, Rambo himself says only 3 words (besides grunts and screams), there is a useless and totally irrelevant "love story" and the film is a giant (and stupid) special effect. And what special effects STUPIFYINGLYLY. While 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at Rambo, nobody has any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow Rambo's blows hit the mark! And, while the bad guys use AK-47, helicopters and missiles, in some scenes Rambo has had a bow and arrows with what look like nuclear-powered drills !! The scene where the only villain is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly shoots one of these explosive arrows is made for silent audiences! It was wonderfully parodied in UHF with Weird Al. Also, HOT SHOTS, PART DEUX also makes a funny parody of the genre - not just this stupid scene. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, a film so stupid and meaningless, it's almost like a self-parody!
