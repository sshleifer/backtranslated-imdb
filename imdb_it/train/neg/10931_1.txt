I went to see this movie with fairly low expectations, imagining it would be a nice piece of hair. Unfortunately, it wasn't even that. I could barely sit in the movie without wanting to go out. I went with my two children (aged 10 and 13) and they also kept asking, "How long?" After it lasted until the end, I kept wondering who would approve this script. Even the reliable Fred Willard could not save the trivial dialogue, the state jokes and the trivial plot. I would suggest that anyone who has written and directed this film (I use the term freely) should take a screen writing course online or drop by their local community college for a film class. At the very least, there are many books on directing, screen writing and film production that teach them something about structure, plot, dialogue and rhythm.
