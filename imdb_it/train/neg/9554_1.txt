This is the worst, and I mean the worst computer-based movie I've ever seen. The whole plot is totally unconvincing and full of stupidity. <br /> <br /> I mean ... <br /> <br /> The guy in this movie can actually talk to the computer like a real person. Now you probably think this must be a super-cool high-tech computer, well, it is, but it does so with other very poor and weak computers that don't even have a graphical interface. <br /> <br /> and the main idea about how to overload the "super" computer by connecting via computer game on the net is really stupid. My phone will turn off the lighting to conserve energy, but apparently this brilliant computer can't decide whether to use its resources to deal with national security threats or to load computer games. <br /> <br /> there are also other bad things about it but I don't have time for this. <br /> <br /> I can't believe anyone could really record a stupid movie like this
