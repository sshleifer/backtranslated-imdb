I was looking for Imdbs bottom 100 because I thought that id had never seen anything as bad as the outerspace 9 plan or the Roller Ball remake, I was wrong. Ben and Arthur beat both. <br /> <br /> This is one of the many films I've ever seen, the worst film ever. Bad direction, bad characters, horrible acting, horrible story There's a reason why nobody says anything positive about this movie. Sam was a horrible and annoying actor, but his direction was so bad that he could have knocked over Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> The director should be ashamed of his work, unfortunately I have to give him at least 1 star, but he deserves: to be continuous stars
