I'm a Jean Harlow fan, because he had star qualities. I don't think her films are good and I don't even think she was a good actress, but she certainly was very good at comedies. Every part of the play in The Girl from Missouri is very good. But this film is perhaps more like a love story. Jean Harlow is wonderful at this and you can forget the rest of the cast - their performances bring nothing new. It always impresses me to think that Harlow's beautiful body is that of a sick woman. Well, in this movie she looks beautiful.
