OK, the director redo REALLY LOVE Director Nikhil Advani after making his debut with KHNH takes his second time and waits for <br /> <br /> He makes a film of 3:30 hours + that loses patience, time.etc The viewer seems a 3 hours sleep watching this movie <br /> <br /> OK they had 6 stories so it was necessary but why? 6 stories? <br /> <br /> We have the convincing but boring story of Anil-Juhi. Isn't there a TV series showing stories like that? <br /> <br /> We have the story of Govinda- Shannon that is fun and works well <br /> <br /> The story of Akshaye-Ayesha is believable, but it soon becomes boring and the focus is on comedy and this it's also a boring comedy <br /> <br /> We have a Salman-Priyanka story that is the worst, not just acting terms, it makes absolutely no sense <br /> <br /> We have a story about Sohail-Isha to make you laugh and the trick works sometimes thanks to the boredom imposed by most other stories <br /> <br /> The story of John-Vidya is a beautiful story in all respects <br /> <br /> But then when all the stories come to pieces, the viewer gets bored and falls asleep The climax is not attractive in particular The apex of Salman-Priyanka's history The management of Nikhil Advani is fine in places, some stories are well managed but weak in places Music (SEL) is good, but too many songs Photography is beautiful, every story is given a different look, t rama and it works <br /> <br /> The actors Govinda rocks, after a fired comeback with BB, actually makes you laugh and love him in this film despite his age and his weight Anil Kapoor plays his part well, also if he looks out of shape and John tired excells in his part, Akshaye Khanna stands over for a change <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is too exaggerated and Isha has nothing to do Anjana Suknani is fired <br /> <br /> Do Priyanka and Salman deserve an award for this film you're shocked at? <br /> <br /> Salman Khan does not only act, he speaks only as if he were in his sleep and that fake accent, oh god Priyanka, exaggerates such a standard you seem to throw something at her, she improves towards the end Vidya Balan is good, Juhi Chawla is ok Shannon is ok
