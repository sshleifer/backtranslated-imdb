I bought this video in Walmart's $ 1 container. I think I paid too much !!! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi produced a long series of third-rate films for small studios (in this case, Monogram - the ones that made most of the Bowry Boys films). While the misery of most of these films does not come close to the level of horror of his latest films (Ed Wood's classics like Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space), they are still poor films and should be avoided by everyone but the toughest fans. <br /> <br /> I am an old film addict, so I gave it a try. Also, some of these minor films were actually pretty good - just not that. <br /> <br /> Lugosi is, what else, a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum is created by young brides. They never really explained WHY they had to be brides or because they had to be women or even what illness his wife had - so you can see that the plot was never really crushed. <br /> <br /> However, a really annoying female journalist (a Lois Lane guy without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders where the bodies were stolen! Then, it follows some clues up to the threshold of Lugosi. Lugosi's house is complete with his mad wife, a female assistant and two strange people who are apparently the assistant's children (an ugly hunchback sex demon and a dwarf). Of course this brave reporter passes out repeatedly throughout the film - apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! In the end, EVERYBODY EVERYONE dies - mostly because of his own hands and all is well. In the end, the journalist and a doctor he just met decide to get married. And, of course, the stupid journalist's cameraman faints when this happens. If you haven't noticed, there are a lot of fainting in this movie. Or maybe because it was such a slow and heavy film that they fell asleep!
