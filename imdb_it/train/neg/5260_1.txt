Normally, I have no problem with a movie or a story with an ending that lets you wonder what really happened, when it's done on purpose ... <br /> <br /> But this movie really does seem to have all but the last 15 minutes they ended, then they realized that they had left $ 5 to finish ... <br /> <br /> I saw it on TBS ... I recommend you don't spend for this either. If you watch it on TV, look at everyone except the last 15 minutes, then leave and finish your final. <br /> <br /> Actually, the film would have been better if it had simply escaped, and returns with the State Poice of Feds only to discover that the city and the car graveyard were gone, and from all appearances it was not never been there ... <br /> <br /> "I wish I had more thumbs, so you could give that movie 4 inches down!"
