There are so many things wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the first twenty minutes of the movie could have been compressed into just five or maybe ten. The film in general is already (fortunately) short, but this could have been compensated by giving a little more attention to the Mean Lion (how did it miss a reference to "The Wiz" on that?) And working its subplot to a little closer in the main plot. In short, the script had the seed of a good idea, but it needed a little reworking. <br /> <br /> Secondly, he could have done without the raw humor. The original also had a little that it could have done without, but at least there was almost an afterthought - here, flatulence and urination abound. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the show is a bit too self-conscious. The original series was quite successful, as was the first film, but here is just one way, too. Brendan Fraser's jokes were a bit exaggerated (and why wasn't the "new Ursula" spoken of?). Other gags with the Narrator, especially a couple of interactions near the end, also exceed common sense. <br /> <br /> Fourth, a little more attention would have been given to CGI work. In the first it was difficult to say that hemp was not a real elephant (except for behavior, of course), but here CGI stands out as a sore thumb. Ideally special effects should simply tell the story if they are good or bad, and at least they can, so it's a relatively small problem, but it's still there. <br /> <br /> Everything he said, Christopher Showerman's performance as George is pretty decent. The charm of Brendan Fraser is lacking, but Christopher really fails only in that specific confrontation - he even managed to give George some personal depth, which should have been a serious foul in a movie inspired by Jay Ward but he wasn't here. Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me as best as that of Leslie Mann in the original. <br /> <br /> Most of the other performances were pretty standard, not good or bad in my mind.
