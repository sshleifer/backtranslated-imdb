I saw it on Showtime tonight and I was amazed at how a movie with such an interesting premise could end up being so incredibly awful. WHO IS YOUR DAD? plays Brandon Davis as an adopted high school senior, Chris Hughes, a geek who inherits the heir to a porn empire left to him by his biological parents. Even if the premise seems that the film could be very funny, it is ruined by the inept direction of the debut director Andy Fickman, by a predictable and predictable script, and by an acting that is even negative for direct video standards. Even the usual fun Charlie Talbert turns into a surprisingly sad performance as the best friend. Ali Landry is the only good part of this filthy and dishonest fool. 1/10
