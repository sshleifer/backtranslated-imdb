Stereotyped, derivative, not original and boring Western. The two famous stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) both give performances that are far from good and rightly; both have superficial roles and character traits dictated mainly by dialogue. Heston is a sheriff who "loved the world better than before" and Coburn is an outlaw who "owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt". Furthermore, Heston is so old that he has trouble riding and Coburn is bad and tough, but not a cold-blooded killer like some of the lesser villains. Apparently, the filmmakers couldn't even invent an original idea on how to make this movie a little bit different. (* 1/2)
