The plot seemed to promise. To be honest, I didn't watch the whole movie. After about an hour in the film I had to make a decision. Is it worth watching this movie until it ends? The answer was clearly NO! It was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from a different species without refusing it. Nor the premise of being chased by secret government authorities for a transplant of men / wolves. It was because the film was poorly written, the acting lacked emotion and I didn't understand the various dream sequences with wolves and buffaloes. When he ran to the zoo with a pack of dogs and left them in front of the zoo gate, the saying "If you can't run with big dogs don't leave the porch" he kept running in my bored mind. Save time and skip this movie. I can guarantee that if you have the courage to see it you will be sitting open-mouthed as I wonder why someone wastes money, time, energy and effort to make this insult offensive to American cinema.
