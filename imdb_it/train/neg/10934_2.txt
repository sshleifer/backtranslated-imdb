First of all, let me say that I am SUGNI or better, I am a Mormon. So when I saw this movie, I automatically gave the benefit of the doubt. I can usually find something I redeem in every movie I watch. And this was no exception. He has his redeeming moments. But they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> One of the first things I noticed that really bothered me was that it looked like Halestorm was ashamed of our Church! In the LDS Church, congregations are called "wards" and the basketball court is located in the "culture hall". NEVER ONCE, one of these two names is mentioned. The Church is never named by name and "the standards" are so far from mentioning what our Church believes. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the directors are really SUGs or SUGs? This film had so much potential! He could have really shown our Church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer, but also what we believe in. Instead it was just slightly fun and left a lot to be desired. If I weren't already LDS, I would be left thinking that Mormons are stupid, idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs. <br /> <br /> NOT a film I will recommend to my non-SD friends. <br /> We are sorry Halestorm. You can do better than this!
