Having enjoyed Jean Arthur in "The Devil and Miss Jones", my interest was at its peak, so I tried to sit in this hunt for a second string for an investigation into the death of a jockey - but I didn't get to end . Arthur, photographed with a fashion show, wants or the other husband William Powell's food or another shot at the wedding, but I've never tried for her because the character is just a series of jokes (she's the kind of heroine prone to to comic curiosity, but once inside a morgue - like all women in these comedies of the '30s - faints). William Powell is said to have worked a lot with Miss Arthur, but you would never know from the final result; they look awkward standing next to each other, hesitant about their joke. The actor who plays Powell's waiter is heartbreaking, and the pauses for the spectators' laughter are pregnant with discomfort.
