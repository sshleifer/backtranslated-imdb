Anything happens in this movie. There are only bizarre short scenes where I didn't know what the hell was going on, so it doesn't count. This film is so boring to hurt, and this comes from a person who likes it when movies talk about making movies. Confused?, Well, I was after seeing this shit. What was Donald Sutherland, because he missed it completely with this. And what happens with the "pedophile" scene at the beginning of the film. Can put someone to sleep! 4/10
