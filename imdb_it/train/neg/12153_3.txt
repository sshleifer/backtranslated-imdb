Feeding The Masses was just another movie that was trying to earn some money from the zombie craze that was circulating, mainly due to the popularity of films like Land Of The Dead and the Resident Evil series. <br /> <br /> Start from a television station, guarded by the military, and report that The Lazarus Virus (zombie) is close to containment and the city will soon be free to resume its business. The problem is that this is totally false. Zombies run rampant and only a small minority of people are aware. Among them are Torch (William Garberina), the camera man, Sherry (Rachael Morris), the presenter (who for some reason is listed as Shelly on this site) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), their military escort . Torch and Sherry are opposed to lying to people, but the station is run by secret services (or some other government agency) and they are heavily censored. <br /> <br /> This film gives the box-cover a pat on the back says "We keep FEEDING THE MASSES at a higher level than any of the three Dead films by George A. Rombero." The source of this quote has lost ALL credibility with me. <br /> <br /> Let me say that this film is BAD. I don't mean badly as I expected more (of course I was, though), but I mean badly because I couldn't find any quality of redemption in the movie, whatever. Acting in all parts is over or too wooden. Has anyone remembered their lines or are reading the ideas? I can't even think of the best part of the film or the best actor / actress. There wasn't really one. If I had to nod at someone, I'd say Roger, the military escort was probably the most interesting character, but that doesn't mean much. <br /> <br /> I should recommend passing this film, although the casket looks good (that's what originally attracted me to the film). 3/10
