This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I examined it mainly for a morbid curiosity since I loved the novel, and I wish I hadn't done it. I turned it off after a little less than an hour, although I wanted to turn it off after five minutes. I would like to have. He ignores the novel a lot and changes all kinds of factors. Unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last 50 minutes or so (which would be impossible), I would not recommend it in any way. It is an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. I don't think, as many say it is, that "The Bell Jar" is necessarily impractical, but this particular interpretation could have been made without. I would almost like to see it someday in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can make it justice.
