I can't believe that so much talent can be wasted on a movie! The Gingerbread Man starts off on the right foot, and manages to build great expectations for the final. But at some point the film turns into one of the worst stories I've ever wasted my time. It's so incredible how the bewitching Mallory Doss manages to snatch the nose of Kenneth Branagh's character. The climax of the film is uninteresting and flat like a beer, which has been left out too long in the sun. The Gingerbread Man is probably the worst Grisham movie ever and this hasn't changed since the talented stars flock to the movie. Don't waste your time here!
