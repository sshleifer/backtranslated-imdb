This movie is so ugly, it made me want to vomit. Badly made, a complete area free from laughter. Why in God's name would you spoof a movie that at one point is a parody (and damn funny for that) as it is? The sets are laughable, the effects are so bad that they are not even ridiculous and farcical. It's a complete mystery because you might even consider looking at this rubbish lump. National Lampoon once did Animal House, which people still consider completely hilarious. Now they have been relegated to making TV movies like this lump of ****. Name your imprecation and it could be accurately used to describe this film.
