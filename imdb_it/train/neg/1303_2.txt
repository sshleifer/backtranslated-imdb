Edward Montagne's Tattooed Stranger should sound like a crime thriller with a little noir film mixed with flavor. Instead, it is a misinterpreted and poorly focused look at low budget and uninspired film production. The plot is absurd and the acting is terribly rigid and amateurish. John Miles, who had a rather poor resume in the industry, grins and guffaws, and all the others behave with the same verve as the characters in a film produced by the government on driver safety. The film anticipates shows such as "Leave it to Beaver" and "Father Knows Best" in its unnaturally healthy vision of New York in 1950. Because the viewer does not even see anyone lighting a cigarette until a buxom woman is interviewed in a flophouse in the middle of the film. The only thing the film has in store for this (besides its brevity) are the excellent location shots coordinated by William Steiner. The film's low budget works in favor of the filmmaker, as the viewer is treated to well-framed shots of the New York City interiors and expansive expanses. Unless you want to enjoy the movie for the choice of settings and camera angles, I suggest you watch almost any other movie.
