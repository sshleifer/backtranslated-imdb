This swirling film looks more like a combination of music clips on MTV than a real movie. There is no real story and while the film goes on you ask yourself: "What is going to happen?"; but nothing happens. The story of Eric Cloeck, the frustrated writer, is the only good thing. Other people seem to have nothing in common: so why put them together in a movie. With music you can make the worst movie watchable. When I open the tap and the water comes out with Bach's music, most people would like to watch it but this is not a movie. The director should learn how to write a screenplay for a 100-minute or more movie before starting to direct a film.
