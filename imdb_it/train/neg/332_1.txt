I'll start by saying that I couldn't reach it completely. I took it on a rainy day from WalMart like the rest of the reviewers on this site. I thought there was no way to regret my purchase. Was I wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved this project? They must be forced to watch this movie over and over again until the end of eternity. This is the only suitable punishment I can think of for having released something so ugly. The shot reminds me of the movies I used to make class projects on an old VHS. Acting is not much better. I think the only difference is that there are some fantastic cameos. Yay, who cares ... Shecky Moskowitz isn't funny, and the ship comedian is an even bigger loser. That is the plot that I understood. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and have given it to many work colleagues to watch. Everyone returns and laughs and says "Wow, I didn't think I'd ever say to close an Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes in ..." <br /> <br /> My answer is always "Well, now you can" <br /> <br />
