In this strangely apocalyptic apocalyptic, the world suffers from a double plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be too worried about this Grade-Z film that no longer resembles the famous novel by Sheridan Le Fanu than my mother's recipe lasagna. Bored attendants continue to run service stations and doctors continue to make phone calls and useful police officers still show up with the radiator just when you need it. The plot, and I use this term freely, involves a father and a daughter trying to make "the general" foolish, whose daughter is missing, in a church to kill a vampire who, very conveniently, finds himself traveling with the father and daughter. I must confess that it is possible to find a moment or two of genuine humor among vast expanses of involuntary humor. The film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested. Anyone older is careful.
