The insignificant and untidy 80s horror of the 80s like thirteen in a dozen, yet can be considered fun if you look at it in the right frame of mind. The special effects are flashy, the atrocious acting and the script seems to be missing a couple of essential paragraphs! "The Brain" takes place in a typical tranquil American environment, where every teenager works in the same dining room and where the high school kid dumps cherries in the toilet. This is where a TV guru named Dr. Blake and his adorable animal brain begin their search for mind control on a national scale. Under the label of "independent thinkers", a giant cheese brain emits waves through televisions and forces innocent spectators to kill! How cool is it? Now it's up to the Meadowvale rebel teen to save the world! The funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr. Blake and his monstrous brain comes from. There are obvious references to extraterrestrial life, but that's all. Meh, who needs a background in a movie like this, really? Unfortunately there is not much bloodshed and the "evil" brain looks like a giant puppet. The only more or less interesting element for horror fans is to take a look at the cast and crew that made this film. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same men who made "Bloody Birthday" and "Plague". Both are much better films and have wisely decided to resign to the film industry. The most familiar face of the cast is undoubtedly the great David Gale, who horror fans will always love for his role in Re-Animator. A girl named Christine Kossak provides the nudity factor and is she obviously a great talent ?? He has exactly 3 films on his repertoire of which this is his "masterpiece". In her debut, she was credited as a "runaway model" and in "3 men and a child", her character is called "one of Jack's girls". I really wonder how he feels about his acting career ??
