I will spend more time on this review as the authors did on the script. This is easily the sequel to THE WORST EVER made. <br /> <br /> They have KILLED Navin Johnson. Not only was Mark Blankfield's performance GOD-AWFUL, so we were all of us !! The physical comedy was forced, flat and predictable. The script seemed to have been written by Mongoloid monkeys using the pen names Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. The way the producers managed to squeeze out such vile movie excrements is outside of me. They even managed to make veteran actor Ray Walston look like a fool without talent. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of himself. <br /> <br /> I want the 96 minutes of my life spent watching this memory mocked of a brilliant comedy, so I can prove and condemn all those involved for this cinematic atrocity.
