When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) starts looking at her brother's death, she begins to suspect something more sinister than "natural causes". The closer it gets to the truth, the more a threat becomes for his sister-in-law, Fiona (Helga Line), and the rest of the local satanists. They will do whatever it takes to stop their nosy ways. <br /> <br /> If you like satanic and satanic films, Black Candles has a lot to offer. The film is full of scenes of nudity and soft-core ritual sex. A particular scene involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed. Unfortunately, all the sleazes of the world cannot save Black Candles. Most of the movie is really boring. In addition to the scene I mentioned earlier, the numerous sex scenes are not shocking and certainly not sexy. Acting is the best hypothesis. Even the favorite genre of Helga Line gives a disappointing performance. The plot doesn't really matter. Its main function seems to be to hold the boring sex series together. I only know another film directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared to his Daughters of Darkness that masterfully mix eroticism and horror, Black Candles presents himself as an amateur. 3/10 is the best I can do.
