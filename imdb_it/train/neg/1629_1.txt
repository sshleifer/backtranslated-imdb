A mystery / routine thriller about a killer hiding in the marshes. During the early days of television, this was shown so often, when Dad would say "What's on TV tonight?" and we told him "Strangler of the Swamp" that he would have wrapped us in the cinema. We went to the movies a lot in those days!
