99.999% pure crap. And the other 0.001% was a brief moment when I thought the blonde girl was about to vanish. No. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was legendary bad. The action sucked, and there was no sex (the aforementioned blonde girl is modestly dressed, alas, the whole movie). The CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst I've ever seen in a movie, and the anachronisms were numerous and sensational. Acting was mediocre even by Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis, the only "names" of this film. And Marina Sirtis looked really, really bad. <br /> <br /> I have seen high school productions produced in a more appealing way. This is the kind of film on which MST3K has grown. The heads should launch at Sci-Fi to allow this steaming pile to fly.
