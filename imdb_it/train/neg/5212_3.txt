I unwittingly had this movie on my shelf for a while in a Mill Creek Collection, and one night I decided to watch it; although I don't expect much. While the closing credits are running, I am surprised to find that this film was made by Filmirage. Filmirage brought to the world drugs like "Troll 2", "Ator the Invincible" and "Quest for the Mighty Sword", so I was forced to watch. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film it had potential to be quite decent, even if it was not original. The gore scenes could have been improved if they had been extended and more frequent. But after a while in the movie, the rhythm started to drag me and I found myself thinking "Okay, someone better get killed soon" or "Someone changes better". At the beginning of this resistance, when I was having these thoughts, although some may have been killed or changed, however, as noted, blood and effects were not very good. What made matters worse was that the transitions of the scene were confused; example: first Dr. Houseman would be at the Zoo, then he would have a flashback to killing someone, he would finally wake up in a cold sweat in the bed - asking the audience "Was he dreaming he was at the zoo?" Like the rhythm of the film, these scene transitions have progressively deteriorated. <br /> <br /> I could try to say that the development of Dr. Houseman's character was pretty good, but towards the end of the film, that is, once it's you I saw what the Doctor turned into hopefully you laugh - in fact, it's the only reason to see this movie at least once; this film flows involuntarily like a long-winded prank. <br /> <br /> The mood costume, the thing Dr. Houseman becomes can also be seen in "Quest for the Mighty Sword" by Joe D 'Amato, which was released in the same year. You have to love Filmirage movies, they're always reusing the same things!
