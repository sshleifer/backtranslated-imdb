Ok, I rented this movie because of the director ... he made some interesting films in the past (if you didn't see Waxork you miss a fun race). Anyway, I had my doubts about this movie from the beginning, but I decided to suck it and take a look at it. It's bad. Very ugly. If you haven't seen the movie and it doesn't matter that the spoilers read in advance. First of all, the old saying "You can't judge a book by its cover" applies here. The box for this film seems to indicate that Jill is the stone fox with long hair with reflections. The back of the box has a beautiful image of the red leather Jill and some other shots. The description makes you want to rent the movie because it's SOUND good. You start looking at it and suddenly you discover that the film takes place (inexplicably) in 1977. Jill is a total dog that is not the girl on the cover. The film is not as predictable as one might think ... and it's not a good thing. The characters do so many stupid things without any motivation ... it's embarrassing to watch. 10 minutes before the end of the film Dolph and another woman have sex without a good reason. Also, what was the point in having Dolph kill this other cold-blooded lady who was helping him. Anthony Hickox the director should have seen a stinker when he read the script. If it had been set in the underground world of the new millennium and made the characters halfway smart, it could have been decent. Setting it in the 70s makes no sense and has no relation to history. Avoid it!
