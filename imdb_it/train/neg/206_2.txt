I gave this film 2 stars only because Dominic Monaghan actually put his acting to the test. The rest of this film is extremely amateur. All that is associated with the direction of this film has been performed very badly. Not only should the director rethink what he is doing for a life career, but maybe he should watch some movies. As Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, putting him in a film of this caliber makes him look horrible. Anyone who was the "actor" who played Jack's best friend should never have faced the camera. I didn't expect much from such a small film, but maybe a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings. Don't waste your time or money on this film (as I did) you will be very disappointed.
