I went to see this movie (actually I went to see Family Portraits, which contains Cutting Moments + 2 other short films by Douglas Buck) at the Mar del Plata festival (Argentina) ... I just couldn't see it! I had to cover my eyes after the first half of Cutting Moments and take a look once in a while. When it was over, my stomach was upside down and I felt light. I just had to leave the cinema a few minutes after the 2nd short start (apart of course I wasn't the only one leaving the room). WAAAAY was too violent and disgusting to me! I am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved him. I don't understand how you can love that kind of movie! The shocking, bloody, and horrible images I saw remained etched in my head for two days !! I also try to analyze the story (my boyfriend saw it all and told me about it) and I don't think it makes any sense. I mean, that amount of violence and stuff makes no sense other than trying to shock people. And this is not a sufficient reason, I think. There is absolutely nothing in this film that I can say "Well, at least the" x "what went well". But well, I guess I'll never understand that kind of movie.
