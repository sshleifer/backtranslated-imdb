I didn't think it was possible for a horror comedy to fail so abysmally on both fronts ... really terrible. The fact that it doesn't take itself seriously (usually a good thing) works against it, mainly because the actors are so wooden that I really could swear they are reading the cues. In the end though ..... the MST3K version, as always, has a few laughs ...
