This film made me feel like I had lost some important scenes from the beginning. There have been errors of continuity and plots that have stopped abruptly as they started. I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover, in addition to that I have always trusted and respected the tastes of Danny Glovers in his choice of roles, "Grand Canyon" for example. I could not finish this film, after what seemed like an eternity, but it was probably just a little over an hour; we had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing in the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them, there was no evocation of emotion regarding this film and the clips of their past were badly modified, confused and useless. What could have been a great idea for a film, even as a drama and not as a comedy (although I think a comedy in this situation would have been better, because I love watching whites go crazy and start behaving like real idiots, it makes me laugh) ) became a waste of my $ 1 credit at the video store.
