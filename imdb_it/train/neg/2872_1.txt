This is by far the worst horror / thriller I've seen in my 29 years. If someone offers you this for free, tell them NO. This movie makes you a dumber person to know you've looked at it. The plot is not even the worst part of this film ... it is acting, working with the camera, lighting and sound. there is absolutely nothing to appreciate in this film. anyone who paid to do this movie is now broken. I hope the director never gets the green light for another film. In his defense, this film was quickly made to try to capitalize on the capture of the current BTK assassin, but I have seen films that seemed like Oscar winners for weeks.
