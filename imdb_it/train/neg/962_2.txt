It is probable that if I looked at him again I could feel physically ill, the film is so annoying ... unless you believe in psychics, reincarnation and the other focus that this promotes in a big way. The "recycling of souls" they call it here. Puh-leeze. <br /> <br /> This story has already been several times before with films like "Heaven Can Wait". It has also been done much better. Too bad they had to waste the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson. <br /> <br /> At least it's a rather docile film, from a linguistic point of view. It is the only saving quality of this film.
