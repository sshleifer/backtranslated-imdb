With Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> This is without doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made. It's about the cruise ship waiter Shecky (Sandler) who wants to become a comedian on the cruise ship. First of all, there is no fun or intelligent line in the whole film honestly. It's so funny that it's pathetic. There is surprisingly little humor or sexual humor, but the f-word is abundant. The budget is really low and this also ruins the film. It takes place on a cruise ship, but they seem to have only the money to rent a small boat and they only had money for 10 extra, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. The opening titles are cheaply animated, and it's just pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone else who sees it will hate it too. <br /> <br /> 86 min. rated R by language.
