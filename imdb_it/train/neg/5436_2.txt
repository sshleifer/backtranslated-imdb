A friend of mine gave me this movie. A friend of mine is now in a hospital where a group of doctors is trying to surgically remove a DVD wrap from his ass. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled by the prospects of another Michael Chabon film. After all, his novels brought me a lot of fun and the adaptations of the previous script were great, but boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all the people who did the casting must have slept while they did it. I imagine the castings went this way. "Tell me, do you like fish?" "Yes, I really like fish." "Wonder full, you're hired, you have some money." <br /> <br /> Than there is the script. I read Chabon, which I hope he became blind before he could see this piece of dong, and he has absolutely nothing to do with his novel. I didn't stop for sure because it bothered me as it did, but it could have something to do with the fact that listening to a 90 year old drunk hunter with a right cranial lobe dysfunction would have been a pleasure compared to the liner that these boys of 2nd grade massacres spat out. <br /> <br /> This is a real line of the film; "If you tell me something you've never said to anyone before, then this moment becomes unique!" Single? It does? Does it really do that? Off course, not you. Please pass me the Imodium. I will have a whole welcome strip. <br /> <br /> The direction is ... well. I have nothing. Perhaps Rawson Marshall Thurber has just learned that his grandmother exploded or something. Follow the direction of the plays. No stick to directing commercials. <br /> <br /> This film is so horrible that it let me bang my head against a wall so strong it brought me back to the stone age. I give him 2 stars because I don't want to be the guy who saw a 1-star movie.
