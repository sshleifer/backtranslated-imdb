"Speedy Gonzalez" by Friz Freleng was the second cartoon to present the title character after Robert McKimson's "Cat-tails for two". In that cartoon, Speedy was an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth, but at his second appearance the famous drawing had already been adopted. Although it looked decidedly nicer, Speedy never developed into a character. A big hat, incredible speed and a bad Mexican accent don't make a classic character and that's pretty much all that Speedy has ever felt for him. However, the arrogant little mouse turned out to be enormously popular and starred in many short films including some truly abysmal films from the last days of the studio. While these early Speedy shorts are better than those subsequent atrocities in which they were often (rather strangely) paired with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired, based on predictable gags usually based on a similar tracking formula. In this eponymous episode, Speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal the cheese from the local factory that is guarded by Sylvester the cat. Even if it carries the extra weight of a star turn in the cartoon, Sylvester's role here could just as easily be filled by any other generic cartoon cat. His personality is weakened by the fact that he is forced into the predictable. non-demanding role of pursuer. This has always been a problem even in the Tweety cartoons, but Speedy makes an opponent even more boring thanks to his shameless arrogance and the obvious impossibility of his capture. Poor old Sylvester would have been forced to appear next to Speedy for many years to come. Despite following a rather simple formula with minimal laughter, "Speedy Gonzalez" won an Oscar and an undeserved star was born.
