I saw this movie last night and was hoping for the best after watching all the great trailers. Even the DVD cover looked good. As soon as I started watching it I thought like the others "oh my God what is this". There were some moments that were a little creepy but then the mood was ruined by stupid music. There was rock and opera during what was supposed to be suspense scenes. That ruined everything there and I was shaking my head thinking damn well that I had wasted money again on a rental and was deceived by the art of the cover. Nothing against the music itself, it was only in the wrong parts of the film. Anyone who has edited the film has no idea what they are doing. The cover showed lightning, which implies that they were caught in a storm at sea. It would have been more interesting but it didn't happen. Acting was not the worst I've ever seen considering they are all unknown and this is their first film. Another reason why I was disappointed by the plot made no sense. At first 2 men saw all the boys get on a boat, so in the end there was presumably only one girl and the others were his imaginary friends or ghosts, I'm not sure why he was portrayed very badly. WhyteFox who wrote a comment here claims that this is a true story. He believes in ghosts and spirits and says there's a haunted boat in the area where this movie was shot. It has not been said in this film that it is a true story. I have never experienced such a thing personally, but I am not saying that it is impossible. I imagine that if someone is interested in renting this movie, do it at your own risk. If you like horror movies for amateur students, you might like this.
