Joel Schumaker directs the script he wrote and has a group of Georgetown graduates confronted with adult life situations. The plot is an encrypted disaster, but some scenes are actually good. There's a lot of wasted talent and time here. The cast is more impressive than the movie. Featured are Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham. The most notable is McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is quite hateful. Getting to age is not so easy.
