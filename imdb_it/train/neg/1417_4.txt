During a beach vacation, the red-haired brothers Michael McGreevey and Billy Mumy (like Arthur and Petey Loomis) find a seal. The boys have christened their critic "Sammy" and spend the summer hopping with the sand sea lion. When it's time to go home, the boys begin to suffer from separation anxiety. Does the young Mr. McGreevey decide that they can't bring "Sammy" to "Disneyland" ?? er, "Gatesville" - but the young Mr. Mumy packs it anyway. At home, they try to hide "the exit seal" from adults and, of course ?? the hijackings result! <br /> <br /> **** Sammy - The Way-out Seal, pt 1 (10/28/62) Norman Tokar ~ Michael McGreevey, Bill Mumy, Robert Culp
