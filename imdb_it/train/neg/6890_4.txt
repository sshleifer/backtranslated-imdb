... except for Jon Heder. This guy thought of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The plot sounded fun. A loafer son of 29 (Heder) still lives with his widowed mother (Keaton) who meets a new love (Daniels). Slacker's son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. He also meets a girl (Faris). I really liked the performance of Daniels and especially Faris, but anyone who chose Hader would have been better at selling hot dogs on the beach. The performance of Heders is annoying, which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy, the problem is that he is a bad actor to lose this act by making this guy nice in the end. In the end I still wish I could punch the boy in the face and you're upset about the end. In the future every movie with this guy will be a no for me!
