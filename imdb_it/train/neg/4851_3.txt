watch a team of bomb disposal experts in Iraq count their time before they can go home. <br /> <br /> In itself it looks boring. Whenever the little caption came close by telling us how long they were gone, it caused this film without plot to drag on and on. hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home. <br /> <br /> I miss something. I'm a big fan of war movies if they're done right. This had the "jarhead" syndrome. A film that has sometimes been beautifully filmed, but cinematography does not prevent it from being totally boring and useless. <br /> <br /> And to overcome the slow mo "cartridges coming out of the gun" already turned. they could save money and only have stock footage from any other film with a gun inside. <br /> <br /> I had no empathy for the protagonist, I was constantly hoping that his recklessness let him die In fact the film would have worked much better if he had had. <br /> <br /> I read some reviews and had the impression that those who had been in the military did not like it, and everyone else loved it. I've never been in force and I'm with them. It's a pretentious madness. the 3 stars are for cinematography.
