ET's obsession with Dannielynn Smith is contemptible. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention that most likely will grow psychotic, depressed or worse. Think of Princess Diana and her desire for privacy. Now the poor and rich little girl Ashley Olson just wants to be left alone. No wonder Greta Garbo has become a recluse and said "I want to be alone". How much is ET this child? Does ET have nothing better to report? I bet there are a lot of people who really don't care what color the birthday cake and balloons were. By the way, I never heard that Anna Nichole ever won any of those court cases on the will and her legacy. Who pays for the lifestyle of Larry, Howard and little Dannielynn? Could it be ET?
