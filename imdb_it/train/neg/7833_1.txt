I just saw the third week of Stephen Kings' Nightmares and Dreamscapes mini series; meaning, I've seen 6 episodes so far. I have to say that the stories are really weak. I read Stephen King's Skeleton Crew, a collection of his stories that has been published in the past. I remember that most of the stories were mediocre, but there was one that was really excellent, if not exceptional. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to say is that this mini series comes from a collection of Stephen King's stories doesn't mean it will be okay. In fact, if your previous short story collection is any indication, then most of this mini series will be medium to poor. <br /> <br /> In Stephen King's defense, I did not read these new stories. Maybe they are good as stories in a book and not easily adaptable to television, or maybe it was the writers' fault in trying to write an interesting script. Who knows. Furthermore, these stories may have been made exclusively for this mini series and not for printing purposes. Perhaps that could have been the problem. If Stephen King had sent these shit stories to a publisher, I'm sure the publisher would immediately tell him to make it more interesting because, as it is, it's simply boring. <br /> <br /> What is clear from all this is that the problem is with the stories / screenplay and not with the actors and actresses because this mini series has some excellent people acting on it. <br /> <br /> Seeing this mini series really makes me appreciate those old "Twilight Zone" "series. Each series was only half an hour but it was compelling and compelling. I don't understand why this mini series can't accomplish a business I am sure that this mini series had a lot of money to make a good mini series but unfortunately, something must not have clicked. <br /> <br /> For example, this week we were shown two episodes. first involved a horror story writer who buys a photo designed by an artist who committed suicide.The writer begins to see the changes in the photo while driving home, feeling uncomfortable, throwing away the painting but still appearing next to In addition, the portrait of an individual in that photo is killing people and trying to kill him (I won't even mention the second episode this week involving criminals and their loot because it was even more boring than this esto episode!) <br /> <br /> This premise is interesting and so the story should be good but after seeing it I was frustrated because there were too many gaps in the story and foreign materials that had nothing to do with the story . After the last scene, I had more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> I tried for 3 weeks to get into this mini series, but it was too aggravating due to poor quality stories and scripts. If it were a film, I would have recommended that people have to wait for the movie to come out by cable or otherwise. I would not even recommend that it be rented in your video store. However, since this is on TNT, a cable channel, I would say if you haven't already seen it, then try it for a week. If you don't like that week, then you won't like past or future series, since they all share the same boring feature.
