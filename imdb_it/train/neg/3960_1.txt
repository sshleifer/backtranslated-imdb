Hi, Maybe because I'm not a Theater major or a sophisticated movie watcher ... I think this movie is "Boring" and "Dumb". I rented this movie because of Charles Bronson and it's title ... but boy, what a waste of time ... just looking at 2 guys sitting in a vault and talking ... <br /> <br /> The movie on this DVD it was so "DARK" ... I had trouble watching the movie damn ... I realize it's a 1968 movie ... but they're putting it on a DVD, so they should do some digital remastering. <br /> <br /> Also, I was totally surprised to see these high ratings on IMDb for this movie ... as I said before I'm not as sophisticated as the others who have commented on this movie before.
