Until this new season I was a big fan of the "Little Mosque". However, the new season has completely ruined it. <br /> <br /> The new Christian vicar destroyed the entire intent of the show. It has always been about living together to overcome prejudices. The new vicar ruins this premise and shows Christians in a terrible light. <br /> <br /> I am neither Christian nor Muslim, but I loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between Amar and the reverend. Not anymore. <br /> <br /> Cancel it and do it. It is not worth looking at more. <br /> <br /> It could still be saved, but many changes would need to be made. <br /> <br /> Report the old format.
