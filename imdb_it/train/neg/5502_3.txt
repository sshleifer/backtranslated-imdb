Silly jokes, often ridiculous, involving the landing of a spaceship and the consequent disaster caused by Tim (Jeff Daniels) and by the people in his orbit. <br /> <br /> I'm always amazed by Daniels. He showed so much depth and promise in the 1983 "Terms of Endearment" as Shirley MacLaine's unfaithful father-in-law. Over the years, Daniels has not been able to get his hands on a good role. Instead, he's in dull comedies like "Dumb and Dumber." <br /> <br /> As for this image, it fails because of the matter. At least, the TV show has led to a variety of situations. In the film, we have a constant slap in the face and people turn into monsters while the government is hindered in capturing martian-Martin. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Brown's part is a perfect example of the film's failure. On television, Pamela Britton played a mischievous individual involved in situations where the Martian leaves her perplexed. In the film version, a blonde bombshell like Brown, looking for a romantic entanglement. <br /> <br /> Is TV star Ray Walston a small role as a government agent, or is he really like that? <br /> <br /> A big disappointment for those who enjoyed the TV show so much.
