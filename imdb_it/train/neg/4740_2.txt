I'm so insulted by this movie, it's not even funny ... And I thought "Mulan" was incredible! As low as my expectations for Disney have become, I never imagined that they would do something so stereotyped and so far away. Here there is no respect for any true Chinese culture, only the Hollywood tradition of casual martial arts. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that they tried to turn Wendy into a normal girl ... But, fortunately, most normal adolescents - particularly Asian teenagers - are much less obsessed with such superficial aspects of life . And from a cultural point of view, it's almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are wrapped in popularity and fashion, but they are quite rare. And even those who are still fairly decent scholars. Another stereotype, perhaps, but true enough. Because that's how Chinese parents work. Here's how Chinese values ​​work. If they wanted authenticity, they would have made Wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a love-hate relationship with her family. <br /> <br /> This only adds to my frustration in American films. Asian culture is not about meditation and vague, nature-oriented sentences that seem wise. We don't go around smiling enigmatically all the time, and we don't all know some form of martial arts. We are a PEOPLE, and I would be grateful if someone wrote an Asian part that does not portray us as a sad caricature.
