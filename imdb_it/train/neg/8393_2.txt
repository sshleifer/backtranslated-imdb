John Carradine, John Ireland and Faith Domergue who as players have seen better days in better films have come together for this Grade horror film about life that imitates art in a mysterious villa. <br /> <br /> For Carradine he was in those for the last twenty years of his career, which appeared in anything on the theory, it was better to keep working, no matter what you did and get those salaries that came. With that magnificent sonorous voice, Carradine was always in great demand for horror images and the man did not discriminate in the slightest in what he appeared. <br /> <br /> He plays the keeper of an old gothic mansion that director John Ireland has rented for his latest low-budget film. He even has a cemetery, but with a missing occupant. Faith Domergue is Ireland's old star and Carole Wells is the naive young woman. <br /> <br /> In the last twenty minutes or so, most of the cast ends up dead that is not already dead. The script is so inconsistent that I'm still trying to figure out the point. I will not waste any more gray material on it.
