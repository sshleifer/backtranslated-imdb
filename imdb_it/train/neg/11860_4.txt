If you did not understand what will happen in this film in the first five minutes, give it a couple of minutes more. Lilia is a widow. It has been left on the shelf for too long and wants to burst. She has a teenage daughter who only points out that she isn't getting younger. While checking his daughter, he discovers a world that he never dared ... the cabaret, where he can dance his belly in skimpy sequin dresses while men throw money at them. The film is very misleading. The portrait of men is sad. Which is rather strange, since Lilia bends over to move for them, not for money, but just for the fun of it. When he succeeds in stirring them up, he makes her feel like a woman again. He does not want to connect with them but is addicted to attention. The other dancers are all mostly elderly women who look like men in drag and realize that their time in the spotlight is short lived. Not short enough, I say. You find romance, however brief, with you you guessed it ... No surprise here we have not seen coming. Even if the ending is good, you realize that it could not have ended otherwise. Perhaps this film does not target my demographic group - 30 Male
