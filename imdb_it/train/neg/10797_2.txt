There was a genius played by Shaq. His name was Kazaam, and he was crazy. His rhymes were trivial, those lines were ugly to a stupid kid who was crying over his stupid daddy bad actor, bad cast, bad special effects what's next? this movie sucks Prolly didn't make 20 dollars living in a boombox, not a lamp hurts like a cramp like a wet food stamp ... <br /> <br /> Yes, you understand, a stupid genius in rhyme that can act in a stupid movie with horrible special effects. Oh, and he's confused to death. I'm not going to go on. Let's just say that it belongs to the category "it's so bad, it's fun". Watch it once with your friends and have a good laugh. But don't expect anything spectacular.
