I saw it in 1994 when it was finally released. Apparently because the images of Orion were bankrupt, I think, the film had not been published a couple of years earlier. <br /> <br /> I have trouble remembering the details because I haven't seen it for a long time, but I remember it as a very boring film. I kept discussing whether to get out. The shop was not at all interesting or engaging. It was a third copy of America Graffiti of America. <br /> <br /> None of the performances are worth seeing. One of the biggest disappointments since a local critic gave a high rating.
