This is a really horrible movie. The plot (as it is) is totally indecipherable. (I think it has something to do with blackmail, but I'm not entirely sure.) <br /> <br /> Half the dialogue consists of useless clich√©s. The other half is spoken by the various actors in unintelligible imitations of "southern" accents which (fortunately) cannot be recognized. <br /> <br /> But the only real tragedy of the film is that such a seemingly historic talent Mary Tyler Moore was in such terrible financial or personal circumstances as to appear in it. <br /> <br />
