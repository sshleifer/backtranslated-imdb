This was not the great disaster I expected, but it is more positive that I can in my description of the film. I'm not sure what should have been fun in this movie, but I suppose it's all a matter of taste. Personally, I don't find it amusing to watch the morons living their idiotic lives or make fun of themselves on television, but then again, I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's pathetic talk show. I wasn't getting too bored watching it, but I was certainly never having fun. If you're in the mood to watch a bad movie, but not too painful to sit down, this is a good choice.
