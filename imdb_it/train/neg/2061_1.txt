The only movie I've ever released. Unbelievable, since I paid for myself and my appointment and I'm really cheap. But my brain could no longer stand the accumulated dreck, especially since I could write more fun material while tying and gagged. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end this film offends. Worse, it's not funny. It wasn't fun then, and it's definitely not fun now. But even worse, this film represents the beginning of the end of a truly intelligent and sophisticated comedy. It's a youthful, really sophisticated script and the ideas started an era (which continues until today) where cheap laughter, and sexual allusions dominate the culture of comedy in cinema. <br /> <br /> Sexual Olympics? Which high school guy didn't think about it? The beginning of the end.
