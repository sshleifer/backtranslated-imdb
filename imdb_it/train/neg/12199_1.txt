- me and my sister now saw that movie we laughed for the deaf. can you imagine on the covers there is a nomination for an Oscar ?? - first, the musician has mixed about 4-5 different styles of music ... and the music is not synchronized with the scenes and the character moves ... <br /> <br /> --- main character Silvester not adapt there. looks like Mexican Tarzan. <br /> <br /> ---- Russian soldiers are everything but not Russian faces :-) ----- ok, the main points: 1. airplane called charter painted in black ... <br /> <br /> 2. What idea when Rambo jumps off the plane, but is blocked? string mix 3. a girl? the best scene is when it dies. She means a lot to him. has he known her for centuries? he cries for her, ... my god samurai 4. how many arrows does he have? is his arrow bag always full of arrows? I didn't notice a scene in which they collect them - but I saw the scene where the arrow remains in the head of the Vietnam soldier - which is very important 5. How many rocket helicopters can they contain ??? (the real one) I saw 4. but the Rambos hit about 20 of them. <br /> <br /> 6. the main part. what do Russian special army helicopters do in Vietnam ????????? after the war? 7. first scene when he enters the field of Vietnam ... his first idea was to free the shelter that is on the tree in the open space "wow, what an idea more than new: 1. with the knife you can cut the iron wire is perhaps made only in Vietnam? 2. mortar - using it to hit a running man or my god, the Americans really need to know the weapons! you know how long it takes to calibrate the mortar (I think the writer has watched many World War II films)
