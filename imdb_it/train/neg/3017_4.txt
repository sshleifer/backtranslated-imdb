Now I had the best intentions when I looked at this. I like some of Tony Scott's work, even a friend of mine told me it was a great movie, even though I heard differently from other people. But this was simply hopeless. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, Tony Scott was trying too hard. It was all too much. Allow me to elaborate. <br /> <br /> Miss Knightley was exaggerating, and not in a positive sense. The people who performed well were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez and Christopher Walken, but their screen time was not able to save the film. <br /> <br /> There were some scenes that popped up in their originality, yet somehow they seemed to have been written by someone other than the main writer. A certain melody was used about 4 times, which really started to creep in the second time. I firmly believe that I don't use the same melody more than once. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the assembly went really well, as the cutting speed is quite high. Oh, and the repetitive echo of some of Keira's lines seemed simply absurd after listening to him for the second, third, fourth time and so on. <br /> <br /> Basically, my opinion is that if you want to watch a high-paced and "a little bit funny" action movie, and you don't care about everything I mentioned above, you might like it. <br /> <br /> (Side note: I'm not a fan of Keira Knightley.)
