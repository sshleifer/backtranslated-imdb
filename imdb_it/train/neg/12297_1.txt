Witchy Hildegard Knef traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them up one by one in twisted and disgusting ways. I thought I saw everything until an unlucky man was crucified here and then set his head on fire. Hildy is also the joker: she takes a nagging harpy and sews her mouth shut ... then hangs it upside down in the fireplace just in time for a crackling fire! "Witchery" made me sick. It hurt my eyes. I was ready to write it as the worst film ever made by otherwise competent people ... until the end. I have to admit that I loved the ending. It involves a boy and his toy tape recorder cornered by Linda Blair who looks fantastically possessed. The scene lasts only for about a minute and the film is finished, but you know that old saying: "If you have a fantastic ending, people will forgive you for anything!"
