I'm a big movie fan of the 1930s and I'll watch pretty much everything I see on Turner Classic Movies for me. So I gave a chance, after all it is the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent comedian. I've seen a lot less of Lloyd's silent films then of Chaplins, but I have to say that I'm a much bigger fan of Chaplin. However this film has become so flat to me that I didn't finish it. I can understand why his sound career was so limited, he didn't have very good material to work with. After seeing Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy make a parody (or violence in general), this is really to forget. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed in Paths of Glory, but his role here didn't do anything special for me. Maybe they should have entered boxing earlier because at least half of the film (at least it seemed so) is before entering a ring. I can say that there are many Lloyd fans here and this will not be a popular review, but I have to evaluate this compared to what was out there at the moment, 4 out of 10. Don't look at this with anyone trying to like old movies , because they might not see another, very flat one again. For an alternative to all those who really liked this or who are looking for little-known comedies in general, I recommend "Kelly The Second" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in secondary role Charles Chase. These were both shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel.
