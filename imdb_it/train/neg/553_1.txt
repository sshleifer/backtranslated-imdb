After waiting impatiently until the end, I must say that I wish I had not adhered to the entire series in the first place. The final episode was all against the previous seven years. He ruined everything. The journey was 23 years, but Captain Janeway has the power to reduce it ... let's say, only seven years. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? The crew members died throughout the journey. Why do you want to save only Seven of Nine? The others do not count or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew claims that going home is not the most important thing for them. As we say, "the journey is more important than the destination". Unbelievable. And at the final scene they are surrounded by other Federation ships and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about landing, the return to normal life. <br /> <br /> The worst ever.
