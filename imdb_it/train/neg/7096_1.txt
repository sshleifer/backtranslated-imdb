It's amazing because it manages to be terrible on so many levels. The script, the acting, the direction and the choice of the cast are all terrible. The costumes, the ensembles and the pseudo-medieval language are also terrible. In a sense, I actually enjoyed this film once it was accepted that it would not do any good. It seems shameful that people spend so much time and effort producing something so poor, when in reality they could have done something pretty decent (though not very credible!), But instead we are treated in a rather nauseating and shoddy tale of dragons and knights, who lacks any charm that can be found in other fantasy films. We just hope that The Lord of the Rings is a little better! Oh, and David Thewlis' haircut makes him look like He-Man. It does!
