This film makes me think that the others I saw with Combs were an accident. The plot had more holes than I think I've ever seen in a movie that claims to be something more than a "b" movie. The acting was so ridiculous that even the memories of Combs' past triumphs from Campania were not enough to save him. Considering the script, I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. I am deeply shocked that I paid Blockbuster prices for this junk. The fact that it was done for television was something that would help me avoid this atrocity and frankly something that those poor films should be forced to warn you about. Avoid this movie, no matter what.
