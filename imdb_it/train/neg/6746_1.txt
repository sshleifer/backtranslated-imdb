* SPOILERS INCLUDED * <br /> <br /> With a title like "Bleed", you know that creative juices were not running when this puppy was conceived. The film is your basic low-budget slasher movie. Oh sure, try to be creative with the premise of the "murder club", but we learn however that it was just a joke. Ok, for those who are really interested in these things, the basic plot is that the new girl in the city starts dating her colleague. He invites her into his circle of friends, and at a party, they tell her how they have a "killer club" and they kill people, blah blah blah. Well, we learn that it was all a joke, but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking lot. Now the "members" of the Murder Club are killed one by one. Oh, and the bad guys win and the movie ends with a downer. At that point, you won't be very interested. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the first 10 minutes or so of this film makes no sense. The motivation for the killings at the beginning of the film is never explained. I would say it was a way for the director to make the film, but there are deleted scenes on the DVD! I'm not sure why anyone would want to see more of the "Bleed" version, but apparently the people behind the DVD thought that viewers would ask for more. On the box, he says there are Easter eggs, but why the hell would I waste my time looking for extras in this movie is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a bad movie, and "Bleed" delivered on that front. However it wasn't a bad funny movie. Everyone looks good in the film, and there is a lot of nudity, but acting is just awful. My least favorite character is the one who ends up being the killer ... I think it should be fun and funny, but ends up being a tool. I think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills the lady in the parking lot, in an unconvincing hilarious death. The heroine pushes the women into the concrete pile of the garage, and the woman seems to barely hit the thing, and spits a mouthful of blood, and "dies". <br /> <br /> For those who think filmmaking is a complex and creative process done by professionals, check out "Bleed". It will change your mind and you will realize that any trick can make a movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, don't waste your time or money on this.
