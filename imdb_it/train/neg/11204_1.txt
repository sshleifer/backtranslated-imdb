:: POTENTIAL SPOILERS :: <br /> <br /> Man, this movie was horrible. A Catholic / superstitious / suspense thriller that goes beyond the already tread of previous films. <br /> <br /> The doubtful priest. Sex and the priesthood. Politics and religion. Church hypocrisy Conspiracy involving the church. The dawn of a new evil age. All kinds of magic darken voodoo battles between good and evil. <br /> <br /> Rather stupid and lame with a weak plot to be sufficient. The story revolves around two concepts: Absolution, better known as the Sacrament of Greasing the Sick - the last rights a person can ask to purify their sins while on the verge of death; And the excommunication, the act of cutting a person out of the Church. Basically, an excommunicated person cannot receive Absolution. Then he arrives in the Mangiacavallo, and I will leave him to that. Throw all the things I have already listed and have "The Order". I found the sex scene with the priest entwined with photos of a Virgin Mary rather offensive to Catholics. It also ends with Heath Ledger who says (I paraphrase) "I am the redeemer and the damned of sins, I live without love blah blah blah" / I push him to walk in a dark alley with a long trench coat to the "The Matrix". <Br /> <br /> I gave this film a 1 not only to be crappy and unoriginal, but also because it managed to insult an entire faith in the process. If you want to see something better I suggest "The Prophecy" with Christopher Walken.
