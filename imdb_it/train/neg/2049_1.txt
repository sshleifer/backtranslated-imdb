At least I was able to have fun teasing the movie, which is surprising since I could barely sit down. In all honesty, my guess is that the cover of the DVD case costs more than the entire film. And to say that he is the same director as The Boogeyman, when a new version of that has just come out ... nice touch guys, he was deceiving enough to intrude. The only thing that frustrated me more than the unbearable script acting was his haircut. Usually you only see that type of hair on a ten year old boy and the character acted like that. It seems that the film was shot by a student of D + Grad at a film school who was enthusiastic about using every cinematographic technique he had ever learned while attending classes .... sometimes, less is more friend. All the while I was losing myself to random twists that didn't lead anywhere or were inexplicable. All this makes a bad film, but when the ending doesn't even come close to joining it, well, that makes it an exceptionally bad film. No doubt this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and this includes the final French video of my friends for the last year of high school, but hey maybe I'm a little biased, I mean I made an extra. Post scriptum I don't even think this deserves a star ... not even half. NO ONE FOR YOU !!
