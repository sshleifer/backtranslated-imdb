I can't vote on this because I wouldn't watch the garbage from these people. They took my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I swore it would never happen again. I feel it's my civic duty to help people stay away from this garbage. Go to the forums of this movie and read where the cast members try to behave as if they were watching the movie for the first time. A boy also responds to himself ... using the same name! There are shills in the forum that say it's as good as Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane ... Not even close (under any circumstances). If this is the company's second film, it should be better than the first. This means that the third film should be much better. Not so, I saw it. All I want to know is how to distribute this garbage always using the same names. Having fun with friends and making a movie over the weekend is fine ... but don't try to market that garbage!
