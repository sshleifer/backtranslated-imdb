In reality, this film, made in 1999, has rather good production values. The actors are attractive and reasonably talented. There are not a group of clowns who go around shooting away, spending hundreds of shots, but without ever hitting the meat. Nor are there chases / accidents in wild cars where thousands of dollars of beautiful cars are uselessly thrown away. <br /> <br /> The interiors look respectably modern, architecturally, and the equipment looks to tobacco. Well, there's that high-tech computer room furnished with what looks like a leftover from an electronics lab from the 1950s. And the corpse pancake trick broke me. It's not a pancake trick in the conventional sense, but what looks like a dried pancake batter expands on their exposed skin. This should support the idea that bodies have calcified - although the way the virus would perform this transmutation is an exercise left to the student (viewer). <br /> <br /> Ah yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the worst premise ever for a science fiction horror film I know, but I can't. A computer virus that is transmitted through a television screen (or computer monitor) and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? Give me a break. Warp drives a "Star Trek" are one thing, but photons become viruses? This is so stupid that the desired "fear factor" is not achievable. The film could have used one of those horrible dream sequences in which the dead come alive, or get a cat out of the closet, or something like that, because the viral thingamajig doesn't. <br /> <br /> It is assumed that Robert Wagner has the same excuse to play in this unanimity that Lord Oliver has given for some of his later places and trash. He needed money. No other comparison between the two should be interpreted, however.
