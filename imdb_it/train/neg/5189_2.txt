This series would have been much better if they had just done one simple thing: Made Ian McShane Code name: Diamond Head instead of Code Name: Tree. Diamond Head, the character needs someone who can handle the role of the lovable rogue, which McShane has shown he can do with the Lovejoy series. Roy Thinnes, the current Diamond Head, is really so-so only in the role. McShane is not as good as the bad tree. France The character of Nuyen, Tso-Tsing, does not seem able to decide if she is the unfortunate victim or the hard woman ready to fight. Eventually he earned his pay when he had to play the role of Diamond Head lover. After watching an episode or two, I ended up not worrying about what happened to anyone. Tree gives us a lot to hate him, but Diamond Head gives us nothing to please him. Unfortunately, the genre of espionage in the 1970s was not exactly like in the 1960s.
