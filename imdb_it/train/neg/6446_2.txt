Western society has had ideas about India as a poor country. Movies like these only make those beliefs stronger. Such illustrations make it even more difficult for Indians to be accepted abroad. Okay, there are poor and homeless people in India, but because there is no representation of educated, if not successful, people. <br /> <br /> I totally hate the idea of ​​the film portraying Patrick Swayze as another Teressa Mother. In my opinion this film showed India in a bad light giving wrong notions. It is unfair to discuss only one aspect of society. Exactly why people ask me, "When we go to India, can we hire an elephant right outside the airport, so we don't have to walk on the streets so full of filth and snakes?" <br /> <br /> Those who want a second opinion on contemporary Indian society should look at "Marriage Monsoon".
