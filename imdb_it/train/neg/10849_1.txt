Normally when I raid the local Hollywood Video I head to the B-Horror movies. For me the basic principles of a B-Horror film are the value of the field, Heavy Gore, a lot of useless nudity and special effects that anyone can put together with a package of corn syrup and latex. I rented Cradle of Fear because I've been a fan of the band since they released their first demo in 1995. The film started out on an interesting note and then when I saw Dani Filth stepping on an extremely obvious RICE latex mask. When I saw the lesbian sex scene for the sake of a lesbian sex scene, I laughed even harder. I spent more or less the whole film laughing and when I wasn't laughing it shook my head thinking about how a multimillionaire rock star would have wanted to make a film that seemed to be on a budget of hundreds of dollars. The central point of this film seemed to attract the "Hardcore Goth boys who think that death, destruction, sex, blood and Satan are the greatest things invented by Lava Lamps. It was really so. For me this movie seemed 80.5% of the things that happened in this film happened only because of being Satanic. This film had great potential and could have been a really good movie, but in the end this "movie" is really just an extensive Cradle video of Filth.
