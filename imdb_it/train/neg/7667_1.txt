The definition of an abomination as defined by Webster's Dictioary is "a cause of aversion or disgust". If anyone can think of a word or definition more appropriate than this for Alone in the Dark, please let me know because this is the best I can invent. However, I don't think that in any case this word describes how terrible this film really is. <br /> <br /> I went to watch this movie with two of my roommates. One has tastes very similar to me, the other is an action / adventure guru. The latter boy usually does not care about the size of the holes in the plot, as long as the film contains many explosions that will go away satisfied. <br /> <br /> Having said that we entered the theater for the Friday viewing of Alone in the Dark. To my surprise we were the only people in the theater. When it started, I knew why immediately. <br /> <br /> It starts with the worst opening scene of every movie, and unfortunately I have to admit that from there it only gets worse worse. The opening scene is a 5-minute scrolling text that is narrated. Still, I understand why it was narrated. The director must have realized that only illiterate people would also have found the thought of paying to watch this film. However, not only is this first scene the longest scrolling text in the history of cinema, but it makes no sense. It seems as if in the same sequence we heard about completely separate films. One speaks of an ancient civilization and its tampering with a portal, the other speaks of a mad scientist and his experiments on orphans. If you are reading this and are confused, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> So they start the plot, the acting, the effects and the work with the camera. Tara Reid is horrendous as an actress. It doesn't do anything even for a second, it makes you think it's a museum curator. Slater is just bad, unconvincing, and has no connection with Reid. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably the worst thing ever created by man. All the while my roommate and similar tastes are asking questions like: What is this? And what's going on? In addition to this sliding garbage we have some sequences narrated by Slater himself. Are good? NO. Do they explain anything? NO. At any time the public has the slightest suspicion as to why we should worry about what happens? Once again, NO. <br /> <br /> Then we have a random sex scene. We are told that Slater and Reid are together, but at no time do they act as if they were worried about another. But then BAM ... sex scene. Once again I don't know. <br /> <br /> A good, oh I don't know, 30 seconds after that painful scene ends, we have a gunfight with about 20 soldiers and a similar number of alien things. This is set on a heavy-metal track and causes more brain hemorrhage than is thought possible. <br /> <br /> And if that's not enough ... <br /> <br /> There is no rascal. There is the scientist and there are "alien" things. At one point the scientist controls alien things and stands on a hill, ordering them to attack the military outpost. Why? How did he become the supreme commander of these things? Why do they listen to it? Once again I have no idea. <br /> <br /> The film ends with Slater and Reid walking in an evacuated city. Why was the city evacuated? Have alien things gone? Did the army tell them? Who knows ... and at this point who cares? I didn't do it and you won't. <br /> <br /> But to finish, Slater and Reid are attacked by an alien thing. Although it has been claimed that alien things will be killed by exposure to sunlight. And that's right, you guessed it, it's the middle of the day * and% $ ing and it's as bright as it can be. Maybe the alien thing bought a pair of sunglasses, I don't know and I don't care. <br /> <br /> Now, after the film is finished, I ran out of the theater, 6 feet 6 inches from me, waving my arms and shaking my afro telling everyone not to go see this movie. Even my gung-ho action / adventure roommate (who would consider a movie that just cut and pasted 2 hours of blast into 1 movie to be the biggest thing ever created) admitted that the holes in the plot were very obvious in this movie . <br /> <br /> To summarize this CRAP-FEST I give it a 0.0 / 10 and I would give it lower if I could. <br /> <br /> Unequivocally, the worst movie ever made. I would not want this film on my worst enemy.
