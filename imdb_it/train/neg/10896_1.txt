I know you've read it before, on countless other films no doubt if you're reading the comments here, but the voodoo academy is still the worst movie ever that was able to track down. undoubtedly the worst ones are not even available to buy or watch TV, but even so I think it right to qualify that I am not just a stupid tenant who has chosen badly. <br /> <br /> I've seen two thirds of the 100 films ranked below here on imdb, and I'm doing the ticking of the rest with every chance. most of these are head and shoulders above this ... excersize in absolute monotony. <br /> <br /> I like to evaluate really bad movies (like in those without humor even because they are bad) by how many people you have to watch to complete it. if you can watch it alone, it's not so bad. if you can watch it with just one friend ... it's bad, but it could be much worse. <br /> <br /> It took 5 of us to get to the Voodoo Academy. and not even the usually fun moments of watching bad movies (picking out the boom mic for example, 3 times in this if I'm not mistaken) could take away the dry taste in the mouth. yes I had looked at it, but I had also forced 4 of my friends to look at it with me to reach that end. <br /> <br /> I hope and pray that we have seen the administrators cut ... to think that there could be a version with 20 minutes more than big brow protrusions with oil glands for children who rub their torsos. It scares me just. most of the film revolves around this. <br /> <br /> I applaud David Decoteau for managing this film in two days on a limited budget, just as I applaud him to convince people to pay him to do what is undoubtedly a celluloid version of some of his fetishes. but it's not a good movie. the original store of horrors was shot in the same period of time for a comparable amount of money (considering inflation) and was a real gem. it's not an excuse for how bad this child is. <br /> <br /> spoilers forward ... <br /> <br /> it is not even worth finding out the holes in the plot or the clich√© all hero characters know ... the rhythm of the film ... it's crazy ... nothing ... it's interesting for the period of time that the decoteau dedicates to the breast massaging car. no matter what your alignment or gender ... rubbing cannot sustain that kind of time on the screen. <br /> <br /> acting is cheese ... but not overly amateur ... I've seen much worse in better films ... but somehow it's the semi-competent delivery of some of the worst lines you have never heard in a movie, which really scratches. <br /> <br /> rent this if, like me, you have a fascination with the worst of the worst, and only if you look at it with a group of people who are ready to work to overcome it. this is no ha ha has the shaky deal. it's a resistance test that you'd probably like to skip. <br /> <br /> I'm sure it's worse ... but I wouldn't be surprised if it had the name of the decoteau on it.
