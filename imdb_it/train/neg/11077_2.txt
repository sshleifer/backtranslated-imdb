The only reason I chose to shoot this film was the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. All I can say is that it was the biggest waste of a good actor ever filmed. As far as I could tell, Borgnine was the ONLY actor in it. The other performances were so uniformly terrible, I'm amazed that a studio actually paid the "performers" to appear. Combine this level of talent in the acting department with such a weak and insipid story that I thought my eyes would start bleeding when the credits rolled up, and you have a perfect cinematic disaster. Obviously the film was made to attract an audience of children and, to its credit, it was better than most of the original Disney Channel programming and similar networks focused on children. But honestly, this is not saying much.
