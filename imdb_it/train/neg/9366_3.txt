I rented the Hybrid over the weekend. What a disappointment! A stupid limping attempt in a tele-film. The boy they took for the command was totally weak and when he ran {he did it very much} he seemed to be eating those mint sweets ... with his backside! The contacts between the wolves he wore were great, although I feel that the actor relied too much on them, since there was nothing threatening in his acting. The wise native American Indian chick must be one of the most suffering hags ever faced. Talk about a sour cow! He smiled once for the whole movie, and I think it's because he had sex. Even the sex scene was lame. They might even have shown you blowing the curtains if you can dig. <br /> <br /> Finally, and this is my great hatred for my animals, on the cover and on the DVD menu, the losers have digitally drawn sharp teeth on the boy. Not seen anywhere in the film. :(
