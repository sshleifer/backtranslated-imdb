... and I've seen ugly ones. <br /> <br /> I have nothing good to say about this movie. The acting is poor by Jennifer Tilly - as to be expected. Daryl Hannah does an OK job, but nothing is close to being able to save this movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in this film is that the plot is so weak - though based on a good premise - that the writer uses the "stupid heroin trick" to create a forced suspense. When all that Daryl Hannah should do is hide, she runs out in front of her pursuer. The hospital scene is absurd. Without exposing too much of what passes for a plot, I think it would be difficult for a minute bloody woman to carry a pregnancy from a hospital without being noticed. Boring. Very lousy. <br /> <br /> Save time and choose another movie.
