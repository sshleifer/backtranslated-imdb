The cast is OK. Sometimes the script is uncomfortable and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the film is. I found myself looking forward to doing the dishes. Shehan's piece is a poor declaration of war. I guess we shouldn't notice ... we did it. It's a house, you've done nothing but kill forty-five minutes. The shower part ... eh? What was it? Literally, I have a customer, "Ok you can use our shower." Yawn. The corners are looking for a difficult way. There was a series of woods, suddenly it disappeared because it is possible to see it through, then later it is deep and the animals die. In the end this is a horrendous film of boring proportions.
