I was asked to watch the movie for my work, so I didn't pay for it (on the contrary, I was paid), but I still found the film to suck a lot more than average. The jokes were lame, the two main actresses ... well, to use the "First wives club" division of women in Hollywood, they are no longer in their "hot chick" but more in their "district proxy". What angered me most about the film was the main plot, which practically completely plagiarized "Beavis & Butthead Do America" ​​(in which the guys are all excited about a guy who gives them money to "do the wife ", without realizing it is expected to kill her. All in all, a bland piece of shit.
