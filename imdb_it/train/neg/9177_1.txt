The House of the Dead was the worst movie I've ever seen, and between the pathetic 'matrix' 360 shooting attempts with the camera and the bad acting I fell asleep. I don't think the director and the set manager could decide whether it rained or not, because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not on the other. I would say that this film is a 1 in 10 (10 is the best, 1 is the worst). Even skipping the scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying, it makes you think if they were just catching up on lost time. Please anyone who reads this, NOT TO SEE IT. It's not worth it.
