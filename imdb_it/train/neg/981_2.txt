As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I had to (finally) see this very, very boring image. It's Miss Dietrich's first color film, and the most beautiful blonde in the world is a redhead! Bad start The story is terribly boring, involving a subject who bores me in a boring way: religious guilt. (Who needs it ???) Suffice it to say, perhaps, that of all Dietrich's films (and I've seen more, including "Pittsburgh") this is the only one where even his performance isn't worth it to watch. Color photography is OK (this is a very recent version of Technicolor), but without purpose. Ridiculous casting: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (enough said?). The only thing of any interest is John Carradine's extravagant caricature of a performance like "The Sand Diviner", which predicts everything that will happen. The alleged "happy end" is one of the most depressing ever conceived. Yet another example of the highly inflated reputation of David O. Selznick (has he ever made a really good film? - other than That?) And, for one last annoyance, the soundtrack of the MGM DVD is a disaster, with the levels of apparently randomized volume. Highly discouraged.
