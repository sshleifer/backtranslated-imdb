I feel like I've just seen a snuff movie ... a beautifully acted, tense, compelling and horrible thing! A litany of two hours of perversion in the most basic and comprehensive sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, beheading, incest, corruption, burial, abuse, abuse, abuse. No redemption whatsoever. And I entertained myself. I couldn't stop watching. What does it say about me, the people who do and act in this kind of thing, and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real tobacco films will be the norm. And I am neither puritanical nor lacking in a sense of humor, I do not try to hide from the existence of darkness and I certainly did not lead a protected life, but I am ashamed of myself. And I'm sorry to see my English cousins ​​drag the sewers of the material just like my tribe does. Doesn't it have to be welcoming, but must bask in vicarious sadism?
