I have seen many Seagal movies, and while most are not exceptional, or even good, this pile of steam has lowered the level for bad movies. <br /> <br /> The plot: I'm not sure. Something about a drug that makes you all crazy and strong or something. Who are the good guys and the bad guys? Hard to say. Most of the film is cut scenes that go back and forth between people in dark rooms complaining about how good the character of Seagals "Mashall" is. <br /> <br /> Acting: Blows. <br /> <br /> Duplication of the item ,,,,,, What was with the horrible overdubbing voice ?! Could they find someone who looked less like Seagal? It could also have been Cheech or Chong who did the voiceover, he could at least have fun then. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring and completely stupid. Avoid it at all costs !!!!
