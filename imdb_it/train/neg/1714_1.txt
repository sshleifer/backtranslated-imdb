Once again a classic film has been uselessly redone with predictably disastrous results. The title is false, like everything related to this film. The period is not made persuasively, and the tracks seem too young and too vapid to be criminals too. Arthur Penn's film had style, humor, a point of view and was made by talented people. Even if the 1967 version did not exist, this would still be an unnecessary film. The 1967 version escaped the facts, presented a glamorous version of Bonnie and Clyde, but was exciting and innovative for 1967, and had some exceptional performances that allowed you to be interested. This 1992 remake seems to have been selected from the original film rather than the truth, and the actors in this version are callows, unattractive and no less interesting. By all means skip this and I hope the 2010 version will be better. It could be worse?
