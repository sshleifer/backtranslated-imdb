I read all the Love Come Softly books. Knowing perfectly that films cannot use all aspects of the book, but in general have at least the main point of the book. I was very disappointed with this movie. The only thing they have in this film that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although both parents come in the book). That's all. The plot was so distorted and backward and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I hadn't read the book, it was too sad. I know that Pioneer life was hard, but the whole movie was a downer. The score is to have the same family orientation as the movie that makes them great.
