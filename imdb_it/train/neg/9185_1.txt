WOW! I didn't know anyone would make this movie! it's horrible! I wrote 5 things that can tell you why you don't want to see this movie. <br /> <br /> number 1: "is the largest rave ever" where is the rave? I could only see some people dancing around. <br /> <br /> 2. when I'm galloping, they can ONLY see blood everywhere, no people, two ruined tents and a stage ... and what do they do !? drink! <br /> <br /> 3. The worst actors I've ever seen! the captain and his crew .. horrible! <br /> <br /> 4. When one of the people is firing a normal gun, he shoots almost 30 times without reloading! <br /> <br /> 5. I didn't know that every person in the world could fight as a professional! it must be something new .. <br /> <br /> I wonder what the producer was thinking! "this will be a great success, it will be a classic" .. sure that you are stupid in any case not to see this film, it is a circle of time. MY EYES ARE STILL OUT!
