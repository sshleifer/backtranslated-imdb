The fatal error of the orders - in addition to a donkey plot - is that the character simply does not resound or even react. <br /> <br /> Two examples: a priest, walking through a cemetery at night, is suddenly attacked by ghosts spirits. After fighting them, he quietly resumed his walk when his friend approaches. "Something wrong?" His friend asks, having seen the attack. "Just some demonic spirits, nothing I couldn't stand." No reaction, no surprise, just as if he had changed a tire. His friend is equally indifferent ... it must be a normal priestly training ... ["And then you put the host in your mouth. Any question? Ok, let's go ahead, the attacks of Demon Spirit ..."] <br /> <br /> Example two: at a certain point the priests need an answer to a question, and only a demon (or something that now matters) could provide it. Such as? Why, you have to ask a dying person! So the demon has a random person hanging in front of the two priests so that they can ask their question to the man who is breathless. "Hey, don't kill him!" or maybe "It's not nice!" it would have been more realistic than their answer. They never ask that they let the man go, or rather, the closest reaction is a slight annoyance. They ask their question and they go. <br /> <br /> I had to turn it off at that point - my brain was starting to atrophy. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br /> * / **** (one in four stars) <br /> <br />
