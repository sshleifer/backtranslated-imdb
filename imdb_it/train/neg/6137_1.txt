Damn. What can you say about Gymkata that hasn't already done so? This is nothing but pure halarity from beginning to end. If you want a movie that makes you laugh, this is the perfect movie to get. From Cabot's combo mullet to Parmistan (and there are four billion assorted ninjas), everything about this movie smells like shit. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Clouse, the infamous mind that brought you the mirror scene in the game of Bruce Lee's death, once again demonstrates his total lack of directing talent. A few other faces that you probably won't recognize will also appear for your enjoyment, from Buck Kartalian to Tadashi Yamashita, even if you don't remember or care about them after the movie is finished. <br /> <br /> Apparently based on a book called "The Terrible Game", which, if I could find a trace of its existence anywhere, I would be interested in reading it, to see where this thing went wrong. Instead, the book is apparently a figment of Gymkata's imagination. Probably something Clouse invented to sell his lame idea. <br /> <br /> Choose this and Yakmallah for you. It's easily one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and that's quite a lot.
