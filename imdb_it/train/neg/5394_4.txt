Shakespeare's modern adaptations irritate me when the director fails to decide whether to use the original or update it. If you use the original words in an updated setting, this is particularly difficult if set in the 20th or 21st century, although it may work correctly in the styles of the period, for example the Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night is set in Victorian times so very effective. It could work with the setting of the 1930s if only there was much less than singing and dancing and much more than Shakespeare's text. Unfortunately, it ends up being a rather banal, though very pleasant, show. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree that he is too old to play one of the students but, more importantly, he is such a Shakespearean actor that despite all his efforts to be just another student, his acting strength shows all the time. Obviously he should have played the King - no problem in having a mature student King surrounded by younger students. Instead, we had a pleasant but unattractive actor for the king, so a so-called King with no attributes. <br /> <br /> The amount of songs and dances, which I found boring despite the beautiful songs and pretty pleasant dances, unfortunately meant that the great Shakespearean dialogue had to be drastically demolished. So it all ends with a trivial and light package, and I got very bored, even with the comedy rounds, and I was happy when it ended. Branagh has not done justice to Shakespeare in this production. <br /> <br /> It still recognizes Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, absolutely gorgeous as the older couple.
