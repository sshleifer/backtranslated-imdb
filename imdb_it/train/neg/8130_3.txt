While exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor is bitten by a bat that causes some alarming side effects ... <br /> <br /> Occasionally the eerie atmosphere and some decent makeup effects ( even if under-utilized) they do not save this B horror film from being a sub-par parody of man-becomes-creature. The bat aka It Lives By Night suffers from its nonsensical story that is awkwardly drawn and lackluster in rhythm. The plot never seems to go very far and the film never offers an explanation for what happens, or even a satisfactory conclusion to all of this. The cast is pretty mediocre in their performances. <br /> <br /> However, I attribute some points to the film for its disturbing theme song and beautiful shooting locations. Even the trick of the late Stan Winston is pretty good, but there's not much of a storefront here. A missed opportunity for sure. <br /> <br /> Surely one of the minor characters of the human being comes out. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on ****
