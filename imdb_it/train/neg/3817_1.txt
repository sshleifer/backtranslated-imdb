Seriously. This is one of the most stupid family shows of all time. <br /> <br /> Plot - A motherless family and 3 "dads" raise 3 girls in San Francisco, California. <br /> <br /> Characters- Neat freak Danny, cartoon that loves Joey, Jesse-obsessed hair, spoiled brat Michelle, stupid DJ and almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this show really want you to hate the characters, right? <br /> <br /> Therefore, I don't think anyone should watch this show. I just chuckled at times throughout the whole show, and I think that instead of a lethal injection, all the criminals should be forced to watch this show, a torture far worse than anything else. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 or: D
