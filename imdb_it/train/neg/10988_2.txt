If I had never read the book, I would have said it was a good movie. BUT I read the book. Who ever made the screen ruined the plot. There are so many changes, which is not really worthy of the title. Character changes, plot changes, changes in the time line ... <br /> <br /> First of all, who was Henry and the investigator? They were not in history. Henry had a bit of a Mitch character, but Mitch wasn't a cop. No, you did it so that Roz helped "sink" his body and used it as blackmail from Zenia against Roz. The real so-called blackmail was that Roz thought Zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to walk away from him. His son had also been blackmailed because he was hiding from his mother. His son was not even mentioned in history. I don't think he was his lover, Roz's secretary either. <br /> <br /> Tony and West were not together at the beginning. He was actually with Zenia before during college. The apartment painted black was their idea, Tony only went to visit. This is where Zenia and Tony meet, they become fast friends. Tony hides his love for the West. So Zenia left the west, with cash from Tony, then West and Tony got together. Eventually marrying, at one point, West leaves Tony for Zenia again for a short time. Just to break the heart. So go back to Tony. Zenia's blackmail for Tony was that Tony had written a test for Zenia. Now being a college professor, he didn't want to let it out. I will say that the character who played Tony did it wonderfully. <br /> <br /> The character of Charis was a blond, not that it was really important. Zenia didn't deceive her to get cancer while Augusta was alive. No, she was there when Charis had a lover named Billy. Augusta's father was a stranger to the Vietnam War. In the end, after Charis takes care of Zenia for months, what was actually a drug withdrawal. Zenia and Billy have an affair right under Charis's nose as they take care of both. So Zenia turns to the government for Billy and departs by ferry. Not with Augusta, Charis was pregnant with her tho. Even Charis had a double personality, Karen was her real name. <br /> <br /> Zenia didn't die from being cut into a piece ... she fell or maybe she was pushed (we never knew it) from the balcony and landed in a fountain. She had an almost pure degree of heroin in her blood and it was probable that she took some of it without knowing and fell while she hated. She too was really dying of cancer this time. <br /> <br /> It showed none of childhood memories or anything that made the characters dear to the reader. The book was striped to its bare bones. Then reworked in someone else's vision. Because you couldn't just write your story along the lines of what you did the movie. It was quite different, and I'm sure more could have been done.
