Bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (like Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money they travel. Their lives become more exciting when they begin relationships with the exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and the lonely Percy Marmont (for Mrs. Barry). But they remain boring as before. The director, perhaps bored, Alfred Hitchcock, tries to revive the well-pitched (as quoted in the film, taken from "The Tempest" by Shakespeare) "Rich and Strange" ordering some photographic make-up. An inaugural tribute to "The Crowd" by King Vidor is the highlight. The low point could be the couple dining on the prepared Chinese cat. <br /> <br /> *** Rich and Strange (10/12/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph
