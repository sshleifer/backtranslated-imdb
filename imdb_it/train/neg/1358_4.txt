The words "Swedish" and "action film" do not mix. This becomes increasingly evident with every attempt made in the genre. This is another failed attempt. <br /> <br /> Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) works at a military air base with top secret computer systems. One day foreign criminals threaten to harm his family if he doesn't do what they say. They want the secret equipment and will do anything to get it. <br /> <br /> This film has its ups and downs. And usually in Swedish action movies there are no "ups", just "down". So I guess something in this movie showed some quality. To start with the positive remarks I can mention that the film is technically well done. The shots of flying planes and helicopters are well shot and look very beautiful. The acting is of very variable quality. Shanti Roney does a decent performance while Maria Bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual (I wonder how long Swedish directors will continue to use her even if she has the acting skills of a wooden board?) Stefan Sauk is ridiculous as the "cool" special forces man who comes to investigate. <br /> <br /> And what about the action scenes? Well as I said above the scenes of airplanes and helicopters in flight are beautiful. But apart from that there isn't much action to talk about. And this is a common problem with Swedish action films. There is not enough action going on. Maybe it's a budget problem, maybe it's the film culture. I don't know, but it negatively affects the experience. Because frankly, the story and acting are not good enough to make this movie rely on that alone. <br /> <br /> I consider this 4/10 for the effort.
