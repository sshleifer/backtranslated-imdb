I'm starting to write this review during a break while watching the movie. It is the first time I try, but I have difficulty overcoming this without occasional interruptions. It's not because it's intense, but because it's ugly. <br /> <br /> It's almost painfully boring and unbelievable, especially when the supernaturally dying brother Ryan (Colm Feore) is on the screen being tragic and asshole, self-indulgent and self-pitying. This would have been a much better film if they had left that character out of the story. <br /> <br /> It adds nothing but makkish, maudlin, very irritating melodrama. Maybe someone decided that if they couldn't make Ryan credible they would only make him hateful. The problem is: who cares if a spoiled, whining and hateful jerk is dying? Not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing this character has for him is the fact that he's dying, and sorry, but it's not enough. Dying does not make anyone special. We are all dying, sooner or later. It does not give anyone the right to expect compassion while acting like an asshole. <br /> <br /> The other two characters, and the actors who play them (David Cubitt in the role of Theo and Chandra West in the role of Sarah), are much more interesting, and their story, without the self-relaxing interruptions of Ryan, it would have made a movie a lot better. But it's not over yet, and it's time to hit PLAY again. Perhaps something exceptional happens before the end .... <br /> <br /> No. Sorry. This rented turkey goes up tonight!
