Let's start with simple lines. On the viewer's side, there are a couple of good "director's details", some viewpoints on the movie scenes that are cute. The special effects are pretty good too, a good acting / good scenario. But the story is too simple. It shows how a unit of elite army bombs lives, acts and sometimes dies. Show the drama of living in war. In my cinematic experience as a boy "dependent" on the serious action film, I missed that click that keeps my eyes and mind locked on the screen. One of the things that must be present in a film to consider it good is the ability to immerse the viewer in the reality and time of the film. It didn't happen to me. I was "conscious" for the whole film. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think this film has earned its place in the fame based on the "subconscious" charm of American patriotism, a healthy and genuine feeling, but not the proper use as a generator of cinematographic fame. More than a film about war, its popularity grows based on this. <br /> <br /> A simple thought: if it were a WWII movie, only the time that changed, with everything still remained, would it have been rewarded? Surely not. Why? Because there are big ones that raise the bar level upwards. <br /> <br /> Compared to its rivals at the Oscars, I do not believe that all the prizes it has won are correctly awarded.
