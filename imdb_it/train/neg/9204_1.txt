I've seen this movie many times (and I recently read the book the film is based on) and every time I see it, I just want to slap all four of them. The fact that they do not indicate the fact that the character of Tom Hank is flipping through his D & D character (oops M & M) :) ("Oh, play in character.") Outside the game session. This is the fact that after three months of therapy, we destroy everything and feed its disappointments! This kind of people is what gives RPGs a bad name. <br /> <br /> Even the "ballad of love", and the music made by "cat on a piano" and "stop us if we become boring" are almost enough to put our teeth in balance!
