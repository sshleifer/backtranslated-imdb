Ok, where to start with this little gem? Mutant snails begin to take control of a small New England town (?). Only one man can stop them ... and that man ... is Mike Brady! Now, if it wasn't ridiculous enough, stay tuned. <br /> <br /> The video of the snails is what is known as archive material. No matter who the snails are attacking or where they are, the same blow is shown as piles of snails dripping everywhere. Keep in mind that this unique shot takes up at least half of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film has been knocked down, dragged out, stolen the wallet, hit your girlfriend, kill your dog, BAD. I'm sure it gets worse, but it will be difficult for you to find it. The only jewel was ... you guessed it ... MIKE BRADY! He must have taken some evening classes at the YMCA, because he was the best in the group. <br /> <br /> What about horror? This film should not be taken seriously. There is no horror! They are snails for crying out loud. The entire nascent action could have been avoided with a saltcellar or two. Just watch this movie in an MST3K type environment, otherwise I can see some major brain damage.
