There is absolutely no reason to waste time with this "movie". The original said it all and continues to resist. Either read the book or do some research on the story, and you will realize that this remake is ridiculous. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? His sister could have done a better job! Having been to Holcomb & Edgerton, KS where the story takes place, the sets and locations hardly resembled Kansas. The original is compelling, from the filming of the place to the use of the actual participants, to the weapons and objects of the victims. Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Soundtrack by Quincy Jones and cinematography by Conrad Hall ... The original is now available on DVD in widescreen format. Let this turkey die quickly.
