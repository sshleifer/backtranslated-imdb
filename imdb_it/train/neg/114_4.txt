It's not the cast. A more refined group of actors that you could not find. It is not the environment. The director is in love with New York, and at the end of the film, so are we! Woody Allen could not improve on what Bogdonovich did here. If you fall in love or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the film is the script. There is nobody. Actors fall in love at first sight, words are not necessary. In the same experience as the director in Hollywood is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is a reality for him and his peers, but it is a fantasy for many of us in the real world. So, in the end, the film is empty, superficial and without messages.
