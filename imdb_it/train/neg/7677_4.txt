I stopped looking lost in this episode because I thought that the deaths of Ana Lucia and Libby were useless and really depressing. Then I found out that they kept Libby around just to die in the next episode! Gah! I can't handle it. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this show for the first season, but it definitely fell in the second season, I found Jack and Locke's little religious feud to be annoying. The death of the characters of Rodriguez and Watros was the last straw! <br /> <br /> Giving this episode a 4/10, to be the end of my vision of this previously great series created by the legend of Alias ​​J.J. Abrams. I hope his series will improve on this in the future.
