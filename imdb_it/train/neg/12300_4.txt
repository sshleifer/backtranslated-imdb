There are many different versions of this float, so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies, otherwise some gore and a nudity scene may be missing. Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. The cut I saw has the title on the screen WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show, which retains the original WITCHERY title for DVD release. It's a nice print and seems to have the whole movie, but it has some clipping / appearance problems. In Italy, it was released as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT). The first two releases of LA CASA were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films (re-titled) and the third LA CASA was another film from the same production company (Filmirage), which is better known here in America as Ghosthouse. To make things even more confusing, WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2. Except in Germany, where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE: DEMONS 3. OK, it's better to shut up now. I'm starting to get confused! <br /> <br /> Regardless of the title, this is a very good horror effort. Some are good, some are not. Actually I was in this movie for the first half or so, but towards the end it became a senseless disaster. A large vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting, as several people are picked up one by one by a German-speaking witch (Hildegard Knef). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to capture "Witch Light", and his virginal girlfriend (Leslie Cumming), who is studying witchcraft, are approaching the hotel without permission. The real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth) also arrives, who is showing off the property to potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks. Even the tagged are their children; her pregnant daughter, Jane (Linda Blair) and her young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), in addition to the excessive architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff's wife at the time). Once everyone is inside, their driver is killed (hung up) and the boat disappears, so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of "Lady in Black". <br /> <br /> So what can you expect to find here? A lot of unpleasant! One of the characters has his lips sewn up and hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally roasted slowly from the rest of the cast. There is also a crucifixion, witches eating a dead child, a swordfish on their head, someone set on fire, a possession, a Sesame Street recorder, the virgin being raped by some demon, the veins of a boy who is they swell and explode thanks to a voodoo doll and some other things. From a technical point of view, it is a good-looking film with good cinematography, a decent score and good gore effects. Even the hotel / island setting is nice. Blair (especially in the end) and Ross both seem to be enjoying themselves and Knef is as big as the evil witch. Although people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days, it's not bad in his role either. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, despite all the blood, the film seems a bit boring and becomes monotonous after about an hour. Even the supernatural themes are confused and confused. When the characters are dragged into the witches' lair to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers decided to superimpose the screaming actors on a whirling spiraling red spiral that looks extremely cheap. And the witches' den itself is empty and designed at low cost with rough wood. And while most of the cast is at least decent, some of the performances (especially the "actress" who plays Hasselhoff's girlfriend and boyfriend) are so bad that they are constantly distracting.
