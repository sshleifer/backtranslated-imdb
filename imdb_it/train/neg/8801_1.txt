Prepared together from dead body parts (erased scenes) by corpses (Anchorman), Frankenstein's Monster (Wake Up, Ron Burgundy) is definitely not a show for irritated eyes (something you would never want to see twice ... .. perhaps only once for that subject.) <br /> <br /> Very often - the relativity of the scenes in WURB is made relevant by a third-person narrator. Even more worrying is that the WURB characters are not consistent with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of Anchorman (in the initial narrative we are told that WURB takes place shortly after the original). At the end of Anchorman, Burgundy had grown from the beginning of the film and embraced with a co-host / hybrid lover. In this film, he returned to his sulky immature with phone jokes to Veronica (quite clearly these are the most scenes of the same Anchorman inserted in WURB.) <br /> <br /> The part that makes this a film, a story in Continuous evolution, involves a clan that destroys the bank without a cause called Alarm. These scenes are almost painful to sit on. This part was discarded from Anchorman's original screenplays. <br /> <br /> Most of the other scenes involving our Channel 4 news team are clearly alternate / deleted scenes on Anchorman. They go to the same party as the original, the same original "group drinking to have a woman on the team" scene, and the same segment of cat fashion shows that Veronica had objections to report. <br /> <br /> Burgundy recreates their first date with the drive-in place overlooking San Diego and dinner at his favorite club, Tinos. Neither character mentions the fact that they were at the drive-in spot before and when Burgundy enters Tinos with Veronica, he presents it to her as if they had never been before. Oh, and they wear the same clothes as the original date. <br /> <br /> However, I have to give a little credit to the directors, even if WURB is nothing but a clever way of presenting deleted scenes tied together with narration. Between the two stories by Ron Burgundy - this is the weakest. In retrospect, it is a real undertaking for Anchorman to have risen from WURB's ashes. You remain elegant, IMDb. Thanks for stopping by.
