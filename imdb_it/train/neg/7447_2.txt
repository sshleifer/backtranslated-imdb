I first read "Lorna Doone" about 20 years ago and I loved it! It is a classic historical novel set in the 1600s, when the western country was several days away from London and law and order were much more difficult to enforce. Unfortunately, this version of the book takes a lot of freedom with history and has been incredibly disappointing in my opinion. The acting and production values ​​are OK, but the way the plot was messed up was terrible. Why do TV adaptations do this? Why should they think that the thousands of fans of a book would like them to change the story ??? One of the great mysteries of life !!! The BBC has made an excellent version broadcast at Christmas in the early 1990s, which I'm still trying to track down a copy of! Follow my advice, read the book and don't worry about this insignificant version!
