I'm a big fan of Ted V Mikels and the original "Corpse Grinders" is the main reason why this is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. Even the brilliant casting of the legendary Liz Renay ("Desperate Living") could not save this useless piece of trash. This film should serve as a lesson to all past, present and future directors ... when you have a hit movie like the original "Corpse Grinders" you should probably leave lies to the sleeping dogs and you should definitely not try to revitalize it more than twenty years later (unless you have the financial support for a higher level sequel as Herschel Gordon Lewis did with "Blood Feast 2: All U can Eat"). Even if you decide to do it you should probably spend a little more money from the ones you made on the original and for god's sake ... NEVER film a movie on video ... because film producers even try to do it when everyone knows that quality is about to become horrible ... I personally still have to see a movie made this way that it is also worth sending it to hell ... if you can't afford to make a sequel that is better than your original film, sell the movie rights to someone who can you know ... and what did Ted V Mikels think (or he smoked) when he wrote this wful script-god? I mean let's go, dog and cat "aliens" from another planet? A painted cardboard box to look like a devastating machine capable of grinding human bodies ... bones and clothes and everything else? If any of these actors, apart from Liz Renay, had been paid more than five dollars for their horrible performances, he is severely overpaid! Avoid this movie at all costs and watch the original instead.
