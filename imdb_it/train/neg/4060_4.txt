LE CODE CAT O'NINE (Cat Nine Code) <br /> <br /> Format: 2.35: 1 (Chromoscope) <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br / > (Prints at 35mm and 70mm) <br /> <br /> A former blind journalist (Karl Malden) overhears a plot of blackmail outside a genetic research laboratory and later joins a fellow journalist (James Franciscus ) to investigate a series of murders in the laboratory, involuntarily putting loved ones at the mercy of a psychopathic murderer. <br /> <br /> Rushed into production after the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE (1969), Dario Argento conceived THE CAT O'NINE TAILS as a thriller-yellow more or less like his precursor, famous Hollywood actor Karl Malden - fresh from his appearance in PATTON (1969) - and rising star Franciscus (THE VALLEY OF GWANGI). Unfortunately, the resulting film - which the advertisement claimed was "nine times more suspense" than "Bird" - is a disappointing sequel, impeccably photographed and performed with style, but too tiring and aimless for general consumption. <br /> <br /> Malden and Franciscus are eminently recognizable in comprehensive roles, and filmmaker Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to convey the hi-tech world in which the dark scene unfolds of Argento, but the subplot that involves the European star Catherine Spaak (LA LIBERTINA) as Franciscus' romantic interest is equivalent to little more than useless padding. The highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved murderer in a crowded train station (curated with elegant security by the brave cult movie Franco Fraticelli), and a nightly episode in which Malden and Franciscus seek an important clue within a crumbled tomb and fall prey to the subtle machinations of the killer. But despite these flashes of brilliance, the film turns aimlessly from one scene to another, simmering gently without ever really boiling. Not surprisingly, "Cat" failed to emulate the unstoppable success of "Bird" when it came out in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
