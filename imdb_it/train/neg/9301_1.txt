Forward spoiler if you want to call them ... <br /> <br /> I would almost like to recommend this movie so people can really see a 1/10. Where to start, we will start from the top ... <br /> <br /> THE STORY: Don't believe the premise: the film has nothing to do with abandoned cars and people who finally understand the mysterious events we are. It's a draub, basic, going to the movie in the cabin without intensity or "effort". <br /> <br /> PRODUCERS: I usually credit indie writers, it's hard work when you're starting ... but this is shit. The plot is flat - it leaves the whole movie without emotion. The dialogue is extremely weak and predictable with the lines of "Woah, you have completely frightened me" and "I was wondering if you would ... if you'd like ... eh, will you come to the cabin with me?". It makes me want to tear off all my hair, one strand at a time and feed myself. <br /> <br /> THE CHARACTERS: SANTO CRAP !!!! Some have described the characters as flat, I want to go a step further and say that they actually have a reverse arc. Actually they start working on a parallel universe and almost start to behave backwards ... <br /> <br /> THE ACTORS: The actors are worse than the characters. They already take poor written characters and add the terrible acting in high school. The "Woah you completely frightened me" was said so monotonous and slow - as if he had been stunned. I could only complain for hours with the actors. <br /> <br /> TECHNICIAN: LIGHTING: An eight-year-old child would be disappointed by the lighting of this film. Too dark in the areas, too bleached in the others. The director should not use light as an emotion until he learns how to properly illuminate a basic scene. Little steps! SOUND: How many sound guys does it take to create a really grainy sounding film? 9. With so many sound guys this should sound fantastic but the opposite has happened. There is one scene in particular that really stands out, these guys are driving in a car and the sound of the car changes with every angle of shooting .... WEAK! CAMERA: Learn to use it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm running out of whining space ..... rent it - I dare you ... Rent it and learn from it ... give it a 1 rating..it deserves it. <br /> <br /> Signature ... Amanda Christmas
