15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the shows that engulfed nations, particularly that of young people. When I was a 3-year-old boy living in the Philippines, I watched this show every Friday on ABS-CBN (Channel 2 there). When the film was released in 1995, it was a shock to me when I looked at it with my father and two uncles. My grandparents even sent me a "Balikbayan" box full of Power Rangers material (including the easy-to-build Megazord figure and the Rangers stuffed animals). I even played video games and loved only one ("MMPR: Fighting Edition"), which was REALLY sad. However, it was the show that laid the foundation for my interest in the robot series (especially the anime mech series like "Gundam"). Now that I'm 18, I'd like to think this show is pretty bad for me now. To prove it, I embarked on a journey into oblivion by buying a DVD collection with 2 sets with "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" and I saw both. I was like, "Uh, what a horror, just another stuff in the attic for me." For all of you, people of my generation, this is NOT a show you would like to watch over and over again. I'm not saying leave it for the rest of your life, but sometimes it's not a bad thing, is it? Instead of "Power Rangers", I would recommend something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam" (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (aka Ninja Robots), or even the ORIGINAL Sentai that represented the basis of "Power Rangers".
