First of all there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel, the Apocalypse, Matthew 24, Isaiah and other prophetic scriptures. There is nothing wrong with making a film like this to try to present the message of the Gospel. So my problems with this film are neither in its sincerity nor in its aspirations. As a Christian, albeit amillenialista, I believe that there will be a great tribulation and I believe that Christ will return as he himself said. So, even if I don't agree with this kidnapping movie, that's not why I consider this film so low. <br /> <br /> No, what makes me judge this movie so low is not its sincerity or its message, but rather its lack of production values, horrible script, mediocre acting and pitiful FX. This film is placed down there with some of the most juicy fortifies of the 50s. No, this film is there with Plan 9 From Outerspace. This film failed to age well and was probably dated from the moment they made a sequel. <br /> <br /> Apocalypse film producers may have learned how not to make an end-of-film movie from this, but have failed. The Left Behind series, the Apocalypse series and the Omega Code series failed to learn from this because they faced FX problems and the problem of the dated look, but their scripts are still scarce and their acting is wooden. <br /> <br /> There are great Christian films, with extremely low budgets, but this film is not one of them. I'm surprised the MST3K crew has never exaggerated with this.
