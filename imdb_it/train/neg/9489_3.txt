In theory, movies should be a form of entertainment. While this excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of film production; Most films, especially genre films, must not only tell their story or message, but must in some way entertain the target audience. All this just to say that, in my opinion, a bad movie is not a film with low production values ​​or low budget, a bad film is boring. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" or "Asylum of the Damned" as it is known in the United States, is a bad movie simply because it is not only engaging, and hopelessly boring and boring. Although it has a very good premise, it is only underdeveloped and mediocre acting does not improve things. At one point the film could probably have been a classic b-movie, but here is just a bad attempt to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Director Philip J. Jones tells the story of James Bishop (Matt Stasi), a young resident psychiatrist, who just got his dream job at the St. Andrew Mental Hospital; but the old asylum seems to hide a secret. After the mysterious deaths of some patients and the continuing rumors of satanic practices, James decides to find out what is happening; only to discover the disbelief of his boss, Dr. McCort (Bruce Payne), who believes that Bishop is as crazy as his patients. <br /> <br /> While the premise is quite interesting, the film's execution leaves a lot to be desired. In an attempt to create a supernatural psychological thriller, Jones looks for the easiest way and makes a film full of every cliché of its kind. Of course, there are many great movies that are also full of clichés; but in "Hellborn" each of them is wasted and transformed into an economic jump fright to keep things moving, resulting in a dull and predictable plot. <br /> <br /> The acting is quite mediocre for the most part, with one big exception: Bruce Payne offers high-level performances that make the film unworthy of such good acting. Matt Stasi is very weak because the protagonist and the rest of the cast make forgettable shows. <br /> <br /> Despite all these defects, one thing must be written about "Hellborn"; it has a very good visual aspect for the budget and very similar to the hollywod "horror" productions of today's big budgets. Furthermore, the make-up and prostheses are very well made and the designs for the main antagonist are quite good. Unfortunately, the rest of the special effects are horrible and obsolete, creating a huge contrast to makeup and prosthetics. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" is a film with few supernumerary things with its serious flaws with terrible results. Fans of hardcore horror or b-movies might be interested in its premise, but it's a boring and boring experience. 3/10
