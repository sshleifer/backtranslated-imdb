Friend, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1) Adam Arkin is more whiny than Ross Geller of "Friends" <br /> <br /> 2) A great cast is wasted (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) with this amateur script. <br /> <br /> 3) The film suffers from a horrible rhythm. Jump in a confused and confused way. <br /> <br /> 4) History doesn't even make sense. Why do you want to break the football strip? What about the stupid violin? None of these are explained. <br /> <br /> 5) It's not even funny. It's like a group of accountants trying to do improvisations, saying "Look at me, look at me, it's fun!" This was a bad attempt to do another "Love At First Bite". <br /> <br /> I like the films of Larry Cohen, but the man has failed here. I couldn't wait for the credits to launch. Horribly disappointed.
