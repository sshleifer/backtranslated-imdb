Are there any similarities between "Jindabyne" by Ray Lawrence and his latest film "Lantana" ?? a corpse and its repercussions for already dysfunctional lives. But while "Lantana" offered some hope and resolution, "Jindabyne" leaves everything unsolved in a bleak way that will leave most viewers unsatisfied, perhaps even deceived. <br /> <br /> The plot - the consequences of the discovery of a fisherman of a corpse floating in a remote river - is based on a story by Raymond Carver. It has become an element of Robert Altman's classic 1993 "Short Cuts" ensemble. Lawrence uses this theme for exploration and exposure of relationships within a small, stressed Australian community. The film poses some moral questions "Do you want to let the discovery of a corpse ruin your good weekend?" and more intensely for Australians "Would it make a difference if the deceased was an aborigine?" The acting, in particular by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is commendable. And there are elements of mysticism reinforced by haunting music, not unlike "Picnic at Hanging Rock". <br /> <br /> If all this sounds like the basis for a great movie - being prepared for disappointment, the pace is very slow and the murder is shown near the beginning, thus eliminating the mystery element. And so we stayed with these desolate lives and an empty ending.
