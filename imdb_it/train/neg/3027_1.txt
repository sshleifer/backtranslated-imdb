If it smells like garbage and if it looks like garbage, it must be garbage. This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Tony Scott's poor directing style shames an already uninteresting and somewhat false story in Domino Harvey's life as a bounty hunter. The story is completely discontinuous and confusing to look at. Some aspects of the plot were ridiculous and absolutely incredible. It seems that all the action scenes were loosely linked by poor plot points and horrible acting. Keira Knightley is completely naked in this though. This is the only positive side of this film. If you want to see her naked, quickly advance the movie up to about an hour and a half and you'll get a lot of nipples. I highly recommend that nobody ever see this movie! </ 3
