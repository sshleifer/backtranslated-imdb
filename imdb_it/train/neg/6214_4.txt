What?!?? Why do people say this is "amazing"? Let's face it, the ending is among the worst endings in the history of cinema! 4 left and the whole world is finished! Not to mention the character 9 he was an idiot for as long as he killed everyone. I was right all the time, if he had sacrificed 9 then it wouldn't have happened. The people who give us live for a stupid cause and for what? ... to make it rain? I admit the film had its parts, and the whole concept was fascinating. But many were clich√©s one after another. And has anyone else had this feeling that this is very similar to "The Lord of the Rings"? The characters died for stupid reasons, there was almost no character development, and honestly ask yourself it is nice to have only four boys left in the world; it's useless and stupid. It was one of the shortest movies I've ever seen and thank god! How do robots turn against humans creatively? It has been done hundreds of times! This movie is really stupid, go see a movie that is worth watching like Star Trek, The Hangover, or Inglorious Basterds, those were good movies!
