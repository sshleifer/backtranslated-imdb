Presented as a sort of sequel to The Full Monty, of unemployed men in Sheffield, this film is a fake. <br /> <br /> As someone born in Sheffield, and still attached to the city, I was extremely disappointed with this movie. Someone said it could be set in Oklahoma, and that almost sums it up for me. It looked like a romantic view of the North of England made for the US market. Probably many Americans - and many Englishmen in the south - do not realize that Sheffield is a large city of about half a million inhabitants, with a sophisticated urban culture. In Among Giants was described as a squalid, semi-rural, dead-end town, where everyone in Sheffield seemed to drink in the same old-fashioned pub, and where the idea of ​​a party people was line dancing in some village hall resembling. It was a tight-knit small community, not a metropolitan city. <br /> <br /> The men of the working class of Sheffield were totally different from their counterparts in real life, which are generally silent and communicate with each other in grunts and brief dry remarks. They don't talk, and they certainly don't sing in choirs. <br /> <br /> Even rural contexts, presumably in the Peak District, seemed foreign to me. I recognized some places where I went hiking, but some aerial shots of pylons that extended over a gloomy landscape reminded me more of Wales. In fact, in the closing credits I eventually identified a reference to Gwynedd, in Wales. The Peak District is full of hikers and car tourists in summer. It is located between two large cities. It is not a kind of desert. As for the idea that a young woman could fall in love and desire, Pete Postlethwaite, it was ridiculous and could only be a masculine dream. His reasons for becoming his lover have never been made evident. None of the men was shown to have a partner or family; they existed in a vacuum. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wanted to see a film about the unemployed, Sheffielders would be taken astray. This Sheffield existed only in the minds of its middle-class writers and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It was a giant fake! <br /> <br />
