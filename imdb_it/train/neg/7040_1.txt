I just bought the VHS in this movie for two dollars, I wasted my money! Hey, I write Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Giligan's Island" Louise, but hello! This third-level production is a remake of a dozen other motorcyclist films; a crazy group of psychopathic bikers rides in a bizarre city, beats everyone and everything and then is defeated in man by a hero. Adam West regards the part as a hero, but he lacks the cape and his Batman uniform. Sorry, it's not the same thing. Tina L. looks really nervous and scared throughout the show, but at least we know what happened to "Ginger" once she was saved from the island ... LOL! Motorcyclists are a heterogeneous group, and they know that they never acted again or at least they shouldn't have. Hell Riders is the hell to watch!
