In this short an urban man and his wife have their strange lives set up sukimbo when the man leads to wear an old man complete with his mother-in-law's red pants. <br /> <br /> I kept looking at it hoping you could understand why it was done, or why other reviewers found it funny. For me it was a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> Not all tastes are the same, but this was clearly not mine.
