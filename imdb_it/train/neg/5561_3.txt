I saw this movie with the title of "Tied Up". In general I liked Dolph movies, so I tried this. It wasn't worth it. I have read some of the previous comments on the box that attract viewers. Don't be fooled. This is a poor film at best. The acting is non-existent. The plot, what little there is of one, is very predictable. The film in places seems to be chopped together. This simply smells like the place. Not even worth the price of a cheap overnight rental. As a Dolph fan, I kept waiting for him to see him in action. At the end of the film, you'll still be waiting. Better to avoid this movie and spend time watching almost everything else.
