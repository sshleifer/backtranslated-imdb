Unless you are twelve, this film is not worth it. Obviously it's a low-budget film with B actors, and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense CGI work that's not good. I knew it would be bad if I rented it. I like laughing at bad movies. I didn't know how bad though. It's bearable, until after the 2 hour, so it really starts to burn. Combat styles range from normal fighting that obeys the laws of physics to fighting cables. There is no real explanation for the transitions. It has a plot, but again, it's obviously a film for children. It seems that there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are transmitted, like Sesame Street or something like that. It's bearable. But much better if you are, say, nine.
