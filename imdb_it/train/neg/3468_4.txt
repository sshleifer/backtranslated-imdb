A student filmmaker enlists a B-grade actress (a deliciously diva MOLLE RINGWALD!) To complete the horror film that her mother (a terribly boring Kylie Minogue!) Tried 12 years ago. It's a curious plot choice, to say the least, like every other Australian horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors. The film has a curse on it, because Molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set. But it's back, because it needs exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people start dying on the "set". Cut is an Australian attempt in the modern "slasher", but unfortunately brings nothing new or exciting to the table. In fact, it rips out half of Wes Craven's 90s filmography. A lot of world movie names that come down to the "Scream" (except the name of Aussie that drops the name - Jane Campion ... see how this is not so funny) and a lot of "this is true or is a film "a la New Nightmare". The editing is ugly, the music is annoying, the effects are laughable, almost everything that is bad in this. Fortunately, the film can have a sense of humor: at one point, a well-dressed girl in the film crew tells the owner of the house that they are filming: "Don't worry, we'll treat your home as if it was ours," to which he replies, "this means nothing to me, you seem to live in a landfill!" Ha! And Molly's ridiculous one-liners were enough not to regret renting it. "Do you have any coca-cola in here?" (while riding in the film professor's car) and "Does anyone know where I can buy a tofu?" (the first thing he whispers on the set) and "Where the hell is my agent?" (oh wait, that's what I was thinking for her.)
