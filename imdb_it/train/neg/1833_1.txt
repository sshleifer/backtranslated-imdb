Please, someone must stop Ben Stiller from acting in ANY film. Write the studios, hell, write your local deputy too. I had more laughter going to a funeral, then I looked at ANY shot from Stiller. Jack Black tries to do something about a comedy about the disappearance of dog poop, and Christopher Walken, perhaps one of the greatest actors of his generation, simply seems embarrassed to be there. Stiller is his unfunny self, but now also with someone who frees him, he proves to be overrated as a comedian. It is no wonder why this film was enchanted and was available in dollar cinemas after only a few weeks. I warn you, and you must warn your friends, Don't watch this movie, it's just awful, worse than Gothika (personally, I never thought I'd say it), worse than Plan 9, Worst the Ishtar, worse then The Golden Child. Please Hollywood, stop giving Ben Stiller in your films, it's not funny, he's a terrible actor, and he's dragging others with him. The following movie was rated 1 because there are no negative scores allowed, so while the board says one, I'll give it a zero.
