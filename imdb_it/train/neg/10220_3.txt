First of all, this film can be divided into three segments. A promising opening, with the ambush of some Cheyenne cavalry. This is followed by what can only be described as a long and boring central section, with the uncompromising Candice Bergen and "Soldier Blue" traveling together to achieve the security of an army garrison. Miss Bergen spits inappropriate four-letter words every time she opens her mouth, and it seems to have just come out of a 70s Jack Nicholson movie. I mean it maintains zero interest, with zero credibility. The third and final section concerns the totally free massacre of an Indian village. This is so obvious that it exposes itself to anti-war propaganda, which appears simply as long, outrageous and artificial. Not recommended. - MERK ................................ Jacobe (comment above) Here's an idea. Why not actually watch the movie you're commenting on, instead of chirping your liberal nonsense. This is not a political site, it is for film review. - MERK
