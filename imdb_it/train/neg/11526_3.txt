I liked the previous Ittenbach movie I had seen, "Burning Moon". But while that movie was rather gloomy and bad, "Premutos" seems to play mainly for laughter. Although admirable as Ittenbach made this film with no money in his spare time (and the DVD documentary deserves to be seen), I found myself constantly struggling not to go fast to the next gore scene. Sure, there's blood, and if that's all you want then go ahead and have fun. But beware: there is a huge amount of limping comedy and a boring display of stories. Many are comparing it to Peter Jackson's films, especially "Braindead". But looking at what Jackson did on a similar budget in "Bad Taste", it is clear that Ittenbach lacks something that Jackson has - the talent. 3/10 (for fairly good and abundant effects, and to get the most from limited resources - but not worth the money I paid for it)
