The script for this Columbo movie seemed to have been pulled out of a wise 1980s soap opera. Films deeply inspired by the characters are great, but only if the characters are convincing. And in this film the only interesting thing was my desire to change channels. The dialogue of the villain seems as if it had been written by a novelist novelist. The great Lt. Columbo in person is not close to his famous, lovable, selfish shy, crumpled; and the victim of the kidnapped / bride is a nasty one-dimensional damsel in distress (she barks in fear at a small scalpel held lightly in her captor's hand - come on !!! I could have knocked the scalpel from her hand and kicked in the tu-sai-thing in 2 seconds). In any sense of reality, this character would at least have tried to fight or fight at least a little. And speaking of reality ... the story revolves around a kidnapping that is solved and solved by the police. Police?? Give me a break. Everyone knows that the FBI deals with EVERY case of kidnapping. This was NO Columbo, just a superficial and totally predictable criminal drama with our well-known Lt. Columbo written and extended to 2 hours.
