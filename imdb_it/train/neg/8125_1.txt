"The Bat People" is a really bad film that deserved the MST3K treatment just like the other movie "The Creeping Terror". <br /> <br /> In it, we find ourselves in a sort of mountainous terrain full of bats. We see many things happening, like bats flying out and attacking and stuff, car chases, first aid successes and much more! All this, in addition to the poor mediocrity of the 70s (hey, think "Mitchell" here!), Turning "The Bat People" into one of the best episodes of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" actually made in the series! Moviewise, it's terrible. It should be avoided like the plague, unless Tom Servo and Crow are looking at you. <br /> <br /> "The Bat People" - more like "The Bad People !!!!!" LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 of course !!!!!
