JUDAAI was a brave film by Raj Kanwar when he was in 1997 when a subject like that was damn out of the box <br /> <br /> To give him credit, he can show how much greed changes a person and up how far the person can go to get what he wants <br /> <br /> But the movie is damn melodramatic, lots of ridiculous places <br /> <br /> One wonders why Anil doesn't buy a TV for his wife ? when does he earn so much Just to show how poor he is? <br /> <br /> The twist is well managed but the handling is over in the 1980s The Johny-Paresh comedy that entertains here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it does not fit the plot <br /> <br /> Although there are many noteworthy scenes <br /> <br /> Directed by Raj Kanwar is adequate although sometimes too melodramatic The music is ok but most of the songs seem forced <br /> <br /> Anil does his part well Sridevi is excellent in his part Urmila is decent Among rest Kader Khan is as usual Johny Lever is funny, Paresh irritates Farida is decent
