I can say without a doubt that Going Overboard is the only worst film I've ever seen, and yes, I saw Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination like Schecky Moskowitz, an aspiring comedian who works on a cruise ship. This is the plot. <br /> <br /> It's done! Nothing else in the film makes sense, it is everywhere like a madman's breakfast, and not in a bizarre, but more frustrating, naked gun, "pulls shoes to the kind of street". also General Noriega makes an appearance, for no reason that I can understand (it was certainly not for humor). Add to the mix Miss Australia, which has the worst Australian accent I've ever heard, and you've got something I won't call the worst movie ever made, because Going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a movie. I highly recommend seeing this movie, as it will elevate the reputation of every bad movie you've ever seen. I guarantee that the first thing you will say after seeing a bad movie will be "at least it's not as bad as Going Overboard".
