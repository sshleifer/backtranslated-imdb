When I was a teenager seeing this film for the first time, I thought it was one of the best films ever made. Of course, the reason for this is Bo Derek and his various states of undressing in this film. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say this movie is horrible. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and her husband-director John Derek make sure they see her in abundance. But when you take this aspect out of the movie, it becomes a big boring ride. And Tarzan, well, it's as muscular as you think it should be, but when he sees Jane (which is Bo, of course) for the first time, he doesn't know what to think. This is despite the fact that Bo wears a transparent wet shirt, with visible breasts. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem. If you are looking for a film to drool over a beautiful naked body, then this could fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, fun and worthy movie, go elsewhere ... almost nowhere else !!!
