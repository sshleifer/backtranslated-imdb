I noticed how all the other reviews of this film mention how "healthy" and "funny" are. These people need to leave home more often. I don't know why they make the shilling for this insipid, tasteless and brainless piece. Pat Boone has absolutely no acting talent, and his ineptitude is surpassed only by that of his co-star Pamela Austin, a former model (one more reason to outlaw the insidious practice of inflicting talentless models at a unsuspecting public spectator, a foul habit that unfortunately persists until today). A good supporting cast (Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortyon, among others) strives to make sense of this, but without success. I noticed that two directors shared the merit, even if "credit" is not the word I would use (nor "director"). As for "healthy entertainment", there are a lot of those types of movies available without torturing your loved ones by forcing them to sit through this. Find one of those movies and skip this one.
