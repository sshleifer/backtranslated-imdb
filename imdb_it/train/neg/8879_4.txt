I think Cliff Robertson was definitely one of our best actors. He has half a dozen classics to his credit. Here is fine as the heavy, but the direction is so ugly and the rhythm so tiring, that it never comes out of nowhere. The story starts well even though I wonder how he could count on his wife hanging herself. Yet he continues to grumble and carries things forward. The death knell is twofold. First of all, if we had to spend the time necessary for the characters to move from one room to another or from one part of the house to the other, we would eat about a third of the film. Add to that, Robertson's character sitting on the bed in the blue light, looking confused, which could add another piece. I agree with those who said that a shorter half hour would have made a movie quite decent, even if it was insignificant. The biggest weakness is just a twisted plot that, when all has been said and done, leaves incredible questions. I'm not entering spoilers, but when it ends, don't think too much. I can invent ten what-ifs without sweating. It would have been better if a ghost story remained.
