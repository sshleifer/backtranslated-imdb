I made a special effort to watch this film and was totally disappointed with the result. On paper, the script seems hopeful, and the choice of actors leaves hope: I liked Pacino in Scent of a Woman and saw Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French and other 70s / 80s films. But I had forgotten how important a part of the dialogue is in a film, and in this film they are absolute ..... trash! The filming locations were also attractive, but the hopeless, pretentious and forced dialogues brought it to a level below zero. In addition to that, I am quite allergic to the world of motor racing and I find no interest in this sport. Even the inelegant dialogues in "Love Story" were better than those in this movie (and this is saying something !!). I really expected better from this movie and was very disappointed to have been disappointed so much.
