I saw this movie a few days ago and I really jumped during the scary parts. I have to admit, I found it pretty decent ... until I started THINKing about what the characters were saying. Logical problems: <br /> <br /> 1. Her boyfriend, who appears to be a handsome boy, makes no sound as he is killed. Don't you think he could at least try to catch the killer? <br /> <br /> 2. When it is pointed out that the gym teacher is "SOOOO in love with Lisa", I almost screamed at the screen. When your best friend's family WAS KILLED BY A TEACHER WHO WAS LOVED WITH YOU, you don't comment like that if you have half a heart. <br /> <br /> 3. As soon as Nash asks the uncle how many exits they have at home and the uncle realizes that there could be a danger, the smartest thing to do is to bring Donna, the boy, his aunt and uncle in a car and drive a long way, so get out of the house with the HRT and the police so the killer has no way out? <br /> <br /> I could go on. And go. And go. Basically, the plot was decent, the characters were not profiled enough to make you empathize when they were slaughtered and there were too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER. <br /> <br /> This film could be good for teenagers or young couples who are just looking for a fun evening. If you don't consider all the tricks, it's a mediocre film.
