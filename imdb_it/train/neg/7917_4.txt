"Cement" is a bad movie about a bad cop (Penn) with a bad attitude and a bad disposition that has a bad guy in a bad position up to his quick-drying concrete cajones. While we wait for the cement to dry and the film understand what it is, we are periodically brought back in time without rhyme or reason, so we can look at the events that lead to cement. A boring film in general, "Cement" suffers from the lack of a story, a clumsy execution and the more ubiquitous execution of the director's defects; no reason to worry. A time killer for the needy couch at best. (D +)
