Terrible movie with Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome. Here he gets involved in a dead woman under the sea. <br /> <br /> Rome is soon hired to find out what happened to a woman. Of course, it is the woman under the sea. Her roommate, Lainie Kazan, soon finds herself dead on the floor. <br /> <br /> An elderly Richard Conte plays a police officer and a friend of Rome. When a local club owner is killed, the blame falls on Rome and there it becomes an interesting hunting scene. This image is so bad if you have to depend on a chase scene to provide action. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch plays the beauty up to his neck in an intrigue. His acting brings much to be desired. <br /> <br /> Martin Gabel is a retired thug whose son is trying to get past him. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, you don't know why the girl was killed. Don't even worry about asking.
