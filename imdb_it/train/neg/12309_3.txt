This was a disappointing film. Considering the material - the life of the army is always good for a laugh - and the stars, this film should have been a laugh party. A couple of laughs were worth it, at best. Steve Martin was a lot more fun than this and it seems that Dan Ackroyd should stick to dramatic roles, where he could follow Robin Williams' lead and one day win an Oscar.
