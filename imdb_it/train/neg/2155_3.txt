Good night, Mr. Tom starts in an incredibly exquisite village in the south of England where the sun always seems to shine. Before having a great idea of ​​the period, we listen to a radio announcement of the declaration of the Second World War. Soon a train blowing steam clouds brings refugee children from London and when the shy little William is rented with reluctant, grumpy old Tom (who knows he will have a heart of gold) our story begins. <br /> <br /> And what a load of sentimental crap is. Actually it's just the old odd-pair formula. Were no new stories written? <br /> <br /> As I suggested there is hardly any time in the village and not much more in London apart from the strange old noise-making ambulance. And certainly no mention of the horror of the Blitz when the citizens of London appear politely in the bomb shelters. Even when the husband of the local school is allegedly reported missing, he is later revived. <br /> <br /> I found "Buonanotte, Mister Tom" cliché and obvious, and John Thaw's accent evoked a photo of Ronnie Barker of the Two Ronnies with a straw in his mouth pronouncing the "country bumpkin ". <br /> <br /> Incidentally, my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons I didn't like and looking at fellow reviewers I seem to be in a minority of one. <br /> <br />
