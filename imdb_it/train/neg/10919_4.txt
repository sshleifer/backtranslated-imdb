Bollywood fans hold Amitabh Bachan's Mard in high regard, but I think it's very overrated. Manmohan Desai first collaborated on films like Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie and I saw everyone I liked, so I had great expectations before seeing Mard and I was bitterly disappointed. My main complaint about Mard is that it looks like part 2 of Amar Akbar Anthony, perhaps Mr Desai ran out of ideas, after all he had used that formula for years and years. 1. First of all, some members of the cast are repeated by the AAA, for example the police inspector who brings Amar, the Muslim who brings to Akbar, Nirupa Roy and others. 2. In AAA Nirupa Roy loses his sight, in Mard he loses his voice 3. In AAA there is the famous song (Shirdi wale sai baba) well in Mard we have Amitabh singing Maa Sherawali. Having seen AAA over 1000 times I noticed it immediately. <br /> <br /> My other complaints are that some of the situations seem ridiculous, true Manmohan Desai made the brain leave the door type of film but with Mard I thought he had gone too far. My last complaint is that compared to the previous Manmohan Desai movies I found the songs rather disappointing. I know he has a lot of fans who swear by him but I didn't like him a little. It really hurts me to write this review because I'm a big fan and I've loved his movies since I was a kid.
