Marvin (Rob Schneider) does not have the ingredients to be a cop who is his lifelong dream. But his fortune changes when he has a crush on his car (very bad) and is found by a doctor. The doctor must use animal organs to rebuild it. After this moment, he begins to behave wildly unconsciously and becomes the best cop you can ever be. For the moment, he is aware of the changes and his animal instinct begins to take over his human side. Meanwhile, find a lovely girl and try to be a perfect gentleman, which means he has to control himself and behave in a civilized way. They are not great fun of Rob Schneider. In fact, this is his first film I saw. However, I can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser. (See his part in Ally Mcbeal, actually quite funny). There are some good parts in the movie like her flirting with the goat. In these films, the biggest problem is that the script seems to make the viewer seem less intelligent. I'm sure this movie is okay, as long as it's not taken too seriously. But it is very sad to see such films that go very well at the box office. The Animal is not the worst movie I've seen to date, but it can't get more than *.
