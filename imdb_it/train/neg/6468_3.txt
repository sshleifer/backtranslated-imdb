It's a good thing that the score came for Marlon Brando as a farewell performance because I would hate to think it came out with Free Money. That's not what his fans should remember about him. <br /> <br /> Brando in his later years looks more like Orson Welles and Free Money is the kind of film that Welles would have done looking for funding for his work. Brando is the director of a local prison that in America, when in a small rural environment, is usually the largest employer in the area. This gives those responsible a lot of influence. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately he has an indulging weakness, his twin twins, otherwise known as daughters. Even when they are simultaneously pregnant by a pair of losers, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden Church, their hearts still belong to Daddy. <br /> <br /> Don't worry because Brando is willing to give them a job in the prison where they work in conditions not much better than the prisoners. What to do, but to commit a robbery of a train that crosses the area every so often bringing with it money used to be burned by the Treasury. <br /> <br /> Although Free Money has some moments of humor, most of the time it is rather below the talent of everyone involved. Some of them would include Donald Sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and Mira Sorvino as his stepdaughter, but also as an FBI agent. <br /> <br /> Of course these people and the rest of the cast worked with someone that many consider to be the greatest American actor of the last century. Had it not been for the presence of Brando and 40 years earlier, Free Money would have played the drive-in circuit in Red America where the population could see how they were being satirized. <br /> <br /> Or a weak attempt is made to satirize them.
