And this comes from someone who will resist practically ANY vision. The acting and the sound are horrible. This could qualify for a point of merit "so bad is good", for some. However, I take my horror films seriously and this is just crap - it's really cheap, I think that's my biggest complaint. Dialogue is often hilarious: beware of how many times you "scared me". The actress "child" is seriously bad, I pray that her acting career ended here ... her line "CIAMBELLE! I HATE CIAMBELLE" is still worth seeing repeatedly.
