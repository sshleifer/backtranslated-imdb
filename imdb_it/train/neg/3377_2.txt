The Broadway musical, "A Chorus Line" is undoubtedly the best musical in the theater. It is about the experiences of people who live for dance; the joys they experience and the sacrifices they make. Each dancer is doing part auditions in a Broadway chorus line, however what comes out of each is stories of how their lives have led them to find dance as a truce. <br /> <br /> The movie version, however, does not capture the passion or the beauty of the theater show, and is probably the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical, as lifeless and devoid of love for the dance , of sorts. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake was made in giving the director's work to Sir Richard Attenborough, whose direction offered the right touch and rhythm for "Gandhi". Why does someone in his right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly small place? <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the next problem. "A Chorus Line" takes place on stage in a theater without real sets and limited costume changes. He is the least showy of Broadway musicals, and his simplicity was his glory. However, this doesn't translate well into the film, and nobody really thought it would happen. For this reason, the film should have taken us into the life of these dancers and should have left the theater and the audition process. The singers could offer their songs in other environments and even offer flashbacks to their first dance, jazz or tap course. Hell, they could have been dancing on Broadway in their vivid imagination. Yet not even a slice of imagination has gone into the making of this film, as Attenborough's complete indifference to the dance and the show itself is evident in his impractical direction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes are downright embarrassing as dancers tell the director (Michael Douglas) if he wants to hear them or not. The character of Douglas is capricious to choose who to extend a sympathetic ear to, and to whom he has no patience. <br /> <br /> While the filmmakers pretended to be faithful to the nature of the show, some heretical changes were made. The beautiful "Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love" - ​​an incredible number of stages that brought the dancers back to their teenage years - was removed and replaced with the terrible "Surprise", a song so bad that it was nominated for a Oscar. Adding insult to injury, "Surprise" simply repeated the same story as "Hello, Love" but without humor or pathos. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to see this movie if you don't want a lesson in what NOT to do when moving a Broadway show to the cinema. If you want to see a film version of this show, the closest thing is the brilliant "All That Jazz" by Bob Fosse. While Fosse's daughter is in "A Chorus Line", HE is the Fosse who should have been involved as a director. He would have known what to do with this material, which deserved a much greater respect than this sad effort.
