The same difficulty that I have with the musical version of "Les Miserables" applies equally to "Oliver". Instead of writing composers in the stylistic period of theater sets, they simply wrote Broadway-type melodies, which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically distorted. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the brazen brutality and unpleasant drama activities do not mix well with some of the sunshine fingers that permeate the score. It is an uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly acidic background. <br /> <br /> The casting of the boy Oliver doesn't help at all: timidity of the timbre and incredibly precious, here is something less than solid. Fagin performs his traditional routine adequately, even if the melodies he is forced to sing have few bases in terms of time. <br /> <br /> "As long as he needs me" he receives a strident, guttural and tense interpretation. The two big production numbers, "Who Will Buy" and "Consider yourself" seem overproduced, with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in. It is one thing to do out of everything, yet another to go beyond the excess line. <br /> <br /> The darkness, despair and depravity of much of the novel do not seem to lend themselves to such dictatorships and choreographies. While the novel is considered a classic, I must confess that I have problems with the conscience of Mr. Dickens, as his works tend to emit a negative vibration. This could be due to the extension of his personal life without joy, which was full of disappointments and regrets. <br /> <br /> Not all the combined talents of this production, both behind and behind the camera, can overcome the non-constructive nature of the basic material. All this translates into an unpleasant experience of unpleasantness for me. <br /> <br />
