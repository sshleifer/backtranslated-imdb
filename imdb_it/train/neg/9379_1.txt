This film . . . I do not know. Because they would have taken a character as indomitable as Pippi Longstocking and cast the singular Tami Erin without charm, I will never know. Because they should spend money on art direction and some not-all-that-bad special effects, so don't worry about changing it properly, I'll never know. Because the sets and costumes are sometimes in period and, sometimes strangely, because they have commissioned such bad songs, because the script doesn't make any sense (not even on a fool, level of children's films). . . . What were they thinking ?? Nothing in this film is exactly as it should be. Every single part is doubled (and always bad), every sound effect is slightly wrong, every change is in the wrong place, every performance is bad in some way. He manages to create an appropriate atmosphere, despite all the problems, but NEVER captures the magic that is Astrid Lindgren's creation.
