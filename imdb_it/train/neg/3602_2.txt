I'm a fan of B-Rate horror movies and I've seen my fair share of slasher images, so I have a considerable caliber to judge this film. It easily places itself at the top of the worst horror films of the 80s. It's not as scary as Night of the Demons, it's not as bloody as Re-Animator and it lacks the value of the There's Nothing Out There field. That said, this film has no value. Keep in mind that the film artwork is for a completely different movie. The shots on the back of the DVD box are not taken from this movie. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (There is a lot of violence but we have seen it before. A murderer kills single students and occasional members of the structure by throats and all the other methods of fatigue used by the horror movie). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: None <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (The plot focuses on Francine Forbes - who wisely changed her name to Forbes Riley after this film was made - accepting a job at a university. People start dying and Forbes believes the killer is targeting her. Is her new heartthrob with a chess past or the student mad about libido? To be honest, it's impossible to worry because the script does not bring any character out of Forbes). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ (Terrible at all levels. Feel of a school production - high school because university students could make a better film than this. Foors shows a minimum of talent as Seminara does as one of the students, but all the others are of the "extra" caliber of acting).
