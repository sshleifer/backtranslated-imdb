A young scientist is trying to carry on his dead father's work on limb regeneration. His mother, who was authoritarian, convinced him that he killed his father and is monitoring his progress for his evil purposes. A young doctor uses the reptilian DNA he extracts from a large creature and when his arm is conveniently pulled away a few minutes later, he injects himself with his formula and grows a new murderous arm ... Sure special effects in "Severed Ties "they are pretty good and grotesque, but the rest of the film is terrible. The severed arm acts like a snake and kills a few people. Big deal. Acting is mediocre and the climax is silly.3 out of 10.
