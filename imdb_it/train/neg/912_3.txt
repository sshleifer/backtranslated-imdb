... for one of the worst Swedish films of all time ... forgive me for being boring. <br /> <br /> First of all I didn't see the first one (I was bored this is the reason I was watching the second one before 1st), well, I hope the first one is better than this, it was full of strange scenes cut and strange plot changes, for people who have seen this and think 4/10 is high (believe me), but it made me laugh a few times, because it was so weird so ugly and I laugh thinking of the punk that came up with this idea, and the next "Det sjunde inseglet II". Sequels not based on novels or books don't go very well often, and this is a perfect example of one. <br /> <br /> OK, I'll be honest with you: I laughed a little, I had some decent jokes and a slapstick humor. But don't buy it, rent it. Let some other idiot do it or download it. <br /> <br /> 4/10 This film will be remembered and the director has probably already laughed ...
