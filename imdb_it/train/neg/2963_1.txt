Since I started visiting this site and voted for the films, I never gave a movie a score of 1. Even the disturbing "Dance! Workout with Barbie" got a 2. There is a reason for this. <br /> <br /> Whenever I find myself watching what I think is a really bad movie, I have to stop and ask myself the following question: "This movie is really as bad as the horrible anime-sucking beast that it is" Theodore Rex '? "And I was never able to answer" yes ". <br /> <br /> I'd give anything within the limits of reason to know which crackhead said "Hey, let's do 'Blade Runner' with Barney as Harrison Ford!" and decided that it would be a good idea to spend time and money to get him to run. Also, I want to know what the hell kind of market they would sell for if it didn't become a video. This is that rare monster: a movie too violent for children and too stupidly stupid for adults. I would like to ask "what were they thinking?" but in this case, it could actually be redundant. <br /> <br /> In any case, all you need to know is that you just have to expose yourself to this monstrosity if you're one of the five or six angry "Howard the Duck" fans, or if you're curious about the movie most evil of all time, or if you REALLY want to punish yourself.
