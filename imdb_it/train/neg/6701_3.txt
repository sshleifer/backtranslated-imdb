I've been an environmentalist for years and couldn't wait to see this show. I had planned to record all the episodes because I thought I could really learn some great news. I could probably get past Rachelle. <br /> <br /> I'm sure a lot of this is staged to look like a reality show and to appeal to that class of spectators. It doesn't work for someone who is really interested in improving the planet. <br /> <br /> This show should be called Nagging with Rachelle. <br /> <br /> Since Ed is a great source of information, perhaps a very serious second show about the environment would be a good idea. There is no need to belittle things for some of us. <br /> <br /> I don't record more episodes or watch the show, but let me know if a real green show could be in the works.
