At the beginning of the film, a narrator warns us that SCREAMING SKULL is so terrifying that you could die of fear - and if this happens, a free burial is guaranteed. Well, I don't think anybody died of fear in seeing this movie, but some may have died of boredom. THE SCREAMING SKULL is the kind of film that makes Ed Wood look good. <br /> <br /> Very loosely based on the famous story by Francis Marion Crawford, SKULL speaks of a rich but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died in mysterious circumstances. Once installed in her home, she is tormented by a half-witty gardener, a poorly executed portrait, peacocks and ultimately a skull that rolls around the room and makes her scream a lot. And to her credit, actress Peggy Webber screams pretty well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, his ability to do so is the highest point in the film. The plot is transparent enough, to put it mildly, and while the cast is indeed in place, the script is terrible and the film so uninspired as to be ready to escape. True, it only lasts about sixty-eight minutes, but everything seems much longer. Add to this a really terrible print quality and you're there. <br /> <br /> There are films that are so bad that they are fun to watch. It is true that THE SCREAMING SKULL has some screams, but the film drags so much that I can't work more than an occasional giggle, and when it is all over your head it will roll over. If it weren't for Peggy Webber's way with a scream, this would be the safe cure for insomnia. Give him a note. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon reviewer
