From reading all the comments posted on IMDb, this film seems to be irregular, but I didn't think it was that bad. I've seen a lot worse, actually. <br /> <br /> "The House Where Evil Dwells" is a ghost story about a husband and his wife, Ted and Laura Fletcher, and their daughter, Amy, who move into an old house in Japan. Little do they know, a Japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and his lover, and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword. As strange things happen at home, the ghosts of previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living, and plan to rebuild the bloody murder that took place 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie and decided to give it a chance, it looked like a decent ghost story from the cover. It was normal, and it was trivial, but I've seen worse in my time. The phantom sequences were a bit exaggerated, we can see the translucent blue figures popping randomly around the family, and take over their bodies. To be honest, the ghosts in this movie reminded me of the ghosts of the tour of the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. I could be wrong, but after seeing this, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror film "Ju-On: The Grudge" and the American remake of that movie ripped it off a bit. The old Japanese house where a brutal murder took place, ghostly activities, curses put at home, etc. But I could be wrong. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this is a rather trivial ghost story. Don't go out of your way to see it, but if you like this kind of thing and happen to come on TV you can give it a chance. 4/10.
