Has anyone changed this movie? Or was it just the DVD version that had huge intervals of thirty seconds between scenes? Okay though, I fell asleep watching the first time. Then I fell asleep the second time and the third time. The plot is actually not the worst I've ever seen, but it's close. Acting is not the worst I've ever seen ... but it's close. The production .... well, I can honestly say that it was the worst I've ever seen in my life! Don't try to be spiteful, but Unhinged could have used some more production. <br /> <br /> Please do not think that I am a horror film hater, or even that I did not like this movie. I just felt that I was laughing at the movie a lot more than I laughed together. The gruesome moments weren't bad, but could have been better done even on a shoestring budget. <br /> <br /> The characters seemed badly developed, or ignored all together, the twisted ending was rather ugly, and the exhibition took forever without exposing much. <br /> <br /> I suggest you avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
