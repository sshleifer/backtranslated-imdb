This is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen ... Unfortunately, I'm a fan of horror movies and will rent any horror movie unless it's done for t.v. When he looks at the box he says it is rated R for gore and some language ... Where was the blood? Was it their only death scene where you really saw gore? I could have overlooked that if there had been any brief nudity or some good dialogue. There was not even a distant joke, witty or funny, in this lame film. Sometimes horror movies are fantastic because they are so stupid, but this was just sad.
