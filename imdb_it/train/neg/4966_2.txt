I understand that this film was made on a very low budget but it is not an excuse for the monstrosity that is Grendel. Deathstalker, The throne of fire, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, the invincible barbarian have all been made with limited budgets and poor special effects, but they have nevertheless managed to create cult classics by adding some skilfully dressed women and a good sense of 'humor. The primitive costumes, the dark castles and the beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a great low-cost sword and witchcraft film, but the producers have completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor CGI effects and colorless characters. Compare this film with Beowulf (1999). It may not be Citizen Kane, but it is a good example of how a fun low-cost science fiction / adventure film can be made using credible special effects and catchy characters.
