Last night I was watching our DVD tower for something to watch. We were among the NetFlix mailings and it was a quiet Saturday night. I extracted one that I had never heard before and realized that it had been borrowed from a friend. From the jacket, it looked like a rip-off of "The Big Chill" but, with the cast of all the stars, it seemed worth watching. Boy was I wrong !!! Not only was it like "The Big Chill", it was a real madness by character. Bill Paxton's character was a copy of William Hurt ("where have you been all this time") - warning of the sewer - and, well, he stays behind to take care of the old place (cabin / field). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; idiotic womanizer Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc., etc. I found myself wondering why I was even looking at these people. There was not enough character development for me to find any interest in them. How did "Unca Lou" find these characters after 20 years? Besides, it wasn't even funny, except when Perkins fell, he threw himself out of bed the first morning, it was a signal and I missed him. After it was over, I asked my wife, "Were there engaging characters in this movie? Are you sleeping over there?" She replied, "No, I'm still thinking ... No, no one comes to mind."
