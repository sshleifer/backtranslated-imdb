After the success of the (horrible) replicas of Gilligan's Island TV, a number of TV films were made during the retraction meetings of the classic shows of the 1980s. Most of these films completely lost the boat to regain the humor that made the shows so special. THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is among the most disappointing, because it turns to a comic style like Laurel and Hardy that actually wasn't in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful comedian and essential to the series, is completely wasted - she has less time here in this 90-minute movie than she did in a single 30-minute episode. And since the roles of "Eddie" and "Marilyn" in this film are nothing but cameos, what was the point of making them younger and making them again? With very little rewriting, they could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although seeing some of the Munster's spooky relatives was a touch of class, I didn't like Sid Caesar as a hamburger scientist, especially since there's too much of him and not enough of the evil Munsters (ironically that year 1981, old comrade of Caesar in the comedy, Imogene Coca, was also improperly chosen in an important part in a television reunion RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES). Another strange unexplainable piece at the beginning of the film has the Munster family represented as wax figures in a local horror wax museum. Why should they be there when they should be a "typical" (if strange) American family, not famous monsters? This was Munsters' last project with the original cast in their roles, there was a terrible revival of the series in the late 1980s with a completely new cast and a 1990 TV movie starring DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest and Patrick have a family dinner.
