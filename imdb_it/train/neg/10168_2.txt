Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was created. The whole plot is about someone trying to sabotage the superbowl and all the attempts to stop them. The way that Tom Selleck and Donna Mills careers have managed to survive is beyond me. However, the most frustrating thing is that there was NO FOOTBALL IN IT! Avoid this if possible.
