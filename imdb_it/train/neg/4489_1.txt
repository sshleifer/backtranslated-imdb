`The Matrix 'was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic, but which it also thought with curiosity to provoke in its" Twilight Zone "mode. The general rule applies here and this sequel does not correspond to its predecessor. Worse, it doesn't even compare to it. <br /> <br /> `Reloaded 'explodes on the screen in the most unprofessional way. In the first few seconds of opening the first impression is generally good when Trinity is turned into a dream. Immediately afterwards, the film dives from his nose. After a disastrous first 45 minutes, he gradually gains as they enter the Matrix and Agent Smith's battle takes place. But all speed is lost when it reaches the 14-minute car chase sequence and becomes even worse at the big turning point at the end. The worst thing is the too long scene of "Zion Rave". Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but it is also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music. <br /> <br /> The bullet-time aspect of "The Matrix" was a good addition, but in "Reloaded" they are misused to make it boring. In the first there were interesting plot turns, but here it is too linear to be distantly interesting. The film is basically, just a series of elegant diversions that prevent us from realizing how empty it really is. It works on the wrong principle that the bigger the better. It seems that the "The Matrix" franchise has quickly descended into the special effects of fiery misfire that other franchises like the 'Star Wars' saga have. <br /> <br /> The acting standard is poor for the most part. The best character obviously goes to "Agent Smith" by Hugo Weaving - the only one to be slightly interesting. Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo, but in all special effects, there is little room to make a big impact. The Oscar nomination Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with little dialogue. The part of Carrie Ann Moss as an action chick could have been improved much better by any other actress. <br /> <br /> A poor film thrown together, "The Matrix Reloaded" is a disappointment. It is unlikely that those who do not like the first are crowded. This is only for diehard fans. Even in the subgenre of the film of special effects bonanzas (Minority Report, The Matrix etc.) This is still quite scarce. My IMDb rating: 4.5 / 10.
