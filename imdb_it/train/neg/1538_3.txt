It is a pity that a very competent director like Andre de Toth, who specializes in slippery and changing alliances, did not first grasp this concept. It could have helped bring out the true potential, especially with the interesting character played by William Bishop. Like the movie, it's quite a disaster (as stated by the reviewer Chipe). The main problems concern the management, the low-cost budget and a poor script. The strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept: characters drawn in different directions by contrasting forces. What was needed was someone with a vision that brought together the positive elements, reworking the script in a kind of coherent whole, instead of the messy and uncomfortable chaos that it is, (try to understand motivations and interaction if you can) . Furthermore, a larger budget could match contrasting locations and studio shoots, and get locations outside of the Los Angeles suburbs. The real shame is a waste of an excellent cast - Hayden, Taylor (before his teeth were hooded), Dehner, Reeves, along with James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their premature death. Few films illustrate the importance of an author-with-vision more than this mediocre dark Western, which, in the right hands, could have been much more.
