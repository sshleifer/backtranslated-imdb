The title says it all. "Tail Gunner Joe" was a tag assigned to the senator who relied on the public's ignorance of World War II aircraft. The moving guns facing the rear relied on a catch that prevented the rear shooter from firing from the tail of the plane, preventing the gun from firing when it was pointing towards the tail. When one day the senator practiced on the ground, he managed to shoot from the tail of the plane. He couldn't have done it if the gun had been correctly aligned. The artillery officer responsible for that admitted, in public, in front of a camera, that he was responsible - he had made the mistake, not the senator. The fact that the film did not report this fact shows how unilateral it is. This film was designed to do something, destroy the reputation of a complex person. <br /> <br /> A much better program was the special PBS on him. He was a hard-working, intelligent, ambitious politician who overcame the extraordinary disadvantages to reach extraordinary heights. He made some mistakes, some serious mistakes, but shooting at the tail of an airplane was not one of them. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this film is due to the fact that audiences like simple, one-sided stories, so they don't have to think.
