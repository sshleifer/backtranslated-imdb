Plot does not exist, tons of scenes badly addressed / super-cheesy (world-famous snipers / hungry that can't even hit their targets a few meters away? Besides what happens with the ending? ---> a group of law enforcement officers who vandalize a carnival shooting gallery? WTH?), technical errors (how many bullets can you put in a glock magazine? 100+? These people shoot their guns without reloading). The film is so bad that even the elderly Hollywood actor like Michael Biehn (Aliens, terminator) can't save this stuff. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie (I realized that I wasted some good 100 minutes of my precious life on this). I hope the director would stop making films, or learn more about his next film.
