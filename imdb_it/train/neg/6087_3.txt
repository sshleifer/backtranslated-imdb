This film was not a thankless task as I expected. There are a few seconds of brilliance in this rather idiotic UFO hardcore paranoia-fest. Most of the acting is mediocre, but typical enough for 70s style stuff full of pregnant breaks. A photographer and a model witness some strange game in the woods and soon they fall victim to these same events. The flying saucers are spotted, the more people disappear - but are they the aliens or the ultra-secret group of our cover-up government? Soon, a reporter and a "UFOlogist" (apparently modeled on the character of the writer-director) are attracted by this disenchanted fiasco and become the target of the ultra-secret agents who are threatening as unlikely and crippled. So the fun really starts. <br /> <br /> The film, predictably, makes as much sense as the average UFO conspiracy theory, but it should be praised for taking it so seriously. The camera work is OK for a low-cost movie, the pace is pretty good, the script is stupid and absurd, and there are continuity issues that are fun to watch. What are the few seconds of brilliance I mentioned? Honestly, I can't tell you much without writing a spoiler. Suffice it to say that the end of the film is, at least, worth moving quickly if you fail to take the vehicle.
