Curiously, it is Rene Russo's eyes and mouth - not those of Buddy the Gorilla - that emerge as the focal point of "Buddy", a production of Jim Henson Pictures through Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope. In some ways, countless close-ups of Russo's face have slipped into post-production phases, and she literally fills the screen so many times that the poor monkeys are overshadowed. A true story unintentionally funny adapted by Gertrude "Trudy" The memories of Davies Lint on the wife of a rich doctor who turns their villa into a menagerie for pets and wild life. The film goes beyond good intentions ... it drips positively with sincere sincerity. The film never shines with the kind of magic of the "family movie" he needed, and in a short time both the people and the animals seem distinctly programmed (nothing here seems real). About ten minutes later, two chimpanzees are joking in Russo's kitchen and start throwing a butcher knife back and forth (missing Alan Cumming's head by a few inches); however, don't raise your eyebrows because it's all in the fun of a day. However, when the adult Buddy gorilla goes mad during a thunderstorm, the cops are called - and everyone looks at Buddy through the window while he grabs the living room furniture. The furniture should be the last of anyone's concerns in this unbearable, well-done failure. But, at least, we know that Russo was in good hands: every time director Caroline Thompson needs a good shot, she gives Rene unstartled another extreme close-up. I wonder what the lipstick budget was on this photo? ** from ****
