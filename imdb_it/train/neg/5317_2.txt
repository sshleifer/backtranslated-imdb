For the first 20 minutes or so (I was watching it on a PS2 so I have no idea how long it took) Alienator creates an interesting premise. I don't think I've seen a slasher movie with a stranger from another planet as the bad guy before. However, interest soon turns to incredulous disbelief as you understand that the "alien" is a huge bodybuilder in a steel bikini. Yes, Alienator is patently ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I don't think he holds it against. In the world of shlock-horror, clearly ridiculous can often be a good sign. However, the blatant stupidity of his premise is that the whole film is really doing it. Alienator is fun to die for, but it's also a top-notch shambolic suckfest. The actors flock to failed attempts of seriousness, the potentially ingenious lines of pure dialogue with cheese have stumbled with unnerving incompetence and the management cannot summarize even one or two decent sets. When the film is finished, you can barely see the original concept through the haystack of total tripe on which the team is massed. <br /> <br /> Add to this the fact that the 'Alien' simply kills people by vaporizing them, as opposed to doing any 'cutting' as such and you have a huge palpitating palate of good ideas left to rot. You'll laugh at Alienator, but AT it, not with it. If this is your problem, go ahead and take a look.
