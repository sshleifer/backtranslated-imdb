In short, this film is completely useless. <br /> <br /> The idea is to make films from the point of view of what some of the early 1900s might think about the future. An interesting idea, but the lack of compelling stories or characters prevents us from always suspending our disbelief, so the idea fails. <br /> <br /> Apparently the whole film was made with actors in front of green screens and we should be impressed But as a graphic person, excessive softening was an obvious crutch to hide the difficult problem of sharp edges with green screening. The color has faded significantly without significant effects except by reducing the visual quality. And I don't understand why anyone would consider anything made in this film to be somehow innovative. If anything, the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics - they're not up to the old Jurassic Park graphics. The models for the robots were so simple, simple and very uninteresting. There were a group of prehistoric animals similar to that island, but they are not explained in any way. <br /> <br /> History is horrible beyond imagination. In fact, I can't believe he didn't get out of this movie. The relationship between Polly and Joe is unmotivated, and throughout the film is based on distrust and deception. Why is the Morris Paley character present there too? We are not in any way convinced that Joe is a hero - I mean that he flies on a plane and has saved a person (Polly) for personal reasons. Yes, there is a great hero for you. Dex has very little time on the screen, so why should we care about Joe who wants to save him? Who was the Nepalease that blocked Joe and Polly in the mine vault, and why they would do it (remembering that the entire Totenkopf operation was robotized?) <br /> <br /> Holes in the plot: (1) Why did the character of Bai Ling (a major fall from his excellent character in "The Crow") stop the robots that had captured Joe? They were looking for vials and had not found them. (2) Why the hell would Dex be captured but not killed (he doesn't or doesn't know vials, and the bad guys didn't know that Polly had vials and was connected to Joe and then to Dex)? (3) Polly indicates that "they" know nothing about Totenkopf, yet she has a secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete FBI-style file about him. (4) The empty point on the map as described by the Nepalese - if they know everything about this mysterious area, then why the hell is their map empty at that point? (5) At one point, Polly and Joe must give up their clothes (they burned) - Joe is given new clothes identical to his old clothes, but Polly is forced to wear a bulky dress with a very strange look, so same line of continuity, suddenly Polly has her original clothes. <br /> <br /> * sigh *. How far should I spend my brain watching this shit? <br /> <br /> We should be uplifted by excessively produced music, even when nothing interesting or remotely hilarious is happening on the screen. <Br /> <br /> And acting? Should we be impressed by a series of bad British accents? Which character is not annoying? I think Ling Bai's dialogue is probably the best in the whole film (it doesn't have a single line). The dialogue was not a field and did not even rise to the level of cheese. It's just ugly and annoying. These people are neither heroic nor irresistible; I'm the kind of people you would like to ignore or disassociate with if you've had the misfortune to meet them in real life. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this movie has an above-average rating here IMDb. IMHO should be in competition with "Batman Forever" at the bottom 100 of all time.
