Don't get me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love the series as well as the films, but enough: Death On The Nile. Everyone did this! We know who dies. We know why they die. We know who the murderer is. We know how it was done. So I say enough already! Mr. Suchet could have used that fantastic talent in another Agatha Christie novel. I will say that the acting of all the actors was superb. The sets were fantastic and very realistic. I particularly liked David Soul, but was surprised by how "horrible" he was. I hope you don't look that way in "real" life! I honestly can't remember from other films if the end was the same. Somehow, I don't think so. I thought it was a brilliant touch if Mrs. Christie had written it that way. I would prefer it to end and then waste in prison!
