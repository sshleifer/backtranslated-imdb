Start with a nice note just to quickly falter and disappoint expectations. <br /> <br /> The Mac characters (Akshay Kumar) and Sam (John Abraham) are not built correctly before the Mac boss decides to attack him with three hostesses. The rest of the drama is about how Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) face situations that sometimes seem forced. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the cast, Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor, I thought he was wasted in the role of a moody chef. Akshay Kumar is tolerable, John Abraham is very bad he continues to stumble on furniture and Rajpal Yadav is the only thing he saves in the film. <br /> <br /> The second part of the film is fun at times, but in all a DUD (songs are boring) and a big disappointment if you hope for some healthy show and comedy.
