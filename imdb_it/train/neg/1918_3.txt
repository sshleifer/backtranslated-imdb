Everything depends on what you want from a twisters: Twisters movie, or a low budget character studio? <br /> <br /> John Schneider and Devon Sawa (which is why the sister bought it), and Devon Sawa, who switched to "Wild America", "Final Destination" and "Slackers" got his big chance here. So in a way, I was one of the first people to see it really take off. I don't know if it's an honor or a sin, I haven't seen how it works in recent films. <br /> <br /> "Night of the Twisters" all depends on personal taste, as I said, it all depends on what you want from a film with twisters: Twisters or a low-budget character studio.
