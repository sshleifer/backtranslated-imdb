I happened to run into this surf channel on the film. my first reaction was, "oh god not yet!". it's so fashionable to play late these days has become pretentious and frankly contemptible. for some reason, however, I stayed to watch it until the end. maybe it was my confidence in the actors, hoping they would give me something to cheer about. <br /> <br /> and surely ken and helena can act. furthermore, the film progresses towards something better towards the end and actually makes a point. <br /> <br /> helena bonham carter surprised me even with her character. Jane has a petty side that she uses to keep distance and repel pity. then again he has a soft side that seeks only love. the only thing that surprised me even more was the character of Branagh ... this was a triumph of acting, the film itself is nothing special. <br /> <br /> see if you are an acting student ... if you are looking for pure entertainment you can skip this. it's sean penn serious! oh my goodness, it was a little tough with a couple of jokes ... not for the tax evaders.
