Terrifying sequel to "L'ululato". This follows Karen White's funeral (she was killed at the end of the first film). Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee unfortunately) arrives there and tells Karen's brother, Ben (Reb Brown), that Karen was a werewolf. He will go to Transylvania to kill Striba (Sybil Danning), the werewolf. Ben and a collaborator of Karens (Annie McEnroe) join him. <br /> <br /> A terrible script, bad direction, inept editing and a really horrendous recital by Brown and McEnroe sink this by themselves. The werewolf effects are mostly kept in the dark - for good reason! They are terrible when you see them. Even the special effects subside - although I liked the comic coming from Danning's fingers. There is also a werewolf orgy that is particularly stupid and Danning takes off his top at least EIGHT times during the credits! <br /> <br /> There are some good things - I found the village in Transylvania to be funny - it seems to come from a Universal horror movie from the 1930s! There are interesting tricks of the camera between transition scenes; Brown and McEnroe have a good body and Lee and Danning are good at it - but they can't save it. Really - WHY did they do it? Where do they struggle to earn money ??? This is one of IMDb's top rated movies. Only this should tell you something. Presumably Danning was horrified when he saw the movie - I can see why! Not to be missed.
