I like late-day movies. I like B movies. I was hoping I'd like this movie. <br /> <br /> I could ignore the negative effects, the often atrocious music, the lines that induce the cringe. I could ignore the inexplicable events, and the fact that the film is constantly based on deus ex machina is excusable, given the argument. I could ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to achieve world peace are the bad guys. None of these things kill the movie. What kills this film is that it is simply boring and simple. Nothing really happens; almost all the scenes in the film are designed to push the morality of film creators to viewers, at the cost of actually having a coherent story or any kind of suspense. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a fun B-movie, look elsewhere. This film is simply boring.
