This is a film that is based exclusively on the controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticed. That's all. The dialogues are pathetic and the sensuality of the "sex scenes" is absolutely absent. Acting and dialogue are more suitable for high school children, however the theme is intended for an adult audience. It is a film without smudging and superficial. It could have been better if it had a story and more drama. Ah, moreover, another thing: why are the internal monologues so over-used? It all seems so cheap. All in all an embarrassing film for Romanian cinema, as well as for a mature audience that tries to see it. I know that the means are scarce but, it is not always an excuse for a film to flop like this. And please start using some good actors in your films and stop recycling them from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can't act!
