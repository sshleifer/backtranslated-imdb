Ok, 'enjoy' is a rather relative term, but flexibility is needed when dealing with a director of the caliber of James Glickenhaus. <br /> <br /> McBain is really one of the most ridiculous, beyond the action lines I've ever seen, without the bad advantage of The Exterminator. Other reviews have commented on the suspension of disbelief regarding the heroic medieval comedies of the film, but how about making a film in the Philippines set in Colombia? All the extras are Filipino. In fact, the only character who seems remotely Hispanic is the good old Victor Argo as the much insulted "El Presidente"! Oh yes, we also have Maria Conchita Alonso who stands out as a madman as a rebel leader. There are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this funny paean to the glories of American imperialism.
