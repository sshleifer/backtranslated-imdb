I was interested in seeing the move thinking that it could be a diamond in the rough, but the only thing I found was a bad writing, a horrible direction (the shooting sequences don't flow) even if the director could say it's what it is to be honest, it seems very uninspired and immature) the editing could have been done by anyone who had 2 video recorders and the stock was a low budget video. I would say that it wasn't even something as simple as a digital mini video. <br /> <br /> There are some simple ways to fix a film with what the director has, such as editing, etc. But it is obvious that he simply does not care. There is so much effort for this film like a ham sandwich. It could be improved, but that would mean extra work.
