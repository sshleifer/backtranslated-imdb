I searched for the right words to describe this film. At first I was inclined to simply jump to more significant issues, since the film does not reach a level worthy of comment. <br /> <br /> However, I stopped, perplexed about how to describe these things and a little intrigued by the challenge presented by the question: "What can you say about a movie like that?" Nonsense? No, it's not rubbish, garbage can be recycled into something useful. Greenhouse gases? No, it is not a greenhouse gas, greenhouse gases help plants grow healthy. <br /> <br /> Finally, I struck "Not even bad", a reworking of the phrase "It's not even wrong" sometimes used in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is hopelessly imperfect and not even worth correcting. That's right, Georgia Rule: Not even bad.
