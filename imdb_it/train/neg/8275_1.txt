(First of all, excuse my bad English) Of course only a movie starring Jessica Simpson can include serious jokes like this .. I'm a Norwegian and I felt offended and shocked by the creators of this movie that they didn't have time to do their research on the making of this American / "Norwegian" film. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country. <br /> <br /> So I'm posting my corrections for my frustration: -The country is called Norway, not Norway. - "Da" is Russian, not Norwegian. -The Norwegian priests never use those black cloaks with that white card for the neck, since the Protestant church is by far the dominant one - It is true that we have a traditional native folk dress (which we use only twice a year) but the dress in this film is more like a German dress. -I could not understand the so-called "Norwegian" in this film .. Jessica made no sense .. she made "Norwegian priests" <br /> <br /> The only thing I recognize is the Norwegian flag (and Viking hats, but what people think of Norway is so stereotyped - vikings !: O gosh) <br /> <br /> Well ... I think the people who made this movie will never read this comment. but at least I clarified some things and got rid of that frustration ..! <br /> <br /> I am proud of my country and would love it if people in the United States were less stereotyped and more accurate when they talk about this country. <br /> <br /> It was all ... Lenge levers Norge! ; p
