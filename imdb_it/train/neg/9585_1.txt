I remember seeing this movie in 1986 when it came out and what a terrible movie. The acting was atrocious, the plot was so fragile that it should or could not be washed away in a gust of wind. I think he put me to sleep on more than one occasion and I wasn't tired of remembering. Please avoid at all costs better still have all the teeth pulled out without the anesthetic cos which would be more fun. It is just a pity that I could not give a zero or negative score. I wish I hadn't wasted my money buying this from the video store all I can say is that the tape it had been on was still completely new almost surprising given that the film was so poor. If I remember correctly, I sat down and watched him with a girl I wanted to go out with and the fact that she was sitting next to me wasn't enough to keep me awake, how bad this movie was.
