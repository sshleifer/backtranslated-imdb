I couldn't wait to see this show given the quality of the actors and the fact that the Scott brothers were involved. Unfortunately my hopes have been broken! Once again we are led to believe that the KGB is a group of idiotic idiots who have no idea what they are doing. At one point there's a ridiculous scene where 4 KGB agents can't handle a CIA agent. I get tired of these distorted, one-sided and completely inaccurate portraits of the Spy game that went on during the Cold War. I find it ridiculous that the United States is unable to make objective films about their involvement in World War II and beyond. Just like the pathetic U-571, where we are led to believe that the United States has once again obtained the Enigma machine, completely false. <br /> <br /> To his credit, "The Company" is very well filmed and acted. The settings are also exceptionally well made. Alfred Molina performs a great performance like Keaton does (the conflict between them is very well done). I really wanted to enjoy this show and I will no doubt end up watching the other 2 episodes but I really wish US productions would stop trying to portray their Spies, the military, etc. As supermen who are intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet. It gets old fast and seriously compromises the plausibility of what could have been a 10/10. <br /> <br /> S
