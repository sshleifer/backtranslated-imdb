Just when you thought it was safe to return to the water ... <br /> <br /> Another computer generated a mutant croc in search of food for human lunch, unleashed by another of those structures that led mad science. The Gereco Biotech company is fiddling with research into growth hormones, casually releasing a baby crocodile that is evolving at an accelerated rate. <br /> <br /> The B-movie cast adds a touch of fun to this "genetic mistake" movie of monsters. "Costas Mandylor evokes Mick Dundee, Australian accent, hat, butt knife, jobs, as a specialist of croc hired by the manager of Gereco Joanna Pacula (.. wasted in the stereotyped role of the corrupt administrative manager who denies any involvement with the gigantic beast of his structure leaves free to innocent people.) Charles Napier is the local sheriff whose city is in danger and Jane Longenecker is her hot daughter, who works in the animal shelter.The star of soap art Matthew Borlenghi is the love interest of Longenecker, a local artist who welds sculptures (.. his brother is a victim of the croc). Of course, this skill will be very useful when our heroes will install a trap created for the croc, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide. <br /> <br /> The croc is never the less co nvincente as it unleashes through a reserve in search of food, the special effects of a low grade variety. Regarding the productions of Roger Corman who deal with renegade rebel monsters, I stick to the Carnosaur. The monster here is essentially a crocodile standing on its hind legs, often erect while chasing potential victims. I could hear Mandylor and the filmmakers who were challenging Dundee Crocodile with his crocodile hunter, and this imitation could amuse where the monster itself fails. Borlenghi and Longenecker really have a good chemistry together on the screen. As expected, Pacula gets his store hilariously (.. gulp).
