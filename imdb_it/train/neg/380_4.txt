I wonder if there is a sense of meaning in this film. It's a big joke. Well .. It's funny .. You see the most stupid plot that is played very seriously in the form of a movie .. I wonder what audience this film is basically focused on. <br /> <br /> Priety) plays a surrogate mom for a happy Salman / Rani couple who wants a child but can't. I wonder how it would be if this drama were a real take-off from the life of a true couple. <br /> <br /> Rani looks happy with another beautiful lady in her home who was taken to have a baby for her and Salman. He takes care of Priety and tries to push her husband Salman to Preity so they can have some romance. When the public is fed up with Salman's nakhras. <br /> <br /> Although it is a good pastime, this film is unbearable. Absurd.
