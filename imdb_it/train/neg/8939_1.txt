Yes, I saw the sharp cuts. Unpublished sex scenes. The terrible scenes. Almost on a par with the movie 'The Need' for horrible acting. This film is as bad as bad movies. Bad script, bad acting, bad effects, bad locations, bad stunts all hurt. The best "actors" in the film were the dancers they hired for vampire extras! <br /> <br /> Sean Harry, the "mad actor" as someone else said, makes a match so talented here. His incredible ability to drive a car badly, when it is obviously shaken by people on the hood (check the reflection in the windshield), his inability to turn left, which is classy. OH and don't forget the sex scene. besides its noteworthy use of a toy pistol that the props could not even be bothered to disguise themselves as a real gun. The other actors on the screen could barely convey their lines. It was like half the time they were waiting for a line that wasn't there! <br /> <br /> The "special effects" were really good to the point that the guys who did it got their real name from the end credits! <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh at a party then rent this movie ... then again there are a lot of good comedies that are just as fun and don't give money to people who don't deserve it.
