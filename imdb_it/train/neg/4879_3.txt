Is there anything worse than a comedy that lacks humor? The answer is yes; one that fails to generate any interest throughout the image. The premise is not bad - a naive man in front of an illegal business - but this is a pot-boiler with a poor script and script and it just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Was it considered a good "B" in 1942? Hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of the photo is the cast, which contains several famous faces from the 1930s and 1940s, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always dismissed Richard Cromwell as the weak man who killed Gary Cooper in "Lives of a Bengal Lancer ", so I wasn't counting it). <br /> <br /> I can't recommend it and I gave it a rating of 3 - if you have a choice, take a root canal.
