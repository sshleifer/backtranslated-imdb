This "film" is the culmination of all that is bad for modern cinema. slow movement not necessary, throwing / jumping / unnecessary flips, unnecessary characters, useless dialogues ... practically useless. (is it a word? well, it was just invented by I, Robot.) <br /> <br /> What happened to the practicality? (ie the garage of the car, the spray for the skin) the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic functionality is the shot of paper in the bar. <br /> <br /> What happened to show respect for women? (for example, the character of smith does nothing but degrade the doctor for the best part of the film, yet she "wants" him. WHAT THE TENSION? I'll tell you where, beautiful and not admiration or common ground) <br /> <br /> What happened to a detective detecting? Smith did nothing but sit and feel sorry for himself, complaining to other people, and when they said something that aroused a suspicion of being outside. this is a lame way to get the story from point b-c-d-etc ... it went well once, but not several times in a row. (speaking of several times in a row, what was the "I'm snoring and not listening to your joke? Twice in a scene?) <br /> <br /> What happened to the small parts of a movie being quite significant and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes? Shia LaBeouf (the child) is in the film for a total of TWO SCENES, we know that A-he degrades women, and B-he knows Smith ....... so of COURSE we should worry about him and if he comes or not to hurt, <br /> <br /> what happened to Hero's? let's forget that there are people, women and children everywhere attacked by robots and selfishly saving the one in my opinion that I have a knowledge and why he had to slide the bicycle up in the air, showing off, while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a few seconds on foot. <br /> <br / > do not misunderstand me, I am everything for the show, but they are also all for a shred of realism and meaning fied. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I have never laughed so hard in a movie myself for a long time. so thank you Alex. <br /> <br /> I pray for the swing of the social pendulum to return to simpler techniques, simpler stories and simpler everything else in the movies ...... but mainly the simplest techniques. <br /> <br /> Budget Action Movies: "You Must Die"
