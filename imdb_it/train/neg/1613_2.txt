Now Che Che (2008) has finished his relatively short run to Australian cinema (extremely limited release: 1 screen in Sydney, after 6 weeks), I can join the two guests of "At The Movies" to Steven Soderbergh. <Br /> <br /> It is usually satisfying to see a director change his style / subject, but Soderbergh's most recent stinker, The Girlfriend Experience (2009), also lacked a story, so fiction (and editing? ) seems to be suddenly Soderbergh's main challenge. Strange, after 20-odd years in the business. He probably never was very good at fiction, he simply hid it in "sharp" projects. <br /> <br /> None of these excuse this present, almost diabolical failure. As David Stratton warns, "two parts of Che do not (either) do a whole". <br /> <br /> The epic biographical film in name only, Che (2008) hardly qualifies as a feature film! He certainly has no legs, as except for his unusual final resolution imposed by history, Soderbergh's long 4.5-hour long road is nowhere to be found. <br /> <br /> Even Margaret Pomeranz, the most permissive of Australia at the duo cinema, has noticed the repetitive waste of Soderbergh (HD digital storage): "you're in the woods ... you're in the woods ... you're in woods ... ". I too am surprised that Soderbergh has not provided us with another 2.5 hours of THAT between his two existing parts, because he has still left out massive blocks of Che's "revolutionary" life! <br /> <br /> For a biographical film by an important but notorious historical figure, Soderbergh strangely distances, if not deliberately insults, his audience from <br /> <br /> 1. never providing the most of the history of Che; <br /> <br /> 2. imposing unreasonable film lengths by simply repeating dullards; <br /> <br /> 3. ignoring both true hindsight and event narration; <br /> <br /> 4. barely develop an idea or a character; <br /> <br /> 5. remaining claustrophobically episodic; <br /> <br /> 6. ignoring the appropriate context for the scenes --- whatever we get is mired in timeshift disruption; <br /> <br /> 7. linguistic dislocation of the whole public (even the Spanish will be confused by the inconsistent expositions in English); and <br /> <br /> 8. unnecessarily whitewashing its main subject in one dimension. Why, at this late stage? The T-shirt series was a success! <br /> <br /> The sense of claustrophobia is certainly due to Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen who base their script exclusively on Guevara's memories. Thus, as a poor student who has only read ONE of his texts assigned for his assignment, Soderbergh's product is extremely limited in perspective. <br /> <br /> The public is held captive within the same bound knowledge, scenario and circumstances of the "revolutionaries", but this does not arouse our sympathy. Instead, it occurs to us that "Ah, Soderbergh is trying to limp his audience the way Latin American peasants were at the time." But these are the same illiterate Latin American peasants who sold the good doctor to his enemies. Why does Soderbergh feel the need to identify with them and to keep us mentally prisoners? Such a public must have a purpose. <br /> <br /> Part2 is more chronological than Part1, but is literally intriguing with its repetitiveness, the unhappiness of perspective and the lack of variety or character arcs. DelToro's Che has no chance to grow as a person as he struggles to educate his battered troops. The only relief is the humor with which Che faces his sometimes profoundly ignorant "revolutionaries", some of whom violently lack self-control around peasants or local food. Certainly we do not understand what caused the conditions, nor any strategic analysis of their guerrilla uprising, for example. <br /> <br /> The terrible countdown of the Part2 remains terribly episodic: once again, nothing is wired or contextualized. So even the scenes with Fidel Castro (Demi√°n Bichir) are unexpected and disconcerting. All the selected events are portrayed minimally and in Latin-centric, with Part 1 interviews replaced by meetings that change the time between the corrupt Bolivian president (Joaquim de Almeida) and US government officials who promise the CIA intervention (! ). <br /> <br /> the rest of the "woods" of the Part2 and the day-for-night blue filter exasperate the audience until they look at the exits. <br /> <br /> Perhaps DelToro has felt the frustration of many non-American Latins too acutely that they never got a truthful and unexpressed story of Che's exploits within their countries. When foreign governments do not deliver a free press to their people yet - for whatever reason - then you can see how a popular American indie producer could try to attract the not-well-educated ("I can't be able to read or write, but I am NOT illiterate! "- cf. Inspector General (1949)) in their local cinemas. The obvious neglect and the gross simplifications of the film strongly suggest that only the comprehensions of the less informed English that still speaks English are aimed. If they did, they would have already read the tomes on the subject and criticized the relevant social issues among themselves - learning the lessons of history as they should. <br /> <br /> Such insights are precisely what societies still need - and not just the remaining Latinos illiterate in Central and South America, but it is what Che (2008) fails to deliver cheerfully. Soderbergh buries his advantage because he is weak in fiction. I'm amazed that Benicio DelToro deliberately chose Soderbergh for this project if he knew. It was 44 years, Guevara's hindsight was much sought after: that's what I went to see this film for, but the director steals us diabolically. <br /> <br /> David Stratton, writing in The Australian (03-Oct-2009) noted that while Part1 was "bumpy", Part2 actually "quickly goes down" from there, "tracing the final campaign of the That in Bolivia in harrowing details ", that" ... seems almost unbearably slow and turgid ". <br /> <br /> Che: La Guerilla alias Part2 is certainly not a travel diary for Bolivia, portraying it as an image of misery and atavism. The entire second part is only redeemed by the mood mentioned above, and the dramatic - but tragic - capture and execution of the subject of the film. <br /> <br /> The rest of this endless cinematic truth is just confusion, unhappiness. - Joking, for a Soderbergh film, to be avoided at all costs. It is destined to break the heart of all those who know even a smattering on the subject. (2/10)
