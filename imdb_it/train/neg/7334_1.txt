I consider Stuart Bliss the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible and the plot ridiculous. The fact is that the wife of the main character who left him triggered a mental breakdown, but it became so silly and boring, after a while I could have cared less about any character. <br /> <br /> The film continued the same ideas over and over again without anything fresh or surprising to add to the plot. Everything with the Geiger counter became too much after a while after Stuart started to open the wall to see what was behind it after the counter indicated that there was something. <br /> <br /> Then there were the repetitive scenes with the flyer, and the confused ones where he meets himself. <br /> <br /> I should have imagined that this movie was a flop when I didn't recognize any of the actors. Do yourself a favor when this movie arrives, read a book! You will be better.
