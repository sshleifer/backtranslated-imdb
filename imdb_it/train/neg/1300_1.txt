This film should never have been made. Honestly, I must admit that before seeing him I had serious doubts. The director is not a great actress, even though she has shot many films in the Netherlands, and the young woman who has taken the main part is a TV personality with a constant smile on her face and not much self-criticism. The actor who played the other main part that I saw recently in Bride Flight and although the film is better, didn't convince me. To start with the story, I didn't read the novel on which it is based, but the script that underlies the film is something that could have been done thinking of children having a birthday party on a rainy Sunday afternoon, not some of the the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie. Something really disturbing was the overdubbed dialogues, it was most often pronounced aloud. My greetings go to the cameraman, at least he tried to do something about it. Too bad the film has been changed badly, otherwise some scenes were certainly more credible.
