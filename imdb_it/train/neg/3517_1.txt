I don't know who wrote the script for this film, but I was irritated from the first moment. Of all the possible decisions you could make in the mountains, why do they make the decision, which is the most dangerous of all? Why do criminals behave in a stupid way, even if they managed to get a huge amount of money from a bank and get away with it? Why doesn't the main criminal land the helicopter, shoot Stallone, take the money and fly away with the girl as a hostage? And there are more cases of illogical behavior. I would give this film 5 points for a beautiful action and a fantastic landscape panorama, but due to the illogical behavior of the characters, I can only give this film 1 point ...
