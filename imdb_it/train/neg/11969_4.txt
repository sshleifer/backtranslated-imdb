If you like to be entertained, don't go see this movie. If you like to see the heroism of war, don't go see this movie. If you like to see good acting and an excellent script, don't go see this movie. If you like the typical Hollywood war films that end just in time to politically appeal to the public about the greatness and glory of war, GO TO THIS MOVIE. Otherwise, don't waste time. I am always interested in war films because I think that if they are done well, they can teach us something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war. This film shows a group of kids running around the countryside, saying horrible lines of clicks, doing more predictable things and defending the oppressed with the same force and brutality that was given to the oppressed. This film is a disgrace for the cinema and for the United States of America! Can you imagine being a person from Europe or Africa, or from any other country and looking at this, being told that this is how Americans really are? No wonder everyone hates us! Please, please, please, don't waste your time with this piece of junk; if you have to, wait and rent it. 4/10
