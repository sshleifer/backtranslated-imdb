Always enjoy great films that treat the super-natural and profound thoughts of the spiritual world. However, this film simply pushed me to its production and direction. There is nothing to learn about what this story has to tell; all I can say is that it was a great waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen. The actors, namely: Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, gave an exceptional performance in his native England, and we saw him in "Still Standing" a TV series. Heath Ledger, played the real bad man and we saw him recently in "Brokeback Mountain", the 05, he gave a great supporting role. Shannyn Sossaman, (Mara Sinclair), did a good job in seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith. Don't waste time, you'll regret it!
