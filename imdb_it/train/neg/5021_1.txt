This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The story was boring, the dialogue was atrocious and the agitation played. I'm not sure this film is the result of a film school homework project, but it certainly played as such. Nor has it particularly happened in its central conception of trying to look like a single continuous shot. The horizontal pans of the horizontal camera are a cheap and unoriginal way to hide the cuts.
