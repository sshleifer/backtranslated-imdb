I remember watching ATTACK when it came out and I picked it up again recently. The science fiction channel has gotten worse, but not by much. A shameless trick of Jurassic Park, ATTACK replaces sabertooth cats for dinosaurs. And I'm on the loose, devouring as many extras as possible. The CGI is rather poor and the close-ups of the prosthetic cat's heads are ridiculous. We get some blood, which helps a little. Wait until you see how the mad scientist who started this whole mess has it. In addition to Robert Carradine, who has very little to do, the cast is unknown. Apparently this was shot in Fiji. Good job if you can get it. It reminds me of all those low budget STV monsters that were popular in the 80s and 90s.
