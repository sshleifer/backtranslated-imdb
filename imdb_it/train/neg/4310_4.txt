This film is about a very sexy Olympic star who is hired to coach a basketball team of high school kids. Similar to Goldie Hawn's WILDCATS, she plays Cathy Lee Crosby in the title role, and does it more or less as the script allows. I think Racquel Welch would have been a better choice, but considering the film's apparent film budget, they probably couldn't afford it. Cathy Lee looks great in every shot, but we never see her completely naked. The story is quite predictable, to say the least, without surprises. A young and lucky Michael Biehn has the role of male protagonist. He is the protagonist of the team and also the love interest for Cathy Lee. Keenan Wynn has some fun scenes like the rich old man who runs the athletic program and doesn't think a woman should train sports. This point is raised throughout the film and, needless to say, is dated. Ironically, Cathy Lee does not put her team into any unorthodox practice session; she does nothing that a coach would not do. There is a fun subplot involving a tall and lackluster player who undergoes hypnosis to pass his lessons and play like the professional basketball player Sydney Wicks. It seems everyone has had fun making this film, but the only real reason to see it is Cathy Lee Crosby. She is not a great actress, but she has a dazzling smile, beautiful hair and a very tanned body.
