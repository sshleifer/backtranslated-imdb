this movie starts with a normal funeral ... and insists so hard on this normal funeral feeling that I lost interest within 5 minutes of watching, and started skipping the scenes. it seems to me that anyone who has made this film is afflicted to the point of being trapped in a morbid and permanent trance, unable to contemplate anything but death and destruction. Well, I'm not one of the dark Southpark kids, I want a movie that in 10 minutes feels good in an interesting story, I'm not going to sit and watch 10 minutes of nothing but the preparations for a funeral .. my grandmother in her last years she was fascinated by funerals, perhaps she could have enjoyed this "movie".
