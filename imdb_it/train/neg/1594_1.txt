Wow. This movie bored my pants when I saw it. Bland, useless and immobile. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Ash and co. he can travel through time with the help of "The Spirit of the Forest" ("Princess Mononoke" a lot?) There, they meet a boy named Sam, and the "plot" begins. <br /> <br /> So Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) get up with nature, become hippies and try to free Celebi (the "Spirit") from a boy hunter of weirdness. I don't even know what else happened. Everything went into a blur. Ash's friends were barely inside, and all the fighting scenes were boring. <br /> <br /> After saving the day, Ash and his infamous friends have to go back to their time as they watch Sam float away with Celebi (that scene was just creepy. OO;) Then, after returning to their time, Ash learns that his new friend is actually the rival's grandfather. And I think so. Quite retarded right? If you love your children, you will not expose them to this. (1 of 10.)
