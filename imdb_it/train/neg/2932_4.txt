Not that he cared, but I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends. If you were, there would be a good chance of failing if you continue to make waste like this. The trouble is that he found a successful formula like the bumbling and ordinary kind of next door in Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run, etc., but it's starting to wear out. Here his character has no perceptible qualities, he is rude and hateful, and he thinks he is funny when he is not. Once moved to New York from London (and I assume this link is intended to attract viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), it proves equally out of place with his new colleagues. However, it is surprising if in his cheerful japes he takes on a stripper in disguise to appear in an editorial meeting an act of revenge for his boss. Yet, somehow, Kirsten Dunst starts to warm it up, even if she hasn't done anything nice. Oh, and since he is a superficial male he falls for Megan Fox at first sight, perhaps because his character is as superficial as his. All of this represents a predictable conclusion of the film, even if I can't see any viewer expressing the way this has reflected his life. The shame is that on paper this is a cast that is worth watching. Pegg, however, plays himself, Kirsten Dunst seems to go on with the movements, without creating any chemistry on the screen, and Megan Fox is not at all tense. The only big advantage is Miriam Margolyes, the owner of Pegg in New York - now if she had been on the screen longer .....
