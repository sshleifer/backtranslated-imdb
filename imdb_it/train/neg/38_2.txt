or someone who was praying for the vision of Al Cliver struggling with a naked black 7 feet tall in a complete nelson, your movie has arrived! The starlet Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group that asks for the ransom of $ 6 million to be delivered to their refuge on the island. What they don't count on is Vietnam veteran Peter Weston (Cliver), hired by a film producer to save the girl. And the one they didn't count on was a local tribe who loved to offer young women to their monster cannibal god with bloodied eyes. <br /> <br /> Practically the same footage created as CANNIBALS, this goes a little better when it comes to entertainment value, thanks especially to a fun dub track and the incredibly stupid monster with bulging eyes (Franco confirms that they were ping pong uniforms on the disk interview). Franco gets a supporting cast of EuroCult, including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the things he scratches the head I've ever seen as a boy who isn't totally he is shown - in the foreground - trying to be him). The film has tons of nudity and the gore (variety of colors Tempra) is there. The highlight for me was the slow fistfight of the world between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the crashing waves. Sadly, the old Jess leads him to a surprising (and, at times, agonizing) 1 hour and 40 minutes in which he would have to run 80 minutes at most. <br /> <br /> For the most part, Severin's DVD looks very nice but there are some strange ghosting going on during some darker scenes. Furthermore, a long dialogue section is in Spanish without subtitles (they are an option, but only when you listen to the French track). Franco gives a 16-minute interview on the film and has much more pleasant things to say about Buchfellner than his star CANNIBALS Sabrina Siani.
