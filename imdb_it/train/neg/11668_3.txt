There are some beautiful landscape shots. Writers who put their mouths in the mouths of the actors. With minor actors this show would be silly. "Art must elevate humanity or it is BS." It is not so because the art of all those mentioned is also to arouse humanity and express the dark side. The main character also says that those who don't drink hide the dark side. Wrong, he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being a dimension by not expanding his horizons with anything other than landscapes. There was no organism breathing in his work, nor an expression of his pain. All the artist did was to limit himself to a dozen landscapes. The discussions between the characters were from elementary school, trivial things that always gave the character the upper hand that the writer wanted. I tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments here. I had to dig deep to see who I agreed with. I imagine the great comments were from those connected to the film. I was moved only once towards the end. The boy was too passive. The scenery was beautiful and the music ridiculous. Just my opinion, but nowhere show for me.
