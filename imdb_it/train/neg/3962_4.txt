I could not wait to see Nana after seeing the fantastic debut work of Renoir, Whirlpool of Fate. I had read that Nana was generally considered her best silent film, so I had high hopes. Unfortunately this seemed like a huge step backwards. <br /> <br /> Catherine Hessling is the main problem with this film. His acting is exaggerated, even for a silent film. His acting is more like what you'd expect in a movie from the early teenage years, not towards the end of the 1920s. He usually has the same face, which reminds me (I'm sorry to say) of someone with constipation pains. It was also very difficult to believe that any man would have fallen for this femme fatale. There was nothing fascinating about her. <br /> <br /> The film was also quite long, camera work was of little interest (apart from a stroke of a horse race) and editing was boring. History reminded me of Pabst's Pandora's box. It is interesting to compare the two because there are only 3 years between these films. Pandora's Box simply marks at every level where Nana fails. <br /> <br /> This film is only for the Renoir finalists or for serious serious film fans.
