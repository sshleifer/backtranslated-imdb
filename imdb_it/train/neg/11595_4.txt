STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Alice, after defeating Freddy at the end of the last film, is now trying to readjust his life. But her unborn child is bringing a demonic presence - Freddy, trying to get out of their world again. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note the directors who got their great breaks directing Freddy's films - Charles Russell (Eraser, The Mask) Renny Harlin (The Long Kiss Goodnight, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2 and here Stephen Hopkins (Lost in Space, Predator 2) But while Russell and Harlin did a good job, Hopkins IMO did something about a podge with this voice, which should soon be forgotten. <br /> <br /> The story is clearly stretched as far as it can go here, with Freddy ridiculously a father himself and the ridiculous looking demon child. Even at about an hour and a half, everything gets pretty tiring, and, of course, it's not at all scary. <br /> <br /> The catch-phrase "bon appetit, bitch" is the only memorable point of this very forgettable entry essay. *
