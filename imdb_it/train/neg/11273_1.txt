How can you bring together this respectable cast of young British actors and invent such a huge amount of filmic manure? Horrible script, annoyingly chaotic camera, terribly modified, terribly mismanaged. Only Rhys Ifans tries to fill his role with life. Another painful test that "different" sometimes equates to "dreck". Why can't money people read screenplays in advance? Do yourself a favor: save yourself and do something else - like hitting a hammer on your knees. It's less painful and more fun than this movie!
