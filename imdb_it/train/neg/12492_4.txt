This is one of those movies that has a fantastic video box, but it has a wired film work and unknown actors who talk to wrong dialogues. It's so dark when the killing happens that you can hardly see it and the film is hard to understand. The only star in this is Vanessa Sanchez from WCW (Tygres in WCW before she folded) and she is a good actress. I particularly like low budget movies that have mistakes because they are fun to watch but Severed is not one of them. It's not a movie for you if you don't like voodoo and severed heads but this is not a blockbuster but if you need something new to watch then rent Severed.
