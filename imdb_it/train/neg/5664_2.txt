I liked Boyle's performance, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Everything was exaggerated to the point of absurdity. Most of the actors talked as if you were expecting your 9-year-old nephew to speak if he was pretending to be a tired, stone-hearted policeman, or an ultra-evil villain. The shrill voices seemed amateurish. I could go buy a cheap synthesizer and get better opening music. And what about all the 1984 police torture stuff? It was completely superfluous and had nothing to do with the real events of history. Cox added a lot of things, in fact, that apparently he thought would be very nice, but it had nothing to do with the story. This is a great disappointment because one of the things that makes Borges' stories so beautiful is its minimalism: they are closely linked, without superfluous details. This film is just the opposite. I stopped looking after the scene where Lonnrot is questioning the guy from Yidische Zaitung, or so. I wasted $ 4 on rent, but at least I can get some satisfaction by writing this review and hoping to save others from making the same mistake.
