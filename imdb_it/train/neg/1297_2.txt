Basically I took this movie because I saw the brilliant Zatoichi remake of Kitano Takashi and I was in the mood for another updated samurai who also played Asano Tadanobu. These two films are worlds apart. Zatoichi added humor and depth to his characters and subverted the traditional clich√©s of samurai films. Gojoe goes the other way in the opposite direction. <br /> <br /> First of all, I hate movies that have other characters that inform the public about the main character instead of having the character develop over the course of the film. "You can't decide if you are a monk or a warrior," says almost every character in Benkei's presence, yet this inner turmoil is barely transmitted within the character itself. Instead of character development, we get bloated, boring, and bloody battle scenes. Asano's character is not developed and he too looks bored and doesn't know what he's doing there. I know he usually looks distant and cool and that's part of Asano's charm, but he doesn't need this movie. <br /> <br /> Much of the camera movement is nauseating. There is a scene that goes on forever where the camera turns around the main characters until my wife and I hear vomiting. The finish is ridiculous and rather anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> Too bad that nowadays, with this kind of budget, really good samurai films are not made in Japan. The colors, the landscapes and the costumes were fantastic, but the rest is just a very waste of time. I'd rather see one of the kabuki versions of this myth.
