If there were a score of 0 stars, I would be happy to hand it to this absolutely awful pile of waste. The fact that the summary is perfect and that, had it been made different, could have been brilliant only by making it worse. The fundamental task of blocking a group of people in an experimental chamber is fine, but WHERES THE EXPERIMENT? All I see are a group of non-intelligent surfers and blondes who talk about music and culture that I don't know or don't want to know ... The challenges are pathetic and silly. The whole point of TV reality is to show REALITY. If you set a "challenge", don't let them play with exaggerated food objects and stereotyped cultural elements in the "Friday night games". have them do a real challenge. And as for the "earn" jackpot, that's fine, if they actually earned it! These people are crazy. If only they could make the show better, the current idea would be glorious. But it won't happen!
