This is a Western action. James Steart is the head of a star cast in the evocative north-west, which is filmed in great splendor. The scenery and costumes are fantastic. There is action and adventure. Stewart plays a wealthy cattle farmer who comes across a dishonest government in the old Nothwest. <br /> <br /> The main disadvantage is the cynical stereotype that Hollywood has always turned into a hero. Even when this film was made, the cynic was the stereotypical hero, and what Stewart portrays has very little thanks for salvation. He is kind to his two partners and this gives him an extra dimension of credibility and sympathy. <br /> <br /> However, he is so lazy for everyone else, it's hard to really take care of him, or accept it. It is very similar to Western one-dimensional spaghetti (not cut so badly). <br /> <br /> Minor characters are still very funny. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan and others make him worth seeing.
