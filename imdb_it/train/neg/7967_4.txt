I might not be a great admirer of the original "Creepshow", but its sequel trash makes that anthology similar to perfection! And to think that I was waiting for this I would like more. Five years after his predecessor, George Romero returns to the Comic EC-style path and in this play he shoots the screenplay of Steve King's three stories. However, the direction has passed to Michael Gornick. The film mostly wobbles in that aspect with Gornick's uneven brushes. But most of the blame should go to Romero's terribly static and unbearably cruel script (especially in those dialogues that cross the first and last story). Moralistic messages (mostly coming from a group of harsh characters) simply took over from black humor. Oh, it was painful and the same can be said for the lively rotten musical score that accompanies the image. The loose connection of the three stories (Old Chief Woodenhead, The Raft and The Hitchhiker) together is a delicately curious and effective enveloping story, made in the form of nostalgic animation (1980s). I really liked this segment and the creep character of Wisecracking was a shining light. <br /> <br /> # The first story "Old Chief Woodenhead" sees two elderly owners (George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour) in a department store in a dying native community, Dead River. Let yourself be robbed and finally killed by a pair of punks who die to survive in Hollywood. In front of the shop there is a wooden statue of an Indian chief who comes to live to avenge their deaths. <br /> <br /> - Listen to George Kennedy's waffles .. And waffle for 10 minutes on how he engaged with his "big" community. What a pleasant and delicate weather. Well, just like Kennedy's speeches, this is a monotonous and colorless object that never makes a good premise. The overbearing script is trivial and the performances are appropriate. These two factors have really increased my headache. When the Indian comes to life and becomes an avenger, the killers encounter a very rapid (though frighteningly) death in the right way. The effects were commendably made, but with regard to hair flowing freely. How could Hollywood bring back that lock of hair? Ugh! <br /> <br /> # Second story "The Raft" follows a group of drug smokers and yahoo teens heading for a secluded lake. After swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake, they are trapped on the platform because of a threatening-looking creature lurking in the water. <br /> <br /> - Now this is much better, MUCH better. What starts when your basic teens collide turns into a mysteriously creepy whole full of tense and claustrophobic tension. And it doesn't even flash the nudity or the contemptuous splatter. It is quite morbid and also applies to his sense of humor. The surprisingly ironic finish has a beautiful touch. The performances of the nobles are acceptable without leaving a huge mark. Gornick's direction sticks to the bad and rather sticky side. While, the alarming soundtrack on this occasion has pressed the right chords. The mud-like creature in the lake (as many have already said) looks like a icky black tarot (yes, you're reading well!) Floating on water. <br /> <br /> # Finally the third issue ends with "The Hitchhiker". A rich woman, but sexually poor, is returning home after being with her male gigol√≤, but is late. Thinking of some ideas to explain her delay, if necessary, she slips off the road and accidentally hits a hitchhiker. Instead of checking or getting help, she walks away hoping to get home before her husband. Soon she is terrified by the mutilated corpse of the dead hitchhiker. <br /> <br /> -It's not terrible, but I actually couldn't get into this ridiculous ridiculous exercise. Compared to the first two this was very different in tone and tried instead to tickle the funny bone. Lois Chiles agreed in the lead role, but that constant reassurance and the conversations she had with herself became pitifully aggravating and definitely tired. The effects of vivid makeup are well displayed and drip with vision. When it hits the hitchhiker it is when it becomes frenetic, picky and exaggerated in its execution. From then on do we feel our supposed dead hitchhiker endlessly repeat and repeat? and repeat the phrase, "Thanks for the ride lady!" It happens every time he decides to invest it. Have a little courtesy for the deceased darling. <br /> <br /> In all, the second story "The Raft" and the unpleasant and well-conceived effects are what elevate this extremely inferior sequel.
