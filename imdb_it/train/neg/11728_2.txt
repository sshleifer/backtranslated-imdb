Previously I enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action films and I expected a lot more, even from a 5.8 IMDb score, the film fails to entertain and although the story is subtle and unoriginal, the acting is unfortunately more subtle and goes to mimic a "worst case scenario" of interpreting "strong" feelings accompanied by bad acting ... Don't test your time this movie is not funny, if you want to cry it might be enough, even if your tears will cry because of the Wesley Snipes view in the tragic action movie wannabe comedy ... I gave this 2/10 really horrible, if you want to watch a decent movie go see shooter or rent it, it's all good this movie is not.
