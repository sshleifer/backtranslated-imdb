Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent to New York by his uncle (Richard Tucker) to experience life before he inherits $ 25 million. His uncle paid 3 women Jacqui (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carole Lombard) to accompany him and make sure he didn't fall in love with gold diggers. One of these women Cleo (Geneva Mitchell) shows up on the scene for the disapproval of women. We follow the story as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their role as a chaperone who agreed to carry out for the 3 months that Bill is in New York, while Bill meets Cleo and another woman. In the end, love is in the air for Bill and another ............. <br /> <br /> Image quality and sound quality are scarce in this movie. The story is interspersed with musical numbers, but the songs are bad and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice. Rogers isn't even that good. It's pleasant enough, but it really comes to life only when the drums or trombone plays. There is a very annoying character who plays a taxi driver (Roscoe Karns) and the film is simply boring.
