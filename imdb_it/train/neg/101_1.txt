Amateur, no budget movie can be surprisingly good ... but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is horrible, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promises. The "direction" of the camera requires serious reworking. No more "keeping the camera and performing gimmicks"; it just doesn't work The special effects are unimaginative, there is a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you intend to tear off an ear, please do not let us see the actor's real ear under the blood. The scenery is dull and boring (like the other Mr. Sykes), and the music is a cross between the cheap motel and the really bad metal (see the comment on the landscape). <br /> <br /> Did I mention the lack of a real plot or character development? Apparently, the writer didn't do it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is financing this guy ... please, stop. I've seen some of his other "home movies" (which I won't link to) and they're just as bad. Normally, a "director" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur director, but anyone can be a hack. <br /> <br /> Certainly not even a popcorn movie ... of course, chewing popcorn grains would be less painful than this effort. <Br /> <br /> Award: the worst military push-up ever seen in a movie.
