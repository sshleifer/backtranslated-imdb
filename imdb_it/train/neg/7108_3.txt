After seeing the titles with a single name that I recognize and who was the preacher in this film (Russ Conway), I didn't expect much from this film and I wasn't disappointed. A man is planning to kill his new wife by convincing other people that he is crazy and will take his own life. Unbeknownst to her husband is that the plastic skull she uses, by contrast, a ghost of a woman apparently his first dead wife has revenge in his mind and uses a real skull. A simple plot with a touch of irony at the end. If you are tired late one night and need sleep, this will help you sleep that sleep.
