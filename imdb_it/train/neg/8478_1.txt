This film was probably the biggest waste of my life ever. The acting was pathetic. Jordan Hinson could not show upset emotions. At the beginning of the film, she had to be discouraged. Instead, she swung her head with the protruding lower lip. He sobbed pitifully without tears for the scene of tears. I was almost angry that among all the girls who wanted to be actresses, they had to tear it up. All the others also suffered from over-acting. He was flat out annoying. It was also an insult to appearing as a skater. Jordan took a month to train and they chose her as a person who makes the Olympic team. He's practically spitting on the effort that real figure skaters put into their work. A pitiful excuse for a film, and a painful attempt to associate hockey and skating. Do not waste your life. It doesn't even deserve a star.
