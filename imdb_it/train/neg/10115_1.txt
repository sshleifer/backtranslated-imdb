I made it my personal mission to go after the people responsible for this movie. I also got the rental company to give me my money back because I claimed that they committed misleading advertising. <br /> <br /> It's not enough for the film to be a movie in itself, but the cover is what sold me. I made better makeup effects on my kids on Halloween than what the movie actually represents compared to the cover. Can you say "raccoon eyes?" <br /> <br /> I'm not going to waste any more time entering all the details, but come on, the main character in the movie is a Los Angeles cop who was born and raised in Alabama - but he has a German accent!?! It is beyond insulting.
