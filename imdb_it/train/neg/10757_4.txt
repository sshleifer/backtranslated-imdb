I just watched this movie on DVD last night and decided to take a look at this morning's reviews. It seems that "I, Robot" has polarized the critical visualization community here on IMDb (and has given rise to many insults and even denominations). <br /> <br /> I find this a bit surprising, as the film is not exceptional (or even good), but it is not terrible (or even very bad). What this film really is, is ... depressing. Depressing that the population of American spectators is so ready to become insipid, the clich√©s overheat and acclaim them as new spectacular works. This film as "reconstructed" was written all over the world, from the plot (a restless mix of Asimov and the modern action of the day) to the character of Smith (a cynic with an intelligent mouth with a titanium spine), to special effects (which has been borrowed from the Matrix and a few others. <br /> <br /> "I, Robot" is, unfortunately, very probably the perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial plot, insipidly snappy dialogue and lots of so much adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew it (it seems to be Hollywood's last failed attempt to create a black Bruce Willis.) The story has many holes, of all sizes, but I don't think most of the attracted people from this film you have a critical mind to note: maybe a blockbuster for today's standards, but a lot of B-movies compared to the real winners.
