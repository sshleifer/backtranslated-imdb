I know John Singleton is a smart guy who created Boyz N The Hood, so how did he write and direct this? It is like the pilot of a bad soap opera "going away to college for the first time", a parade of boring stereotypes and clich√©s with a gratuitous violence launched to make it a commercial proposal, I imagine. Who would have ever imagined that the date rape victim would dump the sausage for seafood? The lonely rabid would be plundered by a group of neo-Nazis (and would be full of a Jewish black E - just for the laughs!) Even Laurence Fishburne's gruesome reactionary history professor just annoyed me and I love the boy, he's like all those involved in this film have just lost the plot. Except Busta Rhymes, of course. Big increases.
