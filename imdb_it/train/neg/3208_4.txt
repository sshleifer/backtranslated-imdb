This film was a big disappointment for me. I was waiting for this film to come out for years, and I was a loyal follower of Chaos Comics until bankruptcy. Not only did they cut half the plot, but they altered the information. The claim that Lucifer is Hope's father is not true. He corrupted his father, but he himself is not his father. Even the voices didn't fit the characters, and once you hear the voice of a beloved character, the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned. I can't even remember all of this movie that was wrong. The bottom line is that if you love Lady Death you don't watch this movie. He simply did not do comic justice at all !!
