Ahh this movie has had so much potential! A good cast of quality B actors, Jessica Simpson's thighs and ... that's it! <br /> <br /> I think someone in an anonymous marketing department had an idea. Basically, we make a kind of legally blond movie, but we do it in New York. That great and brilliant city of opportunities, power and money and where everyone is a person without a heart, thirsty for money / power. Add to this Jessica Simpson, small town, that brother of Owen Wilson and for some apparent reason Andy Dick (just his fault you should ignore this movie). <br /> <br /> Baseline: <br /> <br /> The boy leaves the girl for New York, the girl follows, the boy cheats, the girl stays in New York with her cousin, gets a job under false pretenses, mami su, he is courted by another boy (brother Wilson) and together he saves the day and kisses. <br /> <br /> some words come to mind when reflecting on this film, namely terrible, terrible, unbearable, intolerable and xenophobic <br /> <br /> Just don't watch this movie, you'll make it more happy One reviewer referred to Guantanamo and I totally agree with him. This film causes a shock. And I know what you're thinking ... at least at some point I'll see Simpson naked or close. It won't happen, save time and YouTube. You'll have better sexy time! <br /> <br /> The editing of the films is fragile, the acting is unbearable, and why do they use blue screens? <br /> <br /> In conclusion; this is a cinematic betrayal that should be punished to the full <br /> <br /> Another question because Willie Nelson always plays a sort of father figure in almost every Jessica Simpson film and why there are no black, Latin, asian or european people in this movie?
