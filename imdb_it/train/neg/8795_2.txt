I have seen virtually no saving qualities in this film. The only thing I saw was Quentin Tarantino's crazy obsession with this ... There were some attractive women in this movie and maybe that's a decent quality. Overall, however, I found this film surreal and ridiculous. Motion picture production combined with slow motion and other film gimmicks seemed awkward and dizzying, even sickening. Overall the music was horrible and repetitive to the extreme, also reminding me of the psychological warfare of the American army against various discontents. <br /> <br /> The various vignettes that make up the film are random in their positioning and unsatisfactory and unresolved in their content and "conclusions". A depressing film (not a real film, a term I reserve for true art) that left me with a bad feeling. Do not believe the various people who try to make it become a "romantic comedy", even if there are certainly isolated elements of this film that repudiates in the content, form and conclusion any association with this genre. <br /> <br /> I suggest staying away despite the seemingly overwhelming positive opinions of IMDb and other rating sources.
