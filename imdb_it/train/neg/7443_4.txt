There were some scary scenes, which I always liked more than usual, but otherwise this film was pretty weak. There were too many questions left unanswered and when they tried to explain something in the film, it was still rather unclear. After watching this film, it still seemed to me lost in many ways. It reminded me of Silent Hill a few years ago. That film was also unsatisfactory, but even better than that because it tried to work and the story really made sense. This, not so much. <br /> <br /> The acting for the most part in The Abandoned was decent, but the film was dragged onto an on, and never gave any kind of satisfying conclusion. As I said above, there were some disturbing scenes, but otherwise, this film was a disaster. Sorry, I can't recommend it.
