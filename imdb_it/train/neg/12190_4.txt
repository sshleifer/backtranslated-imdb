One of the worst of Scorsese. A medium thriller; the only thing to recommend is De Niro who plays the psychopath. The ending is typically of this kind, that is to say over-the-top, with another almost invincible villain, immune to pain. I didn't like the original of the 60s, and this version wasn't much improved. I have no idea why Scorsese wasted his time on a remake. Then again, considering how bad his recent films have been (I am referring to his boring Buddhist film and all those with his new favorite actress, blonde Di Caprio) this is not so bad by comparison. And considering that Spielberg wanted to do the remake ... it could have been much worse.
