Primal Species (1996, Dir. Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> International terrorists get a surprise when their cargo turns out to contain living dinosaurs. The army commando group must now think quickly, if they want to prevent the extinction of the human species, instead of reptiles. <br /> <br /> Look at the cover and get the first impressions of the film. This is pretty much everything. Acting is acceptable only by a few characters. The story is poor, with the entire film based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs. This film was released three years after "Jurassic Park". Instead, this film looks like it was released 13 years before "Jurassic Park". The costumes of the dinosaurs are so badly made, and I mean customs. Obviously there are people dressed and this film does not try to hide it. A scene in which a dinosaur runs along a corridor is created in a way, in which it seems that someone is driving the creature. The is a good thing, coming out of this movie. Short execution time. At only 1 hour and 15 minutes, don't waste too much of your life, but still try to avoid it altogether. <br /> <br /> "The 13th nightmare is like a Friday." - Officer (Brian Currie)
