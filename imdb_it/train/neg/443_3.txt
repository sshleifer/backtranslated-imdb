Overall an extremely disappointing image. Very, very slow to build up to the basic plot. The role of Maria Schrader in search of her family's secret past. (Every grip seems to last forever ??. There is really no rhythm in the film.) *** SPOILERS *** His mother Ruth is saved by the Nazis, by a German woman, played by Katja Riemann. The whole character of Ruth is so one-dimensional, so stereotyped. *** SPOILERS END *** The film goes back and forth between today's New York, Berlin and Berlin 80s something. Please, when you do, give the audience an indication of what time exactly the story takes place. Is there never a clear indication of the weather ?? very boring. The worst part is, the end. *** SPOILERS *** The whole show and the chatter about the Jews are so terribly tormented, simply by a bureaucratic accident! Give me a break. Is this how the Jews left Rosenstrasse? The question of who released the Jews has NEVER responded. Were the Goebels the ones who freed them? Did Lean Fischer sleep with Goebels? In Venice the film won an award for acting for K. Riemann, why? ?? I have no idea. Must be the Jewish theme ??
