With this film that lasts only 61 minutes and nothing so beautiful on television, I decided to bring Revolt of the Zombies to the DVD to pass the time. While realizing the era from which he was coming, I was deeply disappointed. It began with the strange, optimistic quality of the initial score (what - no music that broods?) And then the rather slow opening sequences in motion. Damn, I thought that a zombie movie - even from the 1930s - would have had some thrills (White Zombie, with Bela Lugosi, of course) but he didn't. Zero. It wasn't even dramatic (except for the few moments with fiery eyes superimposed on the film to indicate someone's hypnotization). As the equally boring King of the zombies, this film could be an interesting curiosity to possess, but nothing more.
