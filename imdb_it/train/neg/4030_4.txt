I remember seeing "Missile lost" (in fact, while I and one of my guests all night I agreed to watch it with me - I was, from time to time, Eric Cartman of the '60s - sorry, guys) and feeling a bit embarrassed when the sustained wave of millions of degrees of heat emerged as a plot device: even when I was in my second year, I knew that a simple missile could not carry energy around for as much heat or devastation for more than the duration and limited range of a nuclear detonation. <br /> <br /> Inflicting that turkey on loving relatives was a self-punishing crime. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​of the film were very good. The acting is not bad (apart from the actor's Shatnerism who played the help of the governor that someone else mentioned here). <br /> <br /> But the idea of ​​an Easy-Baking missile on the surface of the Earth by means of the heat of its exhaust ... no. <br /> <br /> Why did the people of the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" lose "The Lost Missile", anyway? <br /> <br /> It's a great classic of involuntary comedy - watch it if you want something to drink beer for a few weekends.
