Wonderful actors <br /> <br /> Incorrect script and direction not too big. My main problem was simply not to worry about any of these people. Not the killer, not the victims. The settings were rather shabby. Dennis Quaid's character was so badly written, I didn't even care when the end came. He got his son back. Big deal! I wanted my money back.
