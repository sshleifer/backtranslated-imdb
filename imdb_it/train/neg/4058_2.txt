From the beginning, you know how this film will end. It's so full of clich√©s that your typical NRA member won't even like this movie. I give it 2 out of 10, just for the acting of William Benton. I can't believe people voted 6+ for this movie. He is so biased towards a "certain point of view" (once a thief ...). People are not born bad. Nor were they born well. They were born with a clean slate. It is society, parents and education that makes them what they are. And if they take the wrong turn, somewhere along the line, it certainly won't be the American penal system that puts them back on track! Anyway, avoid this movie like the plague. I bet you have better things to do with your time than wasting it on this piece of shit. <br /> <br />
