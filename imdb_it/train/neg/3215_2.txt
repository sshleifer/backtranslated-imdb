The film has a nude scene: a man sitting on the edge of the bed, with his genitals exposed to strike in the center of the screen. It's a pretty long scene. What was the point? I almost think it was funny but we were watching it with my mother and it wasn't fun to have THAT staring at us for what seemed like a full minute. <br /> <br /> The film is cold. None of the characters is even nice. Audrey Tatou is pretty, of course, but her character is an unhappy girl. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't really recommend this movie. I expected it to be charming and cool but it was depressing. I wondered if the director came from a very educated and high stature French family and looked down on these characters. <br /> <br />
