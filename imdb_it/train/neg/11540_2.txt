This reminded me of SOO much of Michael Winner's lousy "Dirty Weekend" with its lousy low budget English. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I must say that I am a fan of both exploitation and serious film. I appreciate, say, 'demented' for his ineptitude and 'Last house on the left' for his brutal and shameless brutality. And any number of inventive and increasingly brutal Italian spin-offs. <br /> <br /> This was still useless. A bit like a director of the British budget, he thought 'let's redo "I Spit on your Grave" without making it too heartbreaking now that horror is back in fashion with Hostel. <br /> <br /> The whole thing does not go together or have a point. What has the rapist's daughter got to do with it? Why worry that the man is a security camera expert? Crappy.
