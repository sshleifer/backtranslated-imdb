After being very amused by Mr. Brosnan's performance as "The Tailor of Panama" (which I consider 10/10 on the whole line: casting, acting, script, history, editing, rhythm, music, emotional impact, etc. ), I enthusiastically anticipated this film. I was deeply disappointed. It is a script that does not read a film, vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, bankrupt in any way that "Il Sarto di Panama" is rich and satisfying. Blame the screen by writing and directing. I sat in the theater waiting for "the good part"; never arrived. I didn't laugh or cry, even though a line of dialogue made me smile. Is it worth $ 7? Almost.
