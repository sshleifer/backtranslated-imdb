I don't know why this conduct was ever tolerated in the world of cinema! This (short) film is indecent (to say the least)! They are a group of 5-7 year olds who wear diapers with big hairpins that act like adults (and too much!). However, it is interesting because it is a good example of how "the good old days" may not have been so good after all! (Thank God we have laws against this kind of material now!) <br /> <br /> {This is a short from the "Shirley Temple Festival"}
