I read that "There's a Girl in My Soup" came out during Peter Sellers' low season. Watching the movie, I'm not surprised. Almost nothing happens in the film. Apparently, the very presence of Sellers and Goldie Hawn should help the film; It is not so. The whole film seems to have filmed randomly whatever happened without creating scripts. Maybe I haven't seen all the movies about middle-aged elderly people trying to be hippies, but this gives these films a bad name. <br /> <br /> All in all, both the Sellers and Hawn have starred in much better films than this, so don't waste your time on this. Rather useless.
