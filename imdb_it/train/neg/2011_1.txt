This film is pure guano. Mom always said you can't say anything nice ... but mom would say that I had to do my part to warn others about this movie. <br /> <br /> I can guarantee that this is the Geoffrey Rush movie the wishes would go away. I hope Greg Kinnear fired his agent from a cannon for giving him the script. After this, Ben Stiller is probably praying for someone to announce "There's still something in Mary". I've always been a fan of Wes Studios, thanks to whatever you thought he was wearing a mask for the movie, so maybe people won't identify the movie with him. <br /> <br /> Start with promising stylistic traits parody of the cinematography of the Batman films and then lose something ... like a coherent plot and half decent effects. <br /> <br /> The lines are wired an hour before the final line arrives, and even then they fall flat. If you want to see an effective parody of the comic book world, see "Chasing Amy". <br /> <br /> RUN! DO NOT WALK FROM "MYSTERY MEN"!
