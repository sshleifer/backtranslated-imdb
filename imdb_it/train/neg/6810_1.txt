To be honest, I didn't like "Executive Decision" - which was obviously the model - a lot, but compared to this piece of shit, it looks like a masterpiece of art. <br /> <br /> Not only the people who move in the film (the term actors would be an insult to all the other actors) should attend more acting lessons, the guy who builds the setting didn't even see a plane from afar. It is so ridiculous that on a 747 only 3 people are on board, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogicality (for example: use sleep gas, so don't use it, so use it anyway), which brought my rating down to the bottom. <br /> <br /> You can have more fun rearranging the sock drawer or making a hole in the knee and filling it with milk.
