All of this film is pig washing. Pious acting, terrible dialogue, ugly native girls. this movie sinks into oblivion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director must have been a weekend bender. Robert C. is completely lost and has no idea what is happening. The college kids are the worst. No acting talent, very stupid reasoning and dumbbells right below right. The special effects are for birds. The so-called security force around this park belongs to the land of toys: with stupid-looking guns, walkie-talkies that are useless; and a computer system that aligns with a roll of toilet paper. if the park is under construction and nothing works; why bother to invite potential customers until everything is complete. writers should be the first victims of the disaster together with the producers and the crew. The entire film belongs to a septic tank shot on another planet for viewing. What a gem. Inmates should deal with this so they can commit suicide.
