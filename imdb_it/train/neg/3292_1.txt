For this review, a list of good points and negative points. I'll start with the bad guy. <br /> <br /> Negative points: the casting choices (in particular Burt Reynolds in the role of Boss Hogg), the recitation of the evil chosen the cast, the plot, the idea of ​​setting the film in modern times, the direction, editing, soundtrack and, above all, the idea of ​​making a feature film from a television series that was not so nice to start with, despite its popularity. <br /> <br /> Positive aspects: Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ............ that's it! <br /> <br /> An analogy could be made. In the scene where Jessica Simpson in the role of Daisy Duke makes her way to Michael Weston in the role of Enos and asks the question "Enos, where is Boss Hogg and Roscoe?", In his clouded judgment, tells her where they are. he might even have asked "Enos, this is a good movie?", the red bikini would have tarnished his judgment in saying yes, even if in his right mind he would have said "No, not really". As good as she looked in the bikini, she could have been completely naked, and even this wouldn't have saved this horrible piece of film. Stay away from Hazzard!
