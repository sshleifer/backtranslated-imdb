A question for all the girls out there: if a man you've never met before accidentally phoned you on purpose and kept doing it in the most indiscreet moments, are you curious or are you crazy about the phone? Yes, that's what I thought, so I couldn't swallow the idea of ​​Marti Gerrard who endured Connor Hill's disinterested attention <br /> <br /> ***** MILD SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> This is a really stupid story. Connor Hill's wife is murdered and the plot revolves around the question: does Connor call Marti to get an alibi? But here is a huge logical void, couldn't Connor have employed a hit man? something the prosecution seems to have ignored. And there were no forensic investigations at the murder scene? So why is the whole process based on Connor calling Marti at the time of the murder? Stupid Stupid Stupid And it's as predictable as it is mindless. <br /> <br /> My lasting memory of this film is that for someone who did the Winter Olympics Marti Gerrard is a really bad skier
