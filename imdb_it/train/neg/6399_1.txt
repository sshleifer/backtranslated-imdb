One: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two fantastic comics transformed into sap for a snotty kid. They both sold in this, worse than the character of Pryor. Two: a horrible and excessively sentimental script that could have been used in a Harold Lloyd film is so clich√©. Three: choice of a black actor as a toy; the racial subtext of this is unbearable, as never before faced. There is no message here, the part of Pryor may have been played by any comedian. Four: That kid ... I wish I could go back in time and stop him from acting ... it would mean movies like this and Kid Co. wouldn't have been made ... and my childhood would have been free of their power to distort the mind. So, if you want to see a couple of fantastic comics getting contaminated in a sweet movie for kids, go ahead. If you want to see them in something good, see the old act of Stand Up by Pryor and Gleason in something better, like the Honeymooners.
