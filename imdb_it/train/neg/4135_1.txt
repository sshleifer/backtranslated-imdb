This movie was so bad that I had to speed up most of it to get to the good pieces. Hah what beautiful pieces? the only bit that was worth was the ending (those who saw the film will know what I mean). I expected a lot from this movie as an underworld meets the dawn of the dead meets Freddy against Jason, but what I got was this shit. The story was forgettable, the cast was badly used and what the director was thinking when he did this. This could have been great, but I became the most boring movie I've ever seen. OK, so if there was a whole lot of T and A, I was behind the blood and I was bitterly disappointed. Don't expect a movie that is beautiful but if you want a bad horror in bad taste, then look at it by all means and watch how a horror movie MUST NOT BE DONE.
