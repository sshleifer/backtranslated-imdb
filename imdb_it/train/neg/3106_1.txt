Every time I make a list of the worst movies I've ever seen, this movie is always about it. It has no redeeming qualities. It took an act of will to sit on the whole thing, and soon I would have overturned my own blood rather than having to repeat it. <br /> <br /> What's wrong? Let me tell you the story of my journey to go and see it in the theater. <br /> <br /> I went to a midnight show on a Saturday night. I was the only one in the theater to be myself, and a group of noisy, noisy and rather unruly teenagers, sitting somewhere behind me. They were obviously out with a good time on Saturday night, and they had come to this "comedy" for some laughter. Before the film began, during the previews, they were laughing and joking and making noisy comments with a great old time. He was annoying borderline; if they continued their unbridled enthusiasm in the actual film, I could have said something, but I felt tolerant and empathetic with their lively entertainment, so I gave up. And they settled in once the film started. <br /> <br /> Why am I telling you all this? Because you can judge this alleged "comedy" by the effect it had not only on myself, but on this noisy group. <br /> <br /> During the entire performance of the film, not one person in the theater laughed. Not once. Not myself, not the loud children. Absolute silence, apart from the soundtrack. And when the film was finished and the lights came on, all of us, all of us, slowly left the theater in a slow, gloomy, absolute silence. It could have been a funeral. <br /> <br /> This was the effect this "comedy" produced. No laughter, no enjoyment, but absolute DEPRESSION. It was a depressing, depressing, and not a little strange film. Preach, self-indulgent, depressing, but not funny. <br /> <br /> I think Mel Brooks's "Blazing Saddles" is on the list of the funniest movies ever. It still occurs to me that the same gentleman could probably be responsible for the least funny film ever. <br /> <br /> In short: if you feel too happy, give this film a whirl; otherwise, don't say I didn't warn you.
