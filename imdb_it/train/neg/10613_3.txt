Dance was probably the ONLY watchable thing about this movie - and this too was disappointing compared to other films. My gawd! <br /> <br /> For me, this is the worst kind of film - one that assumes it's a work of art because it has all the trappings of film-as-art. Yes, it is beautifully photographed, but in the end it lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film is supposed to surround. Tango is a joke, it's hot, it has a drama, it's bold - exactly what this film is not.
