The film had a good concept, but the execution was not up to par. <br /> <br /> What is this concept? Well, as for the plot, it's "Dirty Harry" who meets "M". A murdering child has begun to terrorize a city. The main detectives (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest) have never had anything to do with a serial killer before. The mayor and the police chief, in desperation, secretly hire the local crowd to speed things up ... to go to places and do things the police wouldn't be able to do to end this chaos as soon as possible . <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie really has good things to offer. <br /> <br /> In addition to the concept, I liked the look of the killer hideout. Norman Bates has his basement. This guy has a creepy sewer. In some of the shots, the light bounces off the water and creates rippling reflections on the walls; often giving these scenes a creepy, dreamlike quality. <br /> <br /> Even the acting was good. Dennis Hopper is one of those actors who gets better with age. <br /> <br /> Once this is overcome, however, it is more or less downhill. <br /> <br /> The film is set too fast The investigation process of both teams seems very hasty instead of feeling intricate and fascinating. This could have been solved in two ways: either stretch the film or cut out some of the subplots. Each of these would have allowed the crew to spend more time on the true mystery. <br /> <br /> For an example of how bad it is, one of the crucial clues that helps them clear the right suspect is this: at some point in his life, the suspect went to a pet shop .. Exactly ... I am absolutely serious here. It is as if they had passed from point A (the first clue) to point Z (the suspect) and jumped over all the "intermediate" passages. <br /> <br /> Then there are the characters. The only ones that I really liked were two pickpockets you meet in the middle of the film. Considering that they are minor characters, I would call it a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the mob corner. That's what pleases me the most because that's why I spit out the $ 3 to buy the DVD in the first place. I mean, what a hook! In the last 10-15 years there has been an excess of serial killer shots. The corner of the crowd was a gimmick that could help him get through the rest ... but he didn't. <br /> <br /> I thought the gangsters' methods would be brutal, but at the same time funny and thrilling; a bit like a vigilante movie or something ... maybe they even threw some robbery film elements into it. We are talking about criminals, after all. Instead, we are given some of the most repellent players involved in celluloid. Detectives question witnesses. What does the mob do? They interrogate them and kill them. Even these witnesses aren't really that bad. Actually I found the least nice criminals of the killer they are looking for. Unless the good points I mentioned are sufficient to arouse your interest, I would say to give it a lack. Maybe one day, they will reuse the same idea of ​​history and they will do it RIGHT. I hope. I hate to see such a good concept wasted.
