Starting with the poster (which included only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the whole movie was a fraud. One stereotype after another, this film talked about nothing - or nothing new, at least. After 10-15 minutes, you realize that you just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J play their way through another cop. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story is about the corrupt system in some cities, secretly supported by the backbone business and in the city, under the watchful eye of a hot-shot politician. The omnipotent and over the top organization is called FRAT and guess what? they have a crazy policeman who shoots and beats at will - suspects, girlfriends, you call him. FRAT policemen are corrupt and greedy, so they end up making mistakes that are discovered by a talented young journalist (!!!). An hour later, after a series of incredibly bad shooting scenes and more stereotyped lines, everything ends happily and we are served the final joke: you can't beat the system. Bah! Don't see this waste of film roll. Freeman and Spacey have barely 10 minutes in all!
