Are we talking about the same movie? This film is totally ridiculous, the plot is disgusting and completely devoid of logic. It's a typical movie on DVD / TV that includes all the ingredients necessary for a horrible cinematic experience: Over-acting by was actors, side steps from the plot that have remained unexplained, THE GIRL SHOWS HER T * ts (why, god why ??), people do not react to things as they would in real life. I won't even bother you with the details, it would take all night. Well, OK, just one: if two people were killed in front of you while you were walking down the street, one of the victims practically dies in your arms, his blood gushes from his head wound on you, it would be your first concern to be ; "Oh, he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!"? My thoughts go to Harvey and his lost career.
