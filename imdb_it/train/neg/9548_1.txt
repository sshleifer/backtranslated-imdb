I can't believe I saw this expecting more. Start OK. This film pushes the limits of reality far away !! At least the first one was pretty realistic. Tear off the first film and even mention the Joshua Project. Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie. He still has a good message, WATCH THE BIG BROTHER !!! The film makes it seem like Big Brother is much bigger than it really is in reality. It was very aggravating. Even the actors' makeup was completely wrong. Some acting is pretty good. Some of the acting are really bad. The script was OK in some places and completely messed up in other parts. This film is reproduced practically every five minutes. As I said, I can't believe I saw him expect more. I think I'll make the original appear to return to earth ... Q
