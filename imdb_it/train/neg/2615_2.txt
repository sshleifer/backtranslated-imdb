I don't know why, but for some sick reason, I think since I've been on the Disney binge sequel, I've decided to go ahead and see 102 Dalmations. The first film that was a remake of the classic Disney cartoon starring Glenn Close as Crudelia De Vil, seemed like a sure hit, but it was just a bomb. I think the reason these films don't work is because 101 Dalmations, the original, was a cartoon, it worked better and was more attractive to children and adults. This was not so much fun because the adults who ran trying to act like cartoons instead of just real human beings, I understand that they are trying to make sure it is attractive to children, but it is ridiculous to see how these actors behave in the film. And the story of Dalmations is not that good. <br /> <br /> Cruella De Vil has been in prison for a while, but things change when it is shown that she now loves animals and is a pleasant human being. But her reputation is now damaged like a puppy-napper, but she buys a shelter for man dogs and is suddenly loved by everyone and seems to have changed. But when he sees the Dalmatians of his surveillance officer, he goes mad and starts to see the spots, and loses it. She came back to take revenge on the puppies and is still determined to get that Dalmation coat she always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is such an extraordinary actress, very undervalued, but with Cruella De Vil, she's good, but let's face it, this movie made the hilarious fun just more than a stupid nut case. Besides, cute as puppies, it only works more for animation, it sounds silly, but it's not as believable without the cartoon and their personalities in the mix. I really wouldn't recommend 102 Dalmations, it's all right, but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time, it's just the same thing. <br /> <br /> 2/10
