Three Stooges - Have Rocket, Will Travel - 1959 This was the first feature film to play the Stooges and is pretty ugly. Makes THE THREE STOOGIES ALL OVER THE WORLD IN A DAZE (since 1963) looks like a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The Stooges are janitors in a rocket seat. They climb on a rocket and go to Venus. They encounter some things including a talking unicorn that they call "Uni" and that they bring to Earth with them. "Uni" speaks like an average and pleasant person - "Oh, hi. How are you? Beautiful planet here. I hope you like it." Exhilarating. <br /> <br /> Very few gags and so many scenes go on and on and on. <br /> <br /> The Stooges return from space and the film is finished until the story goes, but no one has said that the film producers for the image continue for another 10 minutes or so at a party where not much happens. The Stooges leave the party and then the film is almost finished. <br /> <br /> Highlight of the film "The end when the Stooges sing a little song on their journey. Larry and Curly Joe hit Moe in the face with two cakes. Brutal. <br /> <br /> Another writer mentioned the beautiful musical score. Eh? L The only music I've noticed are two classic songs - I TAKE THE ROMANCE AND THEY COME BACK THAT SONG, both played at the party. And * this * is really the high point of the image - the music of the old Columbia movies. <br /> <br /> The tall sexy blonde was pretty. <br /> <br /> Awful - a brand new VHS video from the 99 Cents store O nly.
