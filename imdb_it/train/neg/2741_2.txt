Spoiler !! I love Branagh, I love Helena Bonham-Carter, I loved them together in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" - but THIS - I can understand an actor's desire to stretch, to avoid the romantic stereotype. Well, they did, but actually - the script continued, Bonham-Carter's clothes were tr√®s chic, and the occasional "crazy" sequence could be an outtake from a Beatles movie, or old Rowan and Martin Laugh- In . <br /> <br /> I never understood the point - other commentators say that the character Branagh was a dreamer. I never heard it. He was a loser, and not very bright, and certainly not appealing. The deal with the bank robber disguise was simply painful to watch. It's definitely not fun. <br /> <br /> The realistic attempts (we suppose) of Bonham-Carter as a realistic speech were more difficult to understand than the first 15 minutes of the Lancashire accent in "Full Monty". <br /> <br /> The poetic ending, with him atop a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his plane was too orchestrated. Was there a choir of angels, or just a soundtrack? <br /> <br /> Go back to the classics or something with a spine and an arch. Donate this to PBS. <br /> <br />
