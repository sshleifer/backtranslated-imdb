Before watching this film I had very low expectations and I went to see only cars. In the end I even regretted going for that reason. The plot is almost non-existent. The character development is non-existent. There are so many incredible clich√©s and so much fun in the movie that I could only watch and wonder how it was even released. If it were not for the exotic, I would not have even evaluated this film at 1. An attempt at a coherent plot is destroyed by the sheer absurdity of this cult of elites and the laughable characters that make up its members. Indeed, the plot of the film is so predictable and simple that an average child could predict most of the plot. Bad acting, bad plot, bad jokes, bad movie. <br /> <br /> Not seeing it. Instead, play Gran Turismo HD and satisfy your thirst for fast and sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste.
