I saw this bomb when it hit the theaters. I laughed all the time. Why? Because stupidity seemed to have made me mad. I look back at it and realize that there wasn't a funny thing in the whole movie. A leat nothing intentional. It is terribly strange that Lizzie chews a piece of Nurplex and becomes a gigantic and carnivorous demon ... yet her small, plastered dress is perfectly intact, although it is now hundreds of times bigger than when it was first put up. Or the type of film in which a man can be shocked with a defibrillator and fall only indifferently, and return to consciousness without any medical intervention. And don't let me start on the ridiculous fate of the "bad guy" who decided they needed to create "conflict". Uh huh. <br /> <br /> To the person who complains about Disney that only addresses children: the vulgar parts of this film seem to contradict this statement. Do we really need Daryl Hannah to accuse Jeff Bridges of having vicious videos? You do it if you are Disney and you have no ideas to make the movie appeal to the crowd above 8 without writing a smarter script! I am absolutely convinced that Disney pays the rating board so that films can get away with murder and still get family-friendly ratings. <br /> <br /> What a waste of the DVD format.
