I knew nothing about the film or that it was based on a successful book. Provided by the initial scenes of what it was, best hypothesis, buried treasure and death list. It lasted about 15 minutes when I got the sneak suspicion that the film was a crap. I won't bore you with how bad the plot and acting are, but whoever gave more than two stars has to work for the directors. I watched until the hero jumped into his corvette to run to the hospital. He had his suit, shirt and tie arrived at the hospital in jeans and a shirt. He couldn't even have the right continuity. I had the Christian theme, difficult not to see it.
