I'm amazed that I actually sat and watched this. I love independent films, horror films and the whole thing about zombies in general. But when you add the ninga, you have crossed a line that should never be crossed. I hope the people in this film had a lot of fun doing it, so at least it wasn't a total waste. You would never know by looking at it though. Script? Are you kidding. To act? I think even the trees were pretending. Cinematography? Well, there must have been a camera there. Period. I don't think there was any real planning for this film. Such a total waste of time that I will not extend it further commenting.
