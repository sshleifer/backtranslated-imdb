Shocking! <br /> <br /> In 1965 I saw Jury Gagarin alive. He was sincere, unpretentious and kind, he was at ease and seemed like an educated and intellectual person. In this film I saw a clown! The actor looks like a mannequin with affected gestures and mimics. They made a cartoon! The real Gagarin was someone else! Don't believe in this movie! <br /> <br /> I saw this film after films like "Taming of Fire" and "Apollo 13" and after reading books "Rockets and People" by Chertok and "Korolev: Myths and facts" by Golovanov. I was shocked by the tiring scenery, poor acting and production, and a lot of inaccuracies in "Space Race". <br /> <br /> The film is the boring rendering of well-known historical facts in Russia. Not many interesting and known facts about space projects have been demonstrated. Some facts and details have been perverted. For example, in 1945 Korolev was not already a prisoner (released in 1944), and in 1940 he was not already in the Kolyma prison gold mine, but in a special prison design office. Korolev was the designer of the prison design office and the dead prisoners were not buried. But in the film Korolev worked as a tomb digger after 1940 (because the jailer has shoulder straps on his uniform). IMHO, the film's authors do not have a deep knowledge of this part of the story and cannot make interesting films.
