Wow. This is what I can say now. Who writes this stuff? Who produces this stuff? Which self-respecting actor would accept to "act" in this stuff? My God! I don't know how I made this film, but I assume that the day I drank 8 cups of coffee was the key to keeping me awake. Good God! It was one of the most drastic and predictable pieces of cinemonia I've ever witnessed ... and for the record, I NEVER intend to "testify" again. <br /> <br /> I first saw the movie when I bought the DVD (MISTAKE # 1). I mean ... I thought, hey! Julia Stiles. I like her. She's strong I'll watch it as soon as I get home (ERROR # 2). I tried looking at him without complaining every five minutes, wondering when this pile of shit would end, I really did. But I didn't succeed. It was one of the worst things I'd ever seen. I mean ... what's with that thing where you imagine what's going to happen and then come back to real life? It was quite annoying when his father did it in "Parenthood" like ten years ago. The "jokes" - and BELIEVE about me, it takes a lot of time to call them that - they are stupid, the characters are trivial and forgettable, the plot is completely predictable ... all this for a movie that should be swept away RECORD OF HISTORY! I should have realized that something was wrong when I realized that I had never heard of this movie. Most likely it is a film in direct format. <br /> <br /> For anyone thinking of watching it, I have an advice. DO NOT! For the LOVE of God ... NOT !!! I'm ashamed to have it in my DVD collection, and I can't get rid of it ... Nobody, and I mean NO ONE wants to buy it from me! And I'm talking about second-hand and second-hand shops that would buy mud from shoes and stick it in the shop window. This should let you know how much CRAP it is.
