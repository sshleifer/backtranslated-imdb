honestly, if someone has a brain, there's not a good thing <br /> <br /> to say about this movie what ever. <br /> <br /> I lost $ 1 by renting this. I'd rather laugh at Will Smith saying, "If you have a dream, you have to protect it." <br /> <br /> all the actors must have been bored or had no fame at the time. even Matthew Mc Conahay * however it is written * was better than all the actors in this film, when he played a psychopath in Texas Chainsaw 4. If you see this film, and you have something nice to say, your IQ must be extremely low with such bad taste in movies, it hurts. Thank you ... and the TRUTH, it has been said! <br /> <br /> Save yourself from misery. <br /> <br /> Download Devil's Rejects, now it's a classic.
