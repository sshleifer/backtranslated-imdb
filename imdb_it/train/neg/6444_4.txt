Most university students find themselves lost in the bubble of the academic world, cut off from the communities in which they study and live. Their conversations are held with their fellow students and the college faculty. Steven Greenstreet's documentary is a fine example of a disillusioned university student who judges the entire community on the basis of limited contacts with a small number of its members. <br /> <br /> The documentary focuses on a small group of individuals who have been portrayed as representing large groups of the population. As usual, the people who scream more receive media attention. In addition to his misrepresentation of the community in which the film was set, the documentary was well made. My only dispute is that the feelings and uproar represented in the film have been attributed to the whole community rather than to the few individuals who expressed them. <br /> <br /> Of course it is important to examine a controversy like this and make people aware of the differences that exist between political points of view, but it is ridiculous to involve a whole community of people in the actions of some radicals.
