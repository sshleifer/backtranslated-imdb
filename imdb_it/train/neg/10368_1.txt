This "movie" is a bad job! Nothing even seems to prove and be realistic. The plot is weak, says - miserable, actors who wonder around like in a first-year production, trying very hard to act without any possibility from the beginning. What a flop! What a waste of time, money and commitment for all concerned, including the public. Well, like in every thriller, here too there are murders, corpses and blood. Imagine someone who committed a murder with a knife 5 minutes ago, and came out calm and smiling, not to mention clean as a whistle, as if cutting the throat was done by a virtual agent. Also, this murder had to be done by a tiny and fragile woman on a very strong male, and she cut his throat !!! Did you ask him politely to bend over for her? Much more stupidity than that same guy is going on and leaving the audience wondering if this was meant to be a joke that turned out to be bad. Continuity is another huge problem, for example: the hungry-hungry groom lies in bed, waiting for his virgin bride to come out of the bathroom and after a long time fall asleep (!?!). The next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception area, asking for directions to the places in the scenery! NOT A WORD ON THE LAST NIGHT ??? Such a waste of time also to try to write about this alleged-to-be-low-low "film".
