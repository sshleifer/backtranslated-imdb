I always thought Cinderella II was the worst movie I've ever seen (followed by Peter Pan 2 and other sequels like The Lion King 2 and the Hunchback of Notre Dame 2). All these films are made with the same idea; because the film has no plot, they try to compensate by filling it with jokes. I'm not saying the jokes are bad, but they make up most of the movie. The first time I saw the movie, I would have given it a 1/10. But now I think about it, most kids don't care how good the original movie is, they just care that the movie is fun. I still think the film was a bad follow-up, but that doesn't mean it's horrible. Now I think he deserves a 3/10.
