Usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone just doesn't like it and is annoyed it doesn't have a lower rating, and therefore decides to drag it as much as possible instead of giving it a low rating. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0/10 film. He does nothing and doesn't have the chance to do it because he doesn't really try to do anything. There are the strands of a bad kind of D & D plot that doesn't hold water and a complete lack of any kind of acting. It is clear that no one involved in this project gave him any kind of serious effort, because even the hard work of completely unpatented people would amount to something more. A really terrible film.
