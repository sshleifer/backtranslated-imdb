I wouldn't recommend it unless you like David Copperfield and want to "complete the set". There are some good performances (for example Uriah Heep) and some very good moments (for example the beating), but overall it's really pale compared to the 1999 BBC version, as well as to the previous versions. <br /> <br /> There are unexplained changes in the story that really do not serve any exceptional purpose except, possibly, to silence him (the stolen jewels are a case in point). The American cast was badly chosen: Sally Field is a good actress, but she's wrong as Betsy Trotwood, and her English accent is only slightly better than Dick Van Dyke's cockney. I see why Michael Richards was chosen to play Mr. Micawber; however, if you take it too much, it becomes irritating. He also speaks his lines with an accent that goes beyond the eccentric and becomes simply absurd. Anthony Andrews is as threatening as Mr. Murdstone, but one almost expects him to wear a black cloak and tie David's mother to a railway line (though this may be partly the fault of Dickens). <br /> <br /> I got it for free with a newspaper. It helped me spend a Sunday afternoon, but I felt more disappointed than charmed in the end
