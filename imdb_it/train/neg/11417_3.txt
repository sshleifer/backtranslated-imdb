The young group from "St. Elmo's Fire", just graduated from college, barely seems able to move to high school for less than four years at any major university. For the most part, these guys are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and stupid, but co-writer and director Joel Schumacher seems to keep them as touchstones for a generation. With an outdated cast of "up and comers", a background score that seems terribly similar to that of "Terms of Endearment", and the writing that dominates the complacency of this circle on us, "Fire" is a miserable fire , one that becomes even more embarrassing over the years. * 1/2 from ****
