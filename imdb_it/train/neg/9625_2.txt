This film offers absolutely no imagination in its premise nor in its execution, but these are just two things that come to mind after seeing this so-called comedy that has no energy to speak. The story is about the fussy enigma about analytical risk manager Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller) who finds his new wife Lisa (Debra Messing) who cheats on him with a diving instructor (Hank Azaria) after only a honeymoon day. Upon returning home, Reuben and her best friend Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) attend a party and meet Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston) with whom they went to school years before. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives carefree who is the opposite of who Reuben is as a person but they start going out and Reuben starts to change as a person as he starts trying new things like salsa dancing and eating spicy foods. But one day Lisa returns and wants to remain married to Reuben, but he doesn't really want to, but Polly decides to leave because she doesn't believe in marriage to begin with. <br /> <br /> This film is the second directing work by John Hamburg, who has written two generally not very funny screenplays in "Zoolander" and "Meet the Parents", but those two films seem classic compared to this stale piece by drivel. It is very easy to say that something is not funny, but I think that with this film it is even easier to understand why. This film is totally and absolutely predictable from start to finish with every scene that looks like it only happens because of the ridiculous script. Hamburg, who also wrote the script, seems to have written it without thinking about trying something different and sometimes seems to be trying to generate the same energy as "There's something about Mary", but instead the events seem incredibly forced. Did anyone really think that the blind ferret was funny? If you do it, it's easy! Sometimes during the film the characters would inexplicably have these emotional discourses that should summarize everything but all they get is to exaggerate in the obvious. Stiller works a lot but maybe he should work less and wait for the best scripts to come because this film doesn't work like a comedy or a love story.
