Well, the previews looked funny and I don't usually go to the movies during the opening night, especially with my children, because ... well, you never know. Here is a film that does not appeal to either children or adults because the jokes are too perverse for children and fall completely flat for adult entertainment purposes. Actually I was embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 years old and having to explain to my 6 year old child what spells S H * T. In essence, what happens here is a total twist of the Dr. Seuss classic. He adds a bad and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for his money. If that was a subplot, then maybe it would have gone well, but in the end it was the main plot of the whole movie and "the cat" plays more of a secondary role in exposing the neighbor to the mother for what it really is. Follow my advice and read the book and pass the film.
