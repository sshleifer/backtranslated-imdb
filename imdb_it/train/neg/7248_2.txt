When his in-laws are brutally murdered by a gang of thugs, a young deputy is ordered to escort his dumb friend, forced to take rap from the gang, to Tucson for a trial and end up having to face the real killers along the way . <br /> <br /> The Decoy is a real lure sent to video stores to lure you away from better movies! It's boring, illogical, slow and ultimately very boring. <br /> <br /> There are some nice costumes, set designs and photographs but nothing else is good for this vanity project by writer / director / producer / star Justin Kreinbrink, who apparently had too much money for his hands. <br /> <br /> They used to do westerns like this, which lasted less than an hour. Cut this by about half the length and you may have something watchable.
