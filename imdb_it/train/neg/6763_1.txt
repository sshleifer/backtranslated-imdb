God, what a horrible thing! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment or something like that (see the terrible use of music and images here) but for what? The whole behind "Natural born killers" seems to be an "intelligent" look at how the media can turn into complete garbage, but unfortunately the film turns into the garbage itself. Please Mr. Stone, the next time you want to criticize the fascism of TV shows using violence to get high rates, avoid doing the same with your movie! Michael Haneke said quite intelligently of this film that he was denouncing media fascism with fascist film modes. How true ... Only that he forgot to tell us about the severe headache that comes after spending this shit load too long!
