When I saw the spot for this, I just wanted to see it. Now forgive me, but it's been so long since I saw him that I can't remember how it went. Suffice it to say that the film I saw had no resemblance to the "movie" in which they sold me. <br /> <br /> I was bored, bored and incredibly disappointed with this movie. And if it wasn't bad enough, they had to sink it further with that horrible reggae music. Not exactly atmospheric music for a horror movie, eh mon? I imagine that if you've never seen the commercial (or the trailer, I suppose) you might think this is some hot stuff. For my money, the spot was definitely better.
