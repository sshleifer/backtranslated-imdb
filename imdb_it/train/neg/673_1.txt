... let me count the ways. <br /> <br /> 1. A title-only remake that extracts all the clich√©s in the slasher manual. <br /> <br /> 2. A plot so predictable as to become quite pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3. A completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or chills. <br /> <br /> 4. A PG-13 assessment that does not ensure blood, violence or sex. <br /> <br /> 5. A villain who is neither scary nor mysterious. <br /> <br /> 6. A cast of characters written and stereotyped so subtly that we could not care about them. <br /> <br /> 7. A lack of an actually creepy atmosphere (very different from the original Prom night). <br /> <br /> 8. A script of dialogue that goes beyond the bad - it is the torpor of the mind. <br /> <br /> 9. A series of cardboard performances (I'm not sure if to blame the actors or script above). <br /> <br /> 10. A slash makeover aimed at teenagers completely inept who is not brave enough to try to have an imaginary - or even show a pool of blood. <br /> <br /> He's a mindless horror fan, save your money. <Br /> <br /> BOMB of ****
