Let me say that I will try not to put too many spoilers in this. Normally I like Robin Williams movies, but this gem was not one of them. It was advertised as a suspenseful thriller. The night listener was anything but. To be honest there were 6 people on the opening day of the theater, 2 exits, for good reason. In my opinion, the film was poorly written and directed. The acting was fine, but again there was nothing to work with. The film is about a storyteller reading a good book about a dying child. However * enter here spectral * nobody can verify the existence of children. So Williams goes to Wisconsin to try to find the author, but all he gets is a headache and apology from the boys' keeper. That's all, that's all. Wait about an hour and a half and the film ends. He had the thrill and the thrill of a visit to a dentist's office. Homosexual undertones or homosexuals really had nothing to do with the story, and the film had a bit of vulgarity, but seemed to be thrown in there without any reason or meaning. In conclusion, I can't really write a decent review on this film because there was nothing, it was as engaging as looking at the dried paint. I gave it a 2 because the acting for what it was worth was ok and it wasn't directed by Uwe Boll.
