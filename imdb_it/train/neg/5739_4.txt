A small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is a lonely avenger and a group of ragged survivors. <br /> <br /> Released in 1993, "Darkness" has picked up something of a cult following the release. It's easy to see why - he's full of energy and enthusiasm, like the one found in other non-budget horror films like "The Dead Next Door" and "The Children of Ravensback", and is full of energy and enthusiasm. it is actually quite contagious. <br /> <br /> Although this may be true, unfortunately it is not enough to save it. The film was shot on a Super 8, so the image is grainy and dark, making things very difficult to see (it would have been nice if it had obscured the terrible trombones of the protagonists.) Furthermore it is the soundtrack, composed by annoying Casio Keyboard and even more annoying Death Metal (seriously, what's with these budget-free horror movies and bad Death Metal?) While one doesn't expect performance worthy of an Oscar, the acting is still strictly on time amateur, since the actors sometimes seem almost confused instead of fear or threat. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure no-budget gorefest fans will love this. All the others, however, will want to have some extra meat on their ribs.
