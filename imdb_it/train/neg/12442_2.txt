The invasion of the Star Creatures would surely be in the "so bad is good" category if the film were not so sexist or racist. The fact that it is so simply worse. <br /> <br /> It has the same type of stereotypical sexism you saw in Queen of Outer Space, and the kind of racist stereotypes (in this case, Native Americans) that you would normally find in the thirty and forty b-westerns. In terms of non-fun, the same gag that runs through the cave is repeated more than ten times during the course of this short film. Ray makes a good impression of Jimmy Cagney (but he can't make it work for two impressions of Cagney in a row, nor manage a Peter Lorre when he tries it). There is really no production value to speak of, since "Star Creatures" make the Robot Monster or Tor Johnson Ro-Man appear in Plan 9 from Outer Space as creations of Industrial Light and Magic. <br /> <br /> This film was certainly one of those that you would have called independent cinema in advance ... not quite artistic for those theaters and not good enough for everything except the last feature of a night drive-in . <Br /> <br />
