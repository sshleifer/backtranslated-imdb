I have a question for those who have thought of this idea. Why? What made them think of making a second film on this. If the memory is useful, Cinderella did not end with "They all lived happily ever after"? I'm pretty sure he did, or was implicit. Wait a minute, if everyone lived happily ever after, how could there be a sequel? Unless they were trying to make the most boring story in history, there couldn't be a sequel. I mean, of course, they could make Cinderella sing nonsense for two hours, but why? A film that ends in "happy and contented" cannot have a sequel; if it does, they do not live happily ever after! Something must go wrong that causes problems with the first finish! Why? It is not right, it is evil. This is my last word on the subject.
