I tried to appreciate this program; I really did it. I even bought the pilot film, first on VHS and then on DVD. However, I couldn't get into this story because his two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) seemed to fall in love with themselves first. I admit that there was an intelligent dialogue in the shows, which was a key part of the TV program's success, and I really enjoyed that dialogue. <br /> <br /> Basically, this was almost like the old comedy films of the 30s and 40s with a male against a female. You have a lot of arguments, accusations, shouts and screams. A lot of people apparently love this kind of quarrels, but I hate it, so I never had the Moonlighting bandwagon. <br /> <br /> Only Allyce Beasley as an unlucky helper "Agnes" was fun. Too bad I had so little time for the air. Shepherd was gentle with the eyes and I suppose the women would have said the same for Willis, but too much discussion between the two made me finally escape.
