The producers of this film offer to pay the funeral expenses for those who die of fear while watching this movie. They should have offered intensive psychotherapy for anyone who really loved this stinker. A young couple moves into a house, where a woman who looks like the couple's woman lives. Extremely boring and very predictable. In the end I ended up not worrying about anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs.
