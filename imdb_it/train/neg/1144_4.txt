Summary: Dr. Markov has developed a new theory on how to produce energy, knowledge that could unbalance the world. He keeps his codified and secret knowledge and desperately wants to get out of the Soviet Union. The KGB on the other hand desperately wants the new technology. So they set a pattern in motion. During a rescue attempt to free Markov, the KGB intervenes, takes Markov to a secret location and induces him to reveal his secret by saying that they are in Sweden and working for the UN. As a backup, KGB kidnaps Markov's estranged daughter. The CIA now sends its best agents, a team of ninjas (Swedes?) To counter the KGB and save Markov and his daughter. <br /> <br /> Comments: A cult film that, although not very useful, must be seen. The film is quite ambitious but is missing in many areas. First of all it is that it is very dark, probably to hide places and bad effects, that some scenes are difficult to understand. You can't see what's going on. The second thing that is missing is martial art, despite being a ninja film. Certainly there are some, of very bad quality, but above all the ninja shoots automatic guns or series of explosions. Automatic guns are also a problem as they seem to have an endless supply of ammunition. And the ninjas seem almost immune to bullets as the Soviet guards die like flies. <br /> <br /> What has he got to talk about then? The idea and ambition first of all. Some actually, and especially for a Swedish film, decent action scenes if not martial arts. Some beautiful scenes in slow motion and practically blood and blood. And some new technologies of very interesting weapons that make the heart or brain of the victims explode. Mostly all the parts you look for in a B-movie. <br /> <br /> Because it's definitely a B-movie, you can't make mistakes. But if you expect it and watch it as a B movie, it's fun. But don't forget, it's not just a B movie set in the 1980s. Some girls, for example, in addition to wearing ... they say "interesting" clothes, they have lethal doses of eye shadows and makeup. <br /> <br /> In general, you see cult status and ambition. Have fun and then forget it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
