A good idea, poorly implemented. While this could sum up 99% of the SciFi channel's films, it really does apply here. I love movies that slowly reveal a good story, and I like action movies, and I like all the main actors, so it would have been great. However, despite some good acting, this film fails due to the bad writing and direction of Bill Platt. <br /> <br /> Another review has done the beauty of having to know where you're going, so you can get there. This movie no. It's put together in such a random way that you know the words "second draft" are not in Bill Platt's vocabulary. There is a scene that is completely useless and could be removed without anyone noticing. This scene starts and ends with them driving a car, so you can cut from one car scene to another and never have lost the useless scene in the middle. <br /> <br /> Also this film had a strange habit of below explaining some details while we explain the others, some to the point where you can guess the whole "plot" in advance. He also used to interrupt a fight early, probably just because they couldn't afford it. There are also some ridiculously bad scenes in which the "plot" is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving "toxic adhesive" (seriously, which * is * that?) In a comfortable position. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because it's fine. He manages to break his "Roswell" character a couple of times and become a good (but not always) good girl. John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he has done since he played Q in ST: TNG, so it's not new. <br /> <br /> In all, I gave this film a 4/10 rating.
