Wow, not only is this film a "new lesson in true bad taste", but also a lesson in "real bad film making". Don't get me wrong, I appreciated the concept of "Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence", but at the same time you have to realize when a movie is terrible. In case you missed the plot, the 'Zombie' 90 'plot is about a government plane carrying toxic chemicals that crash into the desert, causing chemicals to leak out, turning the locals into hideous zombies from the appearance. The next thing you know, the zombies are all over the city eating the living, while a stupid-looking doctor and a government agent are trying to understand the disease that is causing these people to eat each other - hence the name "Extreme Pestilence". From that moment on, all we see are the zombies that have a field day on all the rooms in sight - nothing but extreme and disgusting puffs and dismemberments accompanied by endless buckets of guts and blood. Since this is a German film, the film had to be dubbed into English and when you're not laughing at the zombie frenzy, dubbing is pretty funny and fun. As an UnratedX user he mentioned * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER *, there is a scene in the film that crosses the line between what is acceptable and unacceptable, hence the scene where a woman, who is bringing her baby small, he is carried around in his wheelchair by some guy and a horde of zombies sticking out of nowhere and attacking them. A zombie grabs the child and tears it into pieces, eating its organs while feeling the baby cry. Wow, this is a new lesson for tacky REALLY. I say atrocious, atrocious.
