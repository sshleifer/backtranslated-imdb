We don't have this on television in England, but I shot it on the Internet on YouTube. It's stupid, immature and boring! This is from the creator of "Earthworm Jim" Douglas TenNapel, I never got into that cartoon but I have to admit it better than this. The cartoonist has done nothing for years from now. For Doug TenNapel, this is a labor of return and a historical low! The story is about three cats inheriting a house and lots of money from their old dead mistress. They are argumentative and still disagree about what they want to spend their money on. "BORING"! The entertainment is terrible. The main characters are meant to be cats, right? But they don't look like cats! Only strange monstrous-looking creatures of animals with big mouths, sharp teeth and bulging eyes! Even human and other animal characters are drawn really ugly! The acronym is terrible and irritating! Even the stories are lame and most likely they are copied from old shows. I was surprised how this show got 7.5 / 10 votes from other IMDb readers. Television is not really what it is used to be! But now most of them are stupid, inexpensive and boring. Some of you on the site may not agree with me, sorry but this is a total waste of money and a complete and total waste of your time and I'm glad that Britain doesn't tolerate this shit too much (oh yes, if you have digital you have to do it) but I don't, so it's not my problem! Loser! 2/10 (and is very lucky to get it because I have given other worse shows!).
