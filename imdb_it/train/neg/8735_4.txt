This film disappointed me. It looked very similar to the Jaws movie when the Hopper was telling the Mayor to shut down parks like when Roy Shider was telling the Mayor to close the beaches. Both said no his summer! But the box says that Hopper must enter the mind of a killer and think like one. But in reality it does nothing too interesting or exciting. I'm not even a bit convinced that he and his partner have some experience in police work when I'm in the office wondering how to solve this case. They only say that the police let it work and we will solve it. And how it goes with all the old people with billiard cues. I didn't even start to believe they were mob bosses. And then the guy who was doubting the guy that the crowd chose to handle the search for the murderer. With his one-hundred-dollar haircut he thinks his Di @ k is the size of a school bus. Come with what raw lines. I thought he would hit him with a baseball bat like in the other movies. I used this movie and wouldn't buy it again. I suggest you skip this movie. Oh and it was fun to see the microphone above the scene where the hopper is coming out for coffee.
