This movie is just bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Now that I'm out of the way, I feel better. This film is poor from beginning to end. The story is lame. The 3-D segment is really bad. Freddy is the worst cartoon character. Thank God they killed him. And who wants to see the cameos of Roseanne and Tom Arnold? <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the film is the background given to us about Freddy. We see that he once had a family, and we can see his abusive and alcoholic father (Alice Cooper). <br /> <br /> Beyond that, all negative. There are some quality actors here (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto), and they do their best, but the end result is just so serious. The hour and a half I spent watching this film is an hour and a half and I can't go back.
