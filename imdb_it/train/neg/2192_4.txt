Another film based on the hasty and worn-out clich√© of the mad scientist has become more insane. The film focuses on a surgeon whose ambition is to bring the dead back to life ... I know, I know ... you've never heard it before! Of course, since all these films go, the experiment is very, very bad and creates a maniacal, bloodthirsty creature. For this promising configuration, you would think that it would be at least a little suspense. Mistaken. Like many films of this era, the idea is beautiful, but the execution and script are mediocre. It's not the worst horror movie I've ever seen (no, Abominator: the Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake) ... but not even one of the gems.
