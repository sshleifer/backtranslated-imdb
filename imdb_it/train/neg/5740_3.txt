I found the Darkness to be too DARK. He had a nice idea and some ambitious ideas, not bad action scenes and some unpleasant moments to get you going UGH! BUT, he was under the point of confusion. You don't really know what always happens in the dark scenes and for a movie shot on Super 8 Film, you already have all that ugly grain to deal with. Like in Nathan Schiff's films, it's really too much. Director Leif Jonker seems to want to make an original film, but he lacks the know-how to do it. The camera is never pointed in the right place, the lack of fundamental elements such as how to shoot simple dialogue scenes and how to turn on a movie is bad. The actors are all rather irregular and with a hammam. But in spite of these negative aspects, the music is good, the blood is full and ranges from the enormous stucco to the really good appliances. Is it a classic like it says? Is it worth praising the two discs? NO. But it's a good first attempt. Now, if these guys stop giving him a pat on the back about this movie (from what I understand here the only one they ever finished) for a while and try again, they could do better.
