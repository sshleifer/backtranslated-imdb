First of all, I'm a big fan of Madeleine L'Engle and I was so happy to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This film, however, ruined that excitement for me. I'm sorry, but Meg has been described in the book with her jokes and sparkling glasses and considered very unrefined. In the film, he has straight hair and no glasses and is the "sporty type" with a deep voice. This is not the way Madeleine L'Engle imagines Meg to be at all. In fact, Meg was based on the character of Madeleine and painted the way she felt when she was young. This is just an important example of how the book and the film are different. So I'd say, if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, watch it but if you're a devoted fan of Madeleine L'Engle and his Wrinkle in Time series, I'd suggest skipping this movie.
