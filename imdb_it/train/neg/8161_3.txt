Mary Lou is a whore whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her go to her ruinous ruin in 1957. <br /> <br /> Well, the film takes place mainly in 1986. The film falls into the trap of the years 80's weird / stupid special effects, including some strange demented rocking horse. <br /> <br /> However, the spirit of Mary Lou does bad things to people and tries to take over a person's body. Whether he succeeds or not, you will have to watch it to find out. <br /> <br /> However, the film is largely boring and based on a group of worthless characters. Even this is not really a sequel, the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school. It has the average. the horror film falls to the ground, the blood, useless nudity, knocks at the Catholic church. Basic stuff, boring movie. <br /> <br /> Acting is decent enough to give him a 3 out of 10. You can waste time doing something else.
