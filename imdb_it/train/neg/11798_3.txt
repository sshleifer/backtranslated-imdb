I watched Phat Beach over cable for a while and had a little fun. The fat guy is the best character, since he looks like a good guy. The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch these low-cost films that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary about trends and fashions of the year. Phat Beach is also fun because the low budget girls in this movie are strictly at home. Most low-budget films have the "local" quality and it can be said that the girls in this film were local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging on their bikinis that it was fun to watch how the "young" went wild on what was essentially a heavily used, high-mileage skank. There were also beauties. This is the charm of these low budget movies. You'll see lots of little dogs and real cuties! I checked some of them on IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. Sin. It would be interesting if someone had ever managed to make a book "Where are they now" on all the cuties that have appeared in the history of the movies and then they would never come back. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in almost all the movies that seem to have a lot to do for them yet years later, when you watch the movie on TV again, you wonder "what happened to X?" In any case, this film blows mainly, but has some fun moments.
