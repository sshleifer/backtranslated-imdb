This film could have been an interesting study of the character and could have given some idea on the subject, but the real problem with this film is that it has none of this. It provides no idea or solution to the problem. It is only the representation of the "old" male sex and the problems that this is creating for his normal and family life. Why would you want to see it? It's all so totally useless and meaningless. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it does not help much that the main character is a wrinkled male over 50 years old. You will have difficulty identifying and sympathizing with him. He looks just like an old dirty playboy, which is a constant hunt for women and sex. He has all kinds of sexual intercourse about 3 times a day with different women and not only with prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It also doesn't have a negative visual style, even if it all seems a little forced. However, it's all nicer than most other direct-to-video productions. Who knows, if the filmmakers had been given better material to work with, the film would have deserved a better faith. <br /> <br /> The story gets really ridiculous sometimes. There are actually some useless plot lines that are often more ridiculous than they were supposed to be. I'm talking about the entire plot of Ordell, for example. Things get worse when the film starts heading towards the end. Moreover, the whole way the story is told, cutting back and forth between the events and the main character's sessions with his psychiatrist seems a bit cheap and simple. <br /> <br /> But as far as bad movies are concerned, this is not one of them. It's really nothing better or worse than any other straight-to-video random movie with similar concepts. <br /> <br /> It still seems strange and quite surprising that they managed to launch Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. in a simple and insignificant production like this. I guess they were really desperate for work and money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
