This was to be one of the most terrible wrestlemae ever and is saved only by 2 games. The hardcore game between Edge and Mick Foley, also Vince Mcmahon against Shaun Michaels. The main event between Cena and Triple H was a complete failure and to be honest I almost fell asleep, it was so lacking in action, the game of the coffin was not worthy of making the Undertaker appear and the match between Boogie Man and Booker T was a complete joke. If you're really a big WWE fan and you've lost the early days of WWF and Wrestlemanias 17 and 19, you'll probably like this. But I discovered that this Wrestlemania left much to be desired.
