Thomas Clay mixed with the wrong types. This is the problem with young people these days, they have no respect. <br /> <br /> Seriously this film should be avoided at all costs. The action in the main body of the film is slow and rather boring and eventually starts crazy drugs as if, like a director, he doesn't have the best to do. We are presented with the main character of the title who is a bit foreign, we see him at school and at home not entirely at ease, feeling embarrassed in himself as many teenagers do. Robert falls in love with bad boys and starts losing school and taking drugs and before you know it he is a psychopathic rapist. <br /> <br /> The film really talks about Clay's utter failure to understand the links between the image of violence and violent acts. Clay seems to think that a generation of young crowds is made evil by the war scenes on our televisions. yet he filmed the most disgusting piece of SIMULATED violence. Is this guy really? <br /> <br /> If Clay has not seen YouTube, perhaps he is naive and unaware he will be done with the brutal climax scene from his movie? Everyone who wants to see is the most horrible scene of the end of the film and I'm sure it will be what attacks people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is useless because committing such an act of violence to film Clay not only damages young people who are actively engaged in war prevention, but is also condemned for extreme and insipid violence no better reason than his personal celebrity status. <br /> <br /> Too bad for everyone involved.
