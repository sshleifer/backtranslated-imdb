For some reason, several young couples who are hiking in the Italian Alps divide to see who can reach their campsite first. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters a cave, finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of "Tyranus" when he wears a helmet belonging to the corpse. He then spends the rest of the film running in the woods in search of friends and cutting his legs to add a stew to bring the undead "Demonicus" back to life. This Full Moon shot-on-digital version is stupid, senseless, has a terrible acting and sound and (Los) Angeles National Forest is a poor substitute for Italy. However, it is quite high on the scale of involuntary laughter, especially due to excessive lead performance. Whether with staring eyes that run in economical-looking armor brandishing a sword or unleashing a neurotic Latin stuttering on demons and resurrection, Kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and embarrassing delivery of the line must be seen to be believed. Oh well, at least it's not as boring as most of the rest of the cast.
