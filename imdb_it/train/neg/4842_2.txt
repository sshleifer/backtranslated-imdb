Who did the research for this film? It is set in Baghdad in 2004, yet all soldiers wear ACUs and all have the gears of universal camouflage. Nobody wore that stuff in 04. <br /> <br /> I just saw this movie while it's deployed abroad and can I say the overwhelming feeling of the audience was WTF? This film made no sense, the characters came and went without explanation and people did ridiculous things that would never have happened in real life. I realize it's a movie, but obviously it's trying to portray something realistic. He fails miserably, but is trying. <br /> <br /> It is as if someone had invented a lot of random ideas, chewed and swallowed them, then vomited a movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I'm still not sure why I spent all my time. GI Joe was one that really made you think about this. STAY AWAY!
