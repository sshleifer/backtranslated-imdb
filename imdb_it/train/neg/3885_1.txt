This film was not only bad: it was terrible. After watching it, I felt the need for TAKE A SHOWER to get rid of the dirt. There is 'gag' running with an elderly couple peeping out, it's not funny, but it's disgusting. The monster's make-up was beautiful, but that's all. Only continuity errors will make you angry, at least I was. The assembly is really poor. <br /> <br /> Almost everything you could do would be better than spending time watching this movie. Even if your group of friends is in the "bad movies", this is exceptional in its ineptitude, I couldn't even take myself to laugh. You have been warned.
