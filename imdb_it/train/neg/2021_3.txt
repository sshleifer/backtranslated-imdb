Ronald Colman won an Oscar for best actor for his showy performance as a popular theatrical actor who completely loses his roles, in particular with Shakespeare's Othello. The highly regarded film George Cukor has a wonderful pedigree, having been written by the reputable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, the jokes come out as self-conscious and the backstage business is too mature. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for her soundtrack, and Shelley Winters has some good moments as a tough waitress (when Colman faces her breathlessly, she asks him "What are you, some kind of crazy?"). Otherwise, this scenario is terribly obvious, surprisingly negligible and not very funny. * 1/2 from ****
