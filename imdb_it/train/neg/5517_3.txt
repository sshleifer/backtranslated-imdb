I only rate this movie as a 3 out of pity because it tries to be useful. I love to praise a great movie and I'm not inclined to "male" films. Legally blonde was an excellent film. The Georgia Rule, on the other hand, was a disorganized, weak, poorly written, unrealistic example of making films at its worst. at the end of the film I didn't care who was lying or if something had been solved. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in a film is a good HISTORY. This story is weak and never develops (just because the subject is profound, it doesn't mean that the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is the one who experiences a major change of character, and is ready for that change over the course of the film. In Georgia Rule, the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped. Secondly, there were too many ATTENTIVE dynamic characters. Bringing out a really good dynamic character is hard work and takes time (you only have a couple of hours in a movie). This means that too many attempts by dynamic characters will pay too little attention to their personal change. Even if I ignore the badly written story and the litter of weak dynamic characters, I can't even say I liked anyone. Every character was a disaster. It's okay if you're writing American Beauty but not when you're trying a dramatic play. Georgia was a horrible mother, her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being (no, I'm not cutting them a little because she was harassed, crap happens to everyone and we are all responsible for our actions). The Mormon boy of "Dudley Do Right" should have had the courage not to compromise his religion and commitments ... and Simon, I mean seriously, what kind of boy leaves a 17-year-old girl who has been molested, you stay every now and then (unless it's an actor or a politician). It's worth watching this movie if you want to remind yourself what a good movie is!
