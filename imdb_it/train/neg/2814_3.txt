1st watched on 8/26/2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): Frightening, yet sadistic (which makes sense) portrait of a relative of the Marquis De Sade who performs the same sadistic acts and amuses himself that presumably its predecessor done. This film by Tobe Hooper is actually not very different from his style similar to the films of Freddy Krueger with the same star (Freddy himself - Robert Englund) who plays a dual role (the Marquis De Sade and his relative). It also seems that he really wants to hit Christianity, but in the end he really loses my disappointment, but leaves a feeling that is inconsistent with the film. It could have been much worse if excesses in sex and violence had been taken, but they tried to keep it to a minimum despite some disgusting scenes. My final thought is why otherwise Hooper wanted to make this film. Obviously it took a while to be distributed, so it must be advertised in a gruesome way and with the name of Hooper in the title to hope to earn some money on his name and his blood. It is obvious that this did not work.
