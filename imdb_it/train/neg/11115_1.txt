A previous critic has called this film "pure visual joy". I wonder if he saw the same movie I made. "High Art" had to have the most ruthlessly depressing "Seven" interiors. Sheedy and Mitchell can almost be forgiven for the clich√© of going to a B&B for their first time. Of course, before they do, you have to look at the opium-den parties where people who are not apparently employed live but who somehow can sustain a thriving drug habit. Not to mention the icy looks of those familiar types of movies, Girlfriend / Boyfriend At Start, who are well aware of being thrown in the next 100 minutes or so. The film also claims that the character of Sheedy retired from professional photography for ten years. What did he do, retire at the age of twenty?
