Too much of something borrowed in grade B- <br /> <br /> Super Bowl Sunday is one of the slowest days in cinemas every year. For this reason, film studios tend to avoid releasing films with larger budgets for the weekend. Every few years a studio releases a female countermeasure film (2001 "The Wedding Planner") to compete with the big game. The Super Bowl weekend, titled "The Wedding Date", will try to find success and attract viewers who don't watch the game. <br /> <br /> Sick of people sorry for her, a single woman, Kat Ellis (Debra Messing, "Will and Grace" on TV) hires male escort Nick (Dermot Mulrony, "About Schmidt") to pose as she's engaged to her sister's wedding in London. Her family made it difficult not to be married, and her seven-year-old ex-boyfriend, who dumped her for no reason, is the best man. To make him jealous Kat pulls Nick around his ex to show him what he's missing. But in the end Nick helps Kat to understand that he can open up and let someone love her. <br /> <br /> The film borrows too much from similar wedding films. It is almost a carbon copy of the "Picture Perfect" of 1999 and mixes in scenes similar to "The Wedding Planner" and "My Best Friends Wedding". The film also has a reverse "Pretty Women" theme, and knowing his audience, the director makes intelligent references to this and other films. <br /> <br /> "The Wedding Date" has all the clich√© elements of a typical wedding movie, there is the overbearing stereotype mother (Holland Taylor, "Legally Blonde"), and practically the wedding speeches plagiarized by part of the family and friends during the wedding and rehearsal dinner. The turning point in the final was already done before, but it was something that was not completely foreseen. The real reason why Kat was downloaded is a surprise and changes the direction of the film in the last half hour. <br /> <br /> Even if "The Wedding Date" is predictable, it can stand alone. Debra Messing, in her first leading role, proves to be fascinating and fun. Dermot Mulrony has a great harmony with Debra Messing, but most of his dialogue was too trivial and unrealistic. He is able to make the most of what he is given and be able to save the character. <br /> <br /> With the use of many intelligent (often sexual) games, the movie is actually fun. Although the film is primarily a film, it has components that everyone can appreciate. The beautiful story and humor make it the best film coming out a long time ago.
