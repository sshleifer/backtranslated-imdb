what ends up killing this film is his self-awareness, among other things. here is a brief list: 1. irreverent behavior. when the beatles approached and injected their brand of "bizarre, irreverent" behavior / humor, it was hailed as cool. it was more than 4 decades ago. get over it. <br /> <br /> 2. False sophistication. Spitting the base, quasi-socio-political isms are a difficult terrain to make work comically. ask woody allen. <br /> <br /> 3. the post-modern "I am hard on this fake world and yes, I recognize it in myself" you eat the snake - used as an illustration with another animal in the film itself! - is such a rebuilt. <br /> <br /> 4. sweet and smug sympathy. <br /> <br /> 5. amateur writing, acting, directing ... student films ever seen? a victim of herself, the only thing I can say positive is that at least she has a sense of herself, and sheesh, now I'm getting caught up in the part of self-reflexivity that she considers equally useful, of value. <br /> <br /> but towards ... what? in the end, it sounds like empty like any other pretentious piece - hey, never see Woody's bergman on bergman, that is: "Interiors" ??? well, this makes it even more amatrically.
