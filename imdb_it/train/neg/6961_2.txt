I completely agree with the other comment someone should do a What's up tiger Lily with this movie. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the worst French films I've seen in a long time (actually along with Brotherwood of the Wolves, 2 horrendous films in too short a time). <br /> <br /> It's really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea is fun. Antoine DeCaunes in particular and Jean Rochefort among my friends, I was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor film. <br /> <br /> Lou Doyon is pretty mean, as usual, which shows that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they don't necessarily give you the talent. <br /> <br /> avoid this movie, if you want to laugh, look at an Alain Chabat instead or some nice vintage piece full of fun like LA FILLE DE D'ARTAGNAN.
