Why when a star reaches the top of the star chain, does it ruin all the good work by making a bad movie? Burt Reynolds peaked, then began to make Need Needham's terrible car chase gestures. Arnold Schwarzenegger became the hottest property in Hollywood, only to invite derision on himself with the horrible Last Action Hero. And here, the talkative Eddie Murphy erases the memories of Trading Places and 48 Hours with this "family" adventure film, which is an incredible boring, childish and generally horrible misfire in which the possibility of seeing the large, large breasts of Charlotte Lewis in a tight shirt is the most attractive aspect of the entire film. <br /> <br /> The plot is pure and simple. It's about the social worker Murphy, contacted by mysterious types and told he is the Chosen One. Chosen for that, I heard you ask. His job is to save a Tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world. As the main demon, class actor Charles Dance seems terribly embarrassed in the film, but hey, I'm sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents. Of all the Murphy movies, this is easily the worst. I have read some reviews that suggest that it is nice to see Murphy in an atypical role, in a genre of film not formidable, and while both points are vaguely true, it is not possible to forgive the fact that the film is still atypical and could not be - it's an absolute load of garbage. <br /> <br />
