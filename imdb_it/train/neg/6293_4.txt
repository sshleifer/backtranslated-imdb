I had the pleasure of seeing this movie in advance and I must say that I thought it would be boring and wondered how they could improve the 1984 version of the Bachelor Party with Tom Hanks, which I thought was pretty good ... I was right ... In all honesty I thought it could have been better ... Surely there were some funny moments but it just doesn't seem to have hit the mark with me ... The acting was OK and the plot pretty well follows the original but I think it would could have been much better ... This film I would say is for teenagers and young at heart; full of female bodies, alcohol and sex ... It's just another typical run of the mill movie that has been done over and over again. 4/10 is my vote for this.
