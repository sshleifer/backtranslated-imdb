Remembering the dirty details of this insidiously vapid "film" is like digging in the chest cavity with a rusted and salty spoon. Perhaps "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992) was a bit predictable, but this pathetic excuse for a film is just one of the most shameless marketing offers I've ever heard of. A boy who fights spies / terrorists when he is home alone in a Chicago suburb of chicken pox? Ridiculous! Why was this film made? I am the kind of person who believes that even terrible films are not waste of time, but rather learning experiences. However, this is actually a waste of time. It should be avoided at all costs.
