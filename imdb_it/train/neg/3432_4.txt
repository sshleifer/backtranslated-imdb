A murderer, a cannibal rapist is killed by a mad cop at the scene of his latest murder. At his grave a cult met with plans to resurrect him by peeing on the grave. This naturally works and awakens the boy's penis tear and returns to his old ways of killing with a new zombie look. The two policemen, one of whom is getting a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a problem with drugs, are back on the case. Two members of the original sect also try to stop the murderer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing. Thinking they had filed away, they leave, but outside the grave comes a plastic doll that was used in the original resurrection. Seems a bit confused but it's not just crap. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy who plays Dr Vincent van Gore in the faces of the gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this movie. The other cop only talks about battles to get his terrible jokes. Now I'm all for low budget cinema, but this film is simply terrible. If it hadn't been for the ladies of the eyes and their nakedness, I would probably have fallen asleep. There is some blood, but it is never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims. The zombie make-up on the other hand looks fantastic and his long penis along the foot he uses to rape his victims is sometimes funny. There is also a decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The doll with the voice of the Chipmunks is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie. It's just a plastic toy on a line. <br /> <br /> The finish is extremely ugly. You would expect the killer to do a lot more fighting than he does. God knows how they made enough money to make a sequel. <br /> <br /> 4/10
