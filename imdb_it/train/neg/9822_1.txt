There have been times during the film that I wish I had been beaten to death. The only reason I put up with the whole movie is because I couldn't believe how bad it was and I thought it would improve. This was really a horror movie. I was horrified to have wasted what seemed like 4 hours of my life that I will never return. The other two hours I mourned for the loss. Please recommend this movie to anyone who wants to torture and tell them that the suspense will kill them.
