I saw this recent Woody Allen film because I am a fan of his work and I try to see everything he does, even though the reviews of this film have led me to expect a disappointing effort. They were right. This is a confusing film that can't decide if it wants to be a comedy, a romantic fantasy or a drama about the middle-aged female crisis. It fails to all three. <br /> <br /> Alice (Mia Farrow) is a restless middle-aged woman who has married with great wealth and leads a life of luxury without purpose with her rather boring husband and their two small children. This rather trivial plot concept is enlivened by such implausibility as an old Chinese folk healer that makes it invisible with some magical herbs and the ghost of a former lover (with whom he flies over Manhattan). If these additions sound too fantastic to you, how about something more prosaic, like a relationship with a saxophonist? <br /> <br /> I was never quite sure what this confusing mixture was trying to say. There are only a handful of really fun moments in the movie, and the ending is a really absurd Pollyanna touch. <br /> <br /> Rent 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' instead, a superbly well-made film that manages to combine comedy with serious ethical and moral consideration. Or return to "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan".
