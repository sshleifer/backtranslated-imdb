First of all, to give you an idea of ​​my tastes in the movies ... <br /> <br /> 2007 Comedies I had fun: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades Of Glory <br /> <br / > Comedies of 2007 I hated: Evan Almighty, The Brothers Solomon, Good Luck Chuck <br /> <br /> I should have followed my first instinct and turned off "Hot Rod" after I arrived about 20 minutes. I knew then that this movie wouldn't make me laugh once. The script is absolutely brutal - I have no idea how this monstrosity managed to beat 6 on IMDb. Anyone over 10 who liked this must be a kind of mental defect. <br /> <br /> This does not come close to anything with Will Farrell and it is clear that Andy Samberg cannot bring more than a 5 to 10 minute sketch to YouTube or SNL. I don't know how they put Ian McShane and Isla Fisher online in making this film ... they must have favors or something. I arrived knowing it would be a stupid movie, but I thought it would be at least fun. I didn't smile. <br /> <br /> Normally I don't comment on IMDb movies, but it was so terrible, I just had to warn people. This is only the 4th movie I saw that I felt compelled to evaluate 1/10.
