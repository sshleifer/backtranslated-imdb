This movie is the worst excuse for a movie I've ever seen. To begin with, I'd like to say that the cover of this movie is misleading, if you think you see a really scary horror movie with a monster clown, you're really wrong. In fact, the face of the assassins doesn't look a bit like the cover, it's just an image they must have found on Google and thought it was beautiful. Speaking of things they found and thought was beautiful, there is a scene in this film where some of the band are looking for their friend in the old woods, then suddenly the screen breaks into a scene where there is a deer mother who feeds is young in a twinkle of sunlight ... I mean seriously WTF ??? How is this relevant to the dark woods that are wandering? I bought this movie from a man in a market hoping it would be fun, if it wasn't horror, at least it would be fun, right? MISTAKEN! The next day I gave it to my colleague by getting rid of the plague named S.I.C.K <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: DON'T SEE THIS FILM !!!
