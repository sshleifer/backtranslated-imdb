James Gandolfini is a good actor, so he never took part in this piece of garbage. Affleck is just a light weight that he can't cut, the rest of the cast is truly unforgettable. I saw it in the United States in an empty theater, I immediately understood why the place was empty after about 10 minutes. I went out before the end it was so bad, so imagine my surprise when I returned to England, I saw the film had a brilliant report from that yoyo "Paul Ross" on one of the market Sundays. I always rely on Ross to save me money on movie tickets, if he says the film is good, I go straight to this same site to check it out. This film should go directly to â‚¬ 1.99 DVD in a supermarket near you.
