How sad there is not the possibility of posting a grade lower than 1. I saw this piece of nonsense and I couldn't believe what I was looking at. Every single part of the film was horrible. Music, acting, direction, history, everything, simply everything. Actually I found myself laughing out loud at various points in the film. I particularly loved the point where our hero is rushing into the hospital in slow motion with soft focus, and he throws the clip out of the nurses' hand because ............. well . Just because. Product placement? Crucifix (crucifi?) Everywhere. If you are of Christian persuasion and very easily satisfied, you might like this movie. If you like this movie, you really need to get out more.
