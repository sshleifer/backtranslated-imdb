There are many comments already posted that say exactly how I felt about this movie, so Ill keep it short. <br /> <br /> "The Grinch" I thought it was wonderful - Jim Carrey is a very talented, physical comedian and versatile versatile actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers on the other hand gets his laughs being annoying. I really liked "Waynes World" and "So I Married a Ax Murderer" in his days - but I've never been fond of Austin Powers and "the Cat In The Hat" just finished me. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible - the gags were horrible! inappropriate for children not only in adult content, but in the fact that some of them were so outdated that they haven't entertained anyone for 50 years! The plot was messy, messy, messy! It's a shame because the kids were very nice like "mom". They could probably have chosen a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but he could have taken it off if it hadn't been for Myers ugly, disgusting representation of the Cat too much. <br /> <br /> I mean - did Myers even look at a script? Was written? The other actors seemed to have one - but the Cat just seemed to fly it out! <br /> <br /> On the other hand I would like to say that the sets and props were wonderful !!! But unfortunately they can't save this movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Dr. Seuss - the man was a genius! Don't ruin his reputation by adapting his work in such a lazy and messy way !!! <br /> <br /> 1/10
