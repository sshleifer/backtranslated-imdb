I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. Above all because in this there is Juhi Chawla, she is a great actress. <br /> <br /> This film contains six stories. It's a new concept flown by Hollywood. So it's not a new article. <br /> <br /> 1. Khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. She wants to become famous and create a boyfriend to get journalists interested in her. But then Rahul (Salman Khan) appears and claims to be her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Priyanka Chopra is still not a good actress. When she screams, it annoys me. Salman khan cannot play comic roles. But in his serious part he is wonderful. <br /> <br /> 2. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla). He enters a mid-life crisis and is attracted to a much younger woman, forgetting what he really has in life; his wife and children. <br /> <br /> Anil kapoor en Juhi are natural actors / actresses. They are big. But this story is too subtle for them. <br /> <br /> 3. Shiven (Akshaye Khanna) will marry Gia (Ayesha Takia), but has cold feet and extinguishes the wedding. <br /> <br /> 4. Ashutosh (Joh Abraham) is married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). You have an accident and suffer a memory loss. Now he no longer knows that he loves his husband. <br /> <br /> 5. Raju (Govinda) is a taxi driver. He meets Stephani (Shannon Esrechowitz) who is a white woman who is in love with an Indian male but is about to marry an Indian woman. Raju must bring Staphani to that man, but he falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> I never liked Govinda's films. It's very annoying, not fun. But in this film I really liked it, as if it had grown in the last few years. <br /> <br /> 6. Oh yes! There's Sohail Khan! He plays Ram Dayal who is just married to Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar). He wants to have some serious action with her, but every time his family intervenes. <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is not a handsome actor, but it's fun! I like his movies. <br /> <br /> Now here's the problem. All these stories are not interesting. Making a story out of six uninteresting stories doesn't make the whole movie interesting! Here and there the stories touch, but they are not significant for the characters. <br /> <br /> My conclusions; Priyanka cannot act! Free that woman in the Bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should make more films, this role was too small for him. Salman Khan cannot play comic roles, but real serious films. This is written about his acting life. This film sucks, and is a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses like Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> It's just like having the chance to make a movie with Amitabh Bachchan, and you just let him sing a lullaby.
