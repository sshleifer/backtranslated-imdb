What happened in the name of God here? How do you create what is virtually a Redneck Zombies economic knockoff? Has Zombie '90 ever been able to entertain someone ... someone, or even earn a dollar profit? But above all, what happened here? <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence was directed by a madman by the name of Andreas Schnaas, specializing in gore films of earthquakes such as Goblet of Gore and Anthropophagus 2000, some of which contain blasphemies in the titles. In the department of gore, this is not very different from the rest. Although, the level of ineptitude ... well, shocking. <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence is as bad as Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive is bloody, think about it. <br /> <br /> To become too specific with the story would be a waste of time. An accident, involving chemicals, causes the dead to return and eat the living. Never has the concept been treated in this way. The effects of blood are a whole new bass. Just a Z-class nightmare. I can't understand if this was originally meant to be fun, I somehow doubt that the English dubbing was faithful to the original script, but stranger things happened. It just reminds me of a shot-on-video introduction of a Troma movie, except that it lasts much longer. <br /> <br /> I've only seen one movie that was worse than this, The Chooper. <br /> <br /> To prove that Andreas Schnaas is a real director, I highly recommend Nikos The Impaler. If you think you don't have standards in what you're looking for in a bad movie, try Extreme Pestilence, but you've been warned. It takes nerves of steel to get to the bottom. But if blood is all you are here for, then you may be able to stand it. Apart from that, no atmosphere, no, and I mean NO budget, no entertainment value, but above all, no pride. Show some pride, Schnaas. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Updated 07/07/09: After a few more Zombie '90 views, I changed my mind, or I think I just figured it out. Zombie '90 is hilarious, so hard words don't matter, even if Extreme Pestilence still deserves only one star.
