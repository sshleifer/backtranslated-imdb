I got a copy of this movie thinking it was the 1964 movie with "Zombie Bloodbath" as one of his alternative titles. Perversely, this film actually has a better rating on this site than the title above; which could mean that the other is really bad! This film is also pretty ugly; obviously you can't go into a movie that calls itself "Zombie Bloodbath" and expect to see a masterpiece, and in all honesty is up to the title with the amount of blood on display ... but everything looks very old and tired he is not helped by atrocious acting and stupid plot. It's just your average nuclear spill that causes people to turn into zombies, etc. Etc. The film kicks off with a sequence that sees people melting and practically letting you know what you are for; low quality zombie garbage. There's a lot of blood in the film, and it's a great job, otherwise the movie would have been really boring. Even the Zombie Bloodbath seems really cheap, and it was clearly put together by inexperienced directors! The main influence seemed to be Romero's best Day of the Dead, although it could really be anything that contains zombies and blood. It all boils down to a typically predictable and useless ending and overall I can't say I was impressed!
