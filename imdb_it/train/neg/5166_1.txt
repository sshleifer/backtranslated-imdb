The terrible acting, the limping plot, the stupid story and all the terrible film all in all summarizes this piece of junk. It was atrocious to sit down. Just awful. Don't waste a penny on this. Cinemas should feel guilty for putting this movie out there for people to watch. This "horror" film was not even scary, disturbing or disturbing. It was in no way visually appealing. The acting was so terrible on the part of all the actors that every attempt to drag you through the film through dialogue is completely destroyed in the moments when the actor / actress opens his mouth. Also, the whole story, I don't know why anyone should make a movie with this story again. Don't waste time and money. Even if it's a free ticket, don't waste a moment seeing this movie. You'll feel dumber to watch it.
