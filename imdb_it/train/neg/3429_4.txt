I received a copy from the writer of this movie about soulseek. I have to say that it is pathetic and simply painful to see the two cops acting, but I saw the film as a joke and since it is a tribute to the Augustus subway that I saw is in my book as a fantasy film. Its quality and everything is pretty ugly, but it's fun and something to talk about among your friends. It reminds me of the troma but good stuff. I recommend seeing him in two conditions, if you are bored and you need a good laugh, or tall, otherwise let it be. Recommended download for sure. or and the killings are pretty funny. like when zombies tear Satan's idolaters and dub someone with their heads on their heads.
