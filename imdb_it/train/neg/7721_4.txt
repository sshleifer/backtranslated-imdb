Combat scenes play in slow motion Jackie Chan and witty attempts are pathetic (the worst word game ever: "Guess what?" I heard you coming this time "). The stars are a couple disagreeing: Brandon Lee, despite the terrible jokes he has to say, actually shows traces of charisma and screen charm - things that Dolph Lundgren is completely lacking (at least in this film) Note for the director: in the future, please stay away from any scene of love, especially when your main actress will not make any nudity and you have to rely heavily on a double corporal.
