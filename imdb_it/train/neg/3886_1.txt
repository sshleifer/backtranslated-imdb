Is it a stupid movie? You bet!! I couldn't find any time in this movie that was creepy or scary. Stupid moments? Plenty. Stupid characters? You bet. Negative effects? Everywhere! Rick Baker may have done great and better things, he's not one of them. Oh well, people have to start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson is celebrated. He's the most whiny doctor I've ever seen. He has a man who's melting somewhere in Ventura County, he's not overly happy that his wife is pregnant (probably because he's 55 and weighs 90 pounds) and there's no cracker to be found anywhere. He also has the general not too useful in his obstacle in wanting to find astronaut Steve. And the local sheriff wants to know what's going on even though Mr. Nelson can't tell him anything. There are also some random characters launched to a large extent that meet the melting man. Eventually the film ends and the monster is collected in a garbage can to become a compost. In the end it's just what you need for a great MST episode.
