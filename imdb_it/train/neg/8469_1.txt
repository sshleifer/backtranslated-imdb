"Kids Like These" could have been a decent movie, given the topic. But instead it has become a TV movie of the average below average, of the week, without much success. The acting is stale, the plot is predictable and the direction does not exist. For a better film on the same subject, try the excellent "Le Huiti√®me Jour", a film that really cares about people with Down syndrome. In "Kids Like These" they are simply used as an excuse for crying sentimentality. Pretty scary. 1/10
