Ok, I saw the preview of this stupid movie. First of all the film is so staid and not real, they all act. They can't sing. They are too full of themselves. It's horrible. Yes, children between 8 and 10 could have fun, but it's really stupid. I mean, they say their manager is a child. And there the record label is false. It's stupid. Don't see it. <br /> <br /> As for the set up and the direction, not so bad. It's a cute documentary but it documents a stupid thing. <br /> <br /> See only if you don't like good music. Moreover, it is very trivial. It's not even tasteful. I hate being so bad ... but this is really a piece of junk.
