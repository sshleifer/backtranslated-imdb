You can't imagine how I couldn't wait for King of the Ants. As a big fan of Gordon, I awaited the European premiere with wicked anticipation. Especially since I loved Dagon - Gordon's last success - so much. King of the Ants was introduced here in my country and it was Gordon himself who introduced it. Unfortunately, I could not go and congratulate him on this later. King of the Ants is his most trivial and mediocre film to date. In reality, the quality level has never exceeded the standards of the television thriller. The plot is terribly ordinary and, with the exception of some poor scenes, Gordon's typical touch is never recognized. Furthermore, the already weak script has more holes than a Swiss cheese bowl! It involves a young thief who was hired to commit a murder. So he does it and obviously they don't pay him, and of course he falls in love with the victim's wife and obviously gets revenge. Only the sequences in which the boy descends into a spiral of madness are worth a mention and are the only ones to remind you that you are still watching a Stuart Gordon film. The acting performances are below average with McCenna such as the heroic lowlife, George `Norm Peterson 'Wendt as the fat bastard and Kari Wuhrer as the bomb of the good heart. The extremely illogical things happen constantly and the obtuseness of the story becomes irritating very quickly, while the effects of the trick are not enough to satisfy the horror fans. I read some other comments about King of the Ants, claiming that it is the best of Gordon since it is finally a stimulating and mature film. Well, if so. I prefer to remain immature and give Re-Animator another vision, thank you very much. Oh well, I guess every good director ends up getting tired and inspired. Too bad he passed Stuart Gordon too.
