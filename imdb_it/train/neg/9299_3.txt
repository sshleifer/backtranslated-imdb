While watching this movie, I tried to understand why they took the time to do it. Although the main plot of the film is potentially good, there are all kinds of unrelated / unnecessary subplots. Hollywood marketing people must have dictated the multiple villains, the perpetual double crosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex. It's strange that we see more of them having sex than we did of the President and his lover. The many plots and subplots make the film too wide and none of the characters is properly developed - I didn't really feel like I knew any characters, except that everyone is corrupt and evil. The ending is totally incomplete - it left me more than wished for what could have been, but what was meant to be. In the end, there really is no explanation for why someone does what he does, except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double cross. I'm surprised that so many established (and talented) actors have agreed to make a film so empty. It looked like a film made by university students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time unless you are in a movie class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie.
