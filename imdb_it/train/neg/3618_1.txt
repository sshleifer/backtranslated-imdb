Story of an imminent divorce taken with a click - or is it true? - through the eyes of a 6-year-old child. Messy dialogues, cardboard characters, stock situations, a sub-plot of red zombies and, worst of all, absolutely no reward, emotionally or dramatically. <br /> <br /> Nobody teaches creative writing anymore? The true sign of a weak narrator - when you can't create any kind of satisfying denouement - ends the story. I have to ask, "what made you think this was a story to tell in the first place!?" <br /> <br /> Good, but wasted, debut by the small actor Anthony De Marco - the rest of the cast was, at best, forgettable. And they wonder why nobody watches independent films! It is ninety minutes of my life that I will never return.
