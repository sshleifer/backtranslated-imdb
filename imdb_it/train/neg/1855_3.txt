This is the most disgusting movie I've ever seen, but in all honesty it's watchable and pretty funny. I don't think filmmakers meant that it was your typical Hollywood blockbuster quality. It's just a stupid movie about a serial killer who is immersed in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow (since it's mid-winter). It then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to make you laugh alone. This movie is really stupid but it's fun. The killings are hilarious. I wouldn't advise you to go and buy it (as I did - the cover looked good!) But if you happen to be on TV one night and you're ready for a laugh, then attack it.
