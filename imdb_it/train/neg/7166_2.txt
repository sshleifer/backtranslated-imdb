This film could have been very good, but it comes very soon. Kitsch special effects and so-so acting. I might have looked over whether the story was not so bad. If there was more than one background story, it would have been better. The plot centers on a wicked druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines. The film drags itself to infinity and never clearly explains anything, it continues to tire. Christopher Walken has a part, but it is completely meaningless, like most of the film. This film has potential, but it really looks like a bad TV movie. I would avoid this movie.
