This was a painful example of a cheap, boring and unoriginal show produced by Australian television stations to meet local content quotas. The script was really terrible and it doesn't surprise me that the writers are responsible for the worst Australian film in memory of Honerable Wally Norman. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this TV series was fun - never - not even slightly fun. He was just tired and BAD and worst of all, he really thought it was funny. It was simply embarrassing to watch. <br /> <br /> There is something very strange about this show that is given 10 out of 10 on IMDb. Try to find a (real) review from a (real) Australian spectator of the show (there weren't many) and it's impossible. Or crazy. There are more fun loaves of bread than this show. <br /> <br /> Avoid the show at all costs and if it comes out on DVD, remember that the laughter it deserves was not intentional.
