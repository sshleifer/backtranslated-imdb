I really hope I can give a negative rating, because I think I wasted 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror movie ever shot. the acting was just terrible, I meant REALLY bad, the dialogue was worse, the script sounded like it was written by ... I can't think of anything horrible enough to say. And the day "outside" and the night "inside" the shots make you think that the events lasted several days. Terribly recited, directed, written, etc. Etc. All the way to the gofer as it does lunch for everyone. STAY AWAY FROM THIS AT ALL COSTS. If my only hope of staying out of hell is to do a good deed, it's telling the world not to look at this shit. This film is the exact reason why horror movies are never taken seriously.
