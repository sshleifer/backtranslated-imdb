Yes, Marie Dresler drinks plum juice which she thinks is poison and she runs out. <br /> <br /> Dresler is good. Never my cup of tea, but it is a solid performer who definitely keeps the screen. I saw this for Polly Moran, which I saw elsewhere. Here, Moran is OK - just OK - as a clever friend / enemy of Dressler. Too bad it ended up in almost total oblivion. <br /> <br /> The plot is good-hearted. The bad guys try to rob the citizens. Dressler triumphs and everything ends well. <br /> <br /> I wonder about the central mechanism of the plot: the bonds. This emerged during the Depression, so perhaps everyone was aware of the ties and what they can do if used well and if used incorrectly. I, however, not of that era, am vaguely familiar with them. They're like just different stocks, right? It seems strange to build a story in The Little Man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity.
