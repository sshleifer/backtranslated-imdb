First, it takes a full half hour for Hackman to leave the prison and start work. What a waste of time, we all know that Hackman is going out to do a job for his masters, because they waste almost a third of the film on these sequences. Then Hackman stays in a hotel and the plot doesn't go anywhere, simply by showing us that Hackman is under close surveillance and everything he says or does is known by the masters. Again, another 20 minutes. Then more time lost showing the meeting with his wife. All this should have taken 10-15 minutes at most simply as a set-up for real action, intrigue and twists. When the real action came, I was so bored that I just wanted the movie to end. Hackman is big as usual, and so are the other actors, but this is a real disaster of the first magnitude.
