I wanted to see this movie because of Eliza Dushku, but she has only a small part of it and her character is not very nice. However, the main character, played by Melissa Sagemiller, is extremely beautiful and a perfect pleasure to watch throughout the film. This is nothing but a showcase for his appearance and talent. Does a great job. <br /> <br /> The story itself is, at first glance, rather meaningless. After a car accident, some friends are probably dead, but they continue to live their previous lives, while all sorts of mysterious things happen. Some bad guys follow them, but we never really find out who they are (maybe they were the ones in the other car, but we certainly don't hear anything about why they follow them). The final scenes seem filmically ambitious, but I can't get anything coherent. The opening scene, in which the villains (who wear some strange masks) cut the wrist of a blonde girl and collect part of her blood are never explained or followed. Unless the bad guys are a representation of the surgeons who are trying to wrest Cassie (Sagemiller) from the dead ... but no, it doesn't seem to work. The bad guys are just bad; in reality they only create a story that otherwise would have been interesting. In a supernatural story about death, love and sacrifice, who the hell needs bad guys? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
