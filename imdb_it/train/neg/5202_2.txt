Contains spoiler The plot of the film can be summarized in a few sentences: Three boys go hunting in the forest. Two of them along with other people are hit in the head without explanation. The last guy can stand in the clear, scream and do anything without being shot. He can walk through an old factory and let the wicked enter his battlefield without a fight. The bad guys are dressed appropriately in black and look bad. <br /> <br /> This is the whole story, not summarized but in detail. Everything is pulled out with a guy who is ringing a door bell. Let's wait with him. Long shot of bored boys in the woods and sleeping. We can take a nap with them. The only attempt to follow a female jogger could have redeemed, if we could see her ass or her boobs bounce off. <br /> <br /> The dialog box is less than Terminator and it is not because there is so much action. The characters do not speak. And then they don't even have something trivial to say "I'll be back". If my friend shot him over the weekend, I would cheer him on, because it's quite an undertaking to figure out camera controls. Paying money to rent this DVD is totally inappropriate. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is a bit funny is the extra with the director who says the local police didn't realize they were shooting and treated them like a casual guy who walked with a gun. If they had filmed it, I would be sure it would be more fun to watch the movie.
