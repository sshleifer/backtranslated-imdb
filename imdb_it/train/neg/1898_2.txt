The remake of H.B. Halicki's classic 1970s film is simply horrible. Together with Vanishing Point, Gone in 60 Seconds represent the car chase films par excellence. The remake takes the original and puts it on its head. Considering that Halicki gave us 75% of car chases and 25% support for the drama, in GISS 2000 we get 25% of car chases and 75% support for the drama. Cage as a superman, save his brother, kiss the girl. MTV edits, tits and asses. Save your money, rent the original. At least Halicki did not live to see his child (he wrote, produced, directed and acted in the movie "74") degraded in this way.
