This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen is EXTREMELY boring with a lot of boring dialogue and it has some VERY annoying characters and a ludicrous looking creature. The only reason I looked at this piece of junk is because it was on that set of 8 horror records I got. The plot is absurd and totally stupid like the ending. No blood as ever except for some blood marks on the creature, and a pair of bloody gunshot wounds. The acting is TERRIBLE !!. Richard Cardella is as terrible as the sheriff and was rather ridiculous and his character is annoying. Glen Roberts is the comic relief and it wasn't funny at all! Mark Siegel is extremely annoying and he was also NOT FUN! Bob Hyman is decent, but not much more. Richard Garrison is annoying and has never had any problems with Kacey Cobb. Kacey Cobb is so-so here and hasn't had chemistry with Richard. Overall Avoid this piece of junk at all costs! BOMB on 5.
