If there was a ZERO score, I'd give it to this movie. Today was the second time I tried to watch it and I still could not pass from start to finish. I can't believe the multiple stars given by others and I can only assume that they either know the actors or they are an advertiser in disguise! The acting is atrocious all around, the script is blah, the child who plays Nichole shows zero emotion even when threatened. The "southern" accent of the actress who plays Amber's mother is ridiculous: I'm from Georgia and I have friends from Texas - believe me NO ONE talks like that! None of his emotions seemed real in any scene. The subject is very serious and deserves much better treatment.
