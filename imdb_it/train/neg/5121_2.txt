I went into this film thinking it would be a nice football drama (in the same style as Remember the Titans); however, I felt like I had just witnessed a sermon by Ted Haggard on the abduction. The only thing missing was the request for a tithe at the end of the film. In fact, you would probably get more from a teleporting sermon than from this excuse for entertainment. At least with the televangelist's sermon, there are quotations from Scripture rather than quotations from the popular self-help pulp. The plot was completely predictable to the point that anyone with enough attention could trace the entire plot within the first 15 minutes of the film.
