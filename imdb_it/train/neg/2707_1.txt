This is one of the most putrid films of the 90s. I wouldn't recommend it if you have something better to do. <br /> <br /> This photo presents African-Americans as wild, uneducated, violent, inarticulate and reefer smokers. Fudge (Ice Cube) and his group of friends are continually disrespectful to others in the dormitory, not just whites, but also Asians, and are never disciplined for their actions. Despite all that tolerance they continue to whine and cry over the evil white oppressors who run their lives and stand in their way. In fact, it's the Fudge influence that makes Remmy bind to the heads of the skin, leave college and finally kill Malik's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Skinheads are presented as a hidden group of underachievers who share a pad off campus and generally stay away from everyone else. They never blow up their music to annoy people or provoke the police. They commit serious crimes such as drums and rape, yet they are not as repellent or threatening as Caramellus and Dreads (Busta Rhymes) are. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of material in this film that almost offends or made me laugh. Some of these are the following. <br /> <br /> Fudge and Dreads are declared students at the University of Columbus, but we never see them in class and it's not clear how they pay their tuition fees. It can only be assumed that the grass they smoke has something to do with their finances. Although they are students in what appear to be a private university, they cannot pronounce a single line of appropriate English. Their characters are developed only through their compulsive lament and their xenophobia. It seems that Kristen (Kristy Swanson) drunk knew exactly why Billy was taking her to his house. He even asked him to get a tire so they could get started. The fact that he penetrated her without a condom became a rape while it would have been a great sex only if he had one at hand. Later Kristen was assured by Taryn (Jennifer Connely) who had no responsibility in that matter and, although she jumped voluntarily into a man's bed, she was not ready for sexual intercourse and was exploited by a sexual predator. Then about a week later he met, and slept with, a sensitive and ultra sensitive person who knew how to avoid rape and brought a condom. The director emphasized contraception in depth. <br /> <br /> This film is complete and garbage that makes people like black bites and women look silly and fragile. Cole Hauser's acting and Laurence Fishburne's accent are the only reasons I can see it. The writer / director is obviously a man of limited intelligence. Go ahead and limit yours by looking at this crap if you want, but remember that neurons don't grow back. Follow the advice at the end and UNLEARN.
