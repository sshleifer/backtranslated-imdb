It is obviously illegal. Pedophiles pray for such things. How did they make a film like that? This film is all summarized in one word, SICK. Where people go to do and watch this kind of film. While I was watching the movie, I didn't really think they would let this guy say maybe 12 if he actually slept with this woman. Sorry if this is a spoiler for you, but I would have rater not seen this. Where is the mental health of these people? Perhaps the creators of this film are pedophiles? Our society today is full of all kinds of sexual predators that pray about children, yet filmmakers make these types of films that do nothing but provoke this kind of behavior. I noticed that in a previous comment someone asked if there was a version showing them naked. Is this a kid here, and is anyone asking for something like that? What's wrong with this picture?
