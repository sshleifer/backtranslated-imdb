Lensman's original series of novels is such a classic. It's a pure SF adventure with some substance (here and there) and I've always wondered why Hollywood didn't film it literally because it's just the kind of thing they love: massive explosions, super-weapons, superhero-heroes, the hero get girl, aliens (great potential CGI), good against evil in the purest form, etc. etc. Instead (and I remember that I am a lover of Japan or of souls) we get this horrendous film for children that tears the courage of history, mixes in Star Wars (ironic as the second has torn the books from time to time) pastiche and stupid all up at the level of 'Thundercats'. To see Kimball Kinnison, the epitome of the Galactic patrol officer and the second stage Lensman portrayed as a small child is pitiful (etc.). I just can't understand why the creators did this because they obviously had the rights to the story and could have made a lot more money (FAR!) By saying clearly. It does not make sense.
