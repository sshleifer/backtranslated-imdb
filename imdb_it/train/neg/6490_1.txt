Ok ... so I've seen a lot of really weird / unusual movies in my time. Fear and disgust in Las Vegas comes to mind when I think about it. Well, not anymore ... from here on out, whenever someone asks me "hey, what's the most unusual movie you've ever seen?" Slipstream is what I will say! And I don't mean "unusual" in a positive sense. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film, it was obvious that this would be one of those "trippy camera effect" movies. By this I mean, little things like flashing images on the screen, rewinding and fast-forwarding of words and people's scenes, disorder with color on the screen, flashes ahead and flashbacks constantly ... so you have the real action. People become violent at random, they shoot things / people, they say the strangest things they don't do much, if nothing else. <br /> <br /> The film is about a writer who starts to mix real life with the book he wrote and for the lack of a better way to explain it, in practice we see this "journey" that continues throughout the film. The fact is that Johnny Depp made a similar trip to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but the only difference is that his trip was fun to watch, not painful! Honestly, I had a real bad time also ending up Slipstream. It hurts my brain a little. <br /> <br /> I can see some movie buffs claiming this film with some cinematic nuances that make it not only unique, but it increases the feeling of dementia ... blah, blah, blah. The point is that this film hurts your brain when you look at it .... it makes very little sense, it takes all your concentration to try even at a distance and understand what is happening and even at the end, the only thing you can be glad is that it's over ... and you can say you've actually gone through it! So, in closing, if you want to see a movie that will make you say "what the hell" over and over again, out loud and in your head, go ahead and waste an hour and 30 minutes and check this. <Br /> <br /> Mr. Hopkins, as I applaud you as an actor and recommend your choice to do a stab at directing ... please, never do a movie like this again. Next time, try something that relies a little more on the fantastic narrative of shooting techniques that tend to leave the viewer with a headache.
