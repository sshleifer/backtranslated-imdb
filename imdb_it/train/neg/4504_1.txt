A slow, boring and one-dimensional movie! Good casting with clich√© dialogues, boring plot and soulless direction of Mr. Marshal! The conventional and predictable history of the most famous form of prostitution on the Asian continent, lacks heart, new insights and depth. The main character seems out of place because of his tiny physisque and fake contact lens. The lexicon used by geishas seems forced and a little too sophisticated due to their limited exposure to education. The story goes on for hours and hours trying to convince you that this small, boring and bare chested Asian girl is the latest Geisha, they actually say in the movie "It's going to become a legend," I say the case hard! The film is simply boring, it's beautiful to look at, it has very few interesting moments as you can find by going out for cigarrete. Basically, if you don't believe the messenger you won't believe the message, and this girl didn't fill the shoe! Borin, boring, skip it!
