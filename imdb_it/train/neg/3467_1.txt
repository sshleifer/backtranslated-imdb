The cover of this film contains the name of Kyle Minogue, but has the same fate as Drew Barrymore in "Scream". This is the first thing that makes this movie limping; they are trying to market a movie with someone who is in it for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Of course, we must have this film with young university students who are unaware that there is a killer around. To top it all off, the fame of Molly Ringwald from the 80s is the star of this beautiful film. It's a good career move for Molly to get some money by making a lousy movie in Australia, so she won't be ridiculed in the states. <br /> <br /> However, this stupid movie is about a stupid horror movie that has never been finished because this stupid creature kills everyone in it. Throughout the film, we should guess who the murderer is. In short, our little friend Molly remembers, do you save the day ... or you? <br /> <br /> This move is simply ugly, rent it if you want to torture yourself or break it on the floor of your local video store if you see it on the shelf. Don't spread the horror.
