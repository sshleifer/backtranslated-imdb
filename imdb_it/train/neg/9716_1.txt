This is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> The plot is so full of holes, the plot is like a bad remake of a bad suspense movie and the actors seem that they were reading directly from the manuscript for the first time. Best of all is Steve Guttenberg. He plays his character as if he were in "Police Academy" - the same foolish womanizer - and is not suitable for a leading man in what should have been a thriller. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to believe that Hanson would do "LA Confidential" ten years later ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this like the plague ...
