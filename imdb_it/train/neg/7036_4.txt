I'm not ruining anything when I inform you that you can see a woman having sex with a goat in this movie. If this is your case, then your film has arrived. <br /> <br /> A woman and her husband visit their separated sister in the family villa in the woods. His sister is a creepy woman to say the least, and she seems to have interests that go beyond family love. On the side appears a group of unpleasant characters who begin to implement all kinds of pagan rituals. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather weak and the characters are rather stupid. The woman also wanders after her husband starts turning into a jerk and going out with the pagans, he also continues to have sex with him. On the side of exploiting things, there is a lot of split meat and a couple of vicious pairings, but nothing that hasn't been better somewhere else. Oh, and the above kid's sex scene. <br /> <br /> Most spectators won't make it to the end. Fans of exploitation will manage, but they will want more. <br /> <br /> 4/10
