Where to start? This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The editing is the worst ever, the sound effects were terrible and the sound editing was hit. Most of the film, all that can be seen here, is the bad effect of football, with a blurry background. I had to turn my volume on at full blast just for her what was going on ... and what was I supposed to hear exactly? Probably one of the worst scripts ever made. I can't believe people really put a bit of green into this movie. It makes me think I could take a shit in a box, send it to the producers, and then get me a movie for me. <br /> <br /> Dolph, was a customary, Dolph. Nothing else needs to be said. The villains were bad, the protagonists were bad and the film was a stinker. If you really want to know what NOT to do when you write, direct or edit a movie, watch this!
