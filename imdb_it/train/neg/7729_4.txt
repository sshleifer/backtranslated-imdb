A wonderful television miniseries completely ruined by a 45-year-old woman desperately trying to pass herself off as a naive sixteen year old! No exaggeration - this is the ACTUAL age of the character played by Ali MacGraw when the film opens just before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. This mini TV series is really the most classic example of the title of this post and one I am referring to every time the topic comes up. <br /> <br /> This only makes this elusive, despite being one of the most beautiful "global" dramatic films of the Second World War ever made. If you have a stomach - or a good fast forward skill - you could enjoy the late Robert Mitchum in a very strong performance. <br /> <br /> I am stunned by some of the comments relating to the love story (pun intended). Did they watch the movie with their eyes closed? Or are boomers who never cease to amaze me with their "selective memories" and "selective vision". I'm a Boomer so don't think for a moment that I'm a real punk bourgeois. 45 ALWAYS LOOK 45. You get used to it. Deal with it. Age with gracefully damnit. <br /> <br /> The Winds Of War could have been ... so good. How much today are we talking about this miniseries, about 25 years later, was an ACTUAL engagement launched in such an important and critical role? At this moment, with the constant and distracted distraction biddy, which by itself cancels most of the wonderful aspects of The Winds Of War.
