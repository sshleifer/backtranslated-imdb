This film has no plot or focus. Yes, it should be a stupid, stupid comedy, but the writers have no idea what the movie was. Even the title does not agree with the film. It should have been called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Win" or something like that. The characters are not developed and nobody cares what happens to them! The girl's roommate character (from That 70's Show) was the only person worth watching. He was hilarious and stole every scene he was in. The others must make sure that their university degrees are in the works as they will need a career other than acting.
