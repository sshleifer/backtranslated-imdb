I found it on the shelf while I was at home and bored. How can people give this to 10? It's not just that it should be a good redemption movie (I think), because it doesn't even work at that level. Weak story, bad dialogue, terrible acting; there's really nothing there. Harvey Keitel is decent, but he has nothing to work on, and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are simply terrible. The progression of the plot (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) makes no sense. It seems that the writers wanted the plot to go in a certain way and did it, without actually writing the bits needed to make it scroll. It's only an hour and a half, but it's 90 minutes of your life that you never come back.
