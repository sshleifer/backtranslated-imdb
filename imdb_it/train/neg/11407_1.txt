This film is a perfect example of an excellent book that is ruined by a film. Jacob Have I Loved is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. There is no plot, the graphics disappear and the editing is horrible. To top it all off, the music is straight from a synthesizer and sounds incredibly awful. Bridget Fonda's acting is decent, but the acting of all the others is totally amateur. I would suggest this film to someone who is studying to become a producer as a study of how not to produce a film as it is chock full of bad cut scenes, bad transitions and acting that should have been resumed! Read the book and don't waste your time with this movie.
