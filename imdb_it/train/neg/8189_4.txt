It is always difficult to have a brother who does better in your life than you, always a struggle to get out of that shadow and not let bitterness keep you away from your family. So imagine that your big brother is Santa Claus and then imagine how hard it must be. Here is the premise. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn plays the owner Fred, a bitter loser who spends a lot of his energy making sure that people don't go around expecting good things to happen or give his brother, Santa Claus (played by Paul Giamatti), too much praise for simply being the hight limb guy, hungry for hunger, a bit creepy that Fred would like to portray as. Then, you wouldn't know, Fred needs a financial favor and so he has to compensate by helping his brother run until Christmas. And the hilarity and life lessons come from it. <br /> <br /> Well, that's what should happen. The reality is that we receive a Christmas movie with some good moments of Vaughn's patented fast-talk, a moment of incredibly out-of-nothing music video, Kevin Spacey who plays an auditor to close the Santa operation (and he's one of the most weak the bad guys I've seen for a while), not enough of the beautiful Elizabeth Banks in a luxurious Christmas outfit, too much of John Michael Higgins in his elf outfit (to be honest, it's still a highlight) and a movie who is swimming too much in bitterness to feel like good seasonal food, but too schmaltzy in the second half to feel a bit funny in all the bad things about the advertising of the time. <br /> <br /> Rachel Weisz is also around, as is Kathy Bates, but in reality it's nothing more than a Vaughn movie and if you like her style you'll find something to enjoy here. Unfortunately, there is very little else to recommend this seasonal smell. Outside of Vaughn's speeches, the script barely creates anything decent except for a particularly interesting scene involving a hilarious support group facing a very specific problem. <br /> <br /> The direction of David Dobkin is as mediocre and serious as the 20p Christmas card that you send your aunt you haven't seen in 10 years and seems to think that simply putting together the ingredients without a good mix or decent care will guarantee a delicious Christmas pudding. No, we get a blunt burnt lump with too much sugar on top. Forget this and put the hilarious Elf back if you want a big, modern Christmas comedy. <br /> <br /> See this if you like: The Santa Clause 2, Santa Baby, The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause.
