OK, let's face it as an Orthodox woman living in Boro Park, I will be a little biased against this movie. However, it seemed that the only purpose of Boaz Yakin in making this film was orthodoxy. With our wigs, modest clothing and separate seating, we are already a fairly easy target. Yakin never crossed the surface. The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia to love him more than G-d or their parents. Then he deliberately challenges his father's order not to go swimming because of his ill health. 2. Sonia turns to her son's sister. Why does a Hasidic woman from Monsey have such a strong reaction? It is hard to believe that he has never attended one before. Let's face it, even reformed Jews hold bris milah ceremonies nowadays. 3. Did Mendel sleep during his chosson lessons? He should satisfy his wife's passions in bed and refrain from kissing her on the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park! 4. Had Sonia and Mendel been married for more than a year and now realized that they were not made for each other? A small clue: arranged marriage does not mean that the girl should take the first boy her parents created her with. Nor will it be avoided by the community if the marriage does not work. 5. If Sonia really wanted to enter the world of jewelry so badly, she didn't have to go through her lustful brother-in-law. There are doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Orthodox. Sonia has become more whining than funny. Instead of taking control of her life, she leaned back and waited for things to happen, and then complained that she didn't like the result. He is not standing for his environment; this is absurd to the stereotype. Frankly, I think he got what he deserved.
