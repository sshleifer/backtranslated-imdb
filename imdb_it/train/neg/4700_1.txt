I completely hated the movie. He was so retarded. They must have acting lessons .... no, wait, this will not help you because the Naked Brothers Band is late. Do you know why I'm here even though I'm a Naked Brothers Band hater? To warn people before they watch the stupid movie so that the NBB doesn't get any money from them, so they can't do stupid and amateur songs anymore that are so retarded that any old could go and write it in 10 seconds. Not only are the lyrics of the songs delayed, they sing badly. Ok, I'm getting out of the movie here ..... anyway, it was boring and they acted horribly. It wasn't funny at all, even though they tried so hard. I guess they deserve some credit for that ... well, the movie doesn't deserve your time. Look at his evaluation. The film (and the series) is very painful to watch for anyone who even has a half brain. Seriously, if you liked it, you have to go see the movies where the actors play, not making their lines stutter monotonously. I'm in my school's acting club and some people are actually BETTER than Nat and Alex's. Hurry up before it's too late! I seriously thought that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this poopie piece. I don't even know why I even spent half of that movie. I don't think he even deserves to be called a movie ...
