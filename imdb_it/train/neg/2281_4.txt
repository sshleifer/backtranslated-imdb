Think "theater show". It is worth seeing it once for performances by Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye. Cover the Melvyn DOuglas in "Ghost Story" with Melvyn DOuglas of this film. Are there any vampires at liberty in this "Bavarian" village, or is there a more natural explanation, albeit an equally sinister one? Dwight Frye is Herman, a red herring, who is interpreted as a particularly idiotic character. It's fun to watch his different facial expressions in what is really a serial character. Not much for a long time, but then we find out that the Atwill pipe smoke doctor is the real killer. There is too much "comic relief", but this is the reference point for this era. Fay Wray looks really good.
