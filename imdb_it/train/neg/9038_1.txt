This is a terrible production by Bartleby, even if it is not, as the other reviewer wrote because it is "impossible", but rather because this version does not keep the spirit of the book. It tells the story, almost painfully so. Looking at it, I could turn the pages of my book and follow them, which is not so funny when it comes to an adaptation. Rather, see the 2001 version of Bartleby with Crispin Glover. That version, even if funny, brings new details to the film keeping the spirit of the novel. What is important is the spirit, not the minutiae of things like setting, names of characters and customs. The difference between these versions of the film is like night and day, boring and fun. This version is a lesson on what can go wrong if an adaptation is handled with a bad, painful and thrilling schlock.
