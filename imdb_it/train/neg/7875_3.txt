Les Visiteurs, the first film about medieval travelers was actually fun. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected twists, funny situations and obviously absurdities, which remind you a little of Louis de Funes. <br /> <br /> Now this sequel has the same characters, the same actors mostly and the same time travel. The plot changes a little, since the characters should now be experienced time travelers. So they jump up and down history without paying attention to the fact that it continues to be absurd as you progress through the film. The duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep it all together with his playing, but his character has been emptied, so there's not much he can do to save the film. <br /> <br /> Now the slave of the duke / helper really has all the attention. The film simply speaks of him and his being awkward / annoying / stupid or whatever it is supposed to be. The thing is; this character tries to produce laughter from the audience, but fails. It's like someone's telling you a really bad joke, you already know, but he insists on saying that joke to the end, adding details, to make your suffering a little longer. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed Les Visiteurs, don't spoil the taste in the mouth with the sequel. If you didn't like Les Visiteurs, you would never consider seeing the sequel. If you enjoyed this sequel ... well, I suppose you still need to see a lot of movies.
