If another Hitler should ever arise, it will be partly thanks to nonsense like this film, which propagates the absurd notion of being a madman visibly unbalanced from the beginning. Far from following such a person and having elected him in the highest office on earth, healthy people would have crossed the road to avoid him, and would have died in a ditch, without a name or a stranger. <br /> <br /> Anyone who reads the stories of the close comrades of Hitler - the autobiography of his secretary Traudl Junge for example - will be struck by the fact that people found him a kind, intelligent, generous man. He was also a brilliant orator, and the fact that his speeches seemed exaggerated and railed against modern ears ignores the times when they were made, when stiff pomposity was common in political discourses. Ditto the exaggerated anti-Semitism, which was neither a central axis of the first Nazis - who were mainly anti-communist - neither unusual or unusual for the times. The film makes it appear that Hitler's only ambition from the beginning was the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> If you want to identify the next person that will cause the death of tens of millions, you can ignore the flecked-mouth ravers the life depicted here. Instead, he looks for a charming and charismatic man whose convincing speeches inspire the entire nation and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country. I fear his personality will be much more similar to that of Barack Obama than to Fred Phelps. <br /> <br /> I was hoping for a lot here and got nothing but caricatures. The fools who did this thing perpetrated a crime against reality. This is the historical equivalent of "Reefer Madness".
