Some people might consider this film a work of art - being able to express their imagination on the film to create a film full of pain and dead antagonists. I personally think that this film is a disgust, that it should never have been released. This film is repugnant, illogical and meaningless. Not only is it a complete waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come. The terrifying images shown in the film not only make you grab them in the air, but they stick in your mind and it takes days to forget them. It is a pity that people waste their imagination on such inhuman suffering. "Kill Bill" would be another example, but at least "Kill Bill" has its purpose, meaning, climax and resolution ...
