I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not a Mormon, so why did I rent this movie? Well, because I live in Utah and I thought it would be nice to see the locations I know in a movie. I really knew I wasn't going to take the inside jokes, so I wasn't surprised when I sat with the deer in the eyes of the headlights. What surprised me was the anti-Mormon actions that were included in this film. I know this is a Mormon film, aimed at members of the LDS Church, but I found it offensive because of the typical stereotype of people who are not of their faith. All non-Mormons, who were not many, drank, smoked and had an incredible selfish attitude, why? <br /> <br /> I was really impressed by this film, they made the Mormons so pure, yet the rest of the state of Utah is full of punk psychopaths just because they don't follow the LDS Church Scriptures. <br /> <br /> I can understand that the plots revolve around all the members of the Church, but you would think Salt Lake City was 100% Mormon, which is not even close to being the truth. And like I said, the non-Mormons in the movie were portrayed as drunk, please! <br /> <br /> I believe I didn't understand it because I don't belong to their faith and I believe I never have them.
