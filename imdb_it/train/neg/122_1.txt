I would put it at the top of my list of films in the unwatchable waste category! There are films that are bad, but the worst kind are those that are unwatchable but are supposed to like them because they should be good for you! The sexual sequences, so shocking in his time, could not even inspire a rabbit. The so-called controversial policy is closely linked to night-time amateur Marxism in the second year of high school. The film is self-aware in the worst sense of the word. The photograph is in a grainy black and white grainy. Some scenes are blurred or taken from the wrong corner. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art? <br /> <br />
