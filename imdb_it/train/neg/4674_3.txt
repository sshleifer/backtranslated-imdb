I don't know who the fault is, Miss Leigh or her director, but her interpretation of Catherine is almost impossible to watch. On the other hand, Ben Chaplin has a superior job, against all odds as far as I'm concerned. His character is all too charming and captivating. but he certainly wasn't shown greedy enough to endure the stupidity of Leigh's character. Chaplin seems confused by what cannot be understood as Leigh's shyness and lack of grace, but rather his orthopedic instability. There must be some element of credibility to his interest, but how played is incomprehensible. The performances don't jibe. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are, of course, wonderful despite any attempt to derail them. The supporting cast is also a pleasure to watch. Too bad, even the cables don't work together because the production is pleasant to look at.
