Best of the Best 4, it's better than 3, but barely. Basically, I say this because part 4 does not contradict parts 1/2 (like 3 ago), (that is, there is no reference to Tommy Lee who has brothers). <br /> <br /> However, I liked the Russian plot texture, and in particular the part of Sven Ole-Thorsen as Boris. Apart from that and some fighting scenes, the film is nothing special. The limited budget is also very evident (especially in the scene of air strikes). <br /> <br /> Furthermore, part 4 has no morals or says something like part 3, there are a couple of other more well-known actors (Hudson, Thorsen) in part 4, but unfortunately nothing like the beginning of the series (and even these characters have very small roles). Alas, it seems that Best of the Best is the best Rhee show, and to be honest, it can't bring a movie. <br /> <br /> Saw on tape, Evaluation: 4
