Visually interesting, but falls flat in the originality department. This tedious technique exercise fades after the opening battle. Jude Law has the charisma of burnt toast, but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogues I've ever seen on the big screen. In fact, the script is so poor that it continues to take you out of the movie, and made me think about work, invoices, my dogs, etc. There are many moments that scream in bluescreen. Paltrow is wood as they get. This could be saved by a snappy noir film or an upper field. My only complaint about the technique is that the black and white film (I'm sorry, the computer) would have been useful because it looked like Turner in black and white. Just a big boring clich√© mess. I'd rather break my femur than take this resistance test again.
