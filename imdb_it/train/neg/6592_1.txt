Short summary: this film debases anyone who touches. That means you. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me tell you I'm not a purist, and this may have been fun for a few minutes. Imitations are not bad. But overall it's just boring and excruciatingly not fun. Some simple jokes are repeated ad infinitum. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this film exists only to squeeze the last few dollars of the now well-known brand Laurel and Hardy. Producers cannot really respect their role in the history of cinema or in their talents. This is what most offended me. <br /> <br /> Of course, my daughter liked it, so I'm also a failure as a parent;)
