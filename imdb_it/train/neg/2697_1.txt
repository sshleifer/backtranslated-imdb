Based on the personal experiences of the time of director John Singleton at the University of Southern California, Higher Learning comes. A film focused on racial politics that occurs in today's universities. <br /> <br /> There are three main characters on which the film bases its foundations for its story: Malik Williams, a carefree and lowbrow athlete who is an African American male Kristin Conner, a white and soft and protected girl , and Remy, a sophisticated unrelated white male. All three are overwhelmed by the sudden reality that college life is not as good as it is advertised while all three go through the disappointment of being unprepared (Malik), being naive (Kristin) and being unwanted (Remy). <Br /> <br /> A good thing about the film is that it shows that modern American universities are just large high schools. Universities are not places to build character, develop potential or improve personal progress, but they are institutions used to bring together all types of students in a unique and suitable atmosphere. It is an experience that is usually built to fail for most students. It would have been nice if the film had built its story on this parody rather than racial politics. <br /> <br /> But it wasn't like that and that's where the films fall apart. Singleton, apparently, had a bad experience in southern California. Through this film it leaves everything out. No need to beat around the bush here. Singleton lets you easily see the heroes and villains of this piece. <br /> <br /> The black characters in the film are seen as heroes while all the whites in the film are seen as the villains, save for Kristin, who was raped by another white student. <br /> <br /> Who can understand the inconsistencies of this film? Black band members who come to the aid of a white girl after she points to those who allegedly raped her? The nonchalance that the members of the black gang have at the university while a group of heads of skin meet in a dark dormitory that plans violence? <br /> <br /> The performances of Omar Epps (Malik) and Kristy Swanson (Kristin) are disappointing. They look like the third choices for the roles they played in this film (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore should have played Malik and Kristin but were not available). O'Shea Jackson aka Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes and Regina King were all irritating in their respective roles. And Laurence Fishburne was sadly bothered here as a history professor. Only Michael Rappaport did well in this film and he did it considering that his character, of the three main characters, changed more in the film. John Singleton wanted to address the issue of race and inequality in American university life with this film. And it did quite badly. It was like killing a fly with a gun. Life is much more complex than it looks and people are the same everywhere and he should know it. Higher Learning is the proof that he did not understand it at all. Seeing the film, then and now, would do nothing but confuse, disappoint and infuriate the same audience with whom he would like to speak. Not to mention the fact that he would not entertain them in the least.
