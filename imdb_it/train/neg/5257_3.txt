For a horror movie created for TV, the film started out very interesting. I was really intrigued by the story and the mystery of the film. But the end was a total disappointment. The film was proceeding at a rapid pace and was growing, it seemed in any case, at a very climatic end. But guess what there is no end. The film is just finished and after almost an hour and a half the audience remained to wonder what happened. Because all unanswered questions in the film remained unanswered. There was no explanation on any of the key points of the plot. This film is like looking at a mystery of murder and then never finding out who did it. Very disappointed. This film looks like the producers have just run out of money and never completed the film. A real BOMB!
