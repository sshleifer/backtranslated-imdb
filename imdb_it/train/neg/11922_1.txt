Some so-called illegal asylum seekers come to Stuttgart and discover that the Germans are "racist". <br /> <br /> This is just another steaming nugget already forgotten in a long list of anti-German post-World War II propaganda films, aimed at making the Germans feel "bad" for not having accepted all the degenerate into their country so he can chase German blonds and sell drugs to German teenagers. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for good German films in general, see "Der Tunnel", "Der Untergang", "Europa Europa" and "Lola rennt." <br /> <br /> But not this one. <br /> <br /> Also, "Das Experiment", with the same male actor as "Lola rennt".
