I really wanted to, really wanted to see this movie, and I waited for months to do it through our Blockbuster full access account. When it appeared in our mailbox, I threw it straight into the DVD player. <br /> <br /> I was very sadly disappointed, which in turn drove me crazy. I will give any film a chance, even if I want to leave the theater / press "stop". I looked at it all the way, but got nothing from it, but frustration. <br /> <br /> The acting was very, very good, but it was all about it. Nothing is explained; while we understand that Mathieu gets depressed and lands in a psychiatric ward of some kind, we are never given the intuition of his "ruin". While we understand that he and Cedric melt, once again, we don't see it happen or because it happened. During an interview with Mathieu's doctor, Cedric reveals that he had betrayed him once, but it wasn't a big problem. I expected to see it in flashbacks, but no - nothing. We also have the impression that Cedric was the only one to bring Mat to the hospital - but STILL, we don't see him. <br /> <br /> I know that some movies are a "take it the way it is" base, but this movie is honestly wrong. When Pierre, Cedric's ex, shows up at the club and starts to suffer, we don't see either the skin or the hair until the end, and it took me quite some time to realize that Pierre was the former. His personality in the club and when Mat finds him are completely different. I could also be wrong to say this, it was so confusing. <br /> <br /> The film expects you to know everything and get along with its rambling, misplaced and confused rhythm. I can keep up with films like "Pi", "Citizen Kane" and other films that have flashbacks and flashes forward left and right, but CU hasn't captured and ignored the style. At the end of "Citizen Kane", you know what is happening and discover the answer to the main mysteries. CU leaves you alone hanging. He has an air of pretense in his presentation "We will not tell you anything, let alone for yourself". It's like reading a book with the chapters exchanged and the pages missing. <br /> <br /> Good acting, as I said. I liked the characters, but the whole story was too disappointing.
