I started watching this movie with low expectations, in fact I only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a S.K. novel (a novel I never read). <br /> <br /> I'm glad my expectations were low because the film was nothing good, but it manages to get you interested. What really drags this story is the work done by the director and the actors. The film is very long, does not have "nice" shots and is not scary, the dialogues are stupid and the special effects are very disgusting. <br /> <br /> The only good things are that, as I said, it keeps you interested (I think the book should be good) without using many horror clich√©s. <br /> <br /> My vote 4/10.
