This is the most ridiculous and ridiculous thriller I've ever seen. Oh .... where to start .... <br /> <br /> Plot (what little there is): Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), a young billionaire, with a bad heart desperately needs of a transplant. Clay was secretly engaged to his mother's assistant, Samantha, played by Jessica Alba. The night these two get married secretly, it happens that a heart donor is found with the same rare type of blood. Go and calculate the odds of that! Once on the operating table, Clay discovers that anesthesia does not work, and can hear everything and hear everything. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Clay seems to be able to filter the pain of a razor-sharp scalpel cut open his chest simply by concentrating on his memories of Samantha, who is told he is doing through an annoying voice out field that never seems to stop. <br /> <br /> If you haven't laughed yet, it will definitely start when you see the surgical scenes. <br /> <br /> How could a young billionaire agree to undergo a heart transplant performed by a surgeon, a nurse, a doctor and a drunken anesthesiologist? There were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was pulled. Not to mention the medical behavior, which is too absurd to be taken seriously ... the operating room is not even kept sterile ... people are practically able to enter and leave the room without even having washed. During the operation, the viewer listens to Clay's thoughts, none of which is too fascinating. Ah ... but here's what it is ... the doctors are trying to kill him to get his money. Believing that he is unconscious, the bad talk freely. Wow! What will happen? <br /> <br /> Well ... at least there is no interference from anyone else in the hospital, while an incompetent doctor who has four lawsuits for malpractice that are colliding with him is performing heart surgery. Clay's overprotective mother doesn't seem to be able to control his condition either. The only one interested in staying up to date is Samantha ... but oh no ... it could be the sweet Sam to face it ... You will quickly discover through some dialogues of Scooby Doo ... <br /> <br /> In the end, it doesn't even matter if Clay has been aware of anesthesia or not, because the end would have been the same in both cases. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the feeling that the director / writer is trying to make fun of patients who have been victims of anesthesia awareness, maybe there is some stupid fun to have. .. <br /> <br /> Enjoy ...
