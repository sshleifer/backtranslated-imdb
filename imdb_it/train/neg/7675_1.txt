Can we ever say that there are some films that have no saving features whatsoever? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After directing the horrible director of "House of the Dead", Uwe Boll launched his less talented eye towards yet another video game adaptation. Don't these guys understand? For all those who can't understand, here it is in block letters: VIDEO GAMES WE DO NOT MAKE FOR GOOD MOVIES! Acting here is, at best, below normal. The set and special effects are poor. Unlike the video game (which has had its moments of fear), the film does not have an atmosphere of imminent ruin, no sense of danger or threat. Stimulation and texture are confused and the paper on which the script is printed would have been better used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a brush. Hackney's zooms, pegs and pans overlap the whole sad affair in unpredictable moments, leaving the audience disoriented and bored. In order for this boy to have ever been approached to a film set, he must first be considered one of the greatest secrets of modern cinema. Avoid at all costs.
