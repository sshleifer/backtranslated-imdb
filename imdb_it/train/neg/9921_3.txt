Strummer's hippie past was a revelation, but overall it seemed like crashing a trail. Bonfire stories work best around the intimacy of a bonfire. There were just too many anecdotes of old semi-boring friends and too many archival footage. I love The Clash and Joe for not bringing together and selling their songs so far (FU Mick Jones), but this document left me with the desire ... to relate more. Using bonfire narrators without an adequate explanation of who is telling the story removes the viewer in some way. They should have been interviewed alone. Even the use of Strummer's "DJ radio" has done little to glue the film together. And can anyone explain all the flags that fly behind the fire scenes? After the fantastic "Filth And The Fury" I hoped that Temple could deliver. A document by Joe Strummer deserves better.
