At first I was convinced that it was a film made for TV that was not worthy of primetime. But after a few minutes of stupefied amazement, I realized that there was at least a comic value in the exaggerated acrobatics and in the recitation of the c-movie. This movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and I hadn't laughed so much that we watched with amazement that the actors could keep their faces straight. It was like a spy version less fun than The Big Hit (I laughed so much that I bought the Big Hit DVD) with even worse acting. We were disappointed that Nick chose to marry Elena, and not Jim, after embracing all five. A little bit of rum and cokie will certainly help you get off more easily.
