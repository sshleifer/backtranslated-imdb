Will Farmer (Lanter) plays a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack, and Ripley, the government super computer, designed to profile potential terrorists, tracks him down because Will has borrowed (by hacking) money from his neighbor's bank account home to pay a class trip to play chess in Philadelphia. The neighbor, whose computer Will was repairing, has relatives in the Middle East who send money to their neighbour's bank through their bank, and Ripley sees a terrorist connection. Ripley has the power to recall missile attacks. Oh, oh! <br /> <br /> This version of War Games has a much faster and more aggressive pace than the War Games movie in the early 1980s. Well, the electronics industry has a lot more work these days. Does this make sense. So the film dazzles us with a fantastic CGI on computer screens, and once Joshua, Ripley's precursor, has been found to be operating, we look at the computer against the computer and the humans are crying, hoping, praying. oh-ing, OMG-ing, and more cringing hoping things will go their way. In other words, we are living a TV movie, and it's Oh Hum Time. Back to the 80s and watch the original War Games movie. It is much better. <br /> <br /> But we must really ask ourselves: are we making computers too intelligent where one day, over time, they will dominate us? Hmmm ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.
