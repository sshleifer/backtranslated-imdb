I agree with most if not all of the previous Tom's comments (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). The Zatoichi series is a large study of character combined with great fighting and excitement of the sword. <br /> <br /> I have seen Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I believe that 14 was not released on Zone 1 (usa). Zatoichi the Outlaw was disappointing. The plot was complicated and seemed to be a jumble of many previous narrative lines of Zatoichi. At one point, I wondered if I wasn't seeing a remake of a previous Zatoichi movie. <br /> <br /> This film was disappointing because it started to depend on the effects (a rolling head, severed limbs, blood) and less on the nobility of the Zatoichi character. All previous films have succeeded based on plot and action, and have achieved a great following without having to resort to effects. <br /> <br /> I just hope that the remaining Zatoichi films will NOT follow the same trend. This is Zatoichi's first film from his studio. I highly recommend all the previous Zatoichi films and recommend them.
