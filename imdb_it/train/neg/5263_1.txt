This is without doubt the worst movie I can remember seeing. Everything was incredibly clich√© and delayed. Even the acting was horrible. Camera work was not bad but he still could not redeem it. The writer / director of this film must suffer from Down syndrome if he believes this film can help his career. I want an hour and a half of my life that I lost watching this shit. I'd rather watch a video of the grass growing than this. I can't believe that IMDb is writing me 10 lines to be able to publish this post, but I feel that this film is so bad that I have to keep warning others. The reason I learned about this film is that my girlfriend asked the local library to think that it was Kris Kristoferson's movie to be titled "Disappearances". I don't know whose fault it was for this junk that ends up in my DVD player, but I feel that someone owes me at least $ 20 for my time, pain and suffering. In conclusion, the director / screenwriter of this film hopes that I recognize him on the street.
