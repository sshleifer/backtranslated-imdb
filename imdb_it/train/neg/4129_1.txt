After seeing about half of this I was ready to give up and turn off, but I resisted until the end. This is a film that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. The acting is poor --- much worse than the acting in the 1980s T & A movies. <br /> <br /> There are several attempts at humor that fail miserably and the film is 100% predictable. Perhaps if you are a teenager this film will have a certain charm, but for those who have seen many films, you will know how the film will evolve after the first 10 minutes. The rest of your time will be spent in agony awaiting the launch of the credits. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time looking at it.
