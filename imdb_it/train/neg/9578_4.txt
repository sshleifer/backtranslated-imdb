Can A-Pix ever, never ever do something right? This film had to be seen on TV in letterbox format. Since A-Pix does not even believe in pan and scan, we see whole scenes where a shoulder on the left side of the screen speaks with a shoulder on the right side. Of course, not that you miss much. This film is incredibly bad. It is very difficult to enjoy a movie in which the characters shout loudly during 80% of the film for no reason.
