Guys, what a mess this mess. But it only lasts an hour and I paid only a penny for this, so I will live ... unlike the whole cast of this 1933 clunker which is now all dirty. <br /> <br /> However, a small village begins to have bodies that have been drained of all their blood. The kids in the neighborhood start talking about vampires, of course, and a little more loudly after every body is found. The sheriff or city police officer or whatever it is, played by the fantastic actor Melvyn Douglas, tries to tell him otherwise. When he mentions that the dead have a large hole on each side of the neck, instead of two closely spaced holes, the locals simply say it's a giant vampire bat. The policeman insists that vampires do not exist and must be a human culprit who does the murders. <br /> <br /> But Melvyn doesn't seem too worried either way. He spends most of his time trying to get into the pants of his better half, played by Faye Wray. Also in this mix is ​​the simpleton of the city, played by Dwight Frye, who seems to have played the same role in every movie he made. He further chases the inhabitants of the city by capturing bats and drinking his own blood. Lionel Atwill plays the city doctor who seems to be trying to help the agent solve the crimes. he always smells like an actor. Adventure is the closest to the cartoon in this role he could get. And Lionel Barrymore is also in this thing ... a lot of big names to be such a bunch of guano. <br /> <br /> In addition to the terrible mis-title that this film has, the alternative name, "The Blood Sucker" is much better, this film is also boring and tiring and just silly. <br /> <br /> To me the maximum point of the film is looking at Frye, he nails the strange weird city but apart from him this film didn't offer much. And then when you discover the reason for the strange deaths and see the special effect that all this blood required of you. Really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugosi made many horrible photos but at least it was fun and interesting to watch. of this film as a lugubrious, gruesome clunker WITHOUT Lugosi and you will have an idea of ​​how miserably this mess has been bad. <br /> <br /> If you can't make a good horror movie from the 1930s, at least put Lugosi in it.
