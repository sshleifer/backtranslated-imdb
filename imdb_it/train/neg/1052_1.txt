***** THIS REVIEW MAY HAVE SPOILER - but that determination would be negligible in such a classic and well known story ***** <br /> <br /> The story of CINDERELLA is my favorite fairy tale. The world will never have enough of this wonderful story. <br /> <br /> The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the story. This cannot work if the story deviates or tries to throw some interesting ideas together with some magical photography and delicious looking production projects with bad direction and modification. <br /> <br /> This story of Cinderella is more like an ugly duckling that never or better hates, never turned into a swan. <br /> <br /> All the production value that money can buy can not buy good movie timing and dramatic development - or good acting. <br /> <br /> The entrance of Cinderella to the dance, so poorly done, there was no drama of anticipation or excitement of discovery. <br /> <br /> Even writing made me very nervous. Prince Charming was the most undesirable in memory. Why would a girl want to marry a coarse and selfish prince who didn't love women? <br /> <br /> Turner's turn in the stepmother's role was an embarrassing demonstration that demonstrated the jokes once more than playing nuances. <br /> <br /> Even the part of Cinderella has aroused little interest or sympathy. <br /> <br /> Perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt: So cheap in the 90s, <br /> <br /> What MUST be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excess is the glorious photography, the work opaque and production design. It was a pleasure to examine the landscapes, sets and settings as the story unfolded. <br /> <br /> For some Cinderella storytelling, choose two gems: <br /> <br /> 1) Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella Musical with Lesley Ann Warren. Even with the obvious TV stage - the look of the 60s for the sets, this is the best version on celluloid - no bar. A cast of famous actors makes every effort to offer maximum enjoyment. Engaging, fun and memorable writing and music. This is the classic. <br /> <br /> 2) Ever After - this gem by Drew Barrymore maintains the historical perspective, alters the plot but not enough to derail the actual development of the highlights of this classic story. The main characters and all the secondary roles were written intelligently and worked well.
