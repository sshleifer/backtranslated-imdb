So this was an HBO "Made for TV Movie" eh? Is this an excuse for such a pathetic plot and terrible acting? Really a pity to see Jim Belushi reduced to such a repetitive role (shot, survived, liar, beaten, survived, shot, lies and so on ad infinitum.) Call that script? As for the British, embarrassing to see Timothy Dalton pathetic (or was he just taking p ***, depends on how much I think was paid?) Attempt by a southern sheriff). As for that other Englishman, the bleached blond one, what the fuck! There is a tendency to glorify these super-violent "English-speaking" (sic) hooligans lately, perhaps thanks to Madonna's two films, which manage to entertain and justify violence with the wise use of irony and humor , as Pulp Fiction does. However, this film discredits and devalues ​​the genre. definitely one to lose.
