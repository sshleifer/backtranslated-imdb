There is something sad about seeing someone who is so good at doing something that tries to do something very different ... and ends up being mediocre. I was thinking about Jordan playing baseball, but the same goes for Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> This film is reasonably well interpreted and directed, but the script is a stinker. Martin did a great job adapting a classic story to a play in "Roxanne", but this effort to bring a Victorian drama into the contemporary scene ends up straight in a wall of implausibility. If you want to see an old story updated with a certain style, better rent "high hopes".
