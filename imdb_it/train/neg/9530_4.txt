I imagine that this film is based on a sort of true story ... It concerns two girls who harass an adult man for 48 hours; I don't see where the terror comes into play here ... There are some "strange" and "surreal" sequences in the film And the two girls (Sandra Locke and ... ah ... oh well) they play the roll of two psychopathic haters up to after all ... they do a good job (even if some are just a little exaggerated). The film is not good, and it's not horrible, it's really really dated! I mean this thing drips with the 70s ... It's not really bad if you like that kind of thing ... you know ... thank you?
