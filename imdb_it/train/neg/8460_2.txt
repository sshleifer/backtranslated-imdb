I only rented this film because of the promises of William Dafoe and Robert Rodriguez. I thought that, seeing the name of RR on the cover (as an actor), this film would have been good. Sounds like a movie that Rodriguez would do if he intended to lend him his name, which must be good right? WRONG WRONG WRONG. By far the worst editing from "Manos Hands of fate". The way it was modified made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you wouldn't even want to try to follow it. I have no idea how Dafoe and Rodriguez were involved in this film, maybe they owed someone, but they are a way to do good at it. They were also alone in this film for a couple of minutes each and Rodriguez didn't even speak. So if you want to see a movie with Poor editing, poor acting and confusing story of being my guest, but don't say you haven't been warned.
