I don't know who to blame, the timid writers or the incapable director. It seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon) that there wasn't enough left to make a movie. This could have been a lot of fun, but there was a veil of shyness, even cowardice, hanging from every scene. Since he got an R rating anyway, why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year-old woman and not with Angie Harmon? Why does Sheen sleepwalking through potentially hot relationships WITH TWO OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY ATTRESSIONS in the world? If they were just looking for laughter why not choose Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead? This was so predictable that I was surprised to find that the director was not five. What a waste, not only for the spectators but also for the actors.
