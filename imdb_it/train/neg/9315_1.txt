This movie was so bad! It was terrible! It was terrible! I can't stress enough! The acting, the direction, the story, the characters and all that concerned him was bad! It was so trivial and clich√©. Don't be fooled by the cover, or the tag "The Texas massacre" is nothing to laugh about. "Are you kidding me? It was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The first 2 minutes of the movie are good until it comes to the main character Brendan, OK now turn it off. What I got from the movie was, A group of ugly, annoying and immature people go to a cabin in the woods and a clown who sings nursery rhymes kills them in non-original and false ways. <br /> <br /> This film was a waste of time and money , and it would also be a waste of money and time! I took a step forward in most of the film because it was so terrible, I just wanted to see how every bad actor died, and STILL wasn't worth it! Just looking at the cover is a waste of time. This is seriously the worst movie ever! Rating: does not deserve it.
