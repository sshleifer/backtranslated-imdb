I registered only to make this comment (which practically echoes some of those already here) Acting is worse than subpar, it is expressed on commonly held stereotypes, it has some of the worst manifestations of insignificant female objectification (all brainless), and has some of the sweeter lines known to man. <br /> <br /> included but not limited to "all is well let's see what these guys can do" I should also mention that when they show incidents involving innocent civilians, you end up feeling bad for innocent people and start hating characters themselves. Eddie Griffin's character is also one of the most stereotypical characters of the black genre that simply rubs people the wrong way. He may or may not be a good actor, but this movie doesn't allow that kind of character exploration. Do you want a film that leaves the audience on the bad side? Oceans 11. This movie only makes you hate the bad guys instead of catching the public. <br /> <br /> Even the machines cannot make up for this successful film. What Enzo Griffin destroyed sums up this movie perfectly. It sucks.
