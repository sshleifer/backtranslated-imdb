I haven't seen many low-budget movies that I have to admit, but this is the worst movie ever, the main character the old man talked to, had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, a 5 year old could do better. The plot had the most horrible plot, and the army guy had put what he thought was an army and then moved to the top, I just saw him laugh at how bad it was, and I hoped it could lead to the real movie. I can't believe it was under the 2-night blockbuster thing, instead of taking this for free and pulling it out of our sight. I think there was a semi-decent actor different from the woman, I think the only thing OK with the budget was the trick, but they show all the important scenes of the film in the initial part of the music. Terrible just awful.
