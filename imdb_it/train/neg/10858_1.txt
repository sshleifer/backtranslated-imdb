I didn't know if I would have laughed or cried seeing this. Only fans addicted to dirty damage may have a taste for this. This should be a horror movie, but there's just dirt in it. The most beautiful scene is the car accident, with real special effects of the best of Hollywood. Avoid this movie at all costs. See this only for studies of how bad a movie can be ................
