I went to see this with many expectations. Quite unfortunately the dialogue is absolutely stupid and overall the film is far from inspiring admiration or interest. Even a child can see the missing logic in the behavior of the character. Today's children need creative stories to inspire them, which would make them daydream about events. This is exactly what happened with films like E.T. and Star Wars a decade ago. (How many children imagined themselves becoming Jedi Knights and turning on their lightsabers?) Seriously, don't waste your time and money on it.
