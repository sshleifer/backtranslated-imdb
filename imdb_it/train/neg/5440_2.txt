I've been a big fan of Lynn Peterson since she starred in the 1988 hit movie "Far North", and although I loved her in her other movie "Slow" (2004) in which she plays "Francis", this it is by far its strongest role. <br /> <br /> Lynn, as I'm sure you all know (or should) play the critical role of "Driver". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, others of Lynn's amazing performance, I'm afraid this movie doesn't really have much to spend. <br /> <br /> Oh wait - there was another thing - the extraordinary creativity of the assembly to remove the bad words for the viewers. Memorable lines like: "You son of a gun!", "You son of a witch!", "Shoot!" And "Well, forget yourself!" <br /> <br /> O.K. Hello. <br /> <br /> P.S.: Does anyone know where I can find another Lynn Peterson poster?
