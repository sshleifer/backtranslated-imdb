This film has been a yawn from the headlines to the credits, it's boring to boredom and the acting is of wood and stilts! To tell the truth, this was the director Richard Jobson who made his directorial debut, but who on earth lit up a screen so little developed like this? It seems another government project on the run (Scottish Screen is an accredited surprise surprise). I almost fell asleep three times and unfortunately my review will have to be more contained than this one. Please, please Mr. Jobson, what were you doing before you directed this movie sedative, come back!
