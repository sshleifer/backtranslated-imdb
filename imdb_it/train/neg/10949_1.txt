I go to the cinema to have fun. There is absolutely nothing funny about this movie. From beginning to end, there is no respite from the gray and macabre reality of this woman's life. It has a fast pace, with no mood changes. I stayed until the end only because I was convinced that things had to improve. They don't do it, and I don't think I was the only one, as shown by the numerous complaints surrounding the cinema while the film was willingly approaching the conclusion. To honestly describe social depravity is not a crime, but boring the public to moan is not the way to win public sympathy. A terrible film.
