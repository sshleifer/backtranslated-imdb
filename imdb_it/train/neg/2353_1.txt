Madhur gave us a powerful Chandni Bar movie in the past. His next film was one of the worst movies of all time. Apparently it tells the story of some high-class people in India. After seeing a scene in which the man forces another man for sexual reasons to act in a movie. I felt like spitting and breaking the DVD. Coincidently I did. The reason why the film contains scenes of child pornography and harassment. I literally threw up and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children. Very disturbing things, there was no need to show the children completely naked. One of the rich boys loves to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreigners, British men in this film. I am shocked to know that this film was a success in parts of India, otherwise Super Flop in the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia. I'm from the UK, and this kind of thing makes me sick, it shouldn't be published in the UK.
