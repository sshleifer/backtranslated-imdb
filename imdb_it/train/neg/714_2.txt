This is a film of tired but strangely childish clich√©s. Is there a Nazi witch teacher performing experiments related to the sf inside the basement? Oh please! <br /> <br /> Aiming at a creeping sense of horror and fear, the overall impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fear. Having no expectations in advance, I stayed with: an old Xander of Buffy and a heroine with a face like a monkey who seems not to know how to act. I said that I only met Adrienne Barbeau earlier in the much more fun "Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death". <br /> <br /> Camera and editing add a general impression of lame.
