As a Turkish man who now lives in Sweden, I must confess that I often watch Scandinavian films. Most if I never understand them. I think Scandinavian actors work better in Hollywood. Last week I saw a movie called "The Polish Wedding" with a Polish friend of mine and we both said it was the worst movie we had ever seen. Unfortunately I was wrong that this "House of Angels" movie is even worse. None of the actors can act, absolutely not the so-called star Helen Bergstrom. The plot is so stupid that nobody can believe it. I think everything is a mess from the start. a lot of bad acting, except from Selldal and Wollter. Ahmed Sellam
