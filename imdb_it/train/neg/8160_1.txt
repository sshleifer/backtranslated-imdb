and not in a fun way to look. it's just bad. It's shocking that people have posted positive things about this here. the story sucks, the acting is bad, it's not scary, the special effects are not special - oh no! the blackboard has hands coming out of it! oh gee: the mirror turns into water! the hair, clothes and makeup in the 1950s scenes are not accurate, and they have a middle-aged man with a receding hairline to play the high school version of himself. this is like a nightmare on elm street stuff. I like to sit and watch a cheese horror movie like anyone else, but there are better bad guys out there to choose from.
