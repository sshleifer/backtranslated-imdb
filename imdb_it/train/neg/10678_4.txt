This film looked good: good cast, evergreen argument and explosive opening. He went downhill from there. Why was it filmed by a freehand camera? Shakes, judges, partly captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer. A really poor choice. As if that were not enough, the worst modification in memory presupposes a doped display - mandatory if you want to get any pleasure from it. And then he commits the worst sin of all. After having led the viewer on all kinds of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion, they get credits without revealing the epilogue - the end - the reward - how the hell was the motive? How can you expect to succeed by creating thrillers without an ending? Doh! This film had great promise and ended up making a facial in the mud. What a waste of effort. Poor effort as a writer and director.
