Harsh, yes, but I call them as I see them. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the late 80s, and it was really one of the most terrible and boring movies I've ever had to look at. <br /> <br /> Yes, cinematography is adorable. The Czech settings are really sensational. The political context is tempting, but unlike similar "historically set" stories (eg Mr. Zhivago_ (qv)), this failed to make the policy relevant to the story, or even interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this film manages to render even "erotic" scenes tiring and slow. I'm all for romance, but this film was so boring, I started to hope that the Russians would shoot everyone and put an end to my misery. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I would have read the book, the story would have made a little more sense. However, life is too short to spend more time on this.
