This movie is really boring. He was banned in Chinese cinema and I can understand why. It is not because he is critical of the communist regime, but simply because the film is of such low quality. I would never pay to see this. I love the films of Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou and I am disappointed that such a poor film can come out of China. He seems to totally ignore the public and the director seems to have made the film for himself. The shots of a person standing there doing nothing until a minute are hilarious and there are many. Cinematography and video quality are incredibly bad. I watched this movie online and people seem to like this movie. The only explanation I have for this is that some movie buffs think that if a movie is not in English it is automatically good. I see no reason why people would like this. this is not an art film, it is a waste of celluloid. (That's how they turned it on the film, which they didn't)
