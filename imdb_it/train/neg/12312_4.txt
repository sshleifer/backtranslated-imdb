For 50 years after the Second World War the United States was in a state where key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests. At the same time, due to the draft and wars, everyone in society had served, or was connected to, someone he had. <br /> <br /> This allowed a minimum based on the notion of American intelligence in the midst of an inflexible military machine. Sometimes that car was a non-US military, for example in prisoner-of-war situations. Once removed are stories in other machines: science fiction and corporate, but they always refer to this military genre, and in fact the testosterone shots of action even refer to their comic brother. <br /> <br /> You can trace it, I think, perhaps starting with the comic, which means Amrican, sections of "The Great Escape", which immediately generated TeeVee's progeny in "Gomer Pyle" and "Hogan's Heros". Then a second wave unleashed by "Catch 22" and "MASH", both of which had been real life, then books, then films, and in the MASH case, then TeeVee. <br /> <br /> But first of all, there was the "Phil Silvers Show" on a sergeant Bilko and this followed by "Mister Roberts". A happy scammer, who committed only harmless crimes, and then only as a response to a too crude system that attempted to limit his life. This was the day TeeVee shows were important. You absorbed them instead of just bringing them to work to chat. He was not particularly clever in any way, except in finding that crack between what we wanted in control and freedom. <br /> <br /> His only major area in which Americans developed their way of thinking about forgivable lies, even captivating in a military context, an area that was appropriated by one of our political parties here . <br /> <br /> Because it is big, sometimes it pays off for laughter. "Stripes" was damn funny I thought. He had the coup de theater of the misfits who actually defeated the serious enemies, a little folded in some "Dirty Dozen". And the sexual adventure. <br /> <br /> Now, well before the cultural wars intensified. Try to touch that weak spot, like other remakes that have handled Steve Martin. It's so unpleasant, it's actually rooted for the army to be the strongest player. Another way to monitor how companies solve military power handles. <br /> <br /> Evaluation of Ted - 1 in 3: you can find something better to do with this part of your life.
