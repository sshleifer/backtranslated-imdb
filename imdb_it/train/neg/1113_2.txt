Hopalong Cassidy with a horse that is not white and does not have the name of Topper? Go figure it out! <br /> <br /> This parody does a gross injustice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes, Hopalong Cassidy. The actor who plays him is young against old, with blond hair against white hair and kills people rather than shooting the gun from their hands. The real Hopalong will stand up please! <br /> <br /> One of the worst films ever made and, believe it or not, from the person who brought us the grandfather's saga!
