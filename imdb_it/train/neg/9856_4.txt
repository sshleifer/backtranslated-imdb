In the autobiographical training story "Romulus, My Father", Eric Bana, from "Monaco", plays an impoverished German emigrant who fights to raise his son, Raymond (Kodi Smit-McPhee), in rural Australia in the 1960s. The main obstacle to the stability and happiness of the family is his wife, Christina (Franka Potente), who flagrantly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly curling with other men. Despite his highly unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to grant her divorce, masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that one day she will return to him. It is, unfortunately, the good-natured and good-natured Raimond who must bear witness to all this marital tumult - and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the film (Raimond Gaita would later become an author). <br /> <br /> Although I admire "Romulus, My Father" for what it is trying to do, I cannot honestly say that I liked it, because while the film has good performances and serious intentions, these are simply not enough to counteract the dark plot and the funereal rhythm, which leaves the audience dispersed and depressed like the people on the screen. A serious drama of the slice of life is one thing, but this incessant swing of adultery, madness and multiple suicides (not to mention the attempted suicides) is something else.
