When I saw the previews for this film, I didn't expect much to begin with - about a second-rate teen horror movie. But wow, this movie was absolutely horrible. And this is generous. <br /> <br /> First of all, the casting for the film was terrible. You don't feel any sympathy (or, for that, any morbid feeling) for the characters. The acting was so terrible that I was simply waiting and hoping that the terrible thing would end. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there are points in the film that had absolutely no relation to the plot. Can anyone explain to me why the girl-like guy starts screaming "PANCAKES !!!" at the top of his lungs as you enter Jackie Chan's moves that I've never seen before, and even more to bite the guy who has the virus? Why does the child's father continue to get angry with the virus-infected boy, and go for a deer hunt to find him? I was left with a feeling of so much confusion and total disbelief that I literally said out loud, "Where the hell did he come from?" <br /> <br /> I simply could not believe what I had seen. I really thought I saw some bad movies, but I have to say that Cabin Fever surpasses them all. This film made me want to vomit and then vomit again. So blow my brains out. <br /> <br /> Please save an hour and a half and do something more productive. Watching the grass grow, perhaps, is a suitable alternative.
