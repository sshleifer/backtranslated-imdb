This movie is bad news and I'm really surprised by the level of talent of the big names that would have ever agreed to appear in a piece of junk like this. I imagine there were some strangled agents scattered on Hollywood Boulevard. as a result of this fiasco. What really gives you is that it could have been good. The directors claim the charm and the topic was enough to feed interest and ticket sales, but this is a flop. The lines of multiple stories all pass from ugly to foolish from the end of the images, and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten. What Spike is able to achieve is revenge against all Italians who may have beaten him as a child or insulted, since the film does a number of perpetuating obsolete and probably offensive Italian stereotypes. As in every Spike Lee movie, there are some really provocative and magical shots. He has the gift of grabbing your psyche and carrying you in his vision if only for some memorable scenes. But the question remains ... you can endure the other 2 hours of scratching your head and looking at your watch while you ask yourself and waiting for the ending to be there somewhere.
