A brief review but ... <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs, a complete waste of 90 minutes. At the end of the film I was no wiser than what really happened. It's full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3 minutes), Jack Dee (30 seconds), the "Philadelphia" girls) and some vaguely recognizable people, but it doesn't make any sense. If the story just got lost in the edit, not now but jeez ... <br /> <br /> Put a DVD or go to bed and rest !!! <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for cameos and a Morris Minor car chase) <br /> <br />
