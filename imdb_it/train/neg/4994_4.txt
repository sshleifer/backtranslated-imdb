Good movies are original, some leave a message or touch you in a certain way, but sometimes you don't feel like it. <br /> <br /> I wanted something simple, without thinking of simple action when I saw this. It started well and was quite fun, so why a bad review. Well, in the end the film lost its credibility. The script was not at all trivial, the action was not too special but overall good, acting was OK, so more than enough to satisfy my needs. But everything was ruined because things that were exaggerated happened and left me with a bad feeling. They should have made a little more effort to make everything credible and they would have gotten a 7 in the "don't just think simple actions" category. So in conclusion, if you know you will get angry because things that seem completely illogical are happening: don't look! otherwise I'd say go ahead ...
