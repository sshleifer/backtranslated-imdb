This film is really one of the worst pieces of trash ever. It's really surprising that something so terrible can be done. But if you can handle the plot, character development and direction, you could get a kick from the soundtrack that is so terrifying that it's fun. The film starts terribly and quickly becomes unwatchable. Someone should give someone involved in this film some kind of consolation because his career was probably ruined due to involvement in this film. If you end up watching this movie or you've already seen it (I feel your pain), then these words came too late. For others, stay away at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that you waste 2 hours of your life. So at least you can clean or something while viewing.
