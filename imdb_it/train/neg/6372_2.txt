Don't worry A small ham can do a lot, but all we get is pure ham, especially from Dunaway. The plot is one of those bumper car episodes ... the vehicle bounces off another and everything changes direction again, until we just scratch our heads wondering if there's ever been a plot. Gina Phillips is really good, but it's difficult to play a mysterious Dunaway who plays Lady Macbeth lost in Marx's brother's duck soup. Ah, the crow ... now there's an actor. And there is the relative who lies and lies and looks ghostly. Or Dr. Dread who is full of darkness and no working remedies. I'm one of those windy guys who just have to watch a movie until the end. Quoth the Raven, "Never Again".
