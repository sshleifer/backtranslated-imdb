Only recently have I managed to reach Marilyn Miller's films since they are not shown on TCM in the UK. I was very intrigued over the years because this was one of the superstars of the 1920s. Some stars of this era like Jolson, part of the magic still shines, but unfortunately not for Miller. Her dance seems embarrassing and badly choreographed, her singing a little limited and as an actress that makes Ruby Keeler look like Hepburn. Even worse in this film as the audience got tired of the musicals pretty much all the musical numbers were deleted . We are left with a comedy of that period with little real appeal. $ 500,000 had been paid for this! So I have only two conclusions. Either he was badly served by the cinema or he had no talent at all. I think the truth is closer to the next than the first.
