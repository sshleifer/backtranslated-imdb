A girl called is witness to a murder and becomes the next target of the killer. The director Brian De Palma is really on a pretentious roll here: his camera swoops around the corners of a museum (after lingering for a long time on a painting of a monkey), splitting up a screen divided for artistic purposes, practically giving his plot with a sequence (always on a split screen) in which two characters are both watching a television program on transsexuals and staging his (first) final during a violent downpour. "Dressed To Kill" is exhausting, above all because it asks us to swallow so much and does not return anything substantial. Much of the acting (with the exception of the young Keith Gordon) is mediocre and the (second) ending is a rip off of De Palma's "Carrie" - not to mention "Psycho". The explanation of the dirty actions plays like a parody of Hitchcock, not a tribute. Elegant in a cold way, the final results are clearly baked. ** from ****
