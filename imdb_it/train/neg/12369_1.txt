There will be a time when children will grow up without ever seeing the one and only Bugs Bunny (technically) kissing another man on the lips. There will be a time when it will not be a Duck or Rabbit season. There will be a time when the devil of Tazmanian will be called politically incorrect. <br /> <br /> But then help me now is not that time. <br /> <br /> Nobody really wants an "EXTREME" version of our beloved Loony characters. Whoever is in marketing to those who think "Corn Nuts: Corn gone wrong" and "Extreme Doritos" and evidently this jolly asshole should know this only because they have a degree in business or advertising or anything that does not mean they know about Jack children. <br /> <br /> I think they are doing a poor service to children, depriving them of one of the greatest and most iconic shows of all time. This show disgusts me, and it's not just the dated artwork or the terrible dialogue. They use the talents of the good voice badly, such as Phil Lamarr, Michael Clarke Duncan, Candi Milo and many others. Lack of style, humor, character development and, above all, the heart. <br /> <br /> The show, like the redesigned characters (Slam Tasmanian, Rev Runner, Ace Bunny) is nothing but a shadow of its past, timeless and beautiful self.
