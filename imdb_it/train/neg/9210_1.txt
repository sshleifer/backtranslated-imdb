I had completely forgotten about this film so far. This was the most glaring and worst attempt to demonize a hobby I've ever seen. The message seemed to be: "Teenagers don't use their imagination, they could take games seriously, go crazy and hurt people". I can only assume that the non-imaginative writers of this piece thought that D & D style games are a form of evil ritual or arcane cult.
