I saw it for free, thankfully, and I wish it were better than it was, but it's really the same old stuff that film studios seem to take over us in the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston interpret a couple that is opposite, yet they are attracted to each other. <br /> <br /> If that plot doesn't surprise you and turns you on, the movie won't do it either. <Br /> <br /> Lots of sight gags and fart jokes. In the middle of the film I started to understand that Ben Stiller is not so funny, but he tries VERY. And Jennifer Anniston is not very pretty, but her hair looks great. And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymore Hoffman must have paid a great deal of money to be in this kind of average humor film, I expected more from them. <br /> <br /> What was interesting was that I saw him after seeing American Splendor, which is a really funny and original film - and I compared the two in my head, and I found myself wishing that the film executives would have been forced to sit through those two back-to-back films - perhaps this would put some sense into them and <br /> <br /> would start making better films with unknowns rather than this terrific stuff that sounds better on airplanes.
