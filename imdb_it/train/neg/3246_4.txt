The plot of 'House of Games' is the strongest thing about it: a successful author and psychologist is connived by a band of beggars, but discovering the evil part of herself that enjoys the thrill of what they do, finally gets his revenge. This is the point: but someone has to take responsibility for seeing him interpreted as a puppet. It must be director Mamet: Lindsay Crouse has had a varied and fairly constant career in television and film, so she can't perform it badly all the time. He should switch from a quick, cool and controlled lady to a bad and calculating lady who enjoys herself, as shown by the transition from a beige trouser suit (which she seems to be wearing for three days in a row, including underwear) to a soft floral sundress. But everyone seems to say their lines in the same way, precise and precise; I guess Mamet wants to make sure a syllable of his glittering script hasn't been lost. The effect is disturbing and ruins the atmosphere of mystery and suspense that it is supposedly trying to create. Sometimes "House of Games" loses all connection with the way humans behave or talk, and becomes just a mechanism to make the plot run. The sensational faux-jazz vibes'n'oboe soundtrack doesn't even help. The end result is that the only fun to do is guess the result, and the sooner you do it the sooner you get bored with robotic and two-dimensional performances. And they smoke too much !!!
