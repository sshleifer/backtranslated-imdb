This is the best movie the Derek couple ever made and if you think this is a recommendation, then you haven't seen any of the others. There are the usual ingredients: it is misinterpreted as their other efforts, we can see Bo undressing or auditioning for wet shirt contests very often, the story is simply ridiculously idiotic, and the film takes itself too seriously. And then: Orang Utans in Africa? <br /> <br /> But it has some things to do. Bo looks good, production values ​​(sets, costumes, etc.) are quite good, and this greatly increases the value of the field. In a strange way it is actually quite funny, simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly.
