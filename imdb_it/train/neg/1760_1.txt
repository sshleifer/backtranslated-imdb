This film makes several mistakes. some American actors in Spain and Spanish actors who speak English. the English of the "Spaniards" is OK, but the way in which the acting is performed makes everything quite annoying. the dialogue through the entire script is very weak; it may have been a Spanish script but incorrectly translated, who knows and who cares. I can only assume that these are famous Spanish actors forced into the English language, they can be good, but not on this flop. you will understand the film within the first 5 minutes, it is so pathetic that it is. then the rest is just bad. much waste of time, many UN plots needed. Oh, I already said that one of the Baldwins is in this.
