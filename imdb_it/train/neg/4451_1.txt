This film was probably as stupid as The Naked Gun (which it had to be). Case in point: <br /> <br /> 1. To pretend to drown Roberts is secretly taking swimming lessons at the YWCA. After her "death", the YWCA calls her husband to work for their condolences. HI how did they get his job number? <br /> <br /> 2. Before leaving the city, drop the wedding ring on the toilet. Days or even weeks later her husband finds him in the John. Does this mean that the bathroom has never been washed? <br /> <br /> 3. No explanation is given about how he is paying for his mother's care in the nursing home (since he did it behind his husbands RICCARDI). <br /> <br /> 4. Towards the end of this boring film, Roberts suspects her husband is at home. Instead of running for his life, he runs to the kitchen to see if the cans are neatly stacked.
