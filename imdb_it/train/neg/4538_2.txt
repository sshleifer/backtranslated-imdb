Actually I went to see this movie in a theater, but what a waste of time and money! Bad acting, I'm sorry to say, didn't help me enjoy this rather sticky script. <br /> <br /> Some friends told me to go see this movie, since James Redfield, the author of the book, was very involved in the script. They really enjoyed the book, so the film had to be perfect. Well maybe I got my hopes up a little too high, but I absolutely hated this movie! It was predictable, too sweet to a point that I actually left that I had to throw up and, worst of all, there will be a sequel! Do the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade.
