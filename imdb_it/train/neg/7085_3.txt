I really tried to appreciate this movie. Face a major problem in every society: sex addiction. <br /> <br /> In this story we learn that you can lose everything when you are addicted to sex. In this case, our protagonist and hero, to have non-stop relationships with all types of women (crazy, perverse, neurotic) endangers his marriage, work and even his life. <br /> <br /> production values ​​are terrible; mainly acting. Oh, you won't have ANY of the sex scenes, most of them are done in bad taste and you might think about watching a home-made movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the plot is just nonsense. How could a wife so intelligent and beautiful bear all the bad things of her husband? How could he believe him? The three-priced situation is priceless and will make you laugh for a while. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the scene with the black overseer is simply useless and will leave you thinking "wtf?". <br /> <br /> Scenes like those you will find in abundance. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please avoid it; it's not a soft core, it's not a documentary, it's not a dramatic feature. It is a pretentious effort by a so-called documentarian or other. <br /> <br /> Only Ms. Kinski's legs on display deserve the watch. I got it on HBO and I'm glad I didn't spend my money on it. But those 90 minutes of my life won't come back.
