I could never bear to look at Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this film contained Scott Baio (a skateboard chase scene!). Jodie Foster in her first "adult" role turns into her usual professional performance but it's not an excuse for this boring mess. Two hours of my life that I will never return! No character worthy of note, incredible plot, questionable editing and horrendous cinematography, but worst of all is that I couldn't care less. The history of Californian teenagers in the 1970s, where children live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Don't waste time watching this bad excuse for a movie.
