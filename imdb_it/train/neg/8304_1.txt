"A Christmas Story" is one of the most beloved movies of all time. ACS was able to bring the viewer in a moment and a place in such a way that very few films ever had. He had a sweetness and a good will that is rare. <br /> <br /> So I waited (and waited) for his sequel, "It Runs In The Family". The film was almost released a couple of times, only to be pulled at the last minute. When it finally came out, the IRITF was (and is, I imagine) a total failure. <br /> <br /> The sets and the cinematography went well, but the director totally, the brand was completely missing. The film was nothing more than a formula for lazy casting, lazy writing and disconnected acting. <br /> <br /> The narrator, Jean Shepard, who was one of the great American humorists and storytellers, forced us into a false revival of the intense spirit he used in ACS. He exaggerated, and because he did it I'll never know. Somehow he managed to become a boring and boring parody. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting in IRITF are inauthentic and forced. Actors may have seen ACS, but any spirit and nuance that was in ACS should not be recorded on any of them. The acting was grossly disgusting and devoid of any dry Shepard humor. <br /> <br /> ACS will always be a real treasure, but to call an IRITF sequel is to insult all Jean Shepard and ACS fans.
