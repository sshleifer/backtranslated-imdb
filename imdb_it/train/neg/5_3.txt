Basically I looked through the film, but enough to see the plot. To tell you the truth it was a bit boring for me and in some places it didn't make sense. The only reason I saw this film in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD !!! It's so hot, but in this movie his hair was a bit weird. But still hot. <br /> <br /> However, despite the heat of CHACE, in reality it did not compensate for the film. I guess the plot isn't all that bad, but what really upset me was that they cursed like every sentence. Is it so difficult to express your anger without saying the word F every time? The curse was annoying and the whole showy and terrible thing gave me a headache. <br /> <br /> All in all, even if the plot was OK, I found the film a bit boring and dramatic. That's why I only cut scenes with CHACE in it. LOL In any case, it is not worth renting it unless you are a diehard fan of a specific cast member like me. Oh yes, the cast was Hot. The girls were HOT !!! But CHACE IS THE BEST !!
