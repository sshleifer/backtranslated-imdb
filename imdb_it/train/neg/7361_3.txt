Mr. Perlman does an extraordinary performance (as usual). Unfortunately, he has to struggle with a written script and some senseless tastings. <br /> <br /> Larsen is in "Die Hard" mode complete with singleton and bumpy muscles, I'm sure he could do better but he seems satisfied to make a face and growl through his part. <br /> <br /> The adorable Erika is very decorative (even if completely dressed!) and shows some signs of "acting" at the end. <br /> <br /> SFXs are mostly poor CGIs and steal from other movies. <br /> <br /> Shootouts are pitiful - worthy of the A-Team <br /> <br /> It's not even worth seeing for Perlman - EVITA
