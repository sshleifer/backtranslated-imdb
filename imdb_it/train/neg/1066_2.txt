I saw "Paris Je T'Aime" because a friend really wanted to see him, so I went with him. Upon entering, I was indifferent about the film, but on leaving the theater I really regretted having wasted 2 hours of my life in this lukewarm production. The "stories" are almost completely forgettable, except that most of them were horrible. What does Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara have to do with Paris? The endless parade of American actors has definitely given this French film an extraordinarily non-French touch. The clichés about Paris were endless. Yes, most of them played with clichés about Paris, but spending so much time making fun of the French clichés, they promoted them directly and unfortunately once again. Yes, Paris is the city of love. We understood. <br /> <br /> The worst segments were: the one directed by Wes Craven (Oscar Wilde); the one with Nick Nolte; the mime (the worst?); one of the hair products; the one with Juliette Binoche (Willem Dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of Paris?); that of vampires (When I think of Paris, I think of Elijah Wood). The one with Natalie Portman, who really looked like a Mentos commercial and was stupid (the blind young man should know that Portman was playing a part only when she called him). He continued for a long time. It seemed endless. <br /> <br /> I didn't even like Coen Bros. I really play with those clichés parisien, but I didn't find it funny. Simply annoying. The version of Gus Van Sant was interesting but it was so light (and the joke was obvious) that it barely registered. <br /> <br /> There were only two "successful" segments and they were those of the immigrant nanny who leaves her child in a nursery just to babysit a child for a rich woman. Nice irony there. And the segment on the African being stabbed. It's the best segment of the whole film, but this segment has nothing to do with Paris. History could have taken place in any city in the world. <br /> <br /> The last segment, the one with the chubby middle-aged woman, was a bit interesting, but the underlying tone was bad. They wanted to celebrate his limited understanding of French, but the segment proved to be condescending. <br /> <br /> The whole project felt forced and uninspired. Almost like the French government sponsored this film to promote tourism. All in all, with only 10-15 minutes of interesting content, "Paris Je T'Aime" was a terrible cinematic experience.
