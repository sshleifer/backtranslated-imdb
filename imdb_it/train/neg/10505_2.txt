If you liked "Blair with" you will like this. It has the same bad photographic work and the soundtrack, and has the same non-existent plot and moments of suspense. <br /> <br /> He also has Tom Savini, so if you like Romero "Dawn of the dead" or Tarantino and Rodriguez "From Dusk Till Dawn" await you. He is an icon and also an excellent actor. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. This film is definitely the most loved movie I've seen in a long time, and I've seen a lot of movies, even bad ones. I can tell you that I find most horror movies funny, but this was just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie 2 instead of 1, were the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharp-looking plastic teeth ... No, I'm just kidding. I must have been lost before pressing "send" on the voting form. <br /> <br /> Stay away, even if you have sexy girls with teeth on the cover!
