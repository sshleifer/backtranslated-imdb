I started to melt, so I'll make this review as short and sweet as possible. <br /> <br /> There's this astronaut, and he gets on a spaceship with two other guys, you know? Except that something happens that exposes him to radiation, and then when they come back ... well, it doesn't matter what happened to the other guys, but our astronaut started to melt! No, not just burn, but MELT! Like an ice cream cone in July! Well OK maybe not so fast, but you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it gets all red and sticky, and the fact that it's melting makes it really crazy. I imagine he also checked the "melting man" manual because he suddenly knows that to avoid melting completely, he has to eat human flesh, so he starts to divide people. <br /> <br /> There are other characters, but in a movie where a man melts and melts and melts (and melts), do you really need others? What is important is that WHO will chew the next one, and what will be left of it? How long will it take for it to melt into nothing? WHY is this film made in the first place? WHERE did they get the money? WHEN will you fall asleep while watching it? <br /> <br /> I almost melted, but I still have enough time to tell you that this film is terribly boring, even if the idea is really beautiful and kind of gross. The trick is clean but everything else is ... SPLAT
