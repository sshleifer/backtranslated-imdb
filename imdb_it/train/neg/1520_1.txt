Why did I waste time with this movie? There was not a single joke or a funny joke everywhere. The slapstick wasn't even slightly fun. Do I really mean an empty suction tube out of control? Why was the name of the national Lampoon attached to this film? Even the Christmas holidays were better than this (actually I thought the movie was very funny). <br /> <br /> AVOID HOW THE PESTA!
