Except for the Brady Variety Hour, this was one of the hottest televisions I've seen in a while. The qualities of video production were not so bad, but the general appearance was unmistakably in the early 1980s. And Marie Osmond seems to have fought with the Avon Lady ... and lost a lot of time. Too much eyeliner. <br /> <br /> It was a little awkward to see veterans Danny Kaye and Eric Severeid take part in this. It was even more interesting to see Alex Haley talking about the African pavilion in World Showcase which will open "in about a year". <br /> <br /> At the time of writing this article, 17 years later, it has not yet been opened (unless it contains the animal kingdom of Disney). All in all though, despite all the shortcomings, this is still an interesting visual fragment of the history of Disney.
