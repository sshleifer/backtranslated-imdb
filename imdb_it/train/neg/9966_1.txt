Although I never like being the kind of person who denies the personal taste of another; if you like something, that's fine. But this film was horrible and there is no way around it. I don't like Ani Difranco too much, but he is a great guitarist and composer, which I can admit. But I can't admit that there are any redeeming qualities in this film. Many people think that it is an accurate portrait of the problems faced by high school students. Perhaps, but everything is described too far-fetched. There seems to be an attempt at a "Naked Gun" type comedy, but times are off; there is too much space between each line of actors, as if it were laughter (there were none). Anyone who wrote the script was everywhere. They tried to cram together all the controversial themes in a film, almost never completely developing any of them (especially the girl who is left impregnated by a teacher). I didn't laugh at this movie once and for all. I was too insulted by this attempt at humor and satire to do anything but roll your eyes.
