I saw it hoping to discover something I didn't know about the most infamous man in modern history and I couldn't help thinking that the story had been rewritten in HITLER: THE RISE OF EVIL. Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to have one of his admirer shots. Hitler presented himself with a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm. Forgive me for asking but the writers have not confused Adolph Hitler with Tony Montana of SCARFACE? It's pretty bad, but what really offended me is that in this mini series there are no pieces of the historical context. Germany lost the first world war and the Allied powers made Germany pay a heavy price to do so. It was this economic environment that led the German people to have someone - anyone - to restore their pride and that is why they turned to Nazism. The German humiliation of the 1920s caused by the Allied powers seems to be missing entirely so there is no way that HITLER: THE RISE OF EVIL can be taken seriously as a historical document, and I have not even mentioned that Himmler and Goering are conspicuous their absence <br /> <br /> There is a positive point about the mini series and that is Robert Carlyle in the title role. Ok, some of his ways are wrong and his voice is a bit too strong (the recordings of the archives show that Hitler had a sweet and seductive voice) but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and manages to communicate Hitler's charisma on the screen . The comments of the British press that Carlyle resembles Sparks' synth more than Adolph Hitler are unfounded and gives one of Hitler's best performances. I liked the performance of Robert Carlyle but I hated everything else on this mini series and wondered why it was created in the first place. There is nothing to recommend to fans of serious history
