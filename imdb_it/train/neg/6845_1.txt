"Word to your mother. <br /> <br /> Do you want me to stop? <br /> <br /> This is just a small example of the stupmin-flight style of rhymin on display in this waste of films and location permits. This film is seriously wack (that of the 80s speaks only for fucking evil). As a presenter, Mario Van Peebles is an infernal actor. And as an actor, Mario Van Peebles is a real bodybuilder. <br /> <br /> Every film that calls itself "Rappin" has done best to reach the highest standard of the genre of that time. So, why did 6-year-olds enter the corridors, even on the day when the standards were so high up to "Webster"? Because this rap is weak. So weak that not even B.E.T. or Comedy Central will touch it with a chain of 10-foot golden ropes. <br /> <br /> The abduction of Blondie is a poem def near this piece by Dr. Suess in the hood. So don't be a boobie, avoid this movie! <br /> <br />
