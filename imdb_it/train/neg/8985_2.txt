The previous comments encouraged me to check it out when he appeared on TCM, but it was a serious disappointment. Lupe Valdez is fantastic, but doesn't have enough time for the screen. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play familiar but promising characters, but the script leaves them stuck. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the ego of the character of Lee Tracy, who is at best a selfish, physically and verbally offensive idiot. The reactions of the "public" are poorly considered and unbelievable, making the "cheaters" look like excrements of a bad writer. And he questions the credulity that the character of Lupe Velez could fall in love with. <br /> <br /> The "rogue jokes" mentioned in another review must depend on the observer, since I didn't even notice that an attempt had been made.
