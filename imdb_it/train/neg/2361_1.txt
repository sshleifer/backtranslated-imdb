This film is easily the worst in the series. Although New Line could only look at sales, everyone knows that the only reason this made more money than the previous one was due to its 3D ending. It is not that the 3-D was good, because it was the 3D of the 50s with red and blue (anaglyph) lenses. It was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would be like. Besides this film it was so badly done! Bad script, bad characters, bad acting, worse direction. This film is trying to push the field factor to the point of being like an episode of "Looney Tunes". <br /> <br /> Seriously, not for the horror audience, because it's trivial and not scary, and it's not funny or fun for the comedy crowds. Just a total mess with some really bad cameos that are still trying to play all this as a course and making him fall short of what they probably wanted. <br /> <br /> I remember that many of us who were fans of this series were just praying that it would end at this point because of how bad it was. This is one of the films that helped take the horror of popularity and ride a craze of belief that the public really wanted to laugh with a stupid comedy rather than watch a good and scary horror movie.
