Ya I rented it, so shoot me! <br /> <br /> A decent premise creates an otherwise embarrassing story without a real reward, but at least it's turned out well. Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of ​​a fake haunted house with real danger inside. In most cases this should be a crash, but this little stench derails quite quickly. Cinematography is above average and acting is mediocre at best, but history and writing are simply horrible. The slower scenes drag on forever and the fears are too few and far between without a true climax for the film. A disturbing mood is set at the beginning but loses its luster before any kind of horror occurs, and I found myself bored to death and making another sandwich ... The cover is attractive and I suppose it's worth hiring if you are looking for a low budget mindless dreck, but if you like a good story and an eventful ending, look for something else.
