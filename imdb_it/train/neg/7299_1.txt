Sure, I've seen bad movies in my life, but this was so bad that I got really mad at the theater. I wanted my money back. I wrote to the director asking him to reimburse my movie ticket, obviously I didn't receive any refund (or even an answer) but it's the point that counts. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this film a -42. Why does the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ??) stop racing to be hit by a bat? Why did they hit the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ?????) with the bat in the first place instead of breaking the skull of the ass? The plot was thin, the film full of obvious clich√©s and some parts of it made no sense.
