And how many actors will he be able to bear his own neurotic and compulsive New Yorker compulsive character? In this film Woody is played by Will Ferrell in what is mercifully less a direct imitation of what Kenneth Branagh did in "Celebrity". It is a boringly repetitive story now: the nebbishy man, neurotic with a wife or girlfriend, falls madly in love with a shiksa queen on whom he projects all sorts of perfection. Everybody lives in perfect gigantic apartments in Manhattan neighborhoods, all of them frequent expensive exclusive restaurants during which all the characters tell fascinating anecdotes and discuss arcane philosophy, there is always a trip to the Hamptons during which the main fog makes its way on the sand and physical exertion and possible exposure to diseases, and then, of course, said protagonist feels guilty of his lust for queen shiksa but still pursues it, sometimes he succeeds, sometimes fails, etc. <br /> <br /> This is a tired formula and proves that Allen is not really a great film artist. It just looks like a dirty old man with the libido and emotions of a twenty year old who is willing to tell the same boring old stories again and again.
