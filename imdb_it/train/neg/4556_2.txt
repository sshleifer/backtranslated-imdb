I don't know what that other guy thought. The fact that this film was made independently makes it no less terrible. You can be as much a believer as you want ... most of this film is mindless. I feel like I've been insulted by having to watch the first 40 minutes. And that alone was no small feat. Not only is the acting terrible, but the plot is never even remotely developed. There are innumerable holes in history, to the point that you can hardly call it a story anymore. I've never read the book, so I can't criticize it, but this is the first review I've written here and its purpose is solely to save all the spectators out there an hour and a half of your life. I can't remember the last time I couldn't finish watching a movie. This really takes the cake.
