I haven't seen him for over twenty years. OJ was the bus driver, Arte Johnson was the tour guide, Lorenzo was the kidnapper. <br /> <br /> Yes, Lorenzo was very bad at home as the villain, a natural. I think I saw it more for OJ, which I had seen Towering Inferno and Cassandra Crossing, but also to see Arte Johnson. I was a little bored that Johnson was so serious. <Br /> <br /> And yes, he moved the plots. Reading other posts, I remember that it was a plot that would have kidnapped a rich girl, but then that invaluable stamp business arrived suddenly. <br /> <br /> Was I going, a stamp? If it were a late movie, I'd probably record it to see it again, but I wouldn't be nostalgic about it. Not yet anyway. <br /> <br /> There are better films of the seventies like this to try.
