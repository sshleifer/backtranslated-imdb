I don't know anything about the Iliad, so I can't comment on its accuracy in that story. However, as an independent film I found this very boring. The battle scenes tried to be large and spectacular but were simply obvious in CGI. <br /> <br /> The acting is poor and without doubt Brad Pitt has been chosen to attract women. But he is not a good warrior, too good I am afraid. <br /> <br /> The positive points are the design. This film looks good with the impressive landscape and castle buildings / walls. I like a film that at least tries to highlight the characters but this film seems to ignore it completely. we hear Scottish American English everything but what you would expect for a film about an ancient oriental civilization. <br /> <br /> All in all, I don't recommend this movie for a family that sits down. It's too long and young people will get bored. <br /> <br /> For adults, it's okay if you don't care about the lack of realism.
