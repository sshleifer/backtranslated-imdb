This film is the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot is weak - I couldn't even follow it. Acting is high school. The soundtrack is irritating. Attempts at humor are not. The assembly is horrible. The credits are still slow - I would be embarrassed if my name were associated with this waste of film. Don't waste time thinking about this acting attempt.
