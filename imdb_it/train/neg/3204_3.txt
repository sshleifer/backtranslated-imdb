Although it's not as bad as it was made to be (I've seen MUCH worse), this is still a very lame film. Basically a remake of Siegel's "Coogan's Bluff", with the difference that Clint Eastwood's hat has more charisma than the entire Joe Don Baker, an unattractive actor if there was one. <br /> <br /> However, Venantino Venantini is fantastic (and very funny) as the villain, a sort of Vittorio Gassman budget. He is the main reason to sit through this pyramid, since the rest of the cast mostly recites a terrible recitation, especially the girl. Poor old Rossano Brazzi, hard to believe he was once a romantic protagonist (look at "Mondo Cane" to see him run away from women). Looking here as a second Ben Gazzara, he has almost nothing to do. It's all Joe Don's show, unfortunately. And all this marked the generic music of the "80 action films" that could not be more boring. <br /> <br /> Greydon Clark can make good B-Movies ("Without warning"), but here he travels, falls, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, at least the locations in Malta were beautiful, and there's Venantini trying to save the situation. 3/10.
