Kitten Natividad, from the film fame of Russ Meyer, plays Chastity Knott, a woman who discovered she has breast cancer, so she goes to South America to get some special fruit (Crockazilla?) Which should have healing powers. After seeing some of these fruits (which look like plastic bananas on the stems), Chastity has some magical mystical powers that make it a superhero, in particular, The Double D Avenger. Note that she also wears a pair of panties as a mask. In writing, everything looks pretty good. Running, well, leave more than a little to be desired. It seems that Chastity is a pub owner and that a local band is upset because he is taking their business away, so some of the strippers (including Haji, including Russ Meyer's film fame) chase her to ruin her. Of course, Chastity fights under the guise of Double D Avenger. Watch her do a "Wonder Woman" spin to change into her dress and lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force. Bad jokes and double lame senses fly as if there were no tomorrow. With the inane theme song that repeats itself over and over again, this is presented as a "live action" children's show from the 70s with adult content, although while this one has no votes, it could be worse with the PG-13. And it is probably a blessing that the faded stars are well covered. This makes Doris Wishman Chesty Morgan's films appear to be compared. Special aspect of Forest J. Ackerman, but what? Very stupid, and I'll never buy another movie with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 2 out of 10.
