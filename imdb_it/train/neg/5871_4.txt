For me the only reason to take a look at this remake was to see how bad and funny it could be. There was no doubt that it was funny and bad, because I had seen "Voyna i mir" (1968). Let's begin? Here we are ... Robert Dornhelm and Pierre Bezukhov by Brendan Donnison: a thin guy who lacks the depth of the original; Robert Dornhelm and Natasha Rostova of Brendan Donnison: a scarecrow, his image can cause insomnia; Robert Dornhelm and Andrej Bolkonsky by Brendan Donnison - an OK incarnation that, like the thin individual (see above), lacks the depth of a Russian soul and "struggles within"; Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison's Napoleon - a rather insignificant leader; Robert Dornhelm and Prince Bolkonsky of Brendan Donnison - an English-faced asshole; Robert Dornhelm and Count Bezukhov of Brendan Donnison - a strange show without brains ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are not much better. <br /> <br /> The actors' movements and the way they look and talk are often atrocious. They behave like modern European citizens dressed for a day masquerade. It all seems cheap and never comes close to the standards of our Russian men and women of the early nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> A nice piece of entertainment to look at and make fun of. We had a lot of giggles in our office when we remembered this modern product, which had been shown the night before on our TV. <br /> <br /> "User rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)" - I suppose, many young people have never watched our film ("Voyna i mir" 1968) or have a strange sense of the quality of " Tarantino-Spielberg ". Remember the scene where our hussar is saving his friend, turns around, shoots, and the bridge swells up? It looks like a CGI explosion. <br /> <br /> There is neither the sense nor the ability to make a better version of the novel, which has been projected correctly in our country once. But I'd be happy to see a Russian remake of "Gone with the Wind". Hey, directors, wake up and get busy, instead of ruining our classics. <br /> <br /> Now let's get back to common sense. Jokes aside. What I mentioned above is nothing new, although absolutely exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Making foreign actors try to pass for the Russians (while participating in very serious epics and dramas) is a gross mistake and the filmmakers are making this mistake again and again. Obviously it translates into numerous laughs - especially Clemence Poesy is uncomfortably ridiculous and his way of dancing and singing makes one think of a Russian spectator: "This sucks so much that it's funny!"). <br /> <br /> To say something new, I would like to mention the rhythm of the film. In my opinion, this new version is very fragmented. The narration and the scenes are not flowing in a natural way: they stumble and jump out as in a modern video. Once again I must remember our "Voyna i mir", in which the action is so natural and the narration is so simple that you simply sit and enjoy "the flow". <br /> <br /> I thought that maybe the battle of Borodino would be great (somehow rehabilitating numerous inconveniences) but it wasn't possible to match the war scenes of 1968. <br /> <br /> There must be something good in this movie. And there is. The actors seem to be trying to make everything work. They haven't had a chance since the beginning, but they have nevertheless entered the "losers team". Plus 1 point for that recklessness. It makes a Russian spectator uncomfortable - some scenes are ironically ridiculous even though they are destined to be dramatically powerful and the actors are doing their best. Everything evokes pity, and sometimes - laughter. <br /> <br /> What I still like about this serial is the last part of it. It shows very vividly how everyone gets their "wages and taxes". Also, judging from the movie trailers, I thought the movie would have an adult sex scene, which would surely kill the whole project. But, fortunately, it has no such garbage. And this is a great advantage. <br /> <br /> "Voyna i Mir" is not "Harry Potter" and nowadays even we, in present-day Russia, do not have enough work to film it correctly. Do I have to say that the moral quality of our life has deteriorated immensely? Fortunately, a real film was screened during our Soviet times. The American version of the 1950s was somewhat justified - ours did not yet exist. There were extenuating circumstances then. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (1 point is given from the beginning, 1 point goes for unconsciousness and 2 points for the last part of the serial. Thanks for your attention.
