I remember this show. I still remember that funny song "America's Funniest People". Frankly it should have been named after the crippled or disgusting or even disgusting people of America. Dave couldn't save this show and neither did Bob Saget or the AFV replacement hosts that came later. Jackalope's segments were hilarious and yes Dave could make nice voices that were better than Bob's. But this show has gone to hell because of the crappy videos of the videos sent. It also developed as a variety show with lame guest stars including the Olson Twins. In addition, AFV was in the front row before they started choosing the ugly drooler as sinful children as a winner. Did I mention that the videos were disgusting and lame? But still the theme song fluctuates!
