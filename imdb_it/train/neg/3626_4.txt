I don't know what the Oscar voters saw in this film, but they must have seen some pretty difficult things to see to be able to assign it with the best Oscar film. All I know is that fortunately Gene Kelly played it or it would be twice as much as I think. First of all, I don't think Leslie Caron was really suited to playing such a role. She is not so talented, she is not a great dancer and she is not pretty at all. It's a shame that an actor or an actress can ruin a film just like we played it, because if Leslie Caron hadn't been there, she could have made a fantastic movie. The story was smart, the director was not bad and, as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I'm not saying all this stuff about Leslie Caron just to criticize it, I'm just saying it because I think it's the worst part of the movie. She's probably a good actress, but I can't say it because I haven't seen her in anything else, but I think she was pretty bad in "An American in Paris". So if you want to see it, go ahead but I'm telling you that you're much better looking at "Singin 'in the rain".
