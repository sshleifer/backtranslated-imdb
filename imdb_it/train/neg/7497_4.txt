After watching the trailer for this movie and finding out that Spike Lee was directing, I was excited about the event. At the time I wasn't alive yet, I wasn't living in New York, so I expected more of a history lesson than anything else. What I got was a bit of interesting acting, a lot of sex and about 30 minutes of movies that actually have something to do with the Son of Sam. I guess the film wasn't about Sam's son, but it was a peek in the summer of '77. Label me disappointed. <br /> <br />
