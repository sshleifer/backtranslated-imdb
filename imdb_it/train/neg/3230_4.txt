I just finished watching the guinea pig - devils experiment. I have to say that this film, even if I have a very good FX, better than I expected, was NOT a good movie. I honestly can't say that I liked this movie. Obviously it is effective in its way of being a tortuous, realistic, twisted 43 minutes of torture, but I found it very boring (and not as bloody as I hoped). And I also found out that the torturers were very annoying, when they talked and loughed trying to sound tough all the time, that ruined it even more (and I'm sure there are some people out there who will agree with me on that). Now I have seen the guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and the best among those in my opinion is the guinea pig 2 - Flowers of flesh and blood. I won't say much more about the Devils experiment, besides Great fx, the girl's downhill acting, annoying fu ** ing torturers, on the whole I give her 4 stars for the fact that FX is fantastic.
