I never expect a film adaptation to follow too closely the novel (especially a loved one, like Evening) but when I saw that the author of the book, Susan Minot, was a screenwriter and executive producer of the film, I thought Sera would be a good adaptation. <br /> <br /> If you liked the book, don't worry about this movie. It is so far from the book that the two have no similarity between them. <br /> <br /> Here our characters are completely different: the bride is in love with Harris. Harris is the housekeeper's son. Buddy is a drunk, in love with Ann and / or Harris. I don't think a single character came out of the book on the screen; oh, it gets worse every moment that passes. <br /> <br /> And, actually, we didn't learn from Bridges of Madison County to break the story that we were enchanted by, the scenes of our heroes' grown-up children who have hateful and youthful fights, just don't work about the movie This film is a disaster. Salta.
