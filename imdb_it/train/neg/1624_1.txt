I saw this movie a couple of years ago. I could not sleep and there was nothing. So I peeked it. What really gets me is that it doesn't make sense and that's why it's disturbing. Richard is tied by a chicken wire and Jarvis starts making friends with Richard's girlfriend while he is unconscious. Then Jarvis' friend Troubador is playing a stupid song on his guitar. The next morning he shows Richard's girlfriend talking to Jarvis and Trouby and then comes back to Richard and looks at him while he's still tied up. Then they play happy music and the film is over. I mean what happened? Have they braked? And what was he saying to those 2 guys (Trouby and Jarvis)? It is puzzling and poor. I can't stand films that are disturbing and make no sense. This was the worst movie I've ever seen since the 1990s version of Lord of the Flies.
