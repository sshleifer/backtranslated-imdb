This is at least the third remake of this film, so if you look at it, there's a sense of déjà vu, don't be surprised. All they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently but the differences are not significant. And there's nothing better because the plot is flawed to begin with. It never works. And like his predecessors, acting is mediocre. <br /> <br /> The plot has a unique ending that will surprise anyone who has never seen the film before, but the ending does not fit the story. If this movie were finished ten minutes ago, it would have worked and would have been very satisfying and I would have thought it worth it. But here is the spoiler and eventually the crime pays because the criminal is not captured. I never like this message from a movie.
