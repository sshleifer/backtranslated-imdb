Want to know the secret to making a slasher movie set in a fitness center? Just fill the movie with beautiful women in super tight workout clothes and have them bang and grind the floor as if they were in a gentleman's club. This is what the creators of this horrible slasher film did, and that little find kept an eye on me until the end. This is the worst slasher movie I've ever seen, but every time I was ready to switch channels, they added another scene with the coach's girls and I stayed put. As a slasher film, Killer Workout fails in every category it can think of. As a showcase for beautiful working girls, it's a success. Strong recommendation to avoid, unless the thought that half of the film is a great T & A show fascinates you.
