Terrible! Absolutely terrible! No plot, no points, no end. It seems that the director turned on the camera and then the whole crew went to lunch. Everyday. I'm trying to GIVE away this video but nobody will take it. I give him a 2 instead of a 1 because I like Benigni. Roger, I'll have to say the thumbs down on this. <br /> <br />
