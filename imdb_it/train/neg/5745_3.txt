This film was the recipient of the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1990. In the last few weeks I have seen dozens of candidates and recipients of this award in the last 30 years and I really think that this film could only be the worst of all - yet it wasn't just a candidate, but it won !! I assume that 1989 must have been just a horrible year for the genre. <br /> <br /> The film shows a group of characters that look a bit like super-skinny Uncle Festers. They seem to be simple articulated figures that are moved using stop motion animation. All are identical - with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that everyone has a different number drawn on their back. They are all on a large platform suspended, as if by magic, in space. Each has a pole and their is also a box on the platform. The platform starts to tilt slightly and in response the men move in an attempt to balance the platform. This goes on and on and on and on for the longest time. The only relief from this tedium is when one of them behaves pretty badly towards the end, but it's not enough to make this fun to look less. Apart from the passable stop motion animation, this short does not offer anything interesting for me .... NOTHING. <br /> <br /> By the way, the big short KNICK KNACK came out in 1989 and I have no idea why it wasn't among the candidates. It was an exceptional short film and was far better than all the candidates of the year or the previous year. Perhaps Pixar's success in previous years has led to a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so smart and so funny that it seems almost criminal to have ignored it. Could Pixar not have entered it? This seems unlikely.
