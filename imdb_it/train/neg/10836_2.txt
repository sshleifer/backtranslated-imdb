"Magnolia" is an absurd, disconcerting showcase that adds very little. Like "Eyes Wide Shut", "Magnolia" is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for consistency. The camera swoops through corridors and corridors, catching glimpses of sad characters. Where is the reason to take care of these people? The common theme seems to be the people who scream a lot, who can't take care of others (except for the characters of John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman), and are self-destructive idiots who are falling apart or dying. It occurred to me how much I didn't like "Shine" because of the irreducible monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive and unpleasant characters here, why should we spend time with them? <br /> <br /> Having said that, there is nothing that can hold back on "Magnolia". Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are splashed on his canvas with abandon. There are two ideas in particular about the bomb. Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute movie. One has a camera that launches from one character to another while everyone sings one of Aimee Mann's popular coffee songs. Sweet, but ineffective since we can't see what ties them all together. The other idea I refer to cannot be revealed except to say that it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> "Magnolia" has a lot of great acting. In particular, Tom Cruise who frees a performance I didn't know he had in him. And John C. Reilly perhaps plays the most respectable and truly good cop in recent memory. But all in all nothing. When the unexpected secret event happened, a girl behind me in the theater didn't make it anymore and said: "This is stupid!" My feeling is that the majority of spectators will agree.
