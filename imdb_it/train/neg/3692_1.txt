Rajinikanth is reborn after obtaining a magic power he can use seven times. <br /> <br /> There are several problems with this film that are obvious to the casual public: the Rajishstanh 50ish is still at home with his parents; the father of the girl next door thinks he is a compelling "boy" ("vaseekaramaana paiyan"); Rajinikanth suddenly interrupts the film with his sermons, the worst is the way in which women of the past have done their exercise through domestic work - yet we must believe that he is not a theist; even if he was well read, he wasted six of his seven powers on a stupid kite; I can go on, but get the photo. <br /> <br /> There are gods, there are gods, and there is Rajinikanth. The directory has difficulty inserting Rajinikanth into one of these categories. Initially, Rajinikanth is just Rajinikanth doing what the Tamil heroes do - he is opposed to the bad guys and, despite being the oldest, he is being courted by the prettiest girl in the film. Rajinikanth does it well and some of Rajinikanth's brand styles are really enjoyable - "counting babas" is new. What makes this film unbearable is that those initial few minutes are just the preface of a worse book that has ever been written. This preface is also punctuated by some comedies that are forced and obvious. <br /> <br /> The director does not explain the purpose of the hero; we see that the hero is faced with various obstacles (from politicians, as usual), but we can't really root for the hero because we don't know what the hero's ultimate goal is. In the end, when everyone wants him to be the boss, the hero gives another of his sermons and walks away to become a hermit. The director offers no solution to the problem in the climax scene. <br /> <br /> A. The soundtrack of R. Rehman is really interesting. Either he shows patches of brilliance or he hasn't bothered to invest fully in this film - who can blame him. There is a scene in which Rajinikanth enters the van of one of the criminals and then throws the knife and starts his count of baba. The music is very suitable for the moment and acts as a catalyst adding more tension. The songs are all mediocre, nobody would care about the songs in this movie after a few years. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 1 is the lowest rank you can assign in IMDb. This film has all the elements that justify its rightful place at the bottom of the IMDb ranking.
