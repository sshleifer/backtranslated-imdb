Wow. Who ever said that Edward D. Wood Jr. never influenced anyone? This steaming pile of donkey droppings is a perfect example; makes "The Violent Years" look like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" also makes Keith Richards' worst flashbacks like my first nighttime broadcast. I had nightmares, you know, waking up and sweating bullets, which will never come close to the visceral terror that Santa Claus brought to light from the seemingly pure soil of my own being. However, I can think of some parties where this film could actually go further. Also, if you are looking for the perfect example of the Santa-Satan dichotomy on VHS tape, look no further. Don't take a look at this film, since I was informed that the MST3K version is now available. Move on Satan, here is "Santa Claus".
