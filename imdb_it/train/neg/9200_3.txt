One wonders how the script was written. <br /> <br /> Wayne and the other performers do a good job but, since it is neither a comedy, a romantic thriller or anything, it is rather disappointing. <br /> <br /> It feels as if one of the threads had been pursued, it could have been something useful. It's still interesting to see a real turkey from a story made just before the United States entered the war directly. I wonder if surrounding politics has anything to do with trying to make a film for everyone but end up with something that nobody likes. <br /> <br /> However, it has historical value.
