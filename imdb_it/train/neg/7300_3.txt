This film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods. One of the friends captures a horrible carnivorous virus. Suddenly, friends turn to each other in a desperate attempt to avoid contracting the disease on their own. <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is a horrible film. For one, try to be many genres simultaneously. Should it be a tribute, a slasher, a black comedy or a scary movie with an involuntary comedy? No one can say. There is a serious scene at the beginning and a second change, it becomes fun. When the film tries to be funny, the humor is rather bland, excluding the ending. I really liked the ending. <br /> <br /> But aside from the finale, I was rather disappointed and disgusted. Violence is worthwhile, more the look away from the screen than being scared. The tone changes within each scene, sometimes funny, sometimes frightening and sometimes quite random. In fact, you see a girl practicing karate in slo-motion. What should we get from this? This same girl would bite one of the characters. Should it be fun? I do not know. <br /> <br /> Some of the shows were decent, and many were rather amateur. I didn't care about most of the characters. I liked the plot but the execution was horribly done. As a horror movie, I didn't know what he was trying to be. I didn't find it funny, tense, or scary. In the end, you remained indifferent, thinking, "What have I just been through?" Unfortunately, you will never know the answer to this question.
