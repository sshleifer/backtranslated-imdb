This film was absolutely horrible! I can't understand how this film came into production. Nothing against the cast of the film, of course, this is all the fault of the team of writers. Take the old media plot - dance our way to be poor and needy - or STEP in this case. But this lacks any semblance of a real plot - or at least one that someone would care about. With Canadian-speaking actors in what should be an American environment, this film is very flat. On a positive note, the direction was pretty good and the cinematography was pretty decent too. It seems that the production budget has also been very generous. My only request is that this team leave the writing alone and go find real writers to help them bring the words to the film. Net result: how it moves is how she sucks.
