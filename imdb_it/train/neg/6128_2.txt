This film was boring! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some fun moments and jokes, but you can't base an entire movie on this! <br /> <br /> The characters are too stereotyped, there is no real story - but short episodes with bizarre secondary characters, which are not scary enough to make the plot authentic. <br /> <br /> Shame, because most of the actors have been recognized in Hungary, a mystery for which they have assumed the roles. <br /> <br /> This is not * a new hope for the Hungarian film. It was boring, even if it had to be genuine or unique. They could have tried a lot harder than this ... 2 out of 10
