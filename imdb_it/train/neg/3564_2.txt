Pet Sematary, although a beautiful horror film from the 1980s, with a nice director and an atmosphere, is a copy of the Italian film ZEDER by Pupi Avati. It is clear that Stephen King has copied almost all the ideas of this director (the film Zeder was made before King wrote the book) <br /> <br /> The cat, the land, everything has been copied, this is a case of plagiarism, but being Stephen Kind a famous American writer, it is completely normal that he can get away with it, obviously because of the enormous difference between this genre of Italian films without budget (and in part, it is crap in itself .. .) but the original idea, I repeat, is the Italian director Avati <br /> <br /> Let the world know
