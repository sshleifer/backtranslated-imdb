PLEASE TAKE A MINUTE TO READ MY ENTIRE REVIEW. I DON'T KNOW THE SAME FILM - ONLY THE DVD VERSIONS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> I really wanted to give this film two stars too. I mean, how could a single 1 out of 10 ever classify!?! <br /> <br /> Here's how: An epic adaptation of Tolstoy's novel "War and Peace" with historically accurate battle scenes, courtesy of the Red Army and an extremely faithful scene-for-scene adaptation of the novel would be difficult but worth the wait for seven hours - if that's what you were seeing. <br /> <br /> The trouble is you can't watch it - anywhere as far as I know. <br /> <br /> I am trying to watch the DVD version of RusCiCo - widely considered the best version available since it is letterbox and restores scenes that have been cut from other DVD versions. <br /> <br /> But it's one of the worst film footprints I've ever seen transferred to DVD. The image is muddy and incoherent, often strobed. It is almost tolerable if the brightness, color and image levels are increased to the maximum ... but the problem does not end there. <br /> <br /> The sound is also inconsistent, loudly in the parts, virtually incomprehensible in others. <br /> <br /> And as for languages, it's a HUGE problem for English speakers - the dubbed option has some good actors, and some really terrible whose performances scratch, and some parts of the movie are not dubbed at all , slipping back into Russian and even French at random. <br /> <br /> The subtitled option is not much better. Subtitles do not appear below the image, but right above it - obscuring part of the beauty (or what's left of it) in the scenario. Furthermore, the subtitles are often a poor translation (shameful given that the script is committed to showing itself so close to Tolstoy's actual words), and even the subtitles seem to abandon the parts. <br /> <br /> So, even if you reduce the color, brightness and image settings, and raise the volume upwards, and choose subtitles * and * English dubbed, you'll still get an annoying movie watching and listen. <br /> <br /> Can the content be exceeded? He may have been able, but at seven o'clock - who can hold out so long? <br /> <br /> Maybe one day, someone will come and restore this - and maybe then I'll see a masterpiece - but for now, I can't give more than one star to something I've been able to endure just looking at the first 12 % of.
