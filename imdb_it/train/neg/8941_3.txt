Ed Wood is eclipsed and becomes Orson Welles. This movie is fantastic. Witches of vampires who fight in scenes and terribly choreographed dialogues that could break their ribs with laughter. Plan 9 From OUterSpace has no chance against this. Described by writer and psychic Stephen Armourae on Vampire Forum as a masterpiece - it comes from England and is completely sarcastic. <br /> <br /> He has Stephanie Beaton and the producers know what is going to save them from bankruptcy by repeatedly using her. Even if she leaves me cold like she looks more like an undead than all devil farmers. And Eilen Daly is only a lower rate than Elvira. Everything is badly done. <br /> <br /> But watch it for the script
