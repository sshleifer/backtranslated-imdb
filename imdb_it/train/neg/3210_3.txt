There's really no way to beat around in the bush saying this, Lady Death: The Motion Picture just sucks. Apart from the fact that the protagonist is a well-endowed blonde who runs around the hell in a leather bikini with occasional flashes of graphic violence, the film seems to have been created with the mentality of a 1980s cartoon based on a series of action figures. The villain himself even talks like an aspiring Skeletor, he has the inept inept henchman, and he lives in a den that seems to have been modeled on the villain's realm by the old Blackstar cartoon on Saturday morning. Don't expect any more humor than the sometimes terribly bad dialogue. Other times it seems the kind of anime story more suited to hentai, yet there is no sex, no tentacle of rape (thank goodness!) And very little sex appeal, despite the physical appearance of the title character. There is simply no adult limit for this material, unless you contain the half-naked heroin and bloody deaths. In essence, what we have here is an episode of the length of a character of She-Ra, the Princess of Power, but with more succinct and more gore clothes.
