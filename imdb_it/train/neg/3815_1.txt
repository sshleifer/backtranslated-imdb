Acting is bad, ALL jokes are superficial and the target audience is clearly very young children, assuming they have an IQ lower than the average. I realize that it was meant for children, but it is also meant for Malcom in the Middle, yet they continue to arouse humor and adult situations. <br /> <br /> What should we expect from a show led by Bob Saget, the only comedian in existence who is less fun than a ball hitting a man's groin, which is probably why he has stopped hosting the funniest American home videos. <br /> <br /> Parents, don't let your kids watch this show unless you want to save money in college. Expose your children to stupidity and they will grow more stupid.
