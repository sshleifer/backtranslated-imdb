PRO: Akshay Kumar's performance (is it just me or does this guy always manage to beat AB in their movies together?). Some moving scenes in the 2nd semester. <br /> <br /> CONS: The entire 1st hour (the lines were nothing short of flat). Every scene involving Rajpal Yadav. Greater stupidity in the AB decision making process. Let me understand, he brutally believes insulting his son's soul in every possible way (which will probably ruin their relationship beyond repair) is a better way to make Akshay finally take responsibility and then tell him the truth? ? WTF? Consider that Akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his old father will soon die from cancer, but do you think that insulting him will make him stronger? Am I the only one who doesn't see the logic here? Easily the biggest flaw in the film. <br /> <br /> - Akshay becomes a stuntman. LMAO !! We are told that he has finished the first one in college every year and has a degree in MBA. But when the time comes to support himself, and his pregnant wife, he becomes a stuntman. LOL !! How can you actually apply for a regular job in your field? Oh heck, anywhere else where life isn't in danger? This is an incredibly stupid script. <br /> <br /> - The finale. I hate this sort of melodramatic shit. Everything is pushed down our throats to displease AB's character, which I could not. The whole thing reminded me a little too much of Srk in KHNH (what I hate). This "please feel sorry for the boy with the disease" cagata has run its course. I felt more like throwing up than sympathy for the old man. I couldn't watch the last 20 minutes or so because of this and so I had to fwd fast. the whole. <br /> <br /> Bottomline: Waqt is too stupid to be called a good movie. His obvious director Vipul Shah has targeted this theme in chicas and emotionally fragile oldies that could be less interesting for a story that really makes sense. Give him some decent pictures of the songs, fancy clothes, lots of scenes full of glycerin and a bit of star power and they'll happily do shit like these.
