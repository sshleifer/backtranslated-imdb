Shintar√¥ Katsu gained a lot of fame by playing the wonderful character, Zatoichi. Zatoichi's films had a strange and unbelievable concept: a blind man is the greatest swordsman in Japan and spends every movie to remedy exact wrongs and salaries for the wicked. He's a nice guy and the movies are exciting and addictive (I've seen every movie). That's why I saw this latest episode of the Hanzo the Razor series, as I thought it would have been very similar .... and the boy was wrong! It turns out that Hanzo's films are extremely sexual in nature and also promote the rape of "women who deserve it". You see, Hanzo is a policeman from the Meiji period and regularly takes custody of evil women and interrogates them violently raping them with his "steel penis". How he made his member so strong is something you have to see to believe, but it certainly is NOT for the squeamish. <br /> <br /> In general, I cannot recommend anyone to see these violent and misogynistic films. However, looking at the other reviews, I can see that they are still very popular ... and that's pretty scary. Despite some decent acting and incredible fight scenes, the films are just like brain pollution - and I hate to imagine how the movies could have contributed to violence against women.
