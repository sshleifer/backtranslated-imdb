Ever wanted to eat worms? Here is a 'documentary' to show you how! Yes ... The baby eats live worms! And this is the most interesting part of the film. <br /> <br /> This film was rather summarized by previous reviewers as rather boring. I totally agree here. The film is not going anywhere ... unless you like eating the worm! This is a movie it's almost impossible to write a spoiler for .... because not much happens. <br /> <br /> Now on the technical side: they should have given that guy a haircut. Who's trying to look like anyway ... Bozo the Clown. It was almost comical ... I almost expected it to turn into a ruffled dog or something. <br /> <br /> And what's more; the child was too massive to look hungry! He should have kept him away from junk food for a couple of weeks before shooting. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film almost put me to sleep. And my kids could only handle about 15 minutes before leaving the scene for something more interesting. <br /> <br /> I must admit that the scenario was really impressive. And if there had been a decent story, it could have been a success. <br /> <br /> It seemed safe enough for the children to watch: the bear scenes and the "extravagant" eyeball were too weak to frighten most children, and the short "skinny-dipping" scene has no showed nothing. <br /> <br /> I gave this one a very generous one 3.
