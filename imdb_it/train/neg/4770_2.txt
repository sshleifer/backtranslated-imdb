I wanted to like this movie, yes it's a SAW, blah blah blah, but I like those movies. If done right, this has had all the ingredients of being a good film, not brilliant, but good ... unfortunately those ingredients were gone! The acting was terrible, and this was seen for the first time when the prisoners were introduced with their captor one by one (the caps removed), the comments and jokes are simply terrible, yes I know, bad writing. .. but this is more than that, it was bad writing coupled with bad acting. Two of the prisoners were in a relationship with each other and they didn't even recognize it until much else in the movie ..... <br /> <br /> Sorry, I'm also wondering why I'm taking the trouble to see again this movie to everyone. <br /> <br /> I'll end up with PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES & MORE PLOT HOLES! DISAPPOINTING!
