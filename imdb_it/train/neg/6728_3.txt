This film is not good at all, not at all exceptional. Some memorable scenes and the unfortunate choice to pair Norma Jean with a real actress. Jane Russell worked out for her, the woman and / or the minor actress from Marilyn. One can only wonder why this is considered one of the highlights of his lacking career. 3/10
