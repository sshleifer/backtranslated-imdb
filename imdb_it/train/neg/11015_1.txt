I foolishly read the back cover of the DVD of this movie on Best Buy about a year ago and I said to myself: "It sounds strange, plus there's Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose!" I proceeded to pay $ 15.99 more fees for this. I took him to a friend's house and we were both amazed at how badly it was written and played. Wooden shows abound. All the "hilarious" and "exceptional" promised performances never seemed to come. After 90 minutes I hung my head in shame, knowing I could never get those 90 minutes or $ 15.99. I literally almost cried, because if that was what could be considered "comedy" I no longer wanted to believe in movies. My friend and I constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this film to the point that he needed to see it only to understand how bad it was. During the holiday season this year I saw him with him because he didn't want to look at him alone. This was my next horrible mistake, because as I watched I got angry. I started screaming at the movie, and I'm not one to talk to in the cinema. Everyone I know who even caught a glimpse of this movie has agreed the worst they have ever seen. My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends, but this could not even save this film. The fact that this film is not on the list of 100 at the bottom of IMDb is staggering. The fact that his assessment (at the time of writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
