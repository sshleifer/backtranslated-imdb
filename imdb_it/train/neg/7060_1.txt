this film is terrible. The characters are absolutely incredible and wildly inconsistent. The plot is horrible and some of the class scenes are worthy and make the viewing unpleasant. <br /> <br /> In fact, the quality of the script and characterization suggests that this film was written by high school students, only the absolute lack of credibility in the school environment would suggest that, in reality, writers probably they never went to high school. Even the acting in most cases was weak, although much of it was due to a poor script and plot, I'm not sure all the actors could have made this movie watchable. <br /> <br /> having said the track sound was OK, and the cinematography was nice in some places (even if the editing was poor).
