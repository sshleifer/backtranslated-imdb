This so-called prequel is just a poorly made remake for a better version of Dangerous Liasons. The plots are the same as most of the script. I loved the book it's based on, and I loved the first movie, but I'm not going to worry about the third movie. The useless joke between the two main characters of the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal, and ... I can't stress how bad the film was. If you don't want to believe me, look at it and see what I mean. If you've read a review that says "If you like the first one, you'll like the second one", the only reason is because it's the same movie! Although the plot is not even good. They've taken so many lines from the first movie, it's hard to tell which movie you're watching.
