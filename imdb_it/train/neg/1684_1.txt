*** spoiler *** spoiler *** spoiler *** spoiler <br /> <br /> There are bad movies and then there are movies that are so terrible as to become affectionately comic in their ineptitude. This is the case of "The Grudge" by Columbia Pictures. This cinematic atrocity started when an American, however well-intentioned, saw a Japanese made for the TV movie 'Ju-on' and was inspired to redo the film in English. This started a virtual tsunami of wrong decisions that circumnavigated the globe until it landed in Orlando on October 21, 2004. <br /> <br /> The premise, and I use the word freely, involves a house in Tokyo haunted by a skinny Momma ghost who looks like a cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette, along with his horrible companion, a second plump, turbulent but wicked selector. Is there anything scarier than an ugly 8-year-old Japanese boy? Of course there is! Count Chocula comes to mind. With this extravagant group we must add a mysterious black cat that I affectionately called Chim Chim. (Remember Speed ​​Racer?) As you've already guessed, they were killed in this house of doom and now they want to kill anyone who enters the premises. You see, as explained by a Japanese detective, when someone dies of anger, their ghost seeks revenge on all those who follow the lines of property defined by the county commissioner or something like that, I forget. <br /> <br /> The story begins innocently enough with the acclaimed actor Bill Pullman leaping from a balcony. My hypothesis is that Bill Pullman got this job because of his children begging him for a trip to Tokyo Disneyland. Then we endure the slightly interesting saga of Nurse Yoko, "oh no, don't go in there" screams the audience, but alas she doesn't tolerate the terrible warnings and is predictably off like a magic lantern. About 30 minutes into the film we finally see her American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen. Sarah Michelle Gellar could be a competent actress, but I couldn't help but think of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, to the point that it was distracting. It's the equivalent of having Jennifer Anniston's star in a film about the adventures of six friends in New York. Try as you can, you can't stop thinking about the other project that made it famous. But I digress, Karen, the nurse is hired as a replacement for the doctor who disappeared from us. <br /> <br /> Snoops running around, meeting the ghosts, a lady dying, and something else happening. Looking at the blonde fox for clues, I almost expected her to find the ghost and remove her mask to reveal that it was actually the old Gower who owned the abandoned amusement park! "I too would have taken it away if it hadn't been for you to intrude on me and your dog!" <br /> <br /> Director Takashi Shimizu, who is competing to be the Ed Wood of Asia, has made two unfortunate decisions regarding sound. First, choose to use a soundtrack only when someone is about to be killed. This is an excellent tool to erase suspense because the public receives a two-minute warning to prepare for another miserably predictable murder. Second, he gave the ghosts a bizarre guttural noise that looks like a bubbling gopher. After the movie, I heard several people come out of the theater to make the sound and laugh. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar ends up being the only survivor. And, of course, we learn that the fire he burned to burn the house was extinguished in time for the next mandatory chapter. However, considering the humorous reactions of the public, they did not want a follow-up, but an apology. 'The Grudge' could easily be re-edited into a comedy, perhaps later appreciated for its field value. That being said, this will be the biggest movie thriller from the 'Godzilla vs Megalon'. I would suggest waiting until the film arrives in your local discounted theater, where it can receive the ridiculous audience that it deserves so much.
