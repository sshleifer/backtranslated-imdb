Thunderbirds (2004) <br /> <br /> Director: Jonathan Frakes <br /> <br /> Protagonists: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbet <br /> <br /> 5 ?? 4 ?? 3? ? 2 ?? 1! Thunderbirds are GO! <br /> <br /> And so Thunderbirds was born, one of my childhood favorites. When I heard they were about to make a Thunderbirds movie, I was ecstatic. I couldn't wait to see Thunderbird 2 roar to save people, while Thunderbird 4 would dive deep. I couldn't wait. Then August 2004 came, when the film was finally released. Critics cut him short, but I still wanted to go. After all, as long as the heart was in the same place, that was all that mattered to me. So I sat in the theater, the only teenager in a 50-year-old crowd, everyone else was over thirty and under ten. Most likely the most embarrassing theatrical experience I've ever had ?? <br /> <br /> The film (which wants to be a prequel) focuses on Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet), the youngest of the Tracy family. He spends his days wishing he could save people like the rest of his family, but he's too young. One day, he finally gets his chance when The Hood (Ben Kingsley) traps the rest of his family on Thunderbird 5 (the space station). This means that he must outsmart Hood's henchmen and save his family in time before The Hood can steal all the money from the Bank of England. <br /> <br /> Trust me, the plot looks like a regular Thunderbirds episode when you read it on paper Once it's put to film what mess we have on our hands. First of all, the film was intended for children, just like the original show was. However, Gerry Anderson treated us like adults and gave us plots that were advanced enough for children's programming. This on the other hand, changes the plot as it tries to mock the Spy Kids franchise. The final product is a film that tries to attract fans of the Thunderbirds series and children, while both are completely missing. Joking limbs, cartoon sounds and silly antics that no one really finds amusing are this whole movie, and I'm sure Jonathan Frakes would like to never have directed this. <br /> <br /> Over all, everyone gave a solid performance, considering the script that was all given. Ben Kingsley was as exceptional as The Hood, playing the part extremely well. My only complaint about the characters is about the hoodies of The Hood, who are reduced to leftovers from old Looney Tunes cartoons, muttering because, surprisingly enough, children deal with them easily. <br /> <br /> What's strange about this is that the movie is that while I was watching the movie I enjoyed it. But once the lights came on, I realized that the movie was pretty bad, I was lighter by $ 8 and two hours of my time were gone. A guilty pleasure? Maybe. However, Thunderbirds is a forgettable mess. Instead of a big "go", I will have to recommend you to stay away from this movie. If the rest of the film had been like the first ten minutes, it would have been an incredible film worthy of the name of Thunderbirds. However, we get a movie that only Thunderbirds fans die of (if you'd like to watch your childhood torn apart) or the extremely bored should worry about it. <br /> <br /> My score for Thunderbirds is 1 Â½ stars.
