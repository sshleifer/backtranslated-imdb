This movie is terrible! I don't even know where to start, I'm speechless I can't even describe how horrible it is. Blood is fiery first of all, and acting is TERRIBLE! The only good thing was the biker girl who saved the day. This film was ridiculous, I don't see how it's possible that his vote is poor. It appears to have been made by high school students.
