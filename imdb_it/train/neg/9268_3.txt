*** SPOILER *** Like a combination of diabolical Tinkers-to-Evers-to-Chance we have in "Omen IV", the dead seed of the late AntiChrist Damien Thorn returns. Terrifying his parents his schoolmates his neighbors and finally the whole world as you called Delia York, Asia Vieila. After being given to a "worthy" couple, York Karen & Gene, Fay Grant and Michael Woods, from the orphanage of St. Francis of the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Little Delia wasted no time making her peasants feel scratching her mother at a house party. Delia is almost killed by a fugitive only to be saved by this "Devil" named Ryder. Going to school, Delia takes care of the local bully making sure that the big one gets wet in front of all her classmates. Later, when his father threatens the York with a lawsuit, he has his head cut off in a self-induced car accident! Delia is a person you don't mess around with if you know what's good for you. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile Dalia Gene's dad becomes a big man in the city alone, or so he thinks, being elected to the congress as a champion of clean air and green trees flocking instead of letting the smog and the concrete boys conquer the neighborhood with their eyes on him, the White House itself! Does your grizzled and strange daughter, Delia, have anything to do with Gene York's sudden fortune? <br /> <br /> It's only later when Jo, Ann Hearen, is hired as Delia's nanny that the truth comes out of her weird and bad powers. Jo at New Age realizes that Delia is a bit weird, having turned all her black white crystals, and calls her New Age Guru Noah, Jim Byrnes, to come and check. Noah is so upset by what he sees in the color vibrations of Delia Kirilian, all black and blue with a hint of red, which makes him turn so badly that he almost fell into Delia's moms' car. <br /> <br /> during a trip to a psychic festival of Jo Delia transforms the whole event into a hell by setting the place, through mental telepathy, on fire and raising all those who run to hide, including poor Noah who he was at the festival and ended up with a broken leg. The Guru, shaken and battered, was so upset by the whole experience that he later controlled the country to become a hermit in Tibetan lands. <br /> <br /> Jo herself is then thrown out, with the help of the sweet and tender family baby Ryder, a second floor window until her death because she knew and spoke too much. It is when Karen is pregnant again that she finally decides to find out the truth about Delia's real parents. At that moment she and we in the audience come face to face with the truth. It's not just the dreaded Antichrist of the Revelations, it's his twin sister! His brother, the Antichrist, is about to come on the scene like his little brother the grumpy Alexander York! <br /> <br /> Three times it was more than enough for the Antichrist to return to Earth to bring Armageddon. The film in public was already getting a little tired of him and his evil adventures. With a quarter really unnecessary since Daimen Thorn, the original AntiChrist, had died and been buried for years. They went through the usual ringtone without anyone believing that little Delia was "Te" AntiChrist until it was almost too late to stop her in her mortal cycle of destroying the entire human race. The film, as bad as it is, is also too long, 97 minutes, for a horror film that could very well tell that its story is only 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> Having a private eye Earl Knight, Mchael Learner, and later a former Catholic nun Yvonne, Megan Lehch, and now the healer Felichy in the film just to be killed didn't even help the plot. It has only prolonged the suffering of those who watch the film. You can see the surprise ending coming almost immediately after the film "Omen IV" started with the bases for the eventual acquisition by Delia of the civilized and non-civilized world. What was a bit of a surprise was Delia doing it with a little help from friends.
