I bought the DVD version of this film on the advice of my wife who loved the version she was watching on television. But the DVD version was a disaster. The lighting was poor and non-existent and the whole scenes were simply deleted. At a certain point Adele is put to bed and immediately we make a cut on another scene - arriving in mid-sentence - where it is the next evening. Characters like Grace Poole and Mason were never introduced, leaving to wonder if they were dozing for a few minutes during the movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD we saw was produced by Platinum Disc Corp and even at $ 6.32 it was a gyp. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to which version of this movie you buy! We are postponing this.
