A teenager who seems to have everything commits suicide. Leave his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) asking many questions ... and blaming themselves. <br /> <br /> Good idea, poorly managed. For beginners this was done before 1988 - mostly in TV movies and After School Specials. Apart from a few bad words and dialogues (hence the PG-13 rating) this did not add anything new. The result is predictable and Reeve's acting attempts were truly painful to watch. It's good NOW, but not in 1988. Apart from the fact that his character was dressed like a sloppy and always looked so dirty, it was difficult to develop sympathy. <br /> <br /> Apart from the film, it's boring. I saw every scene coming and every "surprise" was telegraphed. Basically I couldn't wait for this to finish. <br /> <br /> I have a vague memory of seeing him in a theater in 1988 and hating him (he bombed BADLY). It still looks crappy almost 20 years later. The topic is worth being treated, but it has been better done (with better acting) in countless other films. "Ordinary People" comes to mind. You can skip this.
