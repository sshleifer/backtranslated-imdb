I don't know how this film received so many positive reviews on this site! I'm a big fan of Vonnegut and I know very well the story of this original Showtime movie bastard beyond imagination, but even if I wasn't, the mediocre acting, the VERY poor casting (Sean Astin as the brilliant, athletic and all around individual, Harrison ?? The boy is completely generic!) And the sub-standard writing made this tripe barely watchable. Someone pointed out how cute the Maculay Culkin line was. If you read it and thought it was pure genius (unfortunately, it was probably the funniest part of the movie), maybe you'll like this movie. But if you're a fan of Vonnegut or not completely crazy, don't see it. Please.
