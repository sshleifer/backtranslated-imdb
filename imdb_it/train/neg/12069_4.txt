Carl Monson, one of the most prolific filmmakers in the low budget low mayion industry, was one of the most prolific horror directors. His films are full of inept gore, ridiculous acting, devious boring and painful dialogues. A mysterious black dress the figure savagely kills the guests staying in the family villa. Unfortunately this film is almost bloodless. In reality the murders are not seen except with the shadows and some splashes of blood. The rhythm is lethargic and the plot is rather uninteresting. competent, but the lack of blood and mutilation left me disappointed. A generous 4 out of 10. Just be careful: don't confuse the Monson movie with the equally weak "Legacy of Blood" by Andy Milligan.
