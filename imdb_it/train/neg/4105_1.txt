Another sin the lowest they can go here is one. Otherwise you would get an easy zero. Really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact Peckenpah's name was not about the thing I never imagined I'd done it. In fact, one of the people in San Francisco that I know was a lot on the set and from almost sunup says that Sam was simply mocked. It shows itself in spades. The ridiculous part of the first part of the film is the ONLY thing in this mess that deserves a second look. Not even Gig Young is watchable. This is a real test of masochism. If I had been forced to enter the confines of a theater to see it, I would have jumped up screaming. And now I feel really guilty of seeing everything from the confines of a very comfortable couch that was too good to leave. What a mess, it seemed less written than invented as they went on. It's not just a bomb, but a bmob written backwards. Yikes !!!!!
