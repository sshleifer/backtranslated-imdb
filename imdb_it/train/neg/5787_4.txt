As for HEIST films, this is rather weak. The continuity is rather bad, there is not enough continuity of character to really feel as if I understood some of the characters. Peter Falk is fantastic, and that's one of the reasons why it's worth looking at. Falk has some great lines, like "he'll come back right away, buy some saugage" or something ... there are some pretty scenes, even if they are entirely due to the actors' efforts. The direction, the script and the editing are pretty bad.
