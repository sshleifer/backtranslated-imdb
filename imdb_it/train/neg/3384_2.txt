If I were to judge only on the basis of the film, the committee that gave the musical "A Chorus Line" a Pulitzer Prize, and the Broadway audience that kept the warhorse active for 15 years, were all on heavy narcotics, because one singular feeling this film certainly is NOT. <br /> <br /> What someone had to think that Richard Attenborough was the right person for this material completely confused me, but he makes a musical that is almost entirely based on movement and sits on the screen like a piece of clay . <br /> <br /> Not happy with the original score as it was originally written, someone decided that what the movie really needed was a brand new song to give the movie a little zip. So we are assailed with the Oscar nomination (!) "Surprise, Surprise." Well, surprise, surprise, the song stinks, and so does the movie. <br /> <br /> Vote: D
