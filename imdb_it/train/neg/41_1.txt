How can you say that a horror movie is terrible? when you can't stop laughing of course! The plot has been well treated by other reviewers, so I'll just add a few things about the hilarity of it all. <br /> <br /> Some reviews have placed the position in South America, others in Africa, I thought it was in some random island in the Pacific. Where exactly this happens, it seems to be a mystery. The cannibal tribe is shaped by a pair of black women of black men, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa who beats the drums ... the Devil God is a great black man with a terrible suitcase of pink eyes. <Br /> <br /> One of the most "freak" moments of the film is when, "Pablito" finds his partner hanging from a tree covered with what appears to be an orange substance that I assume is blood, he starts screaming for minutes back and forth (which is actually funny), and then his partner's head falls into the ground and "Pablito" kicks him a little for what I assume is "shit and giggles" and the eyes really move ... < br /> <br /> But, of course, then the "maniac" left when you realize that your eyes were moving because the film is just ugly ... <br /> <br /> I hadn't laughed so in a loooong while, and I highly recommend this movie for a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do ... grab a case of beer and start watching this movie, you'll like it! If you're looking for a real horror or gore movie, but ... don't bother.
