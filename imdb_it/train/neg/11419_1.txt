I think I've seen this kind of thing before: graduates don't realize that they did it damn well, all the time, complaining that their lives suck. <br /> <br /> This movie is highly derived from The Big Chill and Reality Bites from what I can do: they have pretty much the same storyline. <br /> <br /> If something good came out of this party of the Russians, it was the music. It was this. <br /> <br /> For my part, I'm not impressed ... but then again, I never expected anything less. This film was directed by the same person who directed Batman and Robin; another film that should only be seen with a bandage in tow. <br /> <br /> Now for the verdict: it's a 1 in 10.
