I loved the first two films, but this film was just a waste of time and money (for me and the studio). I'm still wondering why they made this awful movie. The thing with the plastic gun and the toy car, which can go to another house, is ridiculous. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two films were so funny, but the terrorists in this are so stupid and not funny. Believe me, this movie is just a waste of time.
