I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but I couldn't wait to do it. I was fascinated by the pre-hype descriptions of the Enterprise, its cramped undersea style and raw edge technology compared to the Treks we are used to. <br /> <br /> I have not seen anything so interesting in this pilot. I found the plot complicated and confusing. I will admit that I really enjoyed the character development - the depictions of humans as a "teenage" species ready to overcome their problems were fun. <br /> <br /> And that Vulcan girl had an incredible rack. <br /> <br /> But I don't think he hooks me to this series. <br /> 3/10
