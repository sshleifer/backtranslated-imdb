For the past 10 years I have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling organizations, managed many professional wrestlers (including 2 Backyard Wrestling stars), worked on 2 different wrestling TV shows and made comments and comments for many wrestling DVDs. I have never witnessed the level of absolute amateur stupidity, lack of talent and skill and poor quality of the production found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. Also listing this as ANY type wrestling video is a real misuse of the term. Shot with low-cost video cameras, it is essentially a home video of children playing in the backyards. The sound quality is bad, the quality of the video is bad and the acting is horrendous. The "wrestlers" wear improvised costumes with t-shirts and ski masks drawn by hand and hit each other with a variety of objects and half-way imitate wrestling moves. Sometimes the "games" are on the grass. Sometimes on a trampoline in the back. EVERYONE is misinterpreted and executed with a shameless lack of wrestling skills. In short, don't worry about this stinker. If your interest in this DVD is entertainment or academic (in my case), you will be terribly disappointed.
