Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among that class of actors that I'm always interested in seeing, despite the reviews. I have always found Ms. Ryan a fascinating and captivating actress in almost all of her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always to watch. <br /> <br /> I say "almost" and "almost" largely because of this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, Meg Ryan doesn't play a nice character, she plays a whiner with a weak will that starts to get irritated shortly after the opening credits and doesn't give up until several days later. That said, the character of Kevin Kline is even more annoying and less funny. So, even if you normally like these two actors, I suggest you give this movie a try.
