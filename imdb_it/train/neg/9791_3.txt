Basically it is a couple that wants to adopt a second child. They meet a mouse (Stuart) at the adoption agency and decide to adopt it. If you think I'm stupid, keep it, because it's getting worse. <br /> <br /> Stuart arrives at his new home, where he is treated like a human child. (Save me!) The rest is more or less the usual cliché, on family problems, the jealousy of the older "brother", and in the end all the problems are solved and they are all a "happy family". Boring and boring like this, it is also shown in the most blunt and unsophisticated way. <br /> <br /> I don't know if the director believed he was creative by introducing a mouse to the cliché, or he was just trying to fill in the minutes, but he just updated the cliché from boring to repulsive. <br /> <br /> So why did I give a 3 and not a ZERO? Because of the family cat, who loves Stuart as much as the "brother". And because of some fun concerts, in which Stuart makes good use of its small size. <br /> <br /> Overall I think the film would work quite well if: a. Stuart was a PET and not a "brother". b. He had remained at entertaining concerts, like Stuart trying to outsmart the cat, and he had left boring and boring clicks that didn't even agree with anything else.
