This piece of dirt is practically impossible to follow. The sound is bad, the image quality goes from bad to worse than good to bad again! Things happen for no apparent reason why the characters appear and disappear. Did the director suffer from a severe brain injury during his production? <br /> <br /> Poor films aside, the story is vile only evil sh * t If you like rape, murder and self-harm this is your own alley. And if the simulated murder scenes are not enough you can enjoy the clips of real people being executed. I looked at almost everything but I had to go out after seeing someone's brain burned. Never before have I seen a film that made me feel so embarrassed and dirty.
