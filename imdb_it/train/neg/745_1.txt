I'm not really sure how to start describing how bad this movie is. I like bad movies, because they are often the most fun. I love bad special effects, bad acting, bad music and the wrong direction. With the exception of music (which was better than I expected), this film had all those qualities. <br /> <br /> The special effects were incredibly bad. The worst that I saw from my Nintendo 64. Some scenes to watch for include the Thunderchild, the mechanical foot-crushed woman, the Big Ben scene, the train wreck ... Wow, there are so many negative effects! On the other hand, however, SOME scenes of alien walkers are well done. <br /> <br /> The acting was the worst it could have been, having been based directly on the book by H.G. Wells. To have a good starting material, it's almost as if the actors were trying to be so exaggerated as to make it fun. And then there's the mustache ... the most distracting piece of facial hair I've seen in a long time. Of course, only half of the film contains acting. The rest are characters that revolve around aimless and poorly rendered strokes. <br /> <br /> To say that Timothy Hines is an inept director would be an injustice to incapable directors. With the use of different colored filters between the shots for no particular reason, the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even inside the scenes, the bad green projection, it's incredible for me how come this man has gotten approval to direct a film. I don't imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this ugly movie. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Good boy. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone planning to see this film is to do what I've done: have friends who love bad movies, drink, play poker while you watch it, keep drinking, and maybe you will do it all the way through. It's a bad movie, so have fun and laugh silly at this disaster.
