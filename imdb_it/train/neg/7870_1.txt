The original "les visiteurs" was original, exhilarating, interesting, balanced and almost perfect. LV2 must be a candidate for "The first worst sequel to a really good movie". In LV2 everyone continues to scream, when a gag doesn't work first, it is repeated 5 more times with a vague hope that it will eventually become fun. LV2 is a horrible parody of LV1, except of course that a parody should be inventive. If you loved LV1 you don't see this movie, look at LV1 again !!
