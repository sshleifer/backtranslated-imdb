This film was exactly what I expected it to be when I first read the casting. I could probably have written a more exciting storyline, it's a pity they left it to a bunch of howler monkeys. Alberto Tomba was certainly a good skier, but he must thank God (and us too) who must not rely on his acting skills to make a living. He can't play, he can't talk, he can't even move very well on land without his skis ... Michelle Hunziker is a beautiful blonde girl, and that's it. Obviously she was not chosen for her incredible competence in dramatic roles, but most likely for her beautiful legs. However I have to admit that he could be the Tomba acting teacher, because he is also a worse actor than her, and that's fun, especially considering it's not Italian. I laughed all the time, watching this movie. I found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it actually made me laugh, loud, very strong.
