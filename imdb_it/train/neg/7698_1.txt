Can I give this a negative rating? No? Well, let me say that this is the most atrocious film I've ever tried to see. It was painful. Boringus Maximus. The plot (?) Is well hidden in several sub-levels of nebulosity. I rented this movie with a friend and, after about thirty minutes of hoping it would improve, we decided to "take a step forward" a bit to see if things would have been better. Never gets better. This film about a guy who is kidnapped by these two girls, sounds interesting, but, actually, it's just a bore. Nothing ever remotely interesting ever happens. If you ever have the chance to look at this, do yourself a favor, try "PLAN NINE FROM THE EXTERNAL SPACE" instead.
