It seems obvious from this adaptation that he did not. Not only did he leave the plot behind, he invented his own! The things he chose to leave are so incredibly incredible that I was happy to have chosen to exclude some of the most important parts of the novel. The plot was confused, to say the least insubstantial and uncertain. I don't want to say anything distasteful to the actors, but they can't act! Dickens is difficult, of course, but it's pathetic! Micawber was nothing but a Kramer of the mid-nineteenth century, and the less one spoke of Betsy Trotwood, the better! If you want to see the real Copperfield, look at the wonderful BBC adaptation of 1999. As for the writer, I think he read Cliff's notes!
