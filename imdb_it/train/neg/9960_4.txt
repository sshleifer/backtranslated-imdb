MY BROTHER TOM <br /> <br /> Format: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> Following an episode of sexual abuse by a trusted person the neighbor, the young Jessica (Jenna Harrison), has an affair with a strange boy (Ben Whishaw) whom he meets in the woods. Unfortunately, Whishaw has secrets of his own, no less disturbing and much more dangerous ... <br /> <br /> Dour drama, triggered by the courageous performances of Harrison and Whishaw, in which two kindred spirits immerse themselves in a mutual love of nature after being traumatized by their experiences in the "real world". Unfortunately, their friendship is revealed as the harsh reality begins to intrude, leading to an inevitable tragedy. Directed by Dom Rotheroe and photographed in digital video format, the film appears uneven in some places (too many uncomfortable close-ups and dark movements of the hand-held camera) and takes a while to find its feet, but the dramatic pay-off is quietly rewarding.
