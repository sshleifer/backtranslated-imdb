Yes, the only thing that this film is memorable for is that he starred in a very young Tom Hanks who would be a major star in Hollywood only a few years later. But here it is not a film that is about to show its talents and the only other thing that could be considered a bit funny for this film is the scene in which it thinks of seeing a monster and managing a boy. Yes, this film is about the evils of a game that makes a group of people use their imagination and try to create interesting scenarios. Basically, a special type of after-school care for the evils of the Dungeons and Dragons game cleverly titled as Mazes and Monsters. Apparently, the creators of this film thought that nerds should not have fun in any way unless they came out and were underage drinking, taking drugs, having unprotected sex and harassing weaker children like all popular kids did. No, these bad people were playing a game that actually required brain use, no paradise! Not that, if they have a brain, they might actually be able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by some groups out there. Yes, I think this film is absolutely stupid and a waste of time. Of course, it could be an anti-addiction movie, but there are far fewer people who have died taking Dungeons and Dragons throughout its entire existence than saying what drunk driving claims in a month.
