This film should be nominated for a new genre: Complete Mess! Except for a few laughs and one or two scenes of cold blood, this film is a complete waste of time. Calling him "Campy" doesn't even cut it. "Campy" implies fun that this film was not. Spend the first half of the movie thinking "It should improve, right?" In all honesty, in the end, when he finally explained who the "brother / sister" team is and what they want, but then you don't care anymore because you spent the entire second part of the film asking me exactly what Mr. Honored and Mrs. Pacula have wronged someone out of THIS to be stuck in such a horrible movie. <br /> <br />
