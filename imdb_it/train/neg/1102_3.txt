First of all, I have to admit that I saw both films from this director without titles and therefore may have missed the points. My Czech is not bad but, after seeing two of his films, I wish I hadn't even tried to learn. Samotari is too beautiful. Too good. There are about ten different textures that intertwine inside and out. It is not so unusual in a city the size of Prague (tiny, really.) The main characters are between 20 and 30 years old. They have a job and just a studio. The best character is the young Balkan girl. His feelings are echoed by immigrants here every damn day. That's all. The only great character. Everyone else is making their own hellish life on their own. How can I sympathize with an obvious incompetence? Maybe there are interesting pieces with Japanese tourists, but do I need another stereotype in the film? If you like music, watch this movie. If you want to laugh at other people's stupidity, watch this movie. If you like dry irony and humor, see an original Jarmusch not an imitation. And under no circumstances do you see Ondricek's film, Septej (Whisper.) Unless you like homophobic stereotypes.
