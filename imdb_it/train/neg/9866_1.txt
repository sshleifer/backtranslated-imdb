Want to see the movie "THE Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions. This is not that movie. This movie is not funny. It is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> All the good comments here seem to be written by false third parties (poorly disguised). The people who made this film seem to be trying to summarize the fake interest. <br /> <br /> This film is not a well done mockumentary. Comparisons with "Spinal Tap" or Christopher Guest are offensive. <br /> <br /> The film is so petty that I can't imagine anyone familiar with the subject finding it funny. Being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality, but if you are the one who is returned in this way, you should hate yourself for enjoying it. <br /> <br /> The film is not offensive because of its great satire of taboo subjects but because of its constant pathetic banality.
