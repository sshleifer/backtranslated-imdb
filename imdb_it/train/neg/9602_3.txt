Daniella has some production problems under her attractive appearance. He begins to lose his head when he discovers a distant relative (who looks like him) who was burned to be a werewolf. She gets a little wild when she gets the horny men out and breaks her throat. In the end he finds a man who helps contain his inner beast, but when others ruin their happiness, he extracts his violent and false revenge. <br /> <br /> 'Werewolf Woman' is not a goof film but stands as a good public film. You could have a fun time playing bad acting / dubbing / translation and the simple simplicity of production. But alone, it moves slowly but has a large nudity to keep you awake.
