Watching "Speak Easily" is painful for Buster Keaton fans. Seeing a writer, an actor, a comedian, a director and a phenomenal stunt subjected to this humiliating spectacle is like seeing a Picasso used as a drop of cloth, or perhaps more like seeing the most refined Camembert adulterated with whey and turned into Cheez-Whiz. <br /> <br /> Keaton is battered as a Professor Post, whose exaggerated vocabulary is the only thing that prevents him from saying: "Tell me about rabbits, George". (Post would have said something like, "Kindly inform me about the status of the small mammals of the Leporidae family of the order Lagomorpha, kind sir, which I think is mainly dealt with the epithet 'George'.") When Keaton created his own characters, they could be somehow clueless but they weren't stupid. They were quick studies and became masters of their worlds. Not so with Post, who never stops tripping and mumbling and who no longer has control over his fate as a Titanic bilge rat. And while Keaton's original characters had an enchanting naivety and innocence, Post runs into such a profound sexual delay that if he ever became physically aroused, he would put an ice bag on the swelling and seek medical help. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of small moments of salvation, such as Keaton's attempts to get rid of the vampire Thema Todd or his suggestion as appropriate clothing for a Greek dance, but it's not worth enduring the whole movies to see them. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of bad movies, get drunk and watch "Speak Easily" with friends at the "Mystery Science Theater 3000". But apart from that, follow the silent ones. Let them be 100% of what Buster Keaton is remembered for.
