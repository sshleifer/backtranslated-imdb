Forbidden Siren is based on the Siren 2 Playstation 2 game (so many 2). Like most video games turned into films, I would say that most do not translate into a very different medium. And this also applies to this, painfully. <br /> <br /> There is a rather long prologue that explains and fixes the premise for the story, and the mysterious island on which a writer (Leo Morimoto) and his sons, daughter Yuki (Yui Ichikawa) and the son Hideo (Jun Nishiyama) arrive to move. The villagers don't seem too friendly, and soon enough, good advice is given on the mermaid on the island, to stay at home once the siren begins to howl. <br /> <br /> Naturally and slowly, things start to go wrong, and our brothers go on a mission beating around the bush to find out exactly what is happening on this hostile island with its strange inhabitants. But in truth, you won't worry about what's going on, while folklore and fairy tales are thrown to twist the plot even more. What he was really pushing into the realm of bad comedy are his involuntarily cursed, out-of-the-ordinary moments that have just given rise to pitiful giggles over his sheer stupidity, until it's explained much later. It is one thing to try to present yourself and present something intelligent, but it is another thing to do it convincingly and with loopholes. <br /> <br /> Despite having a clock in less than 90 minutes, I think it's a horror movie phenomenon to have a runtime benchmark - it gives that almost two-hour feeling with its slow build to tell what it wants. Things start to rise in the last 20 minutes, but it's a classic case of too little time. <br /> <br /> What saves the film is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end. Once again this is a common device used to try to elevate a seemingly simple horror film into something a little extra in the hope of amusing an audience. It turned out to be quite satisfying, but leaves a bad aftertaste as you will feel cheated in some way. There are two ways a turnaround will make you feel - or raise the movie to a memorable level, or give you that hockey feeling. Unfortunately the forbidden siren belonged more to the latter. <br /> <br /> Saving grace will be his cinematography with his use of lights, shadows and mirrors, but I'll be explicit - it's not worth the time yet, so better to avoid this.
