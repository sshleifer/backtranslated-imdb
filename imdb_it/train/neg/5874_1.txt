one of the worst movies I've seen to date. Even the pathetic action scene and bad acting don't help. The only positive aspect is the parts of Gary busey, but this does not solve the problem. survives its B movie rankings and passes the test with flying colors. A waste of my money, although I found it fun to start with its becoming annoying after some watches. I don't recommend this movie unless you watch it for free or it's a gift. (a gift you can ask for the receipt and send it back for a full refund). <br /> <br /> Really BAd. <br /> <br /> 1/10.
