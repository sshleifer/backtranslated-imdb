Absolutely nothing happens in this sloooow thriller, annoying and emotionless directed by Amenabar's usual collaborator, Mateo Gil. The film, which somehow deals with the effect of boredom and the search for thrills, does not actually offer it and seems an exercise in boredom. The only slightly suspicious moment is the climax of the film, which takes about 30 seconds of the entire agonizing more than 100 minutes and is resolved too simply. The plot lacks sophistication or credibility, and while the idea is original, the way the plot unfolds is arbitrary and every device or twist is the result of external interference (deus-ex-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to show any initiative or initiative. If you're a fan of the genre, look at "Tesis" instead.
