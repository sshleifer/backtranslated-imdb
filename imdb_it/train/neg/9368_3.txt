Oh an actress once vaguely famous in a movie where she plays a mother with a child. It is shown on BBC 1 at half past midnight, I wonder if ... it's a TVM <br /> You had to deliver it to TVM producers, not content with making a mediocre film, they usually give us two mediocre films in which two themes they are mixed together and NOWHERE TO HIDE is no different. The first theme is a woman in danger, the theme of the cross is pollinated by a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme, which means that we have a heroine scene that survived a murder attempt followed by a scene in which his son Sam asks why he divorced? And being a TVM, he replies that the reason is "That people change" rather than say something like "I'm a real slave" or "Your dad takes a bath for sex" as happens in real life divorce cases . It's the young Sam, I'm sorry, not only his parents divorced, but they are two short pairs. Actually, since he is so stupid, he does not deserve understanding, because he is not aware that a man blushes something The toilet is a drug dealer, unaware of the fact that you could die if someone shoots you, and unaware that I LOVE LUCY is painfully unpleasant. If only our childhood was so innocent, well, as Orwell said "Ignorance is strength." Sam is suddenly an expert on marine life! Is it the development of this character or a poor script? I know what my money is. It is strange that Sam the boy did not notice that if the story is set in 1994, then why do people often wear clothes, drive cars and drive trains from the 50s? But as it turns out during a twist is the mother who is the dummy. Then there's a final twist that made me feel like an idiot for watching this
