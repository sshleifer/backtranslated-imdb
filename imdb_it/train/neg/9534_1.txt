I'm a fan of previous Best of the Best movies. But this was horrible. No wonder I had such a hard time finding it. I tried 4 video rental stores, until I found one with a copy of this movie. The acting was terrible, the plot was a joke and even the action was ugly. I really miss Alex Grady, Travis Brigley and the characters and the original kickboxing theme that this film had with the first 2 movie. <br /> <br /> John
