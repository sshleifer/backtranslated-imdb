Adapting theatrical works to the cinema is often a bad idea because they are two different means. Do you think it's a good idea to make ZULU a theater game? Imagine where two worthy red jackets sit in an open-mouth tent "Blimey there are thousands out there". A fantastic film and a bad script <br /> <br /> To make a theater show become a big cinema there are two essential elements needed br /> <br /> 1) A refined cast that creates on the chemical screen < br /> <br /> 2) Great dialogue <br /> <br /> On paper Cher and Chazz Palminterri would be a good choice of casting but not in these roles. The story revolves around a hit man played by Palminterri who breaks into a house to kill a wife played by Cher with most of the action taking place inside the house. I haven't been able to take these two characters seriously, although maybe it was the script that can't decide if it's trying to be serious or funny. Since the plot is very static it is of utmost importance that the dialogue shines and once again due to the bizarre tone of the script embarrasses more than anything else with much of the conversation revolving around sexual acts. if you want to see a large translation of a theater show transferred to the silver screen, you miss FEDELE and watch 12 ANGRY MEN instead
