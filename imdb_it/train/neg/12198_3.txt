Growing up with the Beast Wars transformers, I wasn't very familiar with the original Transformers, and now that I've seen the fantastic movie, and now that I've seen the old cartoon it's based on, I have to say I like original cartoon and more action movie live than Beast Wars. <br /> <br /> It's not like I don't like BW characters, I just think that characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> I mean, "AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT!" looks a lot better than "MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE!" The voice of the original Optimus Prime continues to convince me that he is a true commander, rather than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Powermaster Optimus Prime is much more powerful than Optimus Optimus. Just look on the web! <br /> <br /> Megatron in the BW character looked more like a humorous version of the most evil version of him in the original series. <br /> <br /> Besides what is more interesting, do robots turn into animals or do robots change into vehicles and spaceships? Give me the original Transformers every day on Beast Wars!
