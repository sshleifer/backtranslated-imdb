The plot of "Edison" was decent, but one actor in particular ruined the entire film. Justin Timberlake ruined the film with every sentence he uttered during the film. It is by far one of the worst actors I've ever seen and should face the same fate as the entire F.R.A.T. team. <br /> <br /> Whether it was an emotional scene, an action scene or even a silent scene, Justin Timberlake managed to ruin it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time watching this movie. Don't even worry about downloading it, middle porn would be a much better choice. <br /> <br /> And Justin, if you're reading this, keep the music. Even if you're not good at it, you've done a great job getting people to think you can really sing.
