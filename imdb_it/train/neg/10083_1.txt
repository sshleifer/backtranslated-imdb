They changed the title of this atrocity in Unexpected love. The only thing worse is the film itself. The script contains dialogues that could be mocked by a third-grade recital. At one point, when his wife leaves her husband, a bad cover of All by Myself reproduces the soundtrack! I'm not kidding. The actors try but are defeated by an inept writing, incredibly terrible. The direction is incredibly bad. No wonder life has a bad reputation. How to do things like this. I'm turning off the television before it's over!
