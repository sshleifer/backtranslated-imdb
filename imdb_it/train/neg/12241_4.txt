This is one of the few episodes (if not the only one) with an indisputable error in the narrative. During Ralphie's handling of the situation, Christopher claims to have heard of Pie-O-My's death in the incident. This is an important detail because in this context it is quite obvious that Christopher knows from the beginning that Tony is the one who must have killed Ralphie. However, there is no way that Chris could have heard of the incident. Who should have told him and when? The moment he is pulled from his delirium by Tony's call, no one else has been informed. Tony knows, which makes it even worse! Listening to Christopher talking about the death of Pie-O-My could therefore only lead Tony to the conclusion that Chris himself set fire to it. Given the extraordinarily elaborate writing process, as told by the authors themselves on the DVD, I really wonder that none of them understood the problem. The story does not work that way. No need to add that I am a big fan of sopranos. Otherwise, I certainly wouldn't care.
