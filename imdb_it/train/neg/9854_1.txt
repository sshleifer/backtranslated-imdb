This documentary (or should I say mockumentary) is the perfect example of how ridiculous people can be when they have full enthusiasm for something like this. Honestly, I hate cryptozoology. It is unconsciousness, it destroys it. However, something positive in this was the visual effects (the dragons were beautiful), but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally false, and this is really disappointing because it came from scientists, so this is why it deserves a 1 of 10 and not 0. An example of false information would be the idea of ​​hydrogen: it is true that, according to Chemystry, hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to produce in those proportions, so in that case, you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon's stomach. There are many substances with hydrogen in nature but not necessary to make an animal like that fly, and hydrogen does not appear from nothing, so it is impossible. However, there is actually something worse, the idea of ​​platinum: this element is more difficult to find than gold, and I cannot explain to myself how dragons survive depending on it. It's ridiculous, they present dragons as creatures with little chance of conquering planet Earth, but at least that clearly explains why they became extinct. Cryptographers are probably scientists, but they are not. People like them tell lies like this mockumentary, and what's worse, some people buy them. But I don't think a person who cares about science can believe in dragons after seeing this. Those false scientists waste their time.
