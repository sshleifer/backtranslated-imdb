Kubrick meets the king. It looked so promising in the spring of 1980, I remember. Then the film was released, and since then Kubrick's cultists have been arguing with the king's cultists. King's cultists claim that Stanley Kubrick took a great horror story and ruined it. Kubrick's cultists don't give a damn about King's story. They talk about Steadicam, tracking shots, shots. This is a film, they insist: it should be considered alone. As it happens, both fields are correct. Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> If we consider it purely as an adaptation of King's novel, "The Shining" is really a failure, a missed opportunity, a series of evil narrative gambits. <br /> <br /> I used to blame Kubrick's scriptwriter. The writer Diane Johnson (author of Le nozze, L'Affaire, Le Divorce, etc.) has a reputation as a writer of social customs. Perhaps it was chosen for its subtle understanding of marital relationships or family dynamics. But the small working-class town of Sidewinder, Colorado, does not exist on any map in its francophile universe. <br /> <br /> Kubrick the Anglophile probably found it congenial anyway. He is obviously the real author. And considered in his merits, his script of "The Shining" - with its mixture of abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernaturalism and implicit reincarnation - does not simply hold up to logical analysis. <br /> <br /> I am willing to consider Kubrick's "Shining" on his terms. I'm even willing to take it as something different from a conventional horror genre movie. But even a naturalistic study of isolation, alienation and madness fails. Analyzed in both cases, the film practically breaks. <br /> <br /> Are the horrors of Overlook Hotel real? Or do they exist only in the mind - first as the foreboding nightmares suffered by little Danny Torrance, then as the hallucinations of his father? It is noted that every time Jack Torrance is seen talking to a "ghost", he is actually looking into a mirror. One notices how the hotel's topiary hedge maze symbolizes the stunted and twisted psyche of Jack. Really profound things. <br /> <br /> But if indeed the "ghosts" of Overlook are purely manifestations of Jack Torrance's growing madness, then who exactly does Jack get out of the hotel kitchen walk-in closet, so that he can go on with his unbridled obsession with the ascents? <br /> <br /> E EVERYTHING can explain, with a straight face, that black-and-white photograph (usefully labeled "1921") by Nicholson as a tuxedo party -Do you jump out of the left field and onto the wall of a hotel-ballroom during the closing seconds of the film? Should we seriously conclude that Jack Torrance's Bad Craziness derives from a sort of "past life" experience? (And if I swallow it, since when do people reincarnate, should they be the exact physical replicas of their past selves?) <br /> <br /> Maybe Kubrick didn't care about his plot. Maybe he just wanted to conjure up a state of horror. In any case, the film tries to cover his narrative bets - to have both rational and supernatural. As a result, the plot is a disaster. This film has not improved with age, and certainly does not improve with repeated views. <br /> <br /> I do not deny that some moments of fear, claustrophobia and general creepiness are scattered all this time, long film. But those immortal blood lifts, seen several times in Danny's little visions, are absurd and laughable. And the notorious Jack Torrance tag line ("Wendy, I'm home!" And "Heeeeeere's JOHNNY!") Simply pierce the dramatic tension of the film and dissipate its narrative energy. (I know: I sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh with a comic relief: "Wow! I'm glad we don't have to take this stuff seriously!") Finally, Kubrick is completely at sea - or otherwise completely cynical - during those scenes in which Wendy wanders the empty hotel while her husband tries to purify their son. An atrium full of mummified guests, all sitting there dead in their party hats? Yikes, I'm really scared now. <br /> <br /> Given the splendor of Jack Nicholson over the years, one can only assume that he only gave the kind of winking performance that rolls, rippling his eyebrows, chewing-scenery that the sought-after director. Shelley Duvall's performance, as a sort of female version of Don Knotts in "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken," is best passed in silence. <br /> <br /> This film simply does not succeed - not as an adaptation, not on its terms. It probably deserves a 3 out of 10, but I give it a 1 because it was so overwhelmingly overrated in this forum.
