Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good couple that portray very different siblings, but only Winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role. Leigh, who plays Sadie Flood, lead singer of bartenders and alcoholics, constantly leans on her older sister Georgia, an acclaimed folk singer in the Joni Mitchell mold. Perhaps because of his double duties as co-producer of the film, Leigh seems to have boxed himself in a corner: he is not credible as a singer and, even if this is intentional, he allows himself too much time on the microphone screen. Probably hoping for a tour-de-force, Leigh has the nervous and jagged barbed wire; however, we simply don't see any talent within this character (Leigh is obviously a solid actress, but makes the decisions here that takes us away from her). If Sadie also had a minimum of charisma or charm, we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the (small) breaks she does. As it is, the probability of her getting up on stage is slim. The director Ulu Grosbard elaborates some intense dramatic sequences, and the final montage juxtaposes the performance of Sadie's bar with the spectacle of the sold-out arena of Georgia - both sing the same song - and it's a sadly nuanced moment ... actually, what's the point? * 1/2 from ****
