This must be the cheapest movie made in the 21st century. It's all low quality, but eventually it falls under ... everything. All the cheap tricks - such as flashing and darkness - are used to hide those nasty computer effects. <br /> <br /> All the actors are below average, especially the main character Anne Fletcher (Simmone Mackinnon). There is a scene in which Anne is asked: "Why do you look so negligent?" The correct answer is, because she cannot act. No matter what happens (the world is about to be destroyed, her friend is dying, she is fired), she has the same stupid smile on her face. <br /> <br /> It's not just the movie, which is B-quality. It is also the description of the back cover (at least in Finland). The text mentions things like Lorica Gray -vessel, Capital -vessel and the main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anne) Fletcher. The description looks like a different film, both with characters called Fletcher and sea monsters
