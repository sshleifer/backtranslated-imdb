Hunting. A remake, of course. The original was a gruesome psychological thriller, and one that has improved over time. Compared to the 1999 remake, it is a classic. There is no character development here, only caricatures (the slut, the authoritative brain, the "I'm will get outta here" mate, the oh so sensitive library mouse). But, since the way in which they were relying on special effects is the "star", I imagine that the characters you can tune into are a secondary concern. Unfortunately, the effects are ridiculous. Wives of cherubs, elastic doors, dead and irritating children who do not know how to speak clearly ... and an idiotic and saccharine ending that really hurts you a new age of butterflies and rainbows. Ill take my Skittles orally, thanks. Bruce Dern, I liked you from "The Cowboys". Stop that.
