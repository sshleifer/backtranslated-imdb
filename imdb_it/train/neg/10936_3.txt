I really wanted this movie. He has excellent actors but eventually falls to the ground. He tries too hard to be funny in some places (the most zealous daughters trying to cook), in addition to reaching in others (the scene in which they clean someone's backyard, so he agrees to join the team) and has some scenes that, although slightly interesting, they are really just fillers (all the work scenes). And I didn't find the "villains" intimidating, or worth hating, as much as I found them childishly annoying. <br /> <br /> I met people like those in the movie while I was playing in the church. And I will say that the referees are pointed at, however, in the end, I did not care much about the characters, or their search for the glory of the church. Perhaps because they were all so one-dimensional, which I wouldn't have minded if the movie was more fun or seemed to run a little more smoothly overall. <br /> <br /> Kurt Hale and Halestorm Entertainment have made some good movies, but this is not one of them.
