Valentine is a horrible movie. This is what I thought: <br /> <br /> Acting: Very bad. Katherine Heigl cannot act. The others were not much better. <br /> <br /> History: the story was fine, but it could have been more developed. This film has the potential to be a great movie, but it didn't go well. <br /> <br /> Music: Yes, part of the music was quite nice. <br /> <br /> Originality: Not very original. The name "Paige Prescott" Do you recognize Prescott? <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Do not see Valentine. It's a really stupid movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br />
