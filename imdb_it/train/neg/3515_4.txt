Basically a typical propaganda film for the last good war. But there were a couple of things that struck me. The first was the use of epithets with lips. In two cases Scott's character gasps one, once in the beginning when his bomb falls off target during the bombing ("damnation") and once when he is trying to swing a bomber into a pilot ("s *% t "). I could be wrong about the second instance, but I repeated it several times and this is what it seems to me. The third case is when the character of Anne Shirley greets O'Brien's character and wishes good luck ("Give him hell") on the roar of the engines. He must have thought it was too little feminine because he clearly says "heck". I also found interesting the character who has moral problems with the bombing, in particular by bombing civilians. The falconer top officer assures him that only military targets will be hit because of the accuracy of the sight used. Given what we know of LeMay's next strategy of igniting Japanese cities into oblivion, this scene plays with not a little irony. I remember McMaram's quote on LeMay in "The Fog of War", which means that if the United States didn't win the conflict it would be tried as a war criminal. The ending is exaggerated, in line with the film. It reminded me a little of the end of White Heat (I'm not comparing the films, just the ending!). Maybe it's just because it's blown up. Blown up really well !!!
