I have yet to read a negative professional review of this film. I think I lost something. The beginning is intriguing, the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain one another with invented stories. This is the best part. After the three have separated, the film splits into three wires. That's when boredom comes. Certainly, the thread with Fukushka babushkas that make dolls with chewed bread is initially an eye that opens curiosity. Unfortunately, the director has beaten this to death, even injecting a wild plot that leads nowhere in particular. Conclusion: a two-hour listlessness without plot. If you suffer from insomnia, look at him in bed and you will sleep well at night.
