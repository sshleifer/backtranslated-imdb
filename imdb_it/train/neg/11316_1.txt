Knights was just the beginning of a series, a pilot, one might say. The plot (I shouldn't really call it that, there was no plot) wasn't logical at all and there were many mistakes, like [warning, I'm summarizing the plot]: <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film someone said that there were only a couple of those cyborgs (the bad guys), but after the climax, Nea discovered that there were many more left. And it was said that the cyborgs were hard to kill, but after a month of training, Nea could kill them with one shot. <br /> <br /> The film was simply pure. Not surprising at all, when I discovered that the main star was a kick boxer. <br /> <br /> There was ANOTHER positive thing throughout the film: it really made a big laugh when I looked at it and talked to my friends about it. I recommend watching it, if you need to laugh.
