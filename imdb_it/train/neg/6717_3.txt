This was terrible. History was everywhere and very often I was confused because of a horrible assembly. I didn't like anyone because their characters weren't developed enough. They were extremely superficial people without dimension. Cheese stereotypes, cheese with subplots that went nowhere. The stripper girl was just a distraction, even though she was decent. I don't know what he's trying to be, but how shocked were I when they showed this garbage at Sundance? I almost canceled my subscription. You would think that such a channel would show more quality movies. There are many, much better gay and lesbian themed movies out there. "The Celluloid Closet" is an excellent documentary. I really liked "Wigstock: The Movie". I'm sure there are others that have slipped my mind right now, but what I'm trying to say is that it really wasn't worth it. If you take it on TV, ok, but don't worry about the rest. <br /> <br /> There were maybe three or four shots that looked really nice (I consider them sad on one side), otherwise the photograph was pretty crappy as well. Lighting was far away in many places. I think some of the effects were used to try to add something that had virtually nothing to do. <br /> <br /> I can't deny that Johnny Rebel is pretty hot (without blonde hair, of course). Too bad his acting didn't do anything for me. Attack with real porn, man. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
