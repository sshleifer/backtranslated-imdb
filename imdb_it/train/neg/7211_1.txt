I grew up watching Inspector Gadget. It was, and still is, one of my favorite cartoons, if not my absolute favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history from the Inspector Gadget's Field Trip spin-off. I wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective of all time. <br /> <br /> But the film ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon. <br /> <br /> Matthew Broderick, an actor with potential, was definitely NOT the role of an Inspector Gadget. First, in the film, the Inspector Gadget is smart. Not so in the cardboard. In the film, Gadget solves the mystery mainly by itself. In the comic, it was almost always Penny, Brain, and the fantastic book (I still want his book!). If Gadget solved the mystery, it was by chance. Gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective, but in the cartoon he was rather stupid, where humor came from. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that it is too "Good Guy v. Bad Guy" in the film. It's not just meant to be a stupid Saturday morning cartoon. Furthermore, Gadget should never have a love story, but the Disney Corporation is full of idiots. <br /> <br /> I also miss the real gadgets that Gadget had, and in particular the gadget car. In the film it was a chic convertible. It was a police car in the carton and could turn into a van. He also barely had a few gadgets and was mainly there to take him from one place to another. <br /> <br /> But if anything, the only thing that was terrible about the movie was that it was a feature film. Inspector Gadget was a stupid Saturday morning cartoon. The film was too serious, too exaggerated, it had too much plot and it wasn't even funny. <br /> <br /> Tip for those who haven't seen it: NEVER see it. NEVER. Look at the cartoon, it's a real classic.
