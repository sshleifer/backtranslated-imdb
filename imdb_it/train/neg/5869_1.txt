Almost 30 years have passed and I continue to hate anyone involved in this film. It remains the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Before seeing him, I never worried about Rivers, in one way or another. After watching this movie, I have an allergic reaction when I accidentally see it on television. <br /> <br /> I got carried away by this - against my best judgment - by peer pressure. However, leaving the theater, those friends have sworn never to restart my choice of film. Almost thirty years later, we still carry mental scars from this film. <br /> <br /> On my deathbed, one of my regrets will be the time I wasted hoping that this movie could improve. It has never been like this. <br /> <br /> If you've ever been given a choice, you'd rather put your eyes on watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I registered for IMDb comments only in the hope that maybe I can warn others against watching this movie. If I can only save one person from looking at this, then my existence on this earth will have been justified.
