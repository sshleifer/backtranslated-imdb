This relic of a short film begins with a teenager who is going through the process of trying to get a driving license. Quickly become distracted by almost every conceivable topic related to cars. <br /> <br /> Things like dune buggies, drag racing, custom paint jobs and car shows are discussed. He often tries to be funny but instead the film is boring, pulled out and even sexist at times. None of the people in the film are really listened to. Instead, everything is done in the narrative and in the voiceovers. Sorry, but I can't stand it. <br /> <br /> There is nothing educational or interesting about "Dad, can I borrow the car?" It's just another piece of unreasonable filler to occupy the time of their television program "Wonderful World Of Disney". 1/10
