When I finally had the opportunity to see Zombie 3 (Zombie Flesheaters 2 in Europe) on a Japanese DVD from the imported region 2, I was amazed by the enthusiasm of this zombie epic. The transfer is almost immaculate, good as always will go to seek unless Anchor Bay holds it in hand. The blood is really exceptional and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx. The sound is also fantastic. It is only 2 dolby channels but if you have a receiver with Dolby Prologic 2, you can really appreciate the cheesy music (actually a very good score) and the effective sound effects even if inexpensive. It has never looked so good, and the excellent transfer is added to the general fun. <br /> <br /> I never understood how much blood flows in this film, it is extremely brutal with exploding head shots, exploding pimps filled with mega, a cleaver at the throat of a zombie, a burned woman's limb ( how come he did not burn the boy), intestinal munching, zombie children and much more lost track. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly for action fans of the Zombies, especially for the Italian genre. There are some excellent set sets and cinematography, I think people don't give them enough credit, if you see a clean print, and not a horrible pirate copy, it's a completely different experience. <br /> <br /> This film never gives up for a second, and I realize it's inconsistent, dubbing is horrible, acting is rigid, and the sense of irreverence is celebrated in style, but that's part of it of its charm. <br /> <br /> For me this is one of the best horror films ever made, you can't make a film so bad, so good, on purpose. He is an accidental genius of the highest level. If they played it for laughter it would have been a disaster, but they sounded straight as an arrow and the result is a terrifying cult classic that is a thumb to all and all traditional film standards. <br /> <br /> Tons of action sequences, exotic venues, excellent scenography, good, sometimes greedy for the cinematography, the wonderfully cheap acting, the incoherent but still interesting plot, the fantastic make-up effects, the beautiful women who know how to throw kicks, excellent music and sometimes hilarious, sometimes gruesome, but always funny zombies. How can you go wrong with this movie? has everything, a cult classic that stands the test of time.
