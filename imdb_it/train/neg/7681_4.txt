Sean, you know I think you're absolutely the greatest actor in the world, but I can't praise you for that. Comedy is not your strong seed. <br /> <br /> However, it wasn't all your fault. Some of the things were too difficult to understand. Alfred Lynch did a decent job, but you have to ask yourself where the lines started from. <br /> <br /> Once again, Sean ... I apologize.
