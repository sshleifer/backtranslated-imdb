Surprisingly, the film has some qualities of redemption when it moves towards its end. For the other part, this film is really ugly and lame, with a limited budget, an insultingly ugly script and everything that goes with it. <br /> <br /> It is foolish that with all the money going around in the Christian circles they never seem to have enough funds to make a decent movie with. I'm not a religious, so I couldn't care less, but making films is a good tool to reach new audiences for churches and make people more interested and curious about reading the Bible, for example. In this regard, these films always seem a wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> The low budget really hurts the film and lowers it. It makes the film ridiculous to look at with its effects and gives the film in general a b-movie campy feeling. <br /> <br /> But what hurts the most in this film is his writing. The things that happen in this film are simply offensive to the intelligence and therefore I don't even complain and I don't talk about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the film proceeds is so unlikely and the people in this film do such highly unlikely things to insult its viewers. I also hated how the movie was like a soap opera sometimes. It seemed to me that they simply struggled to turn it into a full-length movie and added some dramatic characters and developments just to fill things up. Sometimes I really couldn't care less. <br /> <br /> It must still be said that the film becomes more solid and steady towards its end, when its story focuses more on its essence. It remains predictable however, but prevented this film from being a complete wreck to watch and as far as this type of film is concerned, there are many worse ones to watch out for, although I don't think this movie will win new souls. <br /> <br /> 4/10
