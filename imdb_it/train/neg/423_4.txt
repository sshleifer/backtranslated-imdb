I don't know why, but after all the hype about NPR I thought it was a new movie ..... all the best footage was used for the BBC documents and the NatGeo projects you saw if you're interested in nature's programs. .. has been repackaged with a cheesy narrative and music too dramatic for Disney to take advantage of Earth Day - there are great moments, and it's always nice to hear Darth Vader ....... oops, .. ..... .... James Earl Jones speaks, but I had hoped for a revolutionary film, considering the new photographic technology used in the making of this film ...... has been sterilized for a minor public, so it is possible to watch better movies for free youtube .... I feel we are due for something as revolutionary as Koyannisquatsi (sic) and this film certainly is not
