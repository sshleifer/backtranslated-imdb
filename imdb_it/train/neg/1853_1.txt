This film, no correction, this COSA, this abominable abomination from the burns of hell should have been killed before it even left the writer's head. I could never come up with enough adjectives to describe this film. But let's try the same. Horrible, bad, nauseating, tasteless, disgusting, inducing vomiting, ugly gut, horrible, bad, putrid, there aren't enough words in English! The "plot" involves a serial killer who becomes a snowman. Don't ask how, not important. The killer snowman runs to kill people. As you can ask, can a snowman kill someone? In the tasteless ways that make you want to take your eyes off if only you don't have to put up with that polystyrene snowman. In ways that make you want to fill your ears with hot wax so you don't have to put up with your snow games anymore. Don't watch this movie! Destroy it on sight! Don't look at it for the sake of your own soul!
