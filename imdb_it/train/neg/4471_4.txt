The best I can say about this movie is that sometimes it was slightly fun, and that it was a proper time killer. Unfortunately, this film is also so annoying that I wanted to slap these characters. This is the kind of film that is so sweet, it hurts your teeth. The intentions were good, I suppose, but things get terribly boring when the dialogue is SO nauseating. When the two protagonists are not together on the screen, this is not bad at all, but be afraid during those frequent moments when the loving couple starts talking to each other.
