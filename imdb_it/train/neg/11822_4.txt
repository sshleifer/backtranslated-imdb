I thought that Harvey Keitel, a young, fresh of the Sex Pistols John Lydon, then as a bonus, the music of Ennio Morricone. I was expecting an old-school, very aggressive detective thriller, made in America. Istead, I had a story of misery that never made sense and a film that let me say: WTF !!! Too many questions without answers and insufficient action. The result: a potential cult cult was thrown into the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work well together, so maybe Quentin Tarantino can bring these guys together with a better script. Oh, and the Morricone score: OK, but not memorable. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a waste of time, but not a "must see", unless you're a Keitel hardcore fan.
