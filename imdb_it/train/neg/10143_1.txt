FLIGHT OF FURY takes the place of being the worst Steven Seagal movie I've ever seen ... Until now. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible bore with no action scenes of any interest, Seagal isn't really trying into this - it's fat and his voice is doubled again. <br /> <br /> The co-stars are no better, being a rather unpleasant load of 3 raters. <br /> <br /> The Direction Keusch is very poor and it is not surprising that he is also responsible for another pair of stinking Seagals (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE). The script written by Seagal himself is ridiculously inept. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb $ 12M have been spent on this boring load of old tosh - If these figures are correct, I perceive a large violation of taxes as was never spent on this amount. <br /> <br /> FLIGHT OF FURY is actually a hit for the shooting remake of the film Michael Dudikoff BLACK THUNDER - which must be better than this tripe. <br /> <br /> This has NO ransom quality, give it a MISS! 1/2 * on *****
