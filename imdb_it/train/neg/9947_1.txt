This film was horrible. I swear they didn't even write a script, they just broke it for the whole movie. Ice-T was annoying as hell. * SPOILERS Phht more as reasons not to watch it * They sit and have breakfast for 20 minutes. could have been long gone. The terrain was difficult it would have been almost impossible to trace it with the dogs outside. And when ICE-T is on that hill and uses the Spaz-15 Assault SHOTGUN as if it were a sniper rifle (and then shoots down a tree with eight bullets? It would take 1000 shells to knock down a tree of that size.) pump and hand guns are considered inaccurate at 100 yards. And they even saw the reflection. What did the light reflect? I didn't see a purpose on that thing. Even when he was hit in the stomach and kept going, that was delayed that he would have bled to death right there. Plus The ending where a stone or a cigarette is inserted into the boys' barrel. He would not have exploded and killed. The bullet would continue to fire, killing Ice T but ruining the barrel.
