To be as honest as possible, The Devil's Plaything (or Veil of Blood or Vampire Ecstasy or The Curse of the Black Sisters or ????) is really boring. Does the film have a good premise behind it? the resurrection of a long dead vampire through the body of a descendant through the help and assistance of a group of women dressed in black ?? but the execution is horrible. There are big, long moments of screen time when nothing literally happens. The characters simply have nothing to do. There is no mystery, no suspense, and no point of the plot to worry about. The acting is simply abysmal. Most of the acting involves a group of below-average-looking women dancing naked while staring at the camera. They do it repeatedly. And what little plot seems to be designed to get more of these naked women than attractive so they can join the dance. While it is not as ugly or useless as the dance or the plot in something like the Orgy of the Dead, it is approaching.
