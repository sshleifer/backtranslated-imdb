Have you ever heard of a Taiwanese horror movie? Or some Taiwanese movie? Proposals for a reason. This was really boring, even though it has black magic including bodies of withered children and people exploding from within with thousands of eels. <br /> <br /> Reading other people's thoughts, I couldn't wait to do violence and gore, but there isn't much. A little blood vomit and lame stuff, if you're waiting for graphics or macabre effects, you'll be disappointed. Clearly they didn't use the exploding eel and other things to their fullest. <br /> <br /> Practically nothing good in this film; a single character that was not completely bland and some magical spells of black magic, such as eel. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. The horror aspect didn't work at all, the most terrifying thing was an albino girl (not so scary). This is the worst Asian horror movie I've ever seen.
