I'm normally willing to prefer low-budget films, but Darkman III is so terribly disenchanted that I feel nothing but contempt for it. <br /> <br /> It looks and feels like a TV show, and a particularly poor one at that. The sets are scarce, the flat lighting, the score and the effects are disjoint, and the cameraman is the film school 101. There is no plot to talk about, the characters are one-dimensional and the actors are sleepwalkers. Most of the cast look like they're doing soft core porn ..... In fact, the only reward I received from this mess was the appearance of the amazing squint in front of Roxann Biggs-Dawson (Star B'Elanna Trek: Voyager) without his uneven Klingon head trick on. His skin tone is about two shades lighter than that in Voyager; or she was bleached for this role, or blackened for Voyager. Very strange in both cases.
