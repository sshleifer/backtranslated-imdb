Why, or 'WHY! ... did I choose this? Well ... I needed child's play in the summer heat, and the cover looked cool. <br /> <br /> Obviously I should have known better. This is really a bad movie. And it gets embarrassing when the producers know it's bad, and tries to cover it up by adding some sexy / beautiful women and some sex scenes to it. Well, people ... don't cut it, do it! <br /> <br /> If you like a good movie about a large reptile that is actually very, very good, well played and fun: go rent Lake Placid! (this is an order)
