Normally I don't feel qualified to review something I've seen only half an hour, but I'll make an exception for this. <br /> <br /> Let the dialogue speak for itself! Here are some of the bad guy's jokes: "I smell ... teacher!" "Excuse me teacher, get an F!" <br /> <br /> Bad guy and bad girl (right after killing 2 cops and stealing a van full of drugs, they're getting hot and heavy): <br /> <br /> He - "So, what do do you plan to shoot innocent spectators? " <br /> <br /> Her- (purrs) "You know how to show a girl a good time ..." A generic child who has run through his life instead of helping someone, sums up his life and personality in this line - "I AM a CHICKEN-TWIT! (This was the version of the USA network) My old man was right! He left us ..." Boo-hoo. <br /> <br /> (not actually a spoiler) Bad guy (on fire) screams "Aargh! Fire!"
