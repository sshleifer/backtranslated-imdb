It doesn't take long to understand why the code name: Diamond Head failed to do so in network programs. The television pilot film does not exceed the credits before it is obvious how bad it will be. Maybe I missed something, because the plot didn't make much sense. Based on what came out of the confusing chaos, a terrorist or a thief or something called "Tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon. The world's most obtuse secret agent, Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), is ready to stop it. Could there be more, but trust me? it doesn't matter anyway. <br /> <br /> Action movies should have action. Moments of suspense should have suspense. And the dramatic moments should have a drama. None of this in Code Name: Diamond Head. Have I seen others use the word "turgid" to describe this for snoozer TV ?? and it's better than any description of a word I can invent. None of the characters is in any way exciting or worthy of attention. And Roy Thinnes is the worst one imaginable. His charisma is just north of a snail. Ian McShane is easily the best thing the film has ever done, but unfortunately for everyone else involved, it doesn't look like he'd be back as a regular cast member. Now, if McShane had been chosen for the series, well then you could have had something. <br /> <br /> I'm quickly discovering that these horrible 1970s Gawd movies made for TV make great episodes of the Mystery Science Theater 3000. And that's double if Quinn Martin is involved. Very funny stuff from Mike and the Bots. So while I could only give the 3/10 movie, I consider Episode # 608 to 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
