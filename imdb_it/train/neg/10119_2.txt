The animation in this re-imagination of Peter & the Wolf is excellent, but at 29 minutes the film is induced by sleep. They should have called it "Peter & the Snails", because everything moves at a snail's pace. I couldn't even watch the movie in one sitting - I had to watch it 15 minutes at a time, and it was pure torture. <br /> <br /> Save yourself 30 minutes - don't watch this movie - and you'll thank me. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the Oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees. Unfortunately, to vote for the winner in the Best Animated Short (short!) Category, voters will have to sit for everything else. I feel sorry for them already - and I must foresee that in no way does this film come close to victory.
