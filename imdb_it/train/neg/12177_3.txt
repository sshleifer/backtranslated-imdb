Since the 1970s, writer / producer / director Charles Band has been responsible for hundreds of science fiction, fantasy and horror films. Some of these are wonderful examples of how to use a minimum budget for maximum effect; many of them are pretty bad. Trancers (1985) was one of those rare gems. <br /> <br /> A Terminator-style tale of travel and action over time, Trancers has seen Tim Thomerson play Jack Deth, a future cop who has the task of tracking down the bad boy Whistler, who travels to the past inhabiting the body of an ancestor. Whistler is able to control other humans with his psychic powers, converting them into obedient zombies (the "trancers" of the title), and attempts to alter the course of history by killing the ancestors of the leaders of the future. Jack followed him until 1985, determined to stop him. <br /> <br /> In the 1991 sequel, Jack still lives in 1985. After destroying Whistler, he settled down and married Leena (Helen Hunt), the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie. But, for Jack, things don't stay quiet for long, and the problem comes in the form of Whistler's brother, E.D. Wardo, who is trying to build an army of troops. <br /> <br /> Trancers II lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how beautiful the original was. The story is hard to pick up if you haven't seen the first movie (or at least not for a long time), and there are a lot of awesome little actions and a few poor special effects. The inventiveness and spirit that made the Trancers so funny is over; instead we get some background lines and a script that seems to be written on the fly. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can recommend this movie to fans of the genre is the cast, which boasts many names that will be familiar to followers of science fiction and horror movies: Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch , Martine Beswicke. Unfortunately, most of them seemed to have an 'off day' during the filming of Trancers II, and the performances are mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> The Trancers series obviously has its fans; four more sequels have been baked. Unless the quality has raised massive upward swings, I can't imagine them.
