"Drawing Restraint 9" is a kind of movie that loves or hates; fortunately or not, I left him with a strong feeling of wasted time and being completely stuffed with propaganda "killing whales is bad". Aesthetically, the film could have been pleasant, especially its first half, until it is clear that every action represented serves as an allegory of various aspects of whaling. Until then, it might be a bit fun to watch the daily chores of Japanese workers, but later it becomes obvious that everything that appears on the screen is propaganda, and no single frame is an exception. I use the word "propaganda" because the film basically uses the old gaming device of morality, where "good" and "bad" are not deduced in the course of action but are carved in stone. It's probably just me, but I find this kind of superficial and preconceived art, even when it comes to the search for the noble (no sarcasm here) to protect the environment. <br /> <br /> In my opinion it is a capital sin when a film material is stretched without any justification, for the sole purpose of lengthening. In my opinion, "Drawing Restraint 9" could have been easily inserted in 75 minutes, but has a tortuous length of 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting shots, but there weren't enough to leave empty spaces of nothing for 15 minutes without warning. The film does not have a standard scenario, and there is no evolution of the characters, but neither is it a documentary, it is rather a sort of conceptual installation. It's an unusual form for a film, but it can still be seen as a work of art even when the concept is as simple and naive as it is here. OTOH I also believe that the director should have had some honesty and did not pretend that it could be delivered in no less than 135 minutes. <br /> <br /> And yes, the musical score mostly resembled the sounds of whales. What a surprise. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
