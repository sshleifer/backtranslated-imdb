NOTE TO ALL THE ADMINISTRATORS: Long is not necessarily good. This film is incredibly long. Anyway it's not good. The scenes were designed in a way, way, way, too long. Sex scenes were not necessary and often too long. The film reduced to about 2 hours and 10 minutes would have been exceptional, but unfortunately it has become so boring that it can only be given 2 out of 10. It is far below average. <br /> <br /> Some other problems also exist in this marathon. <br /> <br /> 1) Ralph Fiennes plays an entire family tree. The guy who played the great-grandfather doesn't look like him, but the grandfather, the father and the son (who gives us a constant unnecessary voice) are all Ralph Fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic personality. No one seems to notice that each of these children looks like a clone of the last, even if the photos are taken at every corner. This is minor, but if the film had not lasted 3 weeks it would not have been so annoying. <br /> <br /> 2) The fact that no news from Germany has yet been whispered for the longest time Jews are gathered and sent away is ridiculous. A few words would come to them and probably the thought of trying to escape would be discussed. The uncle in France would certainly have sent a warning to try to make them go away. <br /> <br /> 3) The love stories in this film are totally wrong. You are spending forever telling us this and the development of relationships between main characters is extremely short. Suddenly ... people are in love and almost instantly ... married. So have children. So we extract things for 6 centuries and forget the development of relationships. This again would not have proved so much in a 2-hour movie, but with the time elapsed nothing was given to us. <br /> <br /> 4) The finish was just ugly. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but you won't like it either ... unless you're sadistic. <br /> <br /> The director / writer should be tortured by having to watch this garbage inflate a weekly basis, I mean endless loop, oops are the same thing. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Robert Redford did anything for this film, I mean, I think Istvan Szabo should shape his career as a director after him. Long track movie that totally ruins any substance in the film. A brief description of "The Horse Whisperer" and Sunshine. <br /> <br /> Sunshine, perfect title. If you start watching while the sun is shining, it will probably be fine after dark when you go out.
