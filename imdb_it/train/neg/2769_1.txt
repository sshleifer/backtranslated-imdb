This film is a timely warning for anyone who thinks they can write and direct their own film. Face it, you can't. Because this way there is no one around to tell you when you have a lot of holes in your plot, you have meaningless transitions, banal, not memorable dialogues and you can turn a rather cold Korean legend into a steaming pile of asshole of celluloid. <br /> <br /> I wanted this movie to be a scruffy popcorn movie, I really did; I like a lot of crappy movies. But once I was forced to ask myself what the hell happened and WHY, DEAR LORD, WHY? more than a couple of times, I really can't take it anymore. <br /> <br /> Also, I'd like someone to explain how LA became Mordor for the last scene.
