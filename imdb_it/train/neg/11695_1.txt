Calling a film "Thinner" badly is like calling the earth or Pauly Shore without talent. No news, but the way they have become this is what people want to know. <br /> <br /> As for this film .... The book was good, even though it was a small derivative of other "pay attention to what you want for" genre stories. Burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills a gypsy's daughter and is cursed by his father (Constantine from "Room 222" on TV) to several pounds a day. <br /> <br /> As I said, it starts well, but why involve the gangster (Mantegna)? Why fire automatic weapons so much? Why turn it into something so heavily dependent on the FX? I thought it would be much more effective if it focused more on the subtle ramifications of weight loss delays, diseases, death, Gypsy tradition and so on. <br /> <br /> But no, it doesn't have to be. Remember, this is Stephen King we're talking about. <br /> <br /> And the ending ... almost the same as the book, but a little too chatty. In reality the whole film speaks too much, feeling that it must explain every plot that comes to mind. Not that I expected "The Dead Zone", but I could have done without another "Pet Sematary", thanks anyway. <br /> <br /> A star to at least try to do a decent makeup job. However, the rest of the film is left to be ... say it with me ... "Thinner".
