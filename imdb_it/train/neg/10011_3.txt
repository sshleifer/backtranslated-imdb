This film is about a male escort involved in a murder investigation that took place in the circle of wives of powerful men. <br /> <br /> I thought "The Walker" would be thrilling and engaging, but I was really wrong. The rhythm is painful and terribly slow, that even after 40 minutes of film nothing happens. Seriously, the first hour could be condensed in ten minutes. It's so slow. <br /> <br /> The fact that you miss shivers or action scenes aggravates your boredom. It is almost shocking that even discussion scenes are so simple and emotionless. Perhaps it is because of the rigid upper lip of the upper social class? <br /> <br /> It's sad that "The Walker" gets so boring, despite such a strong cast. Blaming the poor plot and the even worse rhythm.
