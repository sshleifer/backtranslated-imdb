Let's see where to start ... bad acting; I'm not sure if I would even call it that, since it's a no-effort script. The actors didn't even seem to be in their parts and seemed lifeless and listless. Of course, there was a scene or two with nakedness, but this could not save this film from its lifeless characters. <br /> <br /> To call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do it. The texts had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of meaningless insults. <br /> <br /> Budget? Does this film even have a budget? Looks like they used less money than I saw in a home-made YouTube video. Bad lights, props, poor post-production sound. Bad special effects, if you want to go so far as to call them that. The story could have been good if people seemed interested in doing it, but there was no life in this film; I don't care who directed it. <br /> <br /> I have seen some really bad gestures in the last year and this is definitely at the bottom. Don't waste time or would you like me to listen to this unbiased review. Check the classifications, you will see that the 1s are quickly overcoming the 10 soft ones with very few intermediate things. I wish I would have felt a little closer before wasting time. What a love party!
