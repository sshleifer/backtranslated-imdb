The character of Jack Black, Tim Dingman the "Dreamer" of Envy, finds wealth and success in the idea of ​​an aerosol spray "Vapoorize" which, sprayed on dog dung, makes the poop disappear in the air. <br /> <br /> For a moment I was hoping that Vapoorize was a real product so you could spray it on this "stinker" of a movie and make it disappear even in the void. <br /> <br /> Although Envy is not the worst film I've seen in the last 12 months (that honor goes to The Cat in the Hat), it gets the honor of a second neighbor. <br /> <br /> Not funny, not sad, not nothing. A real "Stinkeroo" !!!!! <br /> <br /> 0.2 to 10 !!
