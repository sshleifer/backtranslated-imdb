Before seeing it, I had seen some pretty bad Christmas movies. But once we saw this, "Jingle All the Way" looked better than "The Godfather". "Santa Claus" is a cheerful film about Santa Claus that helps some children, but it seems almost demonic to watch it. The jolly ho-ho-ho of Santa Claus is replaced by a devilish and diabolical laugh that I'm sure has driven many children away from Christmas. The plot of this massacre is very strange, which adapts to all performances and dialogue. Santa lives high above the Earth at the North Pole, where he and children all over the world prepare for Christmas. But Santa has an enemy called Pitch or Satan. Pitch tries to ruin Santa's Christmas by turning three boys into evil, and creating diversions, such as moving the fireplace and boiling the handle. When Pitch makes Santa attack a dog, it's up to Pedro and Merlin, the wizard of Santa Claus, the magician to get Santa out of this pickle. <br /> <br /> Everything about this film, besides being decidedly bad, is so bizarre. Satan dances a lot and actually looks a lot more cheerful than Santa Claus. Santa talks about delivering presents to all the boys and girls, yet he seems to carry only 5 children's homes in Mexico. Reindeer are finished toys, and when the reindeer laughs, I am amazed that it does not bring tears to the eyes of children ... it's scary. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes are simply Santa Claus playing the organ while the children sing. Probably one of the strangest scenes is the shooting of Pitch in Santa's ass with a mini cannon and laughing out loud while Pitch dances in pain. I think parents are better at telling their children where the children come from than showing them. The only positive thing is that you will laugh hysterically if you can appreciate the bad cinema. <br /> <br /> My assessment: BOMB / ****. 85 minutes
