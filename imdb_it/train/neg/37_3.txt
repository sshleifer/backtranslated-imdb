Devil Hunter has gained notoriety for being on DPP's "Nasty Video" list, but it wasn't really necessary. Many films on the list where there is for God (and DPP) only known reasons, and while this is not the most beautiful of the group; here there is not much that you deserve to be banished ... which is a shame because I would never have passed that way, not for the fact that it is on the "shopping list". The plot gives the film a decent base - or at least a decent base compared to most cannibal films - and follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged into the Amazon jungle. A hunter is then hired to find her, but along the way he must challenge the natives, led by a man who calls himself "the devil" (hence the title). In practice, the film takes place only for eighty-five minutes and in reality there are not many scenes of interest. It's a pity that Jess Franco ended up making films like this because the man is clearly talented; seen in films like The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good films are just gems between shit and Devil Hunter is a part of shit. I saw this film only because I want to be able to say that I saw everything on the DPP list (there are still two left!), And I suppose that's why most people who saw it saw it . But if you're not looking for Nasties; there's really no reason to worry about this.
