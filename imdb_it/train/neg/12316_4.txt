The director Jonathan Lynn has made some comedies underrated in the past, like "Greedy" and "Clue". This is not one of them. More like a "Police Academy" movie than his inspiration, he sees Steve Martin in the old role of Phil Silvers as an army sergeant who pulls scams forever under the nose of his superiors. But the idyllic life of Bilko and his lazy platoon seems trembling when an old enemy visits the base determined to catch Bilko red-handed. Not much, really. It's all pretty boring. It's not very funny. Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman squeeze a few laughs through effort, but they're all better than this and it's pretty painful to see them work with such thin material.
