I'm a big fan of war movies and, as a veteran of fighting in Vietnam, I have some experience with technical details. I have worked with bombers more than once and I have nothing but respect for them. Other veterinarians, and particularly the Iraqi veterinarians, have summarized the inaccuracies in this film very well. The poetic license is one thing, but this film is a complete fantasy and fails badly because of it. No bomb disposal unit, or any unit, would ever tolerate this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes. Military units reward compliance and discipline for a reason, they save lives. The opening scene particularly bothered me. The guy with the cell phone would be hit immediately. Screaming, "Stop dialing" is not an effective deterrent. It got worse from there. The sniper scenes were particularly striking. As others have noted, your average EOD guy doesn't know he is a sniper, and think that any Arab sniper is so good that he really relaxes his imagination. Kidnapping an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge would never have happened. Someone could shoot him, but this kind of risk-taking is limited to movies. I could go on, but, as I said, others have emphasized these things in detail. This is not a good movie, and if it wins any prizes, it is a further reflection of why "La La land" is so called.
