Wowwwwww, about an hour ago I finally finished watching this terrible movie !!! I wanted to turn it off within the first 10 minutes, but I thought I'd give it a chance because it just had to improve. Or at least have some qualities of redemption, as if I had imagined at least that it would be a way of thinking like film, or as very clever, or very well shot or something ... Needless to say, it wasn't like that and I lost about a hour and a half of my life. I'm not going to get in because it's terrible because it's a waste of my time to explain that this "could contain spoiler" ... IMDb, you should calm the spoilers thing and pay more attention to make sure the people who rate the movies and the comment is not paid to write reviews or be involved in some way in the film or in any other such thing. I thought it would be fun after this terrible movie to come and see hoe badly the score would have been and I was very shocked to see the ratings quite high ... all rankings with around 7-10 stars clearly have to be about DIFFERENTLY COMPLETELY movies. .. Im still a big fan of IMDb, but seriously rethinking this evaluation process because this film should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee as a 3.
