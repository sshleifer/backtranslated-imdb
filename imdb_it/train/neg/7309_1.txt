I rented and watched this movie for the first time on DVD without reading any reviews about it. So, after 15 minutes of viewing, I noticed that there is something wrong with this movie; it's terrible! I mean, it looked scary and serious in the trailers! <br /> <br /> I think Eli Roth (the director) thought that if all the characters in this movie were stupid, the movie would be fun ... (So stupid, it's fun ...? !) He should watch and learn from best horror comedies like: "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys" and "The Return Of The Living Dead"! Those are fun! <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is the reason why I registered on www.IMDb.com so that I could post my thoughts on discontent about it. <br /> <br /> I decided to watch the movie a second time> AAARGH! <and take notes for my partial "review" to show how silly the movie is. "Resident Evil" (horror) or "Dude, Where's My Car?" (comedy) I can look again and again and still have fun! But this ...! <br /> <br /> How bad can a script and a director be ??? This evil Here are the horrible scenes in chronological order: <br /> <br /> In the first scenes we see Henry, who does not realize that his dog is lying on the ground with his tongue coming out of his mouth and his gaze is dead ! <br /> <br /> The film explains nothing about the long-haired blond boy who loves to bite people. <br /> <br /> And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question ("What's wrong with the woods?") is "nothing". The script tells that bearded boy to warn them about the woods just for "suspense". <br /> <br /> So the "smartest" of the 5 pack, Bert, gives us almost an example of how to start a forest fire. He meets Henry, now infected, who asks for help and from here the film wants to break the record using the "F-word". Bert starts to scare because Henry looks terribly sick. Bert: "Don't let me shoot!" (forget to add: "... with my BB gun!") <br /> <br /> Bert returns to the cabin but what do you say? Meet Marcy and Jeff having sex, but suddenly they decide to go for a walk! Marcy wisely pulls out the unguarded bonfire that Bert had started earlier (a moment of clarity for a change?) Bert doesn't say a word about Henry because the madman thinks he killed him with his BB gun. <br /> <br /> Later, as the Five Estupid sit around their campfire, another weirdo shows up with his dog. (Maybe this is the warning about the forest? It is full of wacky ... and their dogs!?) They let him sit down only because he has a huge bag full of cannabis. (Their brains are completely drunk! No wonder why they are all such CHILDREN!) This is the last time we will see this forgettable character ... alive! <br /> <br /> Henry shows up at their cabin, (NOTE: He was lying all the time a few feet from their cabin !!!) looking worse, almost like a zombie, covered in goo! He says he needs a doctor. But the young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker. Get into their unlocked truck which obviously also has the ignition key. Henry seems almost intelligent enough to drive Hell out of there, but instead he starts vomiting blood all over the dashboard, the seats and the windows. The Fantastic Five come running, armed with: a BB Gun, a knife, a baseball bat (* eh? Never tried to play baseball in the middle of the woods ???), a poker and an (insecticide?) Spray- can , ready to fight the single man, unarmed and terribly sick. (intelligent script!) Bert manages to kill the car with a single shot of his BB Gun, which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth. "What else should I do?" Bert screams in his defense. Jeff and Paul try to knock down Henry with their bat and their poker, but they miss and block truck windows instead. Henry approaches the stupid girls who say, "He's coming towards us!" (Thanks for the stupid information, I can see it!) But I don't think he wants to hurt you!) Marcy splashes into her eyes, making Henry scream! And our "hero" Paul touches Henry's arm with a burning log coming from the campfire, which they left incautiously burning while they were inside the cabin! (Where has all this wisdom gone? I suppose cannabis has begun to take its toll! :-) Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs away, screaming. <br /> <br /> The following day, Bert and Jeff head off for a mechanic. And Marcy decides to "ask for help" alone, in the woods, while Paul is left behind with Karen ... Doesn't she seem idiotic? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already "looking for help"! <br /> <br /> I now skip my comments on how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE paddling on a huge and winding river! How did he get a canoe? Do you even know where it's going !? Anyway, she goes to the riverbank and finds a very large and apparently abandoned cabin and, like most horror movies, walks inside the cabin saying, "Hi, is anyone there?" Bert suddenly opens from behind a piece of furniture and scares her (and me at the beginning). And then Jeff comes too. How did they get here !? They swam across the river ??? See how the script is brainless? <br /> <br /> Vice Winston meets Paul in the cabin. Somehow he doesn't notice the blood on their truck. This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I decided to stop torturing myself and to release the DVD. (First I take my eyes off! ... Now, it's fun!) <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed this movie, do yourself a favor and watch "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys", or "The return of the living dead". Then you will see that they are more fun than this ... thing. Even the "Part 2 of Toxic Avenger", which is also a very bad film, is much more fun than "Cabin Fever".
