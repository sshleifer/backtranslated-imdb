The story of Nikolai Gogol "Viy" was filmed again and published in the United States through Faith Films. <br /> <br /> The original story is about a priest who has to watch over a witch's body with faith alone to protect it. Widely expanded and set in America, although clearly filmed in Russia (the houses, clothes and furniture are all wrong despite the English signs), this is a strange film that doesn't really work. Part of it is the strange setting that tries very hard to be backwoods America but clearly it is not. There are also bizarre moments, intentionally slanting, as the main character is a reporter at the beginning and a priest a short time later. I'm not sure why they did it, even after seeing the making of a piece on the DVD) The other problem is dubbing which is beyond all limits. It is done in such a way that everyone talks when their lips are not on the camera - or if they are the voices they don't even remotely fit the edges of the lips. I don't know if the fault of Faith Films or that of the producers who made the film hoping to jump into the West (revealed in the making of the piece). <br /> <br /> The film is not very good. As I said, it has all kinds of technical problems that make this curious curiosity. Despite some good-looking horror images, the film never works like a horror movie. As a film to generate faith, it is too confusing in this revisitation to make anyone feel closer to God. <br /> <br /> Given the choice, I'd give it a ride, even at the price of a cheap deal. My advice would be to find the 1960s version of the story called Viy that will bring both some chills and some understanding about a belief in god.
