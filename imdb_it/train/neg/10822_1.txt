Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in English and this writer should read it. I hate it when writers use Spark's notes for what is a novel. This film is unbearable to watch if you've read the book. <br /> <br /> The whole "red room" is so played down that I wonder why they even bothered to insert it. In the book the "red room" is prefiguring for the whole story and the rest of Jane's life. Helen Burns is treated so badly in the film, I'm sure she was happy to die and leave early. In the book she is one of the most compelling characters and was not the redhead. The entire Christian theme is not present in his life and in the rest of the film. Do yourself a favor and lose this movie and read the story as Charlotte Bronte masterfully said.
