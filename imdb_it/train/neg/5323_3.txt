I can't believe that in the 34 previous comments, no one mentioned that this film is a blatant rip-off of Born Yesterday. A man is hired to bring an apparently stupid blonde to the needs of a gangster. The gun and the hired blonde fall in love and live happily ever after. The gangster is left at the mercy. But Born Yesterday was a clever treatment, while this is just so much. The transfer of Technicolor to DVD is regrettable. Natalie Kalmus would have rolled into her grave. Take a look at the boy. Recognize it? But it is historically interesting to see the roots of Rock 'n Roll. Also interesting is the introduction of Ewell to CinemaScope, a new format at the time.
