A comedy on a note that probably defines the teeth of modern feminists. Department store manager Betsy Drake is in love with the idea of ​​children and marriages, and pinned her hopes on women's magazines until she finds super-bait in the form of an elegant bachelor Cary Grant. The rest of the film trudges from one stratagem to another as the relentless Drake pursues his prey. I guess the word "perky" is just the approximation of Drake's approach to the role. He has a charming smile, but after 20 minutes of memorizing the dentures, I started overdosing. Grant's role is basically secondary and less his usual talent. There is a scene, however, that almost saves this lean exercise. Drake interrogates the unfortunate Grant after his lecture in a room full of respectable ladies. Here his lively manner has an unforced freshness that is truly remarkable, and if the production did not give us the nose for that 90-minute optimistic smile, the film could have been more than a dream dream for girls, around 1948.
