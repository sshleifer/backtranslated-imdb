You have to see this show once for having seen them all, the formula is exactly the same in each episode. Jim does something his way, he means well, but he upsets his wife, eventually discovering that what he did was really for her, she strokes her cheek and gives a chewy smile while looking shyly. In fact, the plots are so lame and formal that I immediately get into a fight. <br /> <br /> Episode 'Valentines Pay' <br /> <br /> Jims's wife notes that all the Jims weekly pay has disappeared, then explains that he lost it at the casino. She screams and leaves the house complaining about how horrible it is. Then, on Valentine's Day, he shows up in a limousine with tickets for a dance (then explains the missing salaries). He realizes "his" mistake and the usual "Oh Jim, you are so adorable". .. The end <br /> <br /> Another very obvious element is the fact that the character of Jims is based on Homer Simpson who, as a cartoon character, manages to get by with being belligerent and ignorant, when this is attempted with human beings it does not work and Jim comes only as an arrogant selfish asshole. <br /> <br /> IMO the only reason this is successful is simply because we are so many now in terms of humans with TV, these days you could do a show about a man who isolates the walls and you get an audience. <br /> <br /> "Two and a half men" on the other hand is fantastic and exhilarating.
