I don't know why I'm commenting on this stupid reality show that I happened to watch some episodes of (a cable television marathon when they aired 5 episodes in a row or something, I didn't watch the whole thing though. Just like three episodes) as I was nine months pregnant and about to go into labor every day. Maybe I'm just bored today :-) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Britney, really. For her, money and fame seem to have very little sense of dignity. Or he is egocentric to the extreme. He married the stupid Federline (okay, anyone can make a mistake) and first he "played" this horrible show about his everyday life with him, where he puts a camera wherever he wants, no matter if it's in someone's face or in shower by Federline. He's stuttering about his sex life without leaving anything to your imagination, I don't care for my part, but I can't help but wonder how he feels now when he's divorced. And yes, for his sake I'm embarrassed But I shouldn't be. It seems that he lives a rather empty and superficial life. I don't want to trade lives with her even if I could. If you want, kill the TV.
