Snow White is, in my opinion, a bad film from an artistic point of view. The plot is practically predictable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too exaggerated. However, the film does not seem to have many artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think this is a direct commercial thing. Including a character from the French part of Switzerland (the actor is the leader of the band he is touring with in the film - the band is called SENS UNIK) he seems to be aiming for a wider audience. A direct German-Swiss film would not have sold in the French part - and vice versa. What really impressed me was the product placements throughout the film. Some scenes are reminiscent of advertising clips! <br /> <br /> I also think that the topic of "young people taking drugs without other goals in their lives" is a widespread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be worked out more carefully. I hope Samir has enough money with Snow White, so that his next film will show his true artistic abilities.
