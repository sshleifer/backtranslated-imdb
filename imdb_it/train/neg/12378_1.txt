Disturbing and lascivious wolf. The young "Red" wears a complete make-up and extremely short shorts and dressing gown. I have about 20 minutes and I realized that it could be a pedophile's dream to come true. "Up-beat" music sounds very similar to something I hear in a strip club. Actually, I think this film is a sick joke - it's not a family movie. Gross, happy that I was watching this with my daughter, I don't want her to think it's normal for families to see almost kiddie porn together. Very ugly, very sad it is sold as a family movie, Joey Fatone will probably be embarrassed that he was in it. And what does it mean to advertise it as a "spectacular special effect" ??? The effects look low on budget, horrible.
