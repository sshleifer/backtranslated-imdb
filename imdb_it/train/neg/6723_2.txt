Charlotte's deadly beauty and lethal kicks make the movie more beautiful than it would otherwise be. The story is so poor and the character of Charlotte dies so foolishly, that you wonder if this is the ending they had thought of for this movie. I would like someone to say that there is an alternative ending, but I fear it is not. As for the rest of the cst, I would say that they simply didn't work very well; even if the blame should be put on the poor script. This film reminds me of Rush Hour 2 in which Zhang Ziyi dies absurdly, since she was the only one who stole the show during the entire movie. I could give this movie 2/5
