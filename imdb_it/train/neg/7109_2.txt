Now I understand. The title refers to the immediate post-reaction of each member of the public after 68 minutes of mental torture. Looking too hard to be terrifying, lacking a good dialogue, any fear for that matter, really makes The Skull Skull more like A Snoring Dull. Although the villa and the property set in black and white create a dark tone for the film, but that's all. The only scary thing about this flop is that people actually made money with this! Remember the warranty of the coffin at the beginning? This could be the funniest thing I've ever seen on the screen. The sad thing is that viewers probably hoped that director Alex Nichol had been forcibly put in a coffin, nailed and buried alive for his lame effort. Jenny placed in this unfortunate horrible situation never attracts any sympathy for a woman whose anxiety is attributed to a haunted and cranial receptacle. Moreover, her husband John looks like a condescending and carefree comedian, but this doesn't work and ends up showing how hard he is by slapping a helpless cripple around! Ah, Mickey? The days before you could get a restraining order against servants like him. This guy's approach is not very good or maybe too much by plane. Yet, despite his strange personality, Mickey is probably the only positive thing for this film that provides a slight sense of entertainment and I can't get enough of a guy who says "It was Mary!" and rummaging through the pots in a greenhouse.
