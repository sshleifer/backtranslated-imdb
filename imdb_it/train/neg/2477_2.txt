If you want to know the true story of Wendigo, I suggest you take a copy of Algernon Blackwell's original story. This film was not only bad but it had nothing to do with the book. <br /> <br /> I loved the book when I read it as a child (in "Campfire Chillers" by EM Freeman) and I was so excited to see a movie based on it comes out. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that there were too many PC subtitles (politically correct) throughout the film that had no space in the film. When the book was written, the PC didn't even exist. <br /> <br /> My advice is not to waste time and money !! If you see it on the video store shelf LET IT.
