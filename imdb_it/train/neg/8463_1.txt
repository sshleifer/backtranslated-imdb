No scenario, bad actors (poor Melissa Gilbert) ... Beurk Beurk Beurk ... <br /> <br /> Give a budget like this to do this ... In Belgium, we make ten films that win all the prices in Cannes with this. <br /> <br /> The last time I saw a NULL movie like that was Hypercube. But the scenario was better. <br /> <br /> Is there anyone who knows if the director graduated from school, in a film or a policeman? <br /> <br /> The best things about this movie were the word "End". <br /> <br /> Why authorize to sell this? 1รง is expensive. <br /> <br /> I paid ten dollars to buy this. <br /> <br /> For me, paying for this was my BIG ERROR of the millennium. <br /> <br /> Too bad. <br /> <br /> Next time I'll break my arm but I'll buy this type of sh * t.
