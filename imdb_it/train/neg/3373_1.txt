I was lucky enough to see A Chorus Line when he arrived in my city .. I was younger then .. but it was an excellent performance .. so someone could tell me why in the name of heaven they had to make a movie from is .. and why Michael Douglas ??? He didn't fit the role ... this movie really sucked me a lot !!! <br /> <br /> my advice is NOT to rent this movie .. save your money for something better like "Cats" ....
