The film and the acting are not bad and Jay Hernandez does a good job with Calito Brigante, but the film forgets that it is a prequel to a successful film. The creators of this prequel clearly did not look at the original Carlito's Way or at least did not care about continuity. This film is a prequel, which means that the original film has already drawn some history for us and this film should end where the original begins or at least carry it out. None of Carlito's old close friends from the original makes an appearance in this film, they are not even mentioned. Luis Guzman, Pachanga in the original, is in the film but plays a completely different character. The original takes place in 1975 and the prequel takes place in 1969-70. Considering that this film takes place less than 5 years ago, wouldn't you think that one of Carlito's longtime friends could make an appearance? In the original, Carlito was released from prison after spending 5 years in prison. It's only a few months between the end of the prequel and the beginning of the original! *** Semi Spoiler *** We know from the beginning of the original, Carlito spent 5 years in prison, so when the prequel gives us this happy Hollywood ending it is an insult to the intelligence of the original fans. What happens to Gail? It is the lack of continuity that made this film direct to video output.
