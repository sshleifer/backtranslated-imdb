My family and I screened Underdog the night before. And as bad as Underdog was (my four-year-old loved it very much), Hot Rod makes him look like an Oscar-worthy material. The only thing that could have saved this film, was if Evel himself had left the board to hit Samberg in the face for making this movie. I must admit however that the soundtrack was good. Was I not sure that the film was set in the 80s, but with most of the music coming from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I'd give a ride. And stay at home and watch the test model on your local TV. Or if you died watching this, people under the influence could enjoy it.
