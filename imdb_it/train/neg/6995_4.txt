Funny how many people who say that this is far superior to Romero's version tend to be very young (judging from their other posts). What we have here is a lousy, action-packed, bloody and "Whoopee" filled 2-hour MTV video. Fast-paced editing, working with pop cameras, cool music bla bla bla <br /> <br /> Actually, it's not bad compared to other recent remakes (Chainsaw Massacre was a total disaster) ... quite good to play all round, totally predictable in the episodes "who will die the next" and a total of money in the name Dawn Of The Dead that will generate a lot of revenue alone from the fans of the original who will go to see him out of curiosity ... br /> Do classic remakes not get on your nerves? Really can't invent something original? Why redo Dawn Of The Dead? The things that made the original special (the middle segment that kids think is so boring should be slow to show how when you get everything you've always wanted you're not happy yet) are totally missing. This is an action movie, simple and simple. The faster the better. If you like action movies (and since the 2004 version is well done) it is quite right, but for all those who like a bit of substance in their films ... prepare to sigh (again) .. . <br /> <br /> Watch the cinemas over the next few years, while the Godfather series is being redone by anyone who is the hottest pop director at the moment, and Star Wars is redone, with all the guys saying the new version it's better miles the version is slow and boring and holds a camera for more than 5 seconds ... <br /> <br /> Not bad, but in 10 years they will continue to talk about the Romero version, not this pap
