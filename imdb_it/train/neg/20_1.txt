This film was terrible. at first I just read the plot summary and it looked OK, so I looked at it. The acting was TERRIBLE. it was as if the actor was almost shy. everything seemed fake. I feel bad for Edward Furlong, the terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago .. I saw it at least 20 times .... <br /> <br /> even the plot was disgusting. writers were probably deprived of sleep when they invented the lines. <br /> <br /> on the plus side, it's the good kind of bad movie. what you keep looking at just to see how much worse you could get, so that later you can tell others how you couldn't believe how awful the movie was. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should look at this, so then we could better appreciate others, REAL, movies.
