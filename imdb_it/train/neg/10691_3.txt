I discussed with myself whether to rent this or not. I'm always afraid of renting something I've never heard of (I don't remember it's in theaters). Big cast ... that's what tipped the balance. 30 minutes in, I almost stopped watching it. The first few minutes are fun to watch, but incredible. After that it only gets worse. The authors of this film could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their films a little better. Or they could just try to write something just a little believable. I give him a 3 .... a 1 for writing (just because there are words) and a 2 for being able to get so many good actors to agree to make this film, even if he had to read the script. Oh my god, this movie sucks.
