The RKS films have always been commercial films adapted to the 90s, by GHAYAL, DAMINI <br /> <br /> His latest KHAKEE films were manageable FAMILY was shit <br /> <br /> This film is a movie decent, but could be better <br /> <br /> The problem is that there are many old-fashioned cliches thrown in and many scenes come out too long and filmed. The character of Ajay Devgan is shown very well but his character becomes heroic which could be subtle <br /> <br /> The long flashback could be avoided as the drawings are simply drawn long <br /> <br /> Even the street game in the second half seems too simplistic and hardly a solution the message is well done <br /> <br /> The direction of RKS is decent, although it could be better The music is in place <br /> < br /> Ajay Devgan looks the part very well and is comfortable playing his part mostly at times it seems uncomfortable in the light scenes. He excels in the dramatic films Vidya excels in the scene in front of the media Pankaj has a role not quite defined and too much filmed excels in his part the hams of Darshan Jariwala while the bad old the others is fine
