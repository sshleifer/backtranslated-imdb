This is probably the worst version of the drama I've seen - several times on stage apart from the movie. <br /> <br /> A very nice idea for the installation - South America can give a credible scenario for the extreme reaction to the alleged crime of Hero. <br /> <br /> But the execution! Widdoes is a very polite Beatrice who offers particularly poor performance. Waterston, a good actor, is not much better than Benedict. <br /> <br /> The worst performance is in the role of Don John - makes Keanu Reeves look good. Perhaps the desire to make it a caricature along the lines of the villain that ties the girl to the train track adapts to the keyers kops of Dogberry and his men - but acting makes you want to shiver. <br /> <br /> Successful set designs include the scene in which they deceive Benedetto into believing that Beatrice loves him - if the acting were competent he would be superb. But the use of the river and the visual humor of Benedict approaching is well produced. <br /> <br /> Overall I had to force myself to keep looking but it certainly didn't hold my attention. <br /> Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> Compared to these last comments I am almost 40 years old. I have been following Shakespeare's theatrical and film productions for over 2 decades. I could suggest when you try to defend your friends talking to the piece rather than attacking other reviewers when you're so inadequately armed. I can assume, however, from your disgust with regard to young people, that you have a sufficient age in which the way you play in the past is more for your tastes. <br /> <br /> My favorite match was Rylance and McTeer on the London stage. Unlike Widdoes, McTeer, a skilled and charismatic artist, can act.
