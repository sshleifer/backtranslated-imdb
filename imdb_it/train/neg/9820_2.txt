I'm glad someone liked this, but I hated this movie. It was a good idea for a plot, but that's where it ended. It was poorly written, badly done and hurt. <br /> <br /> It had some interesting plot points, but they simply jumped too fast, the writers needed to understand what to keep and expand on these bits, I like to lie about why it was kidnapped and throw away the waste. Instead it was "what's going on?", 5 seconds later they tell you. <br /> <br /> This film had no suspense, and I was bored from beginning to end. I just wanted it to end. <br /> <br /> Go and rent misery, or better plans if you want suspense or twists that make you guess until the end.
