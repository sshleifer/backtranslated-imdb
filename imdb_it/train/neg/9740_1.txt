Now where was I? Oh yes, "The Projected Man", yes ... ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... <= 8. <Br /> <br /> Ooops, I'm sorry. Yes, "The Projected Man". Well, he's a British science fool for nothing. An orange-headed guy is projected onto a laser, he gets the touch of death. Eventually it vanishes, eventually. In reality, the film is not even that interesting. Boring, buzzing, starchy, stiff and obsessively boring, "The Projected Man" is made up of 77 minutes of nothing, with no one. Boring as water Boring as the dust of the door handle. Deaf as Ethan Hawke - we're really talking DULL here, folks! But wait, boring compared to our cousins ​​across the puddle, the MooCow now will make a proper review for "The Projected Man": <br /> <br /> ZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ............ .. <= 8.
