Yes, I was lucky enough to see the long original production of Michael Bennett's hit musical. It was an incredible experience and I paid to watch the film when it was released in theaters in 1985. It's terrible. Almost everything fails. First of all, Attenborough (a good actor, a good director with the right material) is an unpleasant choice - almost like when John Huston was hired to manipulate ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - the songs are cut and the CASTING !!! They are horrible - the power of the show was these dancers - these hungry and talented artists just wanted the chance to show what they could do and when they had the chance - you couldn't take your eyes off them. But this cast dances, does a "nice" job singing but none of them sparkles a bit. In fact, watch the cast on IMDb - none of them really did anything much. (OK, OK, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). So this train of cinema does not capture the magic, despair or passion of musical theater for a second. A total strike! (But even if they try to stifle the music - great music still gets up sometimes and reminds people how great the score was).
