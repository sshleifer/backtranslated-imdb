For the first couple of seasons, I thought The Apprentice was a very engaging and exciting show. The combination of reality TV and a 16-week job interview was innovative, and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too "out there". <br /> <br /> The new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and has absolutely nothing to do with business - at all. In the early seasons they used to put more emphasis on business-related tasks - now the focus is mainly on the boardroom where competitors have to do EVERYTHING to keep them on the show (which means lying, trash-talking, backstabbing etc.) . The boardroom can be fun to watch, but it's entertainment at its lowest point. Sometimes you wonder if you're watching a replay of an old episode of Jerry Springer. The tasks of the show are, at best, boring and above all a showcase for companies that are stupid enough to pay NBC for advertising. And what is the agreement about half of the competitors who live in tents in the sixth season? This is simply stupid and has nothing to do with real life business. <br /> <br /> I have absolutely no respect for any of the competitors this season, they all seem like idiots. In the first few seasons at least some of the competitors had a bit of integrity, now it seems that the competitors would have killed their own mother to keep them on display. It also seems that the massive ego of Donald Trump is getting bigger and bigger for every season that passes and, to be honest, I can't understand why someone with good sense would like to work for him. His rationality in the boardroom mostly makes no sense and sometimes he seems to like throwing people away for what he's worth. <br /> <br /> R.I.P The Apprentice. Please, NBC, for God's sake, download the show as soon as possible. It's too embarrassing to watch. Once the Apprentice was a great TV show, but now it's just a big joke.
