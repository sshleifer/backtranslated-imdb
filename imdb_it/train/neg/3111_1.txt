I would have rated this movie at minus 10, but unfortunately it is not offered. <br /> <br /> Because I didn't go out in the first five minutes of this movie I can't say. I should have gone with my instinct and left immediately !! Several people in our theater did and unfortunately did not follow them. <br /> <br /> History lacked all the criteria for a film. NO plot. Terrible act! Even Robin Williams was so disappointed that I could never see another movie in which he is. Not a single relationship in history has gone beyond chatter. I liked the tazer scene. Too bad he didn't shock the meat in the senselessness of the plot. Someone needs to check the writer and director of this movie!
