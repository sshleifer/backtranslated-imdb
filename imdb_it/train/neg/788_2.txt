A film with little positive to say for this. <br /> <br /> First it has a zero rhythm and is devoid of any drama. <br /> <br /> In addition to being extraordinarily slow The Empty Acre seems dedicated to always using the same repertoire documentation. I lost count of how many times I had seen "that" field at night or that little piece of cracked earth. <br /> <br /> It also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the public does not know about things they will be grasped rather than just confused. So, without signs that there are problems, we suddenly find that marriage is not what it appears to be despite having given the impression that it is fine. We find out that Jacob is perhaps the worst farmer in the universe since he seems not to spend any time on the farm and he also seems to have bought land with a totally useless acre. Does Beth have a key to a book store? There are countless other questions some of which are solved later in the film, much later, indeed too late. <br /> <br /> And on the point of the topic. Do horror filmmakers notice that large inanimate objects are not inherently scary? and even if they are meant to be a big acre then make them that way. <br /> <br /> There is also a frightening lack of reasonableness as Beth (the best performer of the piece, followed by Jefferson the cop) suddenly seems to be blamed for everything under the sun just because she is in "medicine ". <br /> <br /> With all the extra ten minutes of running around the fields in search of the missing child (he ran away from the window? He has six months) the film descends into a poorly written scene after the poorly written scene. Plinkk bad "horror" music fails to add atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Often bad movies can be fun but not The Empty Acre, which is just bad.
