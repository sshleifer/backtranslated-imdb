Happy Go Lovely is a waste of time and talent of all, including the public. The lightness of the incorrect identity of the old hat and the scandalous plots of the fake scandal are eminently forgivable. Few people have watched these films for their storylines. But usually they had some interesting minor characters involved in the subplots - not here. Usually they had interesting choreographies and stunning dances and catchy songs. Not Happy Go Lovely. And Vera-Ellen as the female protagonist interpreted the entire film as a second banana in desperate search of a star to interpret it, and instead was called to bring the film, and could not do it. The Scottish club was wasted. Usually the omnipresent and automatically omnipresent Scottish whim is absent. Photography was pedestrian. The musical numbers were pedestrian. Cesar Romero gives his usual professional performance, chewing the scenario since no one else has done his part, in the type of producer role frequently played by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou. David Niven is fine, and no one could make David Niven like David Niven. At the end of the day, if you love Niven like I do, it's reason enough to lose 90 minutes on Happy Go Lovely. Otherwise, jump.
