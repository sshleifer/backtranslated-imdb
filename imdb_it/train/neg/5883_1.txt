This film contains no humor for those who lived with a family member who has a mental illness. Many scenes also reminded me graphically of my life experiences. This film was the male version of "Mommy Dearest". It describes both the lives of many children of a mentally ill parent graphically and precisely. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and behave as if they were God. <br /> <br /> Someone told me it was fun. In no way, I say! It is bad temper at best. <br /> <br /> The film is so intense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the room. The best use of this film is for people who do not understand mental illness or do not believe in what our families actually live.
