I saw this movie thinking it would be one of those old B movies that are fun to watch. I was so wrong! This film was boring and obviously aimed at men who like to look burly women. The story was so ridiculous and implausible that I completely lost my interest. It looked like the same kind as Ed Wood's films: the bottom of the cane.
