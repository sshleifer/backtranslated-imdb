I have rarely been moved to make this kind of comment BUT having spent most of Rankin's terrible film, I feel like I've really earned the right to say what I feel about it! I couldn't do it until the end, and I became one of the six or more walk outs (about 1/3 of the audience) after the jagged plot, the painful dialogue and the offensive characterization became too much to bear. this film is all pose and no art. all style and no substance. he is weighed down by terrible acting, by a very unbecoming script, by indifferent cinematography and by student-level production values. how it was financed, started and finished is a mystery to me. I bet a million pounds never goes to the general version. the appropriate critics would tear it to pieces. a really bad movie. terribly ugly. a really really very poor effort And that is without even mentioning the moment when the kitten is just born and drops fat-in-a-fat. totally meaningless, absolutely light, poorly put together; this film is a terrible embarrassment for British cinema.
