This is just a joke in a movie, they have already lost me in the opening scene (Spoilerwarning) that dangerous creature kills other creatures in its cage, this is seen by a scientist who works there on a monitor and guesses what he does, lets go into the cage to check the stuff, how stupid those writers think that humans have come up with this is the same as jumping into an aquarium with a great white shark because he ate your goldfish ... Pretty useless and even more stupid And not I won't even talk about the cast because it's not worth it. because they haven't fired the guy who wrote that for me it's a mystery to me ..... And this kind of stupidity continues the whole movie. The only good thing in which the CGI is better than the average for these low budget films. <br /> <br /> If these things don't bother you, go see it, but be advised if your IQ is over 60 and you'll probably hate it.
