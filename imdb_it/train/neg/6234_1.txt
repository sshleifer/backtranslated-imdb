Not even Goebbels could have gotten a propaganda gimmick like the one Gore did with this complete novel. This is a study of how numbers and statistics can be run around to say whatever you have predetermined them to say. The "scientists" Gore claims have signed on the validity of global warming include social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists. Would you say that a meteorologist is an expert in neurosurgery? Field research and data analysis geologists are involved in not supporting Gores' alarming global warming claims. As one of those geologists working in the field for 40 years I have not seen any evidence to support global warming. My analysis of this film and Gores' actions over the past two years lead me to the conclusion that global warming is his way of staying important and relevant. No more nor less. Ask any global warming alarmist or "journalist" a simple question: you say that global warming is a serious problem. Tell me. What temperature should the earth be?
