It's 1978, and yes, of course there are too many black players in the teams! The fans will be upset and certainly the 75,000 seats will be full, only less happy are there so many black players on the field! This Super Bowl TV movie is watchable. It's not much more, but it's really surprising the cast of talented actors who make an appearance (for the moment), probably in particular Tom Selleck. Unfortunately, any goodness that Selleck brings to the screen is quickly repudiated by "actors" like Dick Butkus. <br /> <br /> It's a silly story about super bowl betting. PJ Jackson is accused of "New York" (read mafia) to make sure the game ends in their favor, in this case a $ 10,000,000 bet. PJ is innocent enough and seems to have a free hold buying some people here and there. But things seem to fall apart for him. Another person, the unsuspecting Lainie, takes the lead. For a while, the mystery of the murders is not known for sure, but is revealed quite clearly in the final assassination that Lainie is the new antagonist. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie, but it's watchable. The acting is decent and the shooting is good. At least there weren't foolish pursuits typical of the 70s (they only have their place here). Just keep an open mind about the stereotypes of the past and the era of cocaine and you will survive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe a 2.5)
