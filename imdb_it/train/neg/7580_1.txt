This was a terrible film. Basically Jane March was a Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something horrible to US forces in South Korea. Become a waitress for a family of American military men, everyone considers her Korean even though she seems more white actress either 1/4 or 1/8 of Southeast Asia, not quite Korean), and the teen of the family starts hating her and ends up sleeping with her. The way Korea and the United States are represented in Korea is completely insane. Of course, the writer and director were obviously white men who never spent a day in Korea before this film and had no intention of showing a true vision of life in Korea for either the Koreans or American soldiers and instead have just tried to satisfy their pathetic Asiaphile fantasies without any regard for how incredible the movie was. Anyone who has ever been to Korea will know that this is total garbage. Eventually the North Korean honhyol spy girl is killed, in an obvious way of "paying for her sins". Bad movie with a feeling made for TV.
