I can't believe this movie could have been made. These people should be drugged and beat with blunt objects. They should be tortured. This film is an abomination. It is nothing more than the filming of the first film. Whatever is original is strange and makes absolutely no sense. It's like a kind of drug hallucination. Like, laying on a naked mirror therapy. Besides, whatever idiot has patched up this asshole hasn't even bothered to watch the first movie, because he kept calling the character of Suzanna Love Natalie when it comes to Lacey. I wanted to scream that on the screen, "It's LACEY, It's LACEY !!!!" I give a -50 on 10. MY GOD !!!!
