As a writer, I find films so bad that they make production a complete slap in the face. Talk about insulting. I was writing better stories than this in eighth grade. Bad acting, bad writing, bad direction and when added together the result is complete and complete. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film manages to accomplish is to trick the unsuspecting consumer into wasting time. Who would give green light to something so little written? It is not artistic, intelligent, intelligent, suspenseful, mysterious, scary, dramatic - NOTHING. <br /> <br /> The characters are flat and boring without development. The texture is recycled like an aluminum can. Somehow they managed to launch some very familiar actors who must all be pretty desperate for the job or hope that one of these low-cost independent films will prove to be the next "Pulp Fiction". This script should have been used to align a bird cage, not a movie. <br /> <br /> Oh and, last but not least, a woman of 5'2 105 pounds obviously has the strength to kill men and women twice as big without a fight and in one shot. <br /> <br /> Avoid this bomb as if it infects you with an STD.
