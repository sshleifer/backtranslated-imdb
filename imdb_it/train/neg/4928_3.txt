This romantic adventure must have seemed overwhelming subversive in his day. A wealthy high class English family holds, plots and manipulates everyone around them for their own satisfaction. Use your privileged position to undertake decidedly anti-social secret activities. There is a clever reversal of sexual roles as his activities prove more daring and fiery than most male characters. But of course there is a tall, dark and handsome stranger to keep the love interest alive, and this wicked woman is not backward in stepping forward when she meets the right man. <br /> <br /> The weakness and insignificant credulity of every other character makes the plot unconvincing to the extreme, but those who are thirsty for romance will neglect it.
