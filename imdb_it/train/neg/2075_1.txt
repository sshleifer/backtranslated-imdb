I must admit that when I went to see this movie, I didn't have high expectations. But even with my low expectations I was totally and totally disappointed ... <br /> <br /> Basically Luke Wilson is a hot photo that tends to hang out with crazy girls. There is a slight mention of a girl who is stalking him but almost everything for that character. Which I don't mind because it would probably be underdeveloped like the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> So while in a subway Rainn Wilson (who actually liked me before this film) convinced him to talk to a "hot" girl, Uma Thurman. This is strange to say the least, since everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman does not belong to the "hot" category. <br /> <br /> Even Rainn Wilson's performances are far from "hot". Normally I'm all for his acting, but he also failed to save this film. His character was nervous, unrealistic and rather annoying. One could never tell if the writers were trying to make him the gay or simply desperate comic little man. It was almost painful. <br /> <br /> But anyway, someone steals his bag as he leaves the subway, and Luke Wilson is the charming savior who runs after the thief. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is the superhero, or "G-Girl" as she likes to call it in the movie. It still baffles me about what the "G" is, but we'll leave the boards to debate. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes I assume should be fun, but I'm wondering who has a sex like that? They almost throw the bed across the wall because of Uma Thurman's "passion" let's say. It hurts my head, but not in the "I'm thinking really hard to understand" way. <br /> <br /> When Uma insults Anna Faris, calling her a "whore", I have not had discussions with this. Apart from the fact that he cannot choose films correctly, he cannot act and relies on the fact that he is blonde and typical. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would have left the theater if he hadn't paid $ 8.75 to see it. The characters are typical and absolutely chemistry-free, especially Uma Thurman. Someone should let you know that just because you move your head a lot doesn't mean you're acting. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the script and the plot could have used a lot of work or a game and some lighter liquid. Actually, I started feeling embarrassed about the actors and their dying careers. Overall, if you value your money and your personal respect DO NOT waste your time with this pathetic film attempt.
