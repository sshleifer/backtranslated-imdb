"The Leap Years" is a film based on an e-novella by Sinhalese writer Catherine Lim, which became the first Singapore novel / novel to be sold on the Internet. The film had a tortuous post-production program: it was shot at the beginning of 2005, it was scheduled for the end of 2005, but in the end it only appeared 3 years later, on February 29, 2008, a leap year. <br /> <Before saying anything, I must first admit that I am not a fan of the romantic genre, so I might be a little biased against this film - I only saw it because it was a Singapore production, and that it is available for to borrow in my neighborhood library. Here are my two cents in the movie. <br /> <br /> Let's start by saying that besides KS and Wong Li-Lin from Qi Yu-wu, everyone here seems to appreciate an Eurasian. The love interest is an Eurasian (Ananda Everingham), and the trio of Wong's friends are all, er-or, Eurasians. This film perpetuates the stereotype that falling in love and associating with Eurasians is more "in" than the common Chinese (or whatever Asian race you are?). I don't know, it seems so. Moreover, everyone in the film speaks of a mystical accent "angético" that does not exist anywhere, certainly not in Singapore. It's the kind of "semi-perfect English" that the authorities would like us to talk about, but that doesn't exist anywhere outside, for example, of MTV Channel. The effect is that the dialogue of the film seems forced and rigged, not helped by the lack of true Singaporean blues in the cast. <br /> <br /> The writer seems to be trying too hard to line up the liners after jokes. After twenty minutes, the film's "wit" begins to flow and the film begins to serve its usual plate of clichés. <br /> <br /> I think I didn't like the movie because the whole premise of supporting a love story in 16 long years seems incredible. <br /> <br /> There are other disbeliefs in the film. I can't believe that KS (played by Qi Yu-wu) would fall for one of Wong's friends. And the scene where the groom says "Go, before you change your mind," was used in hundreds of Asian TV series (Korean, Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwan, etc.) ... <br /> <br / > So 4 stars for this movie. The value of production is right and Wong Li-lin does its best, but is not helped by the script. Joan Chen has a 15-minute part in the film as older Wong and is perhaps the best actress in the lot, but, hey, her role is just cameo. <br /> <br /> If you happen to meet "The Leap Years" in the rental or library, you may want to make it appear in the DVD player out of curiosity, but otherwise, for people who don't exactly love the romance genre, you can decide whether to give it or not.
