OK, I and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of the b-movies because we do them ourselves. However, the cover contained blood and strange naked girls with fangs and stuff ... and Tom Savini! There is really no way that this film can fail! Right? mistaken!! It seems such a waste! There was really no story, the dialogue was terrible (is there someone there? X 1000 !!!), the characters were .. well, really lacked any kind of personality ... The effects were terrible .. and how's it going with these long artistic shots of frightened people running around doing nothing .. with close-ups of eyes and things? We were sitting the whole movie waiting for something ... whatever happened ... but no ... "oh, here come the nymphs! Great! Oh .. they are kissing ... again ... and now for violence! OK ... nothing happens ... yet ... oh, now they run around ... and the close-up of the eyes ... again ... oh, here is Tom Savini! Oh ... he's dead ... right ... OK, maybe now something nice or even interesting will happen ... no .. oh! Cool! a severed head! in the end ... oh shit .. "And finally, since I'm like that full of myself ... I tell you! Give me a van, six actors, a strange looking house, Tom Savini, a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood and I could make the best movie you've ever seen ... I made films with zero budget in two days that has better effects, better acting and a better script than this ... what is this Johannes guy doing? Making fantastic movies is easy! It could have been so beautiful ... I'm really upset !!
