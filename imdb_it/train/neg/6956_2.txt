Sorry, but every time I see a movie where a woman sucks a man and the man does nothing but giggle, the film loses all credibility. So the new Starbuck (female) immediately contaminated the plot before it even took off (no pun intended). Dirk Benedict was much more plausible than the next-generation psychic hero Kattee Sackhoff - whose hyperactivity will probably be praised as "a compelling, compelling, unmissable, revolutionary performance" by the politically correct new word of today's review editor editors; but in essence, it's just an old tired image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder the size of a city house: the biggest clich√© on today's screens. I could give this series another shot, but human caricatures alone wouldn't keep me tuned. James Hilton once complained, "A story, please, just give me a story."
