This film is a good example of how to ruin a book in 109 minutes. With the exception of the names of the characters, the film bears little resemblance to the book. A book full of strong Latin characters and are represented, for the most part, by non-Latinos. There is no character development in the film and we have no reason to love or hate the characters. And canceling a complete generation is unforgivable. Isabel Allende has written a powerful book and the book is what should be read!
