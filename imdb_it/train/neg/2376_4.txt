George Brent is a journalist sent to interview an heir. It is presumably the heir to a face cream. He interviews her on his yacht. They fall in love with each other in a bathing suit. <br /> <br /> It turns out (very soon) that it is not an heir. It is part of an advertising campaign for ice cream. <br /> <br /> The film follows the ups and downs of their love story. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast does little to encourage it. Davis and Brent carry the photo. Although it is quite predictable, it is also quite fun. He is far from his best. But, especially considering his obscurity in his work, he is not even one of his worst.
