Jean Luc Godard's Marxist controversy is the closest to an unwatchable film, as is likely to be seen by an internationally renowned filmmaker. Fragments of political theater, tediously disturbing and endless, are interspersed with the creation of "Sympathy for the Devil", with the Rolling Stones in the studio. <br /> <br /> The song development process, from Mick Jagger playing a demo with acoustic guitar, to the voice that was recorded towards the end, is fascinating, and it is worth renting this movie just to see the pieces with the Stones. Almost half of the film is dedicated to this, so thanks to the miracle of chapter breaks, you can skip all the bizarre political scenes and just watch the Stones put together a song. <br /> <br /> When I had this on laserdisc, I bravely tried to look at everything, but I don't see how anyone can overcome it. In the end I gave up and simply skipped the chapter to the Stones segments.
