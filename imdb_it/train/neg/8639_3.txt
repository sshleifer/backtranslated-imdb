Routine suspense yarn on a sociopath (Dillon) who gives his sperm to a human reproduction clinic and begins to annoy the lives of the woman (Antonio) and her husband (Mancuso). Extremely predictable, far-fetched and with an undecided tone to the end. Don't waste time with this ... make a baby instead!
