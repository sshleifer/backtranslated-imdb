I can't believe that the city of Muncie is so hard to get attention that they would embarrass themselves by allowing this show to be done there. This show is like a slap in the face of real law enforcement officers. I have never seen anything so stupid in my life in my life. If they had charged it like a comedy it would be one thing, but to say that reality is nothing short of a lie. I only saw him once and I was shocked by what I saw. I wanted to see the baby enter a chase with a bad boy. What a joke it would be. Nothing on the show was even close to the real world. The city of Muncie, the police chief and all the officers should be embarrassed by shame and should never want to admit coming from that city. No wonder he didn't hang around on TV
