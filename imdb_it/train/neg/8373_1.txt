I was not impressed by this film, especially because I went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a film that had obtained the 12A certificate here in the UK. To my dismay, this film was full of embarrassing sexual jokes. (Which is not a problem for me as an adult, but it's not good for watching with children). This movie has sometimes been very crude sometimes with jokes, hit in the groin etc ... and for most of the movie it's not very funny. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is Calvin Sims who is a 2-inch dwarf, comes out of prison and steals a giant-sized diamond, but is therefore forced to put it in a woman's bag. So the rest of the film sees him pass as an abandoned child, enter this women's home so he can recover this diamond. <br /> <br /> So far, I've enjoyed most of the Wayans Brothers result - but this movie is definitely taking the cookie. <br /> <br /> A little good advice - wait for it to arrive on TV or cable
