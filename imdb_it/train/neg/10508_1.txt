I thought the nadir of the horror movie had been reached with "Book of Shadows", I was wrong. This film makes "The Magnficiant Ambersons" look like compared to this piece of shameless and unexpurgated fecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a film. I will write more but I am still angry that I was idiotic enough to spend Â£ 3 for hire, reels. <br /> <br /> And these people were English? and where is the forest> I lived in the UK two thirds of my life and, as far as I know, there are no dark and unexplored woodland areas in the Midlands. The whole thing looked like a nationally trusted conifer plantation. Those angels looked like anorexic porn stars (most of them had been transformed, he did my research). I liked the bit when Judd was torn to pieces. <br /> <br /> P.S I love and admire Tom Savini but HE CANNOT ACT
