I'm studying Catalan, and I was happy to find El Mar, a film with mainly Catalan dialogues, in my art-house video store. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... not so glad to have seen it. <br /> <br /> Yes, as other reviewers have said, it is well done and beautifully photographed. Although the opening sequence of children is surprisingly violent, it is well represented and convincing. (For the most part, this is ... The Mallorquini undress a corpse in preparation for the burial right in the center of the town square, in full view of the dead 10-year-old boy?) Oh, well .. small detail Until that moment, it had something like a non-magical Pan Labyrinth, also set in the Spanish Civil War. <br /> <br /> Fast forward, and the three children who survived the opening accident came of age. Francisca is a nun who works in a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, are both patients. I know, but hey, coincidences happen. <br /> <br /> The problem, as with so many Spanish films (sorry for Almodovar fans), is that with one exception (Francisca) the characters are just so dangerous * weird *. Their motivations, personalities and dialogues are often simply incoherent. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it drops into a horrible terrible excess. Be prepared for a LOT OF pain and LOTS of blood. The auditor who called it a "pot-boiler" is quite on the right track. If it had been made 40 years ago, the manifesto would have said: SEE THE FORBIDDEN LOVE !! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! CRUELTY ON ANIMALS !! BETRAYAL!! <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is not enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters credible. To work, this should have had more flashbacks to enrich the characters. As it stands, it looks like a bizarre and depressing cross between "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" and "Pulp Fiction". If this sounds like something you need to see, by all means, have fun. I think I go with something that doesn't make me feel that I need to take a shower to wash the blood and the darkness. <br /> <br /> As for the Catalan, it is the Mallorqui dialect, quite different from the dialect of Barcelona, ​​although I was surprised by the comment that said that even the people of Barcelona apparently needed Catalan subtitles to understand it.
