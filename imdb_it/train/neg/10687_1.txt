End game started well, the least said about the end, the better. it seemed that things were happening just to keep the plot, for example the journalist who at the beginning is a very curious and intelligent person, halfway doing something really stupid and totally out of character, we are given no reason for apart from that, the next scene would make no sense without it. The whole story could have been told in about 30 minutes, it would have produced an average television political drama. The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. is however very watchable and James Woods does an admirable job considering. <br /> <br /> The end the game was honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen ...... and this is saying something, I saw Gigli.
