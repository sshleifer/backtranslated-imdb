I wouldn't call it horrible, but nothing shines in this film, and is cluttered with some really amazing basic storyline developments. It starts well, but once the main shot is over, it turns into a long subplot around a girl who isn't irresistible, and some action scenes that are absurd and unrealistic. For example there is a prolonged shooting at the airport where the lighting is all stroboscopic. No explanation for that. How credible is it that an airport storage area has lights that turn on and off in a confused way, and enough to allow Snipes to make his incredible escape attempt? This is one of the action scenes too rare and punctuated by unnecessarily drawn out set-ups that fail to induce you to suspend it. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the whole premise seems to be that the US CIA team can shoot in place, but get away with saying "national security" to the British. This trick is based on a stereotype that is very far from reality to be satisfying. <br /> <br /> There are much better action films out there. Better formulated, better executed This is fun sometimes, but there is not enough meat with bones and after a while it becomes decidedly boring - something that should never happen in a good action movie.
