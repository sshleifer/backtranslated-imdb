Unlike the others, I refuse to call this pitiful excuse for a film a triumph of style over substance (I don't want to style bad name). Still, it is the most appropriate description that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> A useless, unpleasant and ultimately meaningless assault on the eyes and ears, "Wonderland" leaves only a glimpse of why the film was made in the first place and who, healthy mind, he gave the green light to this desolate and tangled mess. A biography of the porn star John Holmes? A study of who the man was, why he entered the business and how he influenced him? Great. Tied to be compelling, destined to be fun. Tied to be enlightening and fascinating on about a million levels (and I have no interest in porn). <br /> <br /> But a confusing, violent and Rashomon-style study of a series of murders with which Holmes was tied career is over? Who the hell cares? What information do we get? This film completely ignores the most interesting aspect of the life of John Holmes - who was a porn star! "Wonderland" could also be about anyone: the fact that the main character is the most famous adult male movie star in history is almost irrelevant. <br /> <br /> To make things a thousand times worse, the photo is loaded with jerkoff gimmicks - annoying changes to machine guns, sloppy Dogme-95 cameo, graphics and unnecessary split-screen animations, etc. <br /> <br /> In the absence of a compelling story and a unique main character, the director (and I use the term freely) brought together a dozen techniques from other films and decided to call the film mess, between these: the fashionable look, in "bleach-bypass" style of "Narc" or "Traffic" or "Minority Report"; the frenetic, often incomprehensible, cut style of the in-the-air film in "Natural Born Killers" or "28 Days Later"; the soundtrack of "Goodfellas" or "Blow" of the film fills every moment of silence with a song of other times to evoke the period. the titanic and retro sequence of "Velvet Goldmine" or "Autofocus" or "Catch Me If You Can". The list could go on and on. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> I wanted to love this movie. I had high hopes for this. "Wonderland Avenue" had been around for years; if the context of the murders had been emphasized rather than the murders themselves, I think it could have worked. If the murders (and the growing involvement of Holmes in the shady types of L.A.) marked the end of a career, or the end of the swinging 70s, I think the film could have had a meaning; could have served a purpose. How it is - meaningless. Needless. Who cares how many perspectives exist on a series of murders generally unknown to the public? The case is not famous enough to deserve such scrupulous examination. <br /> <br /> This film should have been the third act of "The John Holmes Story". That's all. Period. And it could have worked. What is that? Oh, right, right, they didn't want to tell a traditional story of ascent and fall. They didn't want to create "Boogie Nights" or "Goodfellas" or "Star 80" or "Autofocus". They wanted their film to be different. Quite right? <br /> <br /> Well, in a sense, they succeeded. There is a big difference between those movies and "Wonderland". The difference is that those films are good. <br /> <br />
