No wonder this film has never seen the light of day. The time of release was terrible. The Gong Show had already "skipped the shark" when the movie was released, so who would pay the money just to see some of the clips censored by the show's original run? And the show's footage is just a little bit of this pathetic 90-minute lament by Chuck Barris about how hard his life was as a guest on the show. Did he really expect us to feel sorry for him and for his messy millionaire life? Did he really think we also wanted to KNOW about his life? (Obviously, since he later wrote his strange autobiography about his career as a CIA agent.) Did he think the gag of having everyone, the audition for him everywhere would stay cool for 90 minutes? Or the network manager who chases him at every turn? This may have worked as a plot for a 30-minute sitcom episode, but not as a full-length movie. However, it was nice to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene and the unknown comic (though, to make the film "spicy", they only included his most vulgar routines). And as someone pointed out, this is the first significant part of Phil Hartman's film (although it only lasts a minute). Note his name is written HARTMANN in the credits, which is the name by which he was born. You cannot lose his voice and facial expressions, even if he is much thinner and younger than in SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a small part; one of his first after leaving the world of soap.
