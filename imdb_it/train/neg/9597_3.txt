As much as I like Japanese movies, this has not only cut it ... A film that is supposed to be about the rebels and the survival of a royal bloodline turned out to be a very slow film with a dubious plot. br /> <br /> Photography is OK, although I've seen much better sword fighting scenes in other Japanese films, fast cameras and the way they followed characters didn't convince me at all. The soundtrack is so weak that you don't even notice its presence. But the worst thing was the evolution of the plot. I must admit that, on some occasions, I had difficulty understanding who was who and what was happening. ..The platonic love between the main character and another was completely superfluous and seemed to derive from a Hollywood influence. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are looking for a Japanese action movie this is not it. It's very slow, with very few sword fighting scenes and very sentimental ... in a wrong way ...
