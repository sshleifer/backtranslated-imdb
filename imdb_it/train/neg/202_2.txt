This is not the sound of bees, this is the effect induced by watching this extremely long film, extremely boring and misinterpreted. How come I did it through all three and a half hours without falling asleep, I'll never know. The plot is simple ... 3 absolutely unlikely idiots talk about sex for 3 hours and a half. And you thought Rohmer was mortal. This is even worse, if possible. > I really have to be a masochist if I could watch the whole movie without turning it off ... or killing someone.
