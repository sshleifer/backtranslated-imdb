What the hell is this? It's one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. I don't understand why the people on this site love it so much. His senseless and nudity for no reason. It's the worst of Resident Evil. I do not recommend it highly unless you want to watch out for chessy and bad deeds. Watch the most original films like Stephen King's It, The Shining, Jurassic Park (kinda horor), JAWS, etc. Leave this crap for a rental when there is nothing else to rent. It's ugly like Crudy against Gayson. The attack of Killer Tomatoes is better than this shit. <br /> <br /> Oh wow meat eating zombies. How many damn zobie films we need. Skip this. <br /> <br /> * outta ****
