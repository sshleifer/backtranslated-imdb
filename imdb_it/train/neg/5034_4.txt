I am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film and the few reviews that need to be positive. I saw the movie and I was pretty disappointed. I didn't find it really pleasant. It was slow, and lacking entertainment value. Even the homicide scenes are lackluster, with real close-up shots of generic stabs that don't look good at all. And the allegedly grand finale is not much, I saw it coming, and then the ending seemed a clich√©. This film may not be mentioned much, but for the little it gets, it is overrated. I would not recommend this movie.
