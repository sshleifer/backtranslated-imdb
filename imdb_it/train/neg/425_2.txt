I can't believe I'm so angry after seeing this that I'm about to write my first review on IMDb. <br /> <br /> This Disney documentary is nothing more than a Planet Earth re-done lite. Now I knew it would be advertised as "by the people who brought you the planet earth", but I had no idea that they would openly use the same cuts as the innovative mini-series of documentaries. I just paid $ 8.75 to see something I already own on DVD. Too bad for Disney for not having warned people that there is absolutely nothing original here (save a voice of James Earl Jones and 90 seconds of sailfish that I don't think existed in Planet Earth). <br /> <br /> But the biggest crime of all, is that while Planet Earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as proof that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecological change, Disney has taken that story and turned it into a tripe suitable for families. After the death of the male polar bear, they show their puppies grown significantly one year later, and they throw up some garbage on how they are ready to carry on his memory, and that the earth is really a beautiful place after all . No mention of puppies growing up waiting for death because of the same situation their father suffered, no warning of trouble for future generations if we don't agree, nothing. Just a montage of things we've already seen throughout the film (and many more times, if you're one of the billions of people who have already seen Planet Earth). <br /> <br /> I have never left the theater so well ashamed and cheated in my life.
