I saw the original unlabelled German version and I was surprised how bad this movie actually is. Thinking I saw my share of bad films like Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake and the like, nothing could have prepared me for it! It was really a pain to go through this film, because there is no plot, no acting and even the special effects are not convincing, especially the so-called zombies, who only wear white makeup and their old clothes, so their good set it would not be spoiled by ketchup and jam stains. <br /> <br /> If you really want to lose 90 minutes of your life, then look, for everyone else, not to do it, because you will regret it!
