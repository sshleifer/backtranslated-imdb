I just want to say that this production is very one-sided, it breaks the necessary impartiality if you want to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> There are no credits from the people they interviewed, so you can't get an idea if they are worth listening to. <br /> <br /> Tell the story from a single point of view. Doing this is very dangerous, because the next generations learn the bad idea, and this is why the wars keep coming. I know this is not the only reason for wars, but it doesn't help either. <br /> <br /> you can watch this documentary, but read a lot on the internet first. The Balkans are as complex as human history.
