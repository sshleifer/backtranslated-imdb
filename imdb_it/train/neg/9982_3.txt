The story begins slowly and nothing fun happens for a while. All the action is at an end, but you won't have to laugh because the film is fun, but because the plot is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The funniest part is when Harvey 'I'm not Paranoia' Keitel really loses him and the judge starts a massacre. Oscar for this guy!
