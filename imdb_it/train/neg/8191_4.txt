"Fred Claus" somehow avoids becoming "The Santa Clause" this year at least having a slightly more fun time than Tim Allen's, but it doesn't mean he has enough to go to the theater. <br /> <br /> As the films of the holidays go, it is artificial and sentimental. But in reality, that could be the last of Fred Claus' concerns, boasting about having David Dobkin ("Shanghai Knights", "Marriages") at the helm, which contains practically a really fun time as he awkwardly walks between a vehicle of Vince Vaughn crude and a blurred Christmas movie. In the end, it doesn't mean much to both. And with a cast that includes Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz and Kathy Bates, he is even more disappointed. <br /> <br /> Vaughn plays Fred, older (alienated) brother of Nick (Giamatti), who once was there, left him and their parents (Bates and Trevor Peacock) after having had enough to endure the favoritism of the his parents towards his younger brother. Nick grows up to be a Santa Claus (and as the voiceover tells us, time hangs over you and your family when you become a saint), while Fred becomes a reporter for Yuletide in Chicago who has trouble remembering her girl Wanda's (Weisz). <br /> <br /> He gets into trouble with the law and has had to call his younger brother (who strangely has at least a decade older than him) to get him out of jail. Nick agrees, but only if Fred agrees to lend a hand in the toy store in the North Pole. Fred reluctantly agrees, but his cynicism clashes with the perpetually cheerful nature of Santa and the goblins, even though an efficiency expert (Spacey) is monitoring the operations of the toy factory, too happy to have all Arctic operations closed if things fail. /> <br /> The film, as mentioned, has its moments, but the length of the padded run lengthens them for its entire duration. In between there are stacks of Christmas film clich√©s that have been better managed, for example, "Elf" and attempts at sentimentality are as captivating as last year's fruit cake. <br /> <br /> Vaugn, as usual, brings his coarse charm to the table, but Dan Fogelman's castrated script prevents him from really doing his thing. Giamatti, under the bad dress, brings an ancient charm to his iconic character, but unfortunately, he has to play the second violin with Fred. Spacey brings his game face, but his turns usually end up being unfortunately vapid. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, "Fred Claus" becomes a forgettable film that falls below what the people involved deserve. Of course, there are worse ways to start the season at the cinema, but there are certainly better ways.
