I vaguely remember Ben from my 1960s science fiction days, I was doing several interviews and biographies of obscure actors / actresses, particularly Ben, actress Fay Spain and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961 of The Young Savages. Ben was one of the people with a low level of science fiction in Chicago, in 1970, when I had a good talk with him, his "career" and his life. All of these have been published in a forgotten time fanzine. I would still like to have copies of those interviews, but time passes and none of those people surely wouldn't remember me many years later. Ben was really a nice guy, earning a living (the disadvantages of those times didn't even pay their guests, unless, of course, they were big stars, and even then the pay was a couple of hundred dollars, at most Good to know Ben is still alive and well! How about a remake of the Creature, but 50 years older! Ugly, then, uglier now!
