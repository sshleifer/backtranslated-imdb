I imagine this film is a tribute to the first Superman movie, as it is cruel and painfully long as the original. <br /> <br /> After an opening scene composed only of obscure intergalactic images, the credits pay homage to the futuristic and extravagant titles of the original Superman movie. <br /> <br /> Then there are other dark things. But Kent sees a kind of dark ruckus on the farm, and spends a good part of my life walking slowly towards some debris in the cornfield. Then Superman sneaks in and faints. <br /> <br /> Then we get in touch with Lex Luthor in a scene of many anonymous close-ups of an old lady as she dies. We don't see Luthor's face until the end of the scene, a first instance of the film's drive to leave no stone unturned. Lex Luthor is a guy who doesn't like Superman because he's not human. Also, he probably doesn't even like humans, as the film occasionally features a storyline about Lex Luthor that plans to kill most of the Earth's population. <br /> <br /> After a while, Clark Kent shows himself an old job (I forgot to mention, he had been away on a five-year journey where nothing happened). He then discovers that Lois Lane has an illegitimate child and is dating Cyclops. It upsets him so much that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a frame. <br /> <br /> At this point we see that Miss Lane is on a kind of jet attached to some type of space shuttle. It's kind of an important event because it's on television. So we learn that there are people in a control room that monitor this event. There are also people who watch it on television and there are pilots in the cockpit. The film also reminds us that these people are involved by cutting them for most of the summer. <br /> <br /> As the events leading up to the inevitable disaster began to build, I apologized for taking a soda. I accidentally returned to the wrong theater and watched that movie about Al Gore showing slides in its entirety. I tried to get back to Superman Returns, but somehow I came across Prairie Home Companion, which I saw twice in a row. Then it was time to stop joking. <br /> <br /> I returned to the first theater, found my place and looked up to see that Lois Lane's impending Space Shuttle disaster was almost there. And yet, it seemed that he wanted us forever, so I wandered through the theater, met a girl, got married, raised a son and sent him to college. While attending my son's medical degree, I remembered that I probably had to check in Superman Returns, so I apologized and ran to the theater only to learn that there was no need to hurry. It took another half hour before things went wrong for Space Shuttle Lane. When they did, Superman saved everyone, which was nice enough. <br /> <br />. And then there's a subplot where Superman gets really scary and starts chasing Lois Lane and his family with his X-ray and super-hearing vision. Then he tries to convince her to cheat Cyclops, who looks like a good guy. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lex Luthor is involved in a sort of contest to show any possible generic bad behavior before the end of the film. I forgot to take my motherboard home (they give me one at the door), but I think it marked almost one hundred percent. I hope he wins the million dollars. <br /> <br /> At this point, things start to mesh for the big, murky finish. I think maybe the projector was broken, because the movie seemed to be somehow in the loop for a while here. I remember seeing murky things growing out of the water, Superman got sick, Superman is getting better, back to dark things, he's sick again, no wait, he's okay again. <br /> <br /> Then Lex Luthor unleashed his final bad move: screaming a little at his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Then Superman died and came back to life. I thought the movie was finished, so I left. <br /> <br /> Ninety years later, the nursing home where I lived felt a little cold. I realized that I had left my sweatshirt in the theater and went to retrieve it. When I did, I was a little surprised to find that Superman Returns was not finished yet. I tried to ask some of the spectators what I missed, but most of them were just skeletons with long gray beards. <br /> <br /> I sat at my old place and watched Lois Lane walking around her house for a while. Then Superman arrived and started to mention the beginning of the film, and since I saw that part already I thought it was right to leave. <br /> <br /> So this is my review of Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> Oh, moreover, if you like jokes about people who eat dogs or jokes about a dog that eats another dog, you will love this movie. Because of the fact that there are two jokes like that.
