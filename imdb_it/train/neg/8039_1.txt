This mindless movie is a piece of shit and boring like the repetitions of the whole house. For all the people who want to see a fantastic, exciting and fun horror movie, you shouldn't even think about watching this group of mindless works. an F- in my opinion. I have a question, what were they thinking? We make a list: 1) invalid script 2) invalid script 3) invalid script 4) invalid 5) bad direction and last but not least, invalid script. I mean I don't like screaming for every movie, but I was disappointed when I saw it. This film should be banned in a box, blocked and sunk into the sea. So please don't do anything like that, please, please, please !!!!
