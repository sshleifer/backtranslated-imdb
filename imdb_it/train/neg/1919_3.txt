I have read the book a couple of times and this film does not follow exactly as it should. I could leave this slide, after all it's a movie. However I have serious problems with the setting of the film. No one seems to have mentioned that this film and the book it is based on are based on real events that happened in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the city where this film should be based. First of all, the "small" city spoken of as the setting is the third largest city in the state. With a population of around 50,000. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Second, the scenario for the film is wrong. Grand Island is located in the valley of the Platte River. Which is very flat with very few trees. I tried watching this movie, but it made me crazy to see my hometown being treated so badly. This was a real event. Large sections of the city were wiped out. In the book they talk about cycling from Mormon Island to Fonner Park. I imagine you could do it if you don't mind a 15 mile ride in any direction.
