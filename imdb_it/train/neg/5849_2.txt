Being a fan of silent films, I couldn't wait to see this picture for the first time. I was quite disappointed. <br /> <br /> As has been said, the film appears to be a long, commercial one for the Maxwell automobile. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the chase scene was about half the length, I might have enjoyed the movie more. But it has become very fast. And while I recognize that reality has spread many times in films, without diminishing the joy of the beholder, what was there in the Mexican bandits? I mean, they're chasing a car through the mountains, a car that most of the time is moving about a mile an hour, yet they can't reach it?
