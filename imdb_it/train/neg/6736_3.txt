How does he act in his effort to be a film with a competent date - and a stellar vehicle? <br /> <br /> The formula requires the cute woman to drive to Ryan or Aniston - check; there is a built-in TV audience! <br /> <br /> Add big-headed, complacent men, usually including the ex-boyfriend / boyfriend problem - check. <br /> <br /> Assemble a plot that maximizes the bankability of the stars. So far, so good. <br /> <br /> What is the role of the male protagonist? It must instantly make all women in the film and the public (and gay flight administrators) pass out. But ... he can't be crazy enough to threaten the male audience, and he can't eclipse the star.

A capable actress could have torn him off after the love scene, where things readily stepped on the soap bars. <br /> <br /> You can't help but feel good about Mulroney ... you can read it in the face that sees all this. He obtained all the respect of a lifetime of over 2.60 batters. This time, he slaps one on the warning track, and no one can figure out what to do while he is having fun at home.
