I grew up watching the original TV series of the sixties and one thing I can tell you right away, there is no comparison. This film was completely ridiculous with a flight costume that was alive. A Martian who has taken different forms. Special effects that looked like something a child would create. On the contrary, in the original, the characters were developed and viewers developed a feeling for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only salient point of this film, yes, actually there was one, occurred when Ray Walston finally made an appearance. He wore dark glasses and made references to live on this planet for 30 years as a kind of homage to the TV series. But even the real uncle Martin could not save this turkey.
