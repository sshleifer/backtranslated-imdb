The noble effort of Guy Ritchie is beaten, beaten, raped, kicked, struck, stabbed, spat, struck, sodomized and abused and left to die by Madonna's horrific performance. His acting resembled a degree from the Al Gore School of Dramatics and Public Speaking. Guy Ritchie has made a somewhat noble attempt to do this again, and if you exclude ALL of his wife's scenes, it's an honest movie at best. I think the best acting job ever is due to the fact that Guy consoled his wife that his performance was good enough not to shoot. If you have the opportunity to watch Swept Away or cut your toenails for 89 minutes ... go to the extended pedicure.
