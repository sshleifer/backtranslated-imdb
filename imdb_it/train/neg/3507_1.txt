A low point of human interaction has been reached by the Maysles brothers with this film. Remember, you who used words like "masterpiece" during the review of this film, that these monsters of Maysles didn't just drive in the Hamptons and happen to make films about some eccentric people. No, when they found these two poor pathetic people they then had to finance their project (and imagine what they said to people's money to sell the project). Then they made friends with the two extremely vulnerable women. No meeting of minds here or real consensual participation. These unfortunate Maysles smiled, kissed their asses, did everything they could to convince the Beales to cooperate and then exploited them as fiercely as ever. One would like to think that these hustlers had occasional thoughts of remorse and guilt. But the process of making the film, given the preplanning, the actual filming and editing, took a long time and their goal had no provision to actually relate to Beales as human beings. An exploitative film perpetrated by the most vile of people. Over time, their film reputation has been seriously tainted by what they have done here. Their reputation as human beings is execrable. This is what people will remember them as. Grotesque Marchette.
