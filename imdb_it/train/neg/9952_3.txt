I just sent an email to a friend who is in the film school for this movie. Something to be avoided during the making of a film - characters who confuse foolish, exaggerated and twisted monologues on the screen that in the end are trivial and unconvincing. If the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal barriers are so exaggerated as to draw attention to the film built as a film and effectively neutralize that intention. Is it the acting, or the script that is bad, or both? <br /> <br /> The protagonist is also incredibly incredible for social realism - voraciously consuming English canonical literature and the Bible while tall or hungover and capable of producing such profoundly sophomoric soliloquies while intoxicated? And how can a character so unattractive, unwashed and verbally harmful be able to accommodate most of the women he meets within minutes of meeting them? (I had to clap when a chick finally threw him into the street, despite his whining and his pitiful jokes). <br /> <br /> The viewer encounters pretentious references to ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the book of revelations. The imminent fate of humanity, in the form of barcodes imprinted on our forehead or on the right hand in spectral biblical style, is presented to a character who is so skillfully exposed in his role as guardian of the empty space. <br /> <br /> This film is overwritten and over the top - an awkwardly infused melodrama of pedestrian "philosophy" on the meaning of humanity, life, etc. It's banal, exaggerated and boring. <br /> <br /> There are some very nice English movies available with similar content to this movie. "Nil by Mouth" is an excellent excursion, much more interesting, in people's lives in a similar social environment. Ditto for "In the Warzone". And even if the comparison is not even justified, take a look at anything by Peter Greenaway, who handles dialogues, wit and absurd characters and situations much more skillfully.
