There is so little here about the fantastic book by Anne Rice that what is here makes no sense. Some characters - intense and surprising characters - don't reach the screen at all, and those who do are watered to the point that there is no reason for their existence. <br /> <br /> the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where is the relationship between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose appear at all, since her story has never been explained? Where is Marie's rape and redemption, whose greatest attribute (and ruin) is that she can pass for white - and her marriage to Richard? Why does the film end with the beating of Marcel at the hands of his father? We learn nothing of Aglae beyond the fact that she is a bitch who hates her husband; why no background that explains this hatred? <br /> <br /> As far as performance is concerned, there is not one that is better than the mediocre one, although it is likely due to the bad script. The best part is that of the actor who plays Richard, but Richard is not on screen enough to save the film. The worst thing is Jasmine Guy in the role of Dolly Rose, even if, once again, she is the actress who has nothing to do with the little she was given to work. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's just terrible. I thought it would have been impossible for any Anne Rice book to make a movie worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FESTIVAL OF ALL THE SAINTS makes this mess look like a critical blow. How is it possible that Rice is so nasty that she will allow her best works to become such a junk on the screen?
