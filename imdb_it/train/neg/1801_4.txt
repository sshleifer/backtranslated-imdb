Istanbul is another of the expatriate films that Errol Flynn was doing in the last decade of his life trying to support his family and stay out of trouble with the IRS. It is a remake of Fred MacMurray's film - Ava Gardner Singapore a decade ago. <br /> <br /> Unlike the studio product, Istanbul has the advantage of that fantastic location cinematography just at the sight of the Golden Horn. But Errol Flynn, who was exponentially aging before the camera in each film, was too old to play these types of action / adventure any longer. His scenes with Cornell Borchers are truly unconvincing. <br /> <br /> As for Cornell, he plays Errol's ex-girlfriend who through the trauma of being saved from a fire now has amnesia. He does not remember Errol and is now married to Torin Thatcher. <br /> <br /> But Errol has bad people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer who are looking for diamonds that came into his possession. I have to take care of them too. <br /> <br /> The best reason to see Istanbul is to listen to Nat King Cole singing and playing the piano. Most people today do not realize that Cole was a successful jazz pianist, they only think of him as a singer. In reality he was a pianist first, singing was an afterthought. <br /> <br /> Istanbul is a routine action / adventure film for those who are fans of that type of film.
