The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a psychiatric institution after starting to believe that she is actually a cyborg. In the institution he meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this you probably already know how talented the Chan-wook Park is. But "I'm A Cyborg ..." is a great departure from the familiar territory and (unfortunately) stronger. I'm a big fan of any movie or story that is trying to do something different. God knows, we have all been subjected to enough bullshit in our local cinemas. The main point of the film I have to say is that it can't say anything about mental illness, or create a character that interests you. <br /> <br /> This story must be one of the strangest things I've seen over the years ... but strange is not enough. There is no heart for the film ... only surrealism and confusion. The confusion seems to be the main theme of the film. The characters try to make sense of their problems, but Chan-wook Park himself proves to be the most confused of all.
