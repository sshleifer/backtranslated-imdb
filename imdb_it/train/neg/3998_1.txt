Can you say "All shock, no plot?" There were so many unexplored directions in this film. There was no history of the room other than the deaths. * WHY * was he evil? What did you do that way? Why a "now" countdown? Then there were the suggested unexplored things; for example we have * seen * a camera in the air intake, which he mentioned. But when he climbed the fan, there was no camera. <br /> <br /> What about the fact that all the ghosts seemed "digital", and things "went out" before hitting the ground making a static noise? Hmmm ... when you put all * those * things together, it makes room 1408 look like a high-tech ghost house. Except there was no follow-up on this. <br /> <br /> Oh ... by the way ... the electronics don't work in 1408. Well, except for the TV ... the phone has no signal, but wireless Internet is working properly. How many continuity could you add? I'm sorry, but this film was nothing but "shock after shock". It has already been done before. Reflections in the mirror. Things just off the site. Changing paintings. Bleeding walls The "Oh, it was all just a dream ... no it wasn't." And, if the room was "evil", why make our main character come to terms with his daughter's death, if he intended to keep him trapped there forever anyway? It just didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Also, there was no basic information on "The first book" he wrote. Just some vague information about "dad was an idiot" and so on. Speaking of Dad, what was that about his father? "You will be in my place". <br /> <br /> Overall, a really HORRIBLE movie. It was the 100% adrenaline rush factor, with no new or innovative effects, and certainly without retrospective, character development, etc. <br /> <br /> My overall impression is that the whole movie was made on "Cheap"; practically using a set and a couple of outdoor shots, and it was nothing more than a film of effects of recycled effects, of cheese, "seen before".
