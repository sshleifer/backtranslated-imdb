Apparently Stephen Stephen Cannell decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and delight in horror. The result, "Dead Above Ground", is an abysmal piece of garbage. Now, if I had noticed his name in association with THIS film in particular, I would have put it back but no, I didn't have glasses and so I lost it, dammit, I really need to take them with me while video shopping. The first question would be, who the hell is the target audience for this? It's almost like a "scary" children's movie, but then again there are topless girls and some blood and some swear words here and there. The main characters are so cute that you want to see someone, someone, chase them with SOME farming tools. It seems that a boy opens a bed and breakfast that has a checkered past, a murderous witch of children who picked up the teeth of children there. Probably something the real estate agent didn't mention. Obviously now, today, there is a little ghost girl around to warn the live girl that now lives there that something bad is about to happen. He does, and there are also two Bubbas who were squatting on that property when the new owner took over, so they too are out for revenge. All this has the feeling of a stuff made for the cables which is for children of Halloween, except, of course, for things that are not suitable for small children, so not only is it mediocre, it is also confusing. A great whistle and hiss in Anchor Bay for having published it, considering their usual track record with excellent releases this is a new low. The UK gets a Phantasm Box Set, we get "The Tooth Fairy". It hardly seems right. 1 in 10, absolute garbage.
