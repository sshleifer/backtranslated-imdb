As a film critic for several Dutch websites, I have to see many films, and not all of them very good. Some movies are so bad, it won't surprise you that they are published directly on video. With taboos, I'm surprised he was released on video. This is a nasty, poorly written low budget junk. <br /> <br /> A group of young people play a game of taboo. They write about their most disgusting desire or act, and then people are killed for their taboos. The question is: should we believe what we see? <br /> <br /> The film has an interesting and interesting plot, and I will not give it here. But what could have been interesting remains stupid, misinterpreted and without any reason. <br /> <br /> Some actors have already played in bigger titles, so why have they signed up for this? If you see this anywhere, try to dodge it. There is no logic, no human sense of quality in this film.
