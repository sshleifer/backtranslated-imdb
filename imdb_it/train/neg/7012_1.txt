My girlfriend and I went to see this movie as a "Premiere Surprise" that we bought at the ticket for a movie preview before it opened here in Denmark. We sat through the first hour or so and then we left! The point of the film seemed to be simply to portray the era (and the club 54), but did so provided the character's development, of which there was none, and the plot of which there was little. <br /> <br /> I have rarely been so indifferent to the characters in a movie! <br /> <br /> The music was still good. So, if you like listening to good music and getting a 70s mood fix, I guess it's OK. But don't expect to get a plot of believable characters. <br /> <br />
