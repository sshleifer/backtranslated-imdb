The film was TERRIBLE !!! Easily the worst movie I've seen in recent years. One of those films I will be able to tell people for the next three years that it was the worst movie I could think of. Thank you for giving me an answer to that burning question "What is the worst movie you've seen?" Answer: Celestine prophecy. Trust me ... I read the book, I enjoyed the message and I was happy to see the movie, but then they treated the audience like we were late. There is no history and the story that is there is paralyzed by too much magic and coincidence. Too bad they have to explain the nine prophecies and they can't just put them into a story that's fun to follow. They didn't spend time developing the character and it was easy not to worry if a character died. It was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stopped at the end of this incredibly boring movie. Even the book is rather boring, but I liked the parallels that can be seen in everyday life as you read the book. The film does not offer the same opportunity and I would suggest not seeing it if you want to keep the words of the book close to your heart. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Trust me.
