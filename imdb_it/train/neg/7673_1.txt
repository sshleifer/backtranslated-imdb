I do not know where to begin. Tara Reid must be stopped before she puts another movie. Stephen Dorff seems to have received the motivation of his character from Val Kilmer in "Top Gun". Slater sleepwalkers through this dreck. Direction, editing, sound (do we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of a gunfight?), Costumes (bulletproof vests with muscles on them), and hey, there's not even a recognizable plot . It amazes me that no one attached to the project stopped and said, "hey guys, this doesn't make any sense, let's start again." We hope that Slater's career can recover from this disaster. <br /> <br /> Down the worst movie I've ever seen.
