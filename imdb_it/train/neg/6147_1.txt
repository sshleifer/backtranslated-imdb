I don't really get all the adulation that this film has received. It is mushy, unnecessarily manipulative and avoids many of the big questions - namely Nash's affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places. This, I suppose, in the context of a commercial Hollywood movie is almost tolerable, but what's all the praise for Russell Crowe's performance? Does the man just seem to mix, holding his briefcase and wearing a ramshackle hat and somehow it seems to be a nice acting? Anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realize that Crowe's performance is not very caricatured. It is also rather offensive. And, dare I say, just the right side of being really terrible
