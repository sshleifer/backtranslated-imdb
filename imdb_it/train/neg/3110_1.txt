I usually come to this site before going to the movies, because I like to see what others think about the film. I read many reviews that said "the thriller is not a horror film". This led me to try this movie. I really have to argue with these "thriller / horror" statements, because it wasn't even the one or the other! I almost went to ask for my money back, and if many reviewers liked this garbage ... well, you have to be easily satisfied! At the end of the film, the people behind me said aloud "what a waste of time" and I turned to them and replied "I could not have summarized it better". I kept waiting for something to happen ... but it's not like that. There was the potential for a lot of good scares (or emotions if you want) but nothing happened. Williams played the part quite well, but I heard that it was a brief change from a poor screenplay that went around and went nowhere. Save your money, folks, this is a turkey that will be present in a 'business box' DVD store near you in a very predictable future!
