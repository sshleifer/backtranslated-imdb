Slaughter High the story of the revenge of a nerd who fell victim to one of the coldest and coldest jokes in the history of cinema. Unfortunately after the promising opening the shot went straight to hell. A very boring and redundant mess with mediocre cuts and a last half hour that sucked a new level of suction. The guy who played the nerd actually committed suicide shortly after the film was released. If you want to rent the movie, stop it after the joke and remember, choose life.
