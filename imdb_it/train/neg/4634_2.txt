obviously she has an added talent, Maria Bello is always great. but this is just a sad wasted time, which portrays every character as someone to detest and exploit so that someone can make a film from an "interesting" story. Well, I hope they pulled it out of their systems. unfortunately for the public, there is no intuition, no sensitivity, no context and really no humanity. that everything would be fine, except that it has no humor, no horror, no context, and nothing constructive to say about the story it is trying to tell. bad things happen, you sit and watch it, you don't care, then? 99% of the time the words "based on a true story" constitute an involuntary warning to the public. means that the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some events they've heard about somewhere, so they simply throw them on the screen and expect the "true" nature of the story to make the audience hear something without the directors do any of the work. I hope they had a great time making this film. It smells like ice.
