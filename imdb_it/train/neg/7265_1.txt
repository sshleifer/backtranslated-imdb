I just saw this at the Chicago Film Festival: avoid it at all costs unless you have trouble sleeping. It's a film full of pretensions - it opens with a minor quote from "Hiroshima mon amour" and it's all downhill from there. Photographic work: imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai. History: Smokey Robinson and the Miracles "The love I saw in You Was Just a Mirage" has been extended from 3 minutes to over 2 hours, but full of repetitions. For the pain from numbness in the ass, this film aligns with the banks of the Methodist church that the parent dragged me to when I was a child. I want 2 hours of life reimbursed. The promoter of Julian Hernandez preceded the vision by commenting that the film was "controversial" - this is true only for the narcotic effect of the film.
