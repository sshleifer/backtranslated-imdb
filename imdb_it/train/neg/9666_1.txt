Having seen "Triumph of the Will", I can only say that this film is horrible, even measured against the historically low "standards" of the time. Of course it is all completely invented and prejudicial. This is what one would expect from 1930 German propaganda. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation, in itself, is trivial and cheap. It is also so patently ridiculous that even contemporary Germans must have left the theater holding onto their noses. In a genre known for its basic appeal, lack of originality and its irreproachable impotence, this film does not even qualify as "bad". It should improve significantly to reach this state!
