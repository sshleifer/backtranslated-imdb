This absolutely boring, senseless, meaningless, spiritless and stupid film is not the final proof that the world can forget Danny Boyle and his post-films "Trainspotting": "The Beach" has already taken care of this. What this low-budget oddity does is simply to secure its place among those who have started very well but have completely lost themselves in drugs, alcohol, ego, self-delusion, mismanagement or whatever led to the rapid disappearance of this once a promising director. <br /> <br /> The premise is absurd: two losers (Ecclestone and some children Jenna G - a rapper, probably) meet by chance and spontaneously begin to sing with fervor more like the inhabitants of an asylum than to a potential duo success - they become. A friend of theirs - an even bigger illiterate loser - becomes their manager by destroying a shop window and stealing a video camera with which he takes them in "action", and then shows the tape to some people in the music who actually show interest in this junk. Now, I know the UK has distributed incredible garbage over the past few years, but this is ridiculous; music makes Oasis look like the Beatles. During studio recordings, the duo - Strumpet - changes the text into each outlet and Ecclestone arrogantly says to the music biz that take it or leave it, and rather absurdly do it. Music is not just total and total rubbish, but its "performers" are anti-social; these NEWCOMERS should call the shots. It's too stupid. It's just awful. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is not fun and goes nowhere, and this shitty, bitch-like story makes no sense and makes no sense. He often feels improvised - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a complete idiot. This little piece of trash is so ugly that it's embarrassing to watch. Etc. I.Q. he must also be questioned for agreeing to be part of this nonsense. Anyone who has funded this 1000 pound joke should leave the movie business before they end up selling their underwear on street corners.
