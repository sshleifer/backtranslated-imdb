I would personally advise people to stay away from this movie. Overall it's a bore to watch and the fight is badly choreographed. Slow and not very convincing. If you buy the Hong Kong Legends DVD release of this movie, the only thing worth listening to is Bey Logan's audio commentary. <br /> <br /> But in any case, ever since there was a Ninja movie worth noting Watching. I can't think of one and frankly I don't want it. <br /> <br /> Overall, when it comes to movies, I have a golden rule: avoid any film that contains the word "Ninja".
