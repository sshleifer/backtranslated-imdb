This show is not intelligent. This is basically what it is reduced to. The "original humor" that these writers try to pull out to avoid completely biting the rest of the worlds, is just a little unattractive. In another comment, someone mentions a couple of hilarious jokes. The hype for me was George H.W. Bush tells the children that they should not watch any TVs other than Fox News. Wow. I thought the episodes I saw were bad. The fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic. <br /> <br /> My problem with the drivel as this sad excuse for political satire is that these people are getting a second season. I am a liberal republican and I know that Bush was not a good president. We all do. But this is not an excuse to take this huge waste of time out. I put these writers on the same level as the genes behind "Meet the Spartans". Their formula, bites the largest number of topical jokes already inappropriate that you can and throws even more original material to be able to give you writing credits. <br /> <br /> Once again, simply ugly. Unfunny, and it makes me more and more unhappy that shit like this is renewed, but surprising and original shows like arrested development are canned after 3 solid seasons. Please don't look at this shit, unless you're one of those green-blooded liberal hippies who think any sentence with the words Bush is stupid is the gold of comedy. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Bush's voice sucks. All he does is lightly emulate a Texan accent, and exhale very hard at the end of his sentences. At least South Park admits that the rumors are not accurate. If you want a funny political satire, look at the Daily Show / Colbert. Or look for political sketches on Robot Chicken, which is fun to watch, since stop motion action animation is EXTREMELY well done. Look for the George Bush as a jedi bit on youtube. priceless
