I don't see how anyone who likes Van Damne also likes this movie. <br /> <br /> The film actually starts with some promise. I would say that the action scenes at the beginning of the film are excellent. Action scenes with the family department trying to save the twins are a great start and a good example for the main story. However, the film is all downhill from there. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise. These are the brothers born in different parts of the world and therefore learn different skills. A brother should be an expert in Martial Arts, but the other brother should be an expert in firearms. How comfortable when the time comes when the brother who never took a gun first suddenly is a great shooter, and the brother who was not taught any martial arts suddenly does the splits and the high kicks . br /> <br /> The plot, the action, etc. they are simply ridiculous. My favorite scenes? How about when Van Damne is facing a soldier armed with an AK-47. The soldier is about 100 meters away. Instead of aiming and shooting at Van Damne, he is making a war cry as if he is wielding a battle ax and running towards him. Van Damne continues to take a gun from a fallen soldier and shoots him, ... while he is still about 75-80 meters away. <br /> <br /> This film has one of the most disappointing endings. Bolo Yeung is a skilled martial artist. However, instead of choreographing a decent fight. Bolo launches barrels to Van Damne as Donkey Kong. Absolutely aggravating film that has had so many promises. If you are a Van Damne fan, save time and see Hard Target or one of his previous movies.
