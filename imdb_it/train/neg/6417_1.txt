How comments like what the high school girls had the title they do it even on this site, this was the most stupid movie I've ever seen, it was ridiculous, how can a moron sit there and say it just because a movie you making jumping is a good movie, that might be the most idiotic thing I've ever heard, I could creep up behind you and go "Boo" and blow you up, but that doesn't mean that I'm qualified to write or direct a movie, not to mention the fact that "they tied everything together in the end" is not a good reason why a film is well received. What kind of film would it be if they didn't tie everything together, I guess it would be a half film, not a whole movie. So basically this idiot girl is complimenting them for finishing the film, well, I like how young people today take media and production houses to such a high level. No wonder the political system of this country can get away with what they want, we have idiots like those that are coming to our country, what would happen if this girl ended up doing something, a terrifying thought. Take a life and go see a real movie sometimes, try Shawshank Redemption or On the Waterfront, or something like that, and don't comment that it was "boring" after seeing it, just use the little brain that God gave you for analyze a little.
