We can start with acting in wood but this film is a disaster. Having grown up in New York, I can tell you that this film is an insult to anyone familiar with the community or people. I'm not even a defender of culture in any way and I've discovered that this is a Hollywood piece of garbage to adapt to one's presentation and language of fiction and ridiculous culture that anyone who knows Seinfeld knows is inaccurate. This is a colossal waste of time and, worse still, it is not exactly interesting since the result is obvious and the comparison scenes are ridiculous. Who acts this way? Nobody. <br /> <br /> The writer's name seems to be Israeli or something of the sort but it is clear that he has not the slightest idea of ​​the subject he is writing about. Looking at his biography, it is shocking that he lived in New York and wondered how much connection he had with the community. Even mediocre films like "A Stranger Among Us" are better and closer to the truth of this dreck. Reading the credits of this guy it's no wonder he wrote scripts on all the C quality films that somehow characterize the stars. shocking. Maybe he knows someone because this script is even below par for a bad Dolph Lundgren movie.
