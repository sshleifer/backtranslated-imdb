I can't believe I saw him again last night after more than 25 years ... <br /> <br /> Some time ago I saw 6 Fu films in a row ... Boris Karloff and all 5 Chris Lees. The last 2 Lees, both directed (and I use this word freely) by Jess Franco, were abominable. At the moment, I skipped this one, remembering that, in a sense, it was ALSO PURE. <br /> <br /> Well, I looked at it. Never again. Do you know what's worse than an abominable movie? A piece of S *** really GOOD. And that's what the FIENDISH plot is. It's a VERY nice movie. GREAT production design, set design, costumes, music, photography, editing, mostly good cast, decent acting ... <br /> <br /> ... and absolutely, positively, one of the WORST SCRIPTS in the history of cinema !! !!! AAAUGH !!!!! The first minute of the movie is so deceptive ... you could confuse this for a decent movie. And then they start singing "Happy birthday to Fu" ... and it goes downhill. Having Burt Kwouk (whose master says "Your face ... is familiar") accidentally spills Fu's elisir vitae to put out a fire, being sentenced to torture, burial and the closure of one of his ears, it was the closest thing to what they had fun. It was as if someone had decided they wanted to make a "campy" movie - so ridiculous it would be fun. RIDICULOUS, it is ... FUN ... it is NOT. It's sad, because it's clear in the first few minutes that someone did a lot of research on the Fu Manchu series to get so much "right". With a different script - or really A FUN, or a dead EVENING, they could have ... could have ... SHOULD have ... have a classic in their hands. A film that could have made us forget the horror of those atrocities of Jess Franco ... instead of forcing them to find them as masterpieces, by comparison. <br /> <br /> There was a period in the late 1970s when a whole series of classic 30s characters were revived in films that were universally terrible. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, The Lone Ranger, Charlie Chan, even Doc Savage. I'm not sure, this could be the worst of all. It took a great deal of self-restraint not to go fast on whole sections of it, especially in every scene containing Sid Caesar (the head of the FBI who was also Al Capone's cousin ... do you understand what I mean?). It's not just that the ideas in the film aren't funny ... they often don't give SENSE. Like when they "audit" police officers to impersonate the king and queen, and we end up seeing people "audition" like ballroom routines like singing, dancing and riding a unicycle. How many drugs had to take the authors of this thing because it made sense to them? <br /> <br /> As I said, a real shame ... and a real waste of all that talent, including that of Peter Sellers (who played both Fu and Nayland Smith), Burt Kwouk (who had been in Chris Lee Fu film in his time), Helen Mirren (the police woman who foolishly falls in love with the villain and damn near steals the last half hour of the movie!). I'm starting to wonder if anyone will ever make a "real" movie of Fu Manchu, or if fans have to settle for the fact that Karloff is almost the ONLY one?
