There is no reason why I can understand why this film was ever made. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood have to keep turning out a horrible update of one classic after another? (Cases in question: Mister Magoo, The Avengers - horrible!) <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd, who usually amuses me, was so miserably discontented in this role. His manic portrayal of our beloved "Uncle Martin" is so unspeakably unfair as to be almost criminal. His complaints, grunts, grimaces and histrionics give us no reason to worry about his character except as a one-dimensional cartoon character. <br /> <br /> The director must have thought that the fast movements, the screaming dialogues and "one-take" slapstick had some resemblance to the play, apparently he told EVERY ACTOR to act as if they had red ants in their pants. <br /> <br /> The fault must lie with the irresponsible script I think the writer used "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" as an example of a good play. maniacal is the classic of 1963, it is far superior to this claprap - in fact - suddenly it seems rather good in comparison. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this film is that it must have been apparently written to appeal to young children I am not sure who the children for whom it was created are for sure, no self-respecting children and cards I know! <br /> <br /> If they had to redo "My Favorite Martian", why they haven't added a bit of the timeless charm of the classic original and? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, IMDB.com cannot consider "zero" as a rating for its readers, this is the only assessment that comes to mind when describing this disguise. <br /> <br /> A good one The thing came from this movie, the actors and crew were paid - I think.
