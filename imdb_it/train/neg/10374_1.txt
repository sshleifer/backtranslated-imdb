A family moves to an old house in Japan. But there is an outlet is infested (BOO !!!). Aw, I didn't want to blow you up. It's just a Solve review. Ahem, however, is now haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife and his lover in slow motion. This naturally makes a 3-minute scene that extends to around 7 or 8. Aggressive. Horrible story. But how bad can you ask? Well, it was so bad that my brain started to melt and leak through the nose in a reflexive drip. It was so bad when Doug McClure came on the screen. I prayed you had Small Wonder flashbacks (Yes, I know Doug was in "Out of this world" and not "Small Wonder", but it's pretty much the same damn show, & I can better hum the "little wonder" theme. There are films that are so bad that they are good, this is not one of those <br /> <br /> where I saw it: Showtime Beyond <br /> <br /> My Grade: F- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Mako Hattori gets topless, Susan George gets 2 love scenes (one nude, one barely topless) <br /> <br />
