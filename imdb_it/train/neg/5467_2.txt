What to say about this film. Well, it's a group of good students who have bad drugs and turn into delinquent students who sell more bad drugs to people. Two of these people have negative effects when he turns into a type of toxic avenger and his girlfriend throws some creatures that grow in the basement of the school. That's all there is to it and they stretch it for 84 minutes. This film is pretty ugly and should be closed forever. Although this is not right, some people like Troma movies and can watch it if they want. The Troma movies for me, though, are the worst movies out there. I just saw this for morbid curiosity.
