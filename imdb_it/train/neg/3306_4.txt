A very "simple" old lady, desperate for money to save house and property, grows "pots" in her home, smokes it with some old friends and then sells it. This is the story of this low-key comedy, which highlights the absurdity of the situation and the humor that the situation entails. For most of the movie, it works. Humor is not a variety that makes you laugh, but it does entertain you for an hour and a half, so I think it serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> There are fun moments and Brenda Blethyn is fun to watch in the lead role. But the ending really ruined a "cute" movie with insulting-bad messages that only the ultra-liberals of the film world would like to see happen. <br /> <br /> Like most people, I would prefer a happy ending, too, but it should not be all hot and blurry for those who openly violate the law. Here too there are the typical (1) children out of wedlock but this poses no problem and is considered okay; (2) clerics portrayed as morally weak people; and (3) even a doctor who is stoned, too! <br /> <br /> Hi? And do reviewers here blow up Hollywood? This is the exhibition A of how a secular society has lowered standards in the United Kingdom and in Europe in general. Hey, folks: at least have a trace of morality instead of nothing but a message from Timothy Leary "If it feels good, do it".
