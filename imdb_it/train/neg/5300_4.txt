I'm one of the millions of Columbo employees around the world and I've just watched this, the episode that started it all, on British Channel 5. It's fascinating to think about what came out of this movie so much and I can only wonder who noticed the great potential of "Columbo" and added all the little touches that make it a wonderful and classic series. That being said, this particular film is not as good as the rest (except for the embarrassing final episode and the paternalistic British episode). If Columbo had been built according to the original "pilot", it certainly would NOT have gone on for a long time, or it would have been watched and loved all over the world. In this film, Lt Columbo is elegantly dressed, drives a normal car, has a partner, does not talk about his alleged relatives and turns out to be rather aggressive. There is not even the chemistry of the cat and the mouse between Columbo and "the bad guy". Watchable, but only for the novelty of seeing how Columbo was born.
