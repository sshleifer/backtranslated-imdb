Trust me, this is a disappointing film that you want to avoid and that comes from a huge Denzel Washington fan. The frustrating part is that it's 1/3 of a BIG movie. The first part of this film does an exceptional job in creating the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl who was paid to protect. The trailers of this film say she was kidnapped. So, I'm not giving anything to anyone when I say that the movie degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess after it has been kidnapped. Whatever the director was trying to accomplish, all he can do is make the audience literally nauseating. The quick, frantic and wavy cuts follow for the next half hour when Creasy tracks down the authors. These cuts are so unnatural and sickening that all they do is get you out of history. I'm sure the director thought that this disturbing way of presenting the story meant a change in the character of Creasy and meant that a different film had to follow. Well, he was right. The film that followed was complete and unsatisfying crap. The result is a depressing ending that also ruins the quality of the first forty minutes of the film.
