I just saw Adam Had Four Sons for the first time and the thing that struck me is that I believe the model used was Theodore Roosevelt and his four children. They were about the same age as the four boys in this film. Warner Baxter in his portrait of Adam Stoddard spoke of the same values ​​and the same family tradition that you would have heard from our 26th president without some of the more blatant aspects of the TR character. <br /> <br /> Like all Stoddard sons, like all TRs, in World War I, in this case even if the youngest loses an eye instead of being killed. <br /> <br /> But what happens if a female minx enters this all-male house and upsets things? This is Susan Hayward's work here. In one of his first prominent roles, Hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries a son, has a relationship with another and starts playing a game for the third. It is an early precursor of the kind of a part that later brought her an Oscar in I Want to Live. I suppose that with such a powerful decorating model as Theodore Roosevelt was and Warner Baxter interpreters, everyone is afraid to tell dad what's going on. The children and also their housekeeper Ingrid Bergman. That's where the plot gets a little silly. Bergman is introduced to us as a housekeeper hired by Baxter and his wife Fay Wray for their children. Wray dies and Baxter undergoes some financial transfers in the business world. Bergman must be released. He returned to France and years later returned to the family when the children grew up. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can't believe that children need a housekeeper now. Hayward is right when he confronts her that it is not the children who bring her back. In the normal course of things, Bergman would go on with his life. <br /> <br /> One of the previous reviewers said that a quarter or a third of the film I have been modified. Perhaps that could be the reason for the many holes in the plot that we have. <br /> <br /> Too bad Ingrid and Susan couldn't make another film together in the fifties when Hayward was at his peak and Bergman had just made a comeback. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the main reason to see Adam Had Four Sons. And I'm willing to believe that a good part of Ingrid was left on the floor of the editing room.
