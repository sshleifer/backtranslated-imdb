Before watching "Dahmer", I thought that no film could be worse than "Freddy Got Fingered". I was wrong. To sum up "Dahmer", this is a story about a murderous serial killer who kills almost nothing and consists almost entirely of Dahmer's encounters with gay men before they were killed. There is no plot to find, and it is no use to tell us something about "Dahmer". All you will learn about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked having sex with men. Horrible acting, horrible direction, horrible writing, all horrible ... If you have to choose between watching "Dahmer" and projecting vomit for three hours, go with vomiting ... it will be less painful .....
