OK, I found this movie in my dad's old pile of movies and it looked very nice from the cover, but the movie was actually sucked !! OK, the first story with the swimmer was pretty good but it took a while to get in, then the one with the boy was completely delayed! It wasn't even scary! His dream seems like a fairy tale about a baby's bedtime. Then the news girls were also completely delayed. I'm sure someone will call the reporter and ask him to go out with you. But that cooled where he stabbed him and she was in the hospital and she saw him on t.v and he told all that garbage to her. Then there was that beautiful gay story about the guy who brought dead people back to life ... It's so stupid that I'm not going to add anything else. The last one was the best. It wasn't that scary, but the idea of ​​the story was pretty nice ... yes the girl is possessed and kills all her classmates or something. Then, when they have finished telling each other their dreams, the losers get on the bus (A HELL AHAHAHAH) and see all the people from their dreams on the bus (Ha). The end.
