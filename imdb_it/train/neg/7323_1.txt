Well ... unlike other comments written previously, I have to say that the only good thing about this film is the fact that a guy looked a bit like Jason Donavon who reminded me of my youth. I have no idea how he won any awards, and though I'm sure a lot of effort has been made to make it worthless, since the end result is the screams of the 90s soap operas. The plot was non-existent, the cinematography was hopeless and the acting was on par with a level performance. It was unfortunately long and the secondary plots were incredibly unrealistic ... for example ... if your best friend slept with your 6 year old ex boyfriend after only 2 weeks of separation, the best of friends would not remain. It was all fantasy. That's all! Oh yes, and the strange house of the 90s / indie soft core was shocking!
