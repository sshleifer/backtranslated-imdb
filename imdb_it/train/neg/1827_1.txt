Envy has some of the best. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler and the great Christopher Walken. With such a cast, one can expect only the best. However, with "Envy", no one could save this disaster. <br /> <br /> Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are best friends and co-workers in a sandpaper factory. Both are making a decent living, but since Tim has a better performance at work, he is able to afford more than his friend Nick. Nick is a dreamer who always finds new ideas for inventions. One day, Nick arrives with the idea of ​​a spray that makes the dog poop disappear (yes, I'm serious). Falling in love with the idea, Nick decides to really invent this product. He makes an offer to Tim to invest in his idea and share 50/50 profits. Tim refuses to think that the idea will never work. <br /> <br /> Nick's invention, entitled "va-poo-rize" (again, I'm serious), ends up earning millions. He likes spending his money on things like a much bigger house, a horse, a personal trainer and imaginative deserts. Tim begins to envy Nick. Hence the name of the film. <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad, but it is still horrible. This film contains some of the worst dialogues and the very poor performances of the whole cast. Then again, as I said before, none of them could save this mess. Even the great Christoper Walken, playing a homeless character called "J-man", made this movie funny. The film is ugly from the beginning and continues to deteriorate. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if: * you like to suck (it's not a pun) * you want to see Jack Black in a white tux <br /> <br /> I say, avoid this movie at all costs, but ESPECIALLY avoid if: * you are offended by the mood in the bathroom * love animals
