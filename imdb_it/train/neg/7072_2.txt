My title sums up this pile of shit I should have mentioned when I saw it was a Fred olen Ray movie - but I thought 'HEY, IT COULD BE BETTER THAN HIS RUBBISH US', I was wrong! This must be the worst film ever for children. The acting was horrible, the humor was non-existent, The Direction was the worst I've ever seen and the special effects wouldn't have seemed out of place in a 1950s Disney movie. <br /> <br /> WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENED DEE-WALLACE STONE! Who had such a promising career in the 1980s. The movie veteran and former child actor Russ Tamblyn was a nasty villain and the budget was so low that it was absolutely incredible even as a children's movie. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the sequel done in 1999 and I mean <br /> <br /> If you want a film for good children Look 'HONEY I SHRUNK / BLEW UP THE KIDS / KID' OR ANY MOVEMENT BY DISNEY <br /> <br /> MY EVALUATION OF A 19 YO: - 2/10 <br /> <br /> RATING AS A KID MOVIE: - 3/10 AT THE BEST!
