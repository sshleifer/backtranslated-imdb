What is this? A zombie movie produced in Canada that I've never heard of before. A mortician works on the body of a young deceased. This allows an extended flashback that shows how the guy got there. Basically, he and his friends went to a cemetery on Friday the 13th and resurrected thanks to his silly singing. Cut out at the morgue where our corpse comes back to life and kills the mortician and the owner (who lets his eyes escape). The final WTF? shot the owner of the funeral home with a straight jacket and shouting "I'm not crazy!" Surprisingly, he has his eyes back. <br /> <br /> Performing a short 58 minutes, this is certainly an oddity in the zombie cinema. It feels much longer, but it put me in a sort of trance where I couldn't stop watching. The film also has one of those "if you see this image, turn the screen". It is the image of an old man who gets sick in a (prophetic?) Theater and when it appears (only twice) the blood begins to flow. The scenes are rather harmful for the period of time. There is a big gaffe in which a zombie cuts off a girl's right hand with a shovel, but - when he pulls his fake hand into the frame to chew - it's a left hand.
