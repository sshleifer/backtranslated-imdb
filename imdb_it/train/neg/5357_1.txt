I do not know where to begin. This film looks very similar to one of those cheap Saturday morning shows that they used to do in the late eighties and early nineties. A bit like Capitan Power or Power Rangers. It is full of ugly digital overlays and really "secret agencies" and bad sounds. <br /> <br /> Acting is so bad that it's not even funny. The direction is terrible and there is little continuity from now on. It looks like someone just threw a lot of scenes together and forgot that there had to be a plot. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the film's most ridiculous scenes arrives early, when several villains plant an explosive device movie in an agent's car. For some reason, even if the device is clearly declared as "detonated at a distance", the bad guys decide to chase it on their motorcycles as it moves away. This pursuit continues. all the time with the bad guys who do ridiculous and absolutely useless stunts. Stand on bikes, do wheelies and so on. At one point, an accident occurs and one of the attackers is thrown from his bike, we see the bike (clearly CGI) thrown on the agents' car but the pilot has vanished. Then, a few seconds later, the pilot and the bike return ... apparently unharmed by the accident. At this point, even if the car has an explosive device, the attackers choose to shoot the agent as they pass, then blow up his car. Which was also clearly done with CGI. Does it sound confusing? It is, and so is the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I could point out that when I say cgi, we're not talking about Lord Of The Rings cgi here. We are talking about the economic type of the Power Rangers cgi, actually I think it would have been better on the Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> Because Savini and Todd have made this film that I will never know, I can only assume that it was made for money, as a favor to someone or because they were blackmailed into it ... probably the last one.
