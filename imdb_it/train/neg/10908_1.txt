NOTHING in this film is fun. I thought the premise, giving a human being the libido of a randy ram, was interesting and should provide some laughter. MISTAKEN! There is simply nothing funny in the film. For example, the main character who takes a ride in a goat in heat in the middle of a farmer's yard is not fun, it borders on obscenity. They are playing with bestiality in this movie on one level, and it's not funny at all. <br /> <br /> We all know that dogs will eat anything, anywhere, anytime. The main character who does this with everything, anywhere, isn't funny at all times. Become a clich√©. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is, I believe, acceptable in the role. By this, I mean that he is not a bad actor, but with poor material it is difficult to comment on the quality. However, Coleen Haskell, the other half of the HUMAN romantic conductors (do you also count the number of animals that the main character has an interest in as he leads romantic?), Seems embarrassed by the whole thing, as it should be. He seems to be acting in a kind of emptiness, detached from all the other actors in the film. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you want to be bored with bland, boring and repetitive material.
