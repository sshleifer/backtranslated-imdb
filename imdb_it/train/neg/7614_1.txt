This could be one of the worst movies I've ever been in production, ever. <br /> <br /> 1. The most exciting part is the beginning, where the boy is walking ... and walking ... and walking (spoiler). There are about 15 minutes of walking. Such as? <br /> <br /> 2. Not to mention the problems with lighting, and it's almost as if they even shot night scenes during the day. <br /> <br /> 3. The acting was TERRIBLE. They seem to have found a community theater (in Mexico) ... and then they took the people who were removed. <br /> <br /> Please, for the sake of all that is holy, do not rent this movie. If you know someone who owns it, apologize to them. The director should be subject to punishment through the war crimes tribunal for dropping him on the public.
