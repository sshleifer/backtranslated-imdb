I don't even know where to start on this. "It's all about the family." This must be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a "horror" film, even if this could not be a horror film, even if it were tried !!! Ugh !!! And I know that Owen Wilson is a better actor. He must stop playing the token that dies in every action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, the man wrote "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore" together. He has some talent. Also, Lily Taylor should stick to independent films. You have no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star. There is no room for legitimate acting for her. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, EVER.
