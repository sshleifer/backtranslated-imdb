Could this have been interesting ?? a story of haunted houses in Japan from the point of view of a newly installed American family? but falls to the ground due to over-simplified treatment and the inadequacy of the cast and director. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from the same problem that you often encounter with the modern and popular rebirth of this native tariff, namely the fact that spirits prove to be evil without a real reason other than what is expected of them ! Also, doesn't it offer much in the scares department ?? is a giant crab attack simply silly ?? how, in general, ghosts inhabit a specific character and make him act in a totally atypical way, like Susan George who seduces the diplomat / family friend Doug McClure and Edward Albert by forcibly feeding his daughter a bowl of soup! <br /> <br /> At some point, an old monk shows up at home to warn Albert of the danger if they stay there? in the end, he is called to exorcise the premises. However, the story is destined to repeat itself and the tragedy is the only result of the duly created situation of tension ?? leading to a violent but unintentionally amusing climax in which Albert and McClure, possessed by the spirits of their Japanese predecessors, engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death! At the end of the day, does this reveal an innocent time waster ?? tolerable in just 88 minutes but in no way essential vision.
