I ended up watching this (very long) movie because I was fascinated by sheer stupidity and naivety. It seems hard to believe that so many famous people (Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, John Gielguld, Vittorio de Sica, etc.) would have gladly participated in this farce. But were people really so naive in 1968? The plot seems to have been written by a confused Latin American Marxist priest with an agenda. There is a conflict of superpowers and the Russians are actually the good guys, with the General Secretary of the Communist Party being a kind and spiritual man, who suddenly, after 20 years, sees the light and feels compelled to alleviate his bad conscience releasing a prisoner priest of a Siberian gulag. The priest thus promptly becomes the Pope with a series of coincidences. We are authorized to see the secret Vatican papal voting process that is portrayed in the most collectively imaginable form. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the Communists in China have reached the usual socialist economic miracle of half the country's famine to death. To resolve this minor hiccup on the incessant path to communism, they want to start a nuclear war (to justly distribute Western capitalist riches to the poor workers of China). <br /> <br /> Our good old comrade General The secretary worries a little and calls the Pope shortly before his coronation to ask him to mediate peace. They meet with Chinese leader Peng, who looks and behaves like a 15-year-old boy. You will roll on the floor laughing at what people in 1968 thought was Chinese. Comrade Peng demands that Western capitalists have to pay (which is quite logical, after all, do the capitalists not always have to pay for the folly of the socialists?), And that the Pope also needs to sacrifice something for the common selfless cause of equality social justice. <br /> <br /> Thus, when the Pope is crowned in Rome, he promises the entire wealth of the Catholic Church throughout the world to feed our poor Chinese brothers in Christ. And so it saves the world from nuclear holocaust. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, there are also some minor sub-plots which, unfortunately, provide little to redeem this incredibly ugly film. I would give three Oscars for stupidity. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony Quinn seems rather unlikely as a pope. The Greek is much more plausible than Zorba.
