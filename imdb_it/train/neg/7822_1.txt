This film is a very poor attempt to make money using a classic theme. I love Superman movies, but that made me want to shoot myself. Bad acting, outrageous special effects and a zero plot. To sum up: Superman leaves the earth, because scientists have discovered pieces of his home planet, some were in space (duh), he says nothing to his girlfriend before leaving (duh again), takes off on a spaceship (?!? ), Arriva back I think 5 years later, and I look forward to connecting again with his girlfriend (who is now razing his son, which son, in my humble opinion, is at least 7 years old). What about that Lex Luthor? Are you trying to grow a new continent to sell the land? Please !! <br /> <br /> I vote 1 out of 10 for this film, just because I am not allowed to vote 0. If you have something else to do with your time, don't go see this movie and even if you have nothing else to do, stay at home and watch TV!
