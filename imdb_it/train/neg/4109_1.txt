It can only be described as terrible. It starts badly and then it gets even worse. When you start you really have to watch it because it's impossible to believe that it can get worse, but don't worry because it does. Another poorly written script for a donkey director for offspring without talent from past movie stars. It is difficult to decide if the script is worse than acting or if the director is worse than both. As for the hero - well he has everyone girded, including a scene where he beats the living lights of the hard by opening the closet door and crushing it against the window. And in another scene he is thrown out of a window and crashes into the cement - he doesn't even blink his eyelids - then he immediately gets up and gets stuck in the bad guys. This is a really ridiculous movie. Fortunately it only cost me $ 1 to hire.
