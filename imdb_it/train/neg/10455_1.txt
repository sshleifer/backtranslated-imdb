$ 25,000 pyramidal clues: Deep Blue Sea. Tremors. Slither. Eight Legged Freaks. <br /> <br /> Pyramid Category: Funniest and most exciting movies of Snakes on a Plane. <br /> <br /> Hell, with that definition I should include the relatively harrowing journey of Ted and Elaine by plane! as superior to Snakes both in laughter and in chills. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that it is not even close to the mother of all involuntarily intentional funny snake movies: Anaconda! In addition to never having been screened again by JLo-Cube-O.Wilson-Stoltz-Wuhrer in the same film, Jon Voight brought out the all-time movie thief. His final scene alone represents all that SOAP has tried and failed to do as a "so ridiculous-is-funny" movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, Snakes on a Plane is the definitive proof that executives and studio fans make the worst possible contributors. Every big scene had been discussed and dissected so much last year, all that was left over from the opening night was the amount of fanboy sweat that had to be absorbed into my theater. I heard more forced laughter here than in a studio recording "According to Jim".
