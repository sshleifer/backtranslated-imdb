OK, I really don't have much to say about this movie, apart from this: I've seen over 4,000 movies in my life, and over 2,300 of them were horror movies. While I have some difficulty deciding which is the best (unlike my favorite, which I can tell you is George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD), I can tell you without the slightest hesitation that Todd Sheets' ZOMBIE BLOODBATH is the absolute worst horror movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I simply can't say anything positive about this movie. Acting, dialogue, direction, make-up, music ... Every aspect of this film is simply so below what is acceptable that it drives me crazy that this has even been published. <br /> <br /> Even if you are a horror or zombie movie, please pay attention to my warning and DO NOT waste time with this garbage. There is no pleasure in seeing it. You won't even have a laugh from the total ineptitude on display ... Trust me. Please.
