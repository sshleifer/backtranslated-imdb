But this film was boring. The part of the story was fine but the musical part didn't. Not a song I cared about and no soundtrack to listen to. <br /> <br /> If Sweet Jesus "should have been a comic relief, it would never work." If John Adams were to be the hateful annoyance, the rest were trying to overthrow him in every scene. <br /> <br /> Hancock and Jefferson were the only characters tolerable throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The historical quotations and the debate on slavery in their past the context was quite interesting but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical. <br /> <br /> You shouldn't hum the songs after a musical, except for a few twitters, nothing else was worth it.
