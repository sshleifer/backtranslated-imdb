How many times of horror must we see a ghost passing in the background and reach the reflection of a mirror? It was done in two dozen films in recent memory and four dozen times in this motionless and poorly made movie. There were only two bizarre moments to appreciate ... when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters. Speaking of characters, the acting was as flat as the 64-ounce Diet Coke. cup from which I was drawing it. The side characters may have been extracted from various Scooby Doo cartoons. There was the friendly and aged sheriff. There was the deadly freak that lived in the woods with the verse of Alabama. Lots with characters without development. The most disturbing image was that of a child murdered at the beginning. But rather than exploring the murder of the child, which would have been interesting, they let us know that she was dead and that her parents had difficulty reconciling her death with the community and the other. When they reach the cabin, the scenes rarely flow together ... with flashing images of the dead daughter interposed here and there. Oh ... and even the disturbing sounds were exaggerated. You know what I mean ... creaking doors that open by themselves, crickets in the forest, yada yada yada. Ooooohhhh. I've never seen it before. Again, you will see the extraordinary door that opens itself in the film over and over again. NOTE TO THE DIRECTOR: a scary scene is scary only if it is not repeated every 5 minutes in the same film. Think of these things before calling "it's a conclusion!"
