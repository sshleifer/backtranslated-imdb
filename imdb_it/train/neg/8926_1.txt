I saw "Myra Breckinridge" when it first came out in 1970. At the time I was a good twenty, who loved movies and I liked Raquel Welsh very much. Also, I had read Gore Vidal's novel that was based on it and thought it was very funny. I saw the movie in a local drive-in and about halfway I was tempted to turn on the engine of my car so that maybe I died from monoxide poisoning and didn't have to see the rest of this shipwreck. He was not "smart" or "fashionable", he was coarse and sloppy. All the actors were deaf and the director had no idea what he was doing. The casting of Mae West was one of the worst casting choices in film history. As one reviewer said here, his role has nothing to do with the film or the book. His character in the book was sexually beaten by the young stallion, something he would never have done for the legendary Mrs. West. Oh no, the plot has changed so she beats him sexually, very credible from a 77-year-old woman who watches every DAY of her age. I could go on, but why? It was a terrible film. <br /> <br /> Bluto
