The atrociously slow pace of this film was probably the director's express intention, in order to convey what life was like as a village teenager in China. However, I found the combination of the glacially slow "plot" and the overall style of shooting so impersonal that it was totally alienating, particularly for a Western audience. Sometimes I really had difficulty distinguishing some characters, since they were shot from such a distance. Two hours in and I was totally worried about the past. As someone who is not only interested in music but is also very involved in China's history and culture (and is no stranger to Chinese cinema), I could not interact with a single character and found nothing to prick my teeth. The question arises: if I didn't like it, who would want it? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of any other Chinese director I've ever seen. This sorry effort is not up to par. I would hate to see Chinese cinema judged on this point of reference.
