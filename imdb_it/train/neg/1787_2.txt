I liked Batman: Dead End. A dark film-noir set for Batman was perfect. Batman: Dead End is good. This is not. <br /> <br /> First let me start with acting. None of this is really that good. The best would probably be Clark Bartram as Batman. But this is not saying much. He's good at first sight, and then you realize you're what he is, a body-builder who seems to be a tolerable actor. But mainly the problem is that Batman does not belong to the light of day, it looks like a monster running in a bat costume. Instead of a horribly scarred man who tries to remedy the mistakes of the past. Daylight also reveals an annoying frown of anger on Bartram's face that never and cannot be overlooked in Batman: Dead End, probably due to the darkness of the short which is so desired in this trailer. Bartram seems to think that frowning and stubbornly frowning his head is acting, it isn't, it's just the opposite. It's called pose, something true that actors avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> Something I never understood because Collora chose body builders as leads. It makes more sense to give the role to an actor who can handle it, instead of a bodybuilder who may be able to handle it but HEY LOOKS SO MUCH AS THE COMIC! Obviously, they could have done better if Collora's dialogue didn't leave much to be desired. <br /> <br /> The entire trailer (yes, trailer. There won't be a feature film) is more centered on Superman then Batman. But everything about Superman is trivial, cloying and amateur. Michael O'Hearn (Superman) is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. He stands, smiles, says his lines. That's all. Even though I'm not surprised since he's just a bodybuilder, they have hired and possibly received some acting lessons. Once again I say to Collora, I launch ACTORS. Not bodybuilders. The actors will be much more convincing than forgive the fact that they do not look exactly like the comic. <br /> <br /> The costume is what you would expect Superman to wear. As for the Batman suit. Well, I guess you're only fine in the dark. I say this because in some shots the suit looks like something you would buy from a Halloween gift shop. <br /> <br /> Superman flies in this movie. But this is not a good thing. These shots seem particularly amateur. This and a lot of the whole "movie" seems to have been shot in their backyard with a VHS camera. <br /> <br /> The best shots are a shot of Superman catching a car in his hands. And the final shot of Two-Face and Batman at the end. For those of you who have seen the trailer. You know what I'm talking about. Now if only he could have extended that shot through the entire trailer. <br /> <br /> Finally I ask. Because if you're trying to show off your skills as a director, would you make a trailer like a short film? This proves nothing when it comes to being a true director who manages the story. My only advice to Collora here is that there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and the chance to work in marketing. <br /> <br /> Batman: Dead End did not feel amateur. I can't understand where this went wrong.
