Well, I have to say that this is probably the worst movie I've seen this year! The jokes were extremely vulgar (I didn't expect from PG) (Rated PG in Canada) and they weren't funny! With this great cast, I expected at least good acting, but I didn't even understand it. I'm a big fan of Rainn Wilson and this is the first time I've been extremely disappointed with his performance. Neither Luke Wilosn nor the characters of Uma Thurman are the least sympathetic and I really would have cared less about what happened to either of them. I was not expecting it at all since in the past I liked the other films of this director (Six Days, Seven Nights for example) This film was NOT worth the $ 10 that cost me and I strongly encourage you not to see this film. I guarantee you will be like me begging for this movie to end.
