When I bought this DVD, I thought, "It seems to be a nice light comedy about love and the relationships made with Portuguese standards, do we give a chance ??" I was totally wrong! What a disappointing movie! First of all, it is not a comedy; it's an economic drama that can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Secondly, is the plot so boring and not getting anywhere ?? Does it have structure, does it flow simply, like the wind, in one direction or another? Production is bad too! Sound mixing is horrible, because sometimes the voices are disconnected. Did you mention some old portuguese movies from the 80s ?? Should acting be even better ?? Well, to sum up, it is not with films like this that Portuguese cinema will improve! In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese films I've seen in recent years! Bad discussion, bad acting, bad production ?? I had no great hopes for this film, but it was much worse than I ever imagined! Just forget it!
