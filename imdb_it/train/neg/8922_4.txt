Two old men sitting on a bench. I really don't have a problem with this scene - the only problem is that it is not a scene for the whole movie <br /> <br /> Yup films no longer have a low concept of this. They too are no longer boring about this, but it is worse to come because these two old men are chalk and cheese. One is Nat Moyer who is a Yiddish communist while the other is Midge Carter, a former champion of gold gloves who is also black. Let me see now, a Jew and a black man sitting on a park bench getting along. Well, I guess it's possible, even if unlikely, but if this film has such a harmless scenario why play the Jewish stereotype? Why make them noisy tribolist bastards who take oaths in Hebrew? Slightly ironic that the Jews seen at the beginning of the film are exactly the kind of Jews seen in Nazi propaganda films in the 1930s <br /> <br /> Stereotypes apart moi dearz the problem with I`M NOT RAPPAPORT is that it` It is written for a film completely different from the cinema, it is based on a theatrical play and exhibition. Walter Matthau sleepwalking through his role as Nat while this commentator has almost slept throughout the film
