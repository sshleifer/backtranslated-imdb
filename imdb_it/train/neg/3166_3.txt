I confess to having a rather unpleasant feeling about ghost movies, and while I sometimes enjoy playing with the genre when it comes to horror, but when it comes to comedies, they really need to be crazy to be funny. 'Over Her Dead Body' seems to take life after death a little too seriously and, in my opinion, it almost fails to think about anything. The story is absolutely incredible, and has failed to convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental register. The choice of the main actresses was terrible. While Paul Rudd is at least handsome and looks like a good boy, the taste of his character's women seems to need a serious improvement as Eva Longoria seems too old (sorry) for him, and Lake Bell seems too unattractive (sorry again ). A romantic story without a good reason for romance is due to failure from the beginning. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were actually better but they only had secondary roles. The rest is uninteresting and uninspired, with a flat, low-cost gag borrowed from unsuccessful television comedies. Nothing is really worth looking at, nothing to remember.
