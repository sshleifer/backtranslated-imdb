Complete waste of time .... This film is not a comedy, it is not a drama, it is not a love story ... not even a teenage comedy, at least !!! History ... should be a bit of a twist ... but it's so disappointing! When the film has an end in the end I expect the turn-over to make movies even better (eg "Fight Club") but this turn-over makes the film even worse ... When I watch the teenage comedy, and I wear Lo I do very often, I expect lousy jokes and a lot of nudity ... The jokes are too disgusting and there is no nudity ... You only have one ... very nice I must admit ... girl, and this is how much! And she's completely dressed in the whole movie! Acting is ugly ... like soap sets ... Don't waste time! There are porn with a better story and acting! <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad English)
