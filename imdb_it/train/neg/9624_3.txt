Considering the potential that this move had, the reality was disappointing. While it's always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie, even this one wasn't able to turn it upside down. Most of the action was predictable. The jokes were flat to slightly amusing. And the characters weren't very interesting. I wanted this movie, but it never happened. Ben Stiller was funny in "There's something about Mary". Here it seems that he is going through the movements. If they are to lift the "Friends" plot points, they should have known something was wrong. The toilet's humor should have remained in the closet :-). <br /> <br /> Look at "50 first dates" instead.
