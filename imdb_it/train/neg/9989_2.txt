I had the misfortune of watching this garbage on Sky Cinema Max on a cold winter night. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, because most of them are just junk. This is even worse: it is one of the most stupid pieces of shit I've ever seen in my life. Horror movie? Yes, there are horrible things in this: acting, script and special effects - Gosh, I laughed at this ridiculous attempt to make a movie for 90 minutes. Actually, if it was a comic film I would have given a 5. Don't even think about renting this unless you want to make fun of the producers. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 10 - I didn't vote because it made me laugh all the time ;-)
