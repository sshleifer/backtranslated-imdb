The shape of the film is that of a more shocking suspense. There are surprises, twists, showers and excitements. Sometimes, this is really a movie "at the edge of the bottom". But it disappoints and disappoints severely. <br /> <br /> The villain of the piece is not credible; his character doesn't hold water. I refuse to "ruin" the film, but I will only say that the character we meet at the beginning could not be what we see at the end. <br /> <br /> The second major disappointment of the film is that - Finally, it becomes a bit more than a bloody slasher movie. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the "Friday 13" movies. Not all films must always be tasteful, but sometimes this film does trickle. <br /> <br /> Although the film features the magnificent Sean Connery, he too is not up to his usual standard, and often he just seems to be walking through the steps.
