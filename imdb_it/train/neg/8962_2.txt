I think this sucked the ice because he left the cube and gave us a lot of information about who he is and why. The original CUBE never left the cube and left everything to your imagination. This shitty party, however, gives you everything. and I didn't like it ... Even if the acting is solid, I think the reason this was a problem was because it was done by people other than ORIGINAL filmmakers, if they had Vincenzo Natali make this prequel, or even I think the sequel would have done better and would have been more faithful to the source. so I advise you to stay away, very far from this, and HYPERCUBE, another film that I don't even want to discuss ... (I gave him a 2 just for acting)
