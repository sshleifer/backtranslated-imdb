I wasn't very impressed with this movie. Originally it was called Sin Eater and it should have remained that way, considering it is all that has been talked about for the last half of the film. I'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the film had to do with the rest. It was very slow and what was with the choice of Robocop (Peter Weller) as one of the main actors. It was a sad point. <br /> <br /> All in all I would say to check if you are interested in things related to the Catholic religion, but don't expect an exorcist or stigmata from this film. He will certainly flop after a few days and the word will come out.
