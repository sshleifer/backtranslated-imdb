This was a watchable movie, but the plot was a bit weak and most of the lines came from some of Rodney's previous films. That being said, it was worth the time to look. I gave this 5 out of 10. So basically, it's one of those movies that you don't go out of your way to see, but if you find it on the tube, take a chance.
