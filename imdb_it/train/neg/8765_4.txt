I saw this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas day. The short summary of this film is MUST AVOID. JP Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited this film and did none of these. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Pakistan's attempt to capture part of the disputed Kashmir region from India in 1999. Presumably based on the fact, we get a hint from this film of the difficulty the Indian army had in recapturing the area from Pakistani troops - which occupied the high ground. But instead of telling what must have been a compelling and heroic story, this whole movie makes the Indian army look ridiculous and stupid, which I know isn't true. <br /> <br /> I saw this film with a completely public, completely Indian film, which was very patriotic and clearly wanted to appreciate this film, but it also found itself laughing at scenes that shouldn't have been funny. <br /> <br /> The script was absolutely abysmal. He gave the impression that Mr. Dutta doesn't know anything about how an army operates and is using bad war movies for reference. The result is a brainless and repetitive script. <br /> <br /> The acting of many of the principals was not stellar, but considering the script they received, I find it difficult to criticize them too much. As for the supporting cast, all I can say is that I hope they were amateurs. <br /> <br /> Even the assembly was pretty bad. It was quite difficult to follow what was happening for a long time and the music would be abruptly interrupted by the scene changes. <br /> <br /> Good things: the cinematography was pretty good, even though the fact that the film doesn't seem to be color-corrected was a bit hurt (color balance often varied significantly within the scenes ). Also, the few songs that were in the movie were pretty funny - at least for the first half-dozen verses. Unfortunately they went much longer than they should. <br /> <br /> And the worst crime of all? This mess is FOUR HOURS LONG. There is enough here that a good editor could almost squeeze a good 1.5 to 2 hour movie from what was shot. Unfortunately, a good editor was not working on this film.
