This is the biggest flop of 2008. I don't know what the director has in mind to create such a big disaster. The songs have been added without situations, the story has been lengthened to fill the 3-hour gap and the acrobatics of action performed by the actors is more disgusting as if everyone were having superpowers that can run between bullets. and a person who fights with 100 people. Only the best performance was by Anil Kapoor, who is always at his best interpreting the role of the villain with a comic act that speaks Hinglish ... Akki also did a good job ... But the movie forgets.
