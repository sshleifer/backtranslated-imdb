Parasomnia has an interesting premise, but the story is badly done without any tension or even a logical approach. The cast does not convince, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who played great roles in films like Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. The rest of the cast is unknown (and not very good) except for Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert West of the great trilogy of Re-Animator). But he can play roles like this in his sleep (which is a bit what he does here). The main problem is that the actions of the characters do not make any sense. The story is rather boring and predictable with low-cost computerized effects mixed with some gory scenes, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> This could have been much better, I haven't had the positive reviews on this one. It's really below average.
