Yet another Alfred Hitchcock film that appears to have been made for contractual obligations. As with Juno and Paycock, you can say that Hitchcock had little interest in this film. There is almost no style or trade. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young married couple, who enter into some money and take a cruise that proves to be a proof of their marriage. Emily has the chance to live a new life with a good and wealthy man who falls in love with her, but chooses to take the high road and be with her husband. This might seem more credible if Fred were not made to be a callous and pompous ass who jumps at the first chance he sees leaving his wife for another woman. The couple ends up being together, but the film lacks a true reconciliation scene. The third act goes in a completely different direction, with the couple stuck on a ship abandoned and saved by an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry makes a very emotional performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband. This is all you can say for this.
