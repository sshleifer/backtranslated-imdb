Strange as less than 2 hours may seem like a life when sitting through a similar, flat, unpleasant excitement. If a story is as personal as the one supposed to be for Sally Potter, wouldn't you expect to show a little passion in her performance? His acting was completely detached and I didn't feel any harmony between Sally and Pablo and the tango scenes, which should have been on fire given the nature of the dance, were instead uncomfortable and painful to watch. Obviously, revealing such a personal story about the film can be daunting, and as such Sally Potter would have been wise in allowing a better actor to take the job rather than letting his passion fall victim to his embarrassment.
