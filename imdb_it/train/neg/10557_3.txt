It is a horrible little production, capable of giving a nightmare and headache. It's an unpleasant mixture of live action and ugly stop-motion animations. It's weird, but it's not the kind of fun, weird journey that anyone could expect optimistic. He is the cold, inhuman, hostile, disgusting, even terrifying type. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney did a fantastic job with the same starting material. And Cosgrove-Hall did much more interesting things with stop-motion. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that this is a French production. As such, it reinforces the stereotype that the French have no concept of fear.
