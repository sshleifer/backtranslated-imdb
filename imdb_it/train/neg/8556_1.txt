OK, I like the idea of ​​this movie. I'm in the demographic age and I identify with some of the stories. Even the sometimes boring and meaningless dialogue seems semi-realistic, and in a different film it would have been forgivable. I'm trying as hard as possible not to destroy this movie like the others, but it's not easy when the directors didn't try at all. <br /> <br /> The editing in this film is terrible! Perhaps the worst montage I've ever seen in a movie! There are things you don't have to go to film school to learn, supporting good editing is not one of them, but identifying a bad one. <br /> <br /> Also, the shot ... Oh my God, the shots, just awful! I can't even go into details, but sometimes we only see random things coming up, and this, together with editing, will give you the most painful cinematic viewing experience. <br /> <br /> This film was made on a low or no budget with 4 cast and crew not even an excuse. I've seen short films on youtube with much more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I don't know what the hell you were thinking, but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of both your ego. You should be ashamed of yourself! In conclusion, this film is like a very lazy amateur porn movie if it was full of 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and a disgusting masturbation scene. If this is not your kind of thing, avoid this at all costs!
