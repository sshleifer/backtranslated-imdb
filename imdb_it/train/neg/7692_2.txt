Here are a couple of previous comments that talk about the abundance of clich√©s on this film, and I completely agree, both in terms of the characters and the dialogue. <br /> <br /> I have read of horrible Elizabeth Berkly performing in the equally monstrous "Showgirls", which I have never seen - and her performance here, though not terrible, is barely up to the standards of Lifetime . There was no hint of depth to his character, but it probably shouldn't have been. If so, he would have put the film completely out of balance, since there was no hint of depth or charisma - not a trace - in any character, artist or portrait. <br /> <br /> The way the headmaster took care of Liz's initial complaint after his tutee kissed her in the room was ridiculous. Her husband's initial reaction and advice was also (Forrest Gump, attacking Jenny's boyfriend in his car, provided a more realistic and intelligent action, and, hell, he was mentally challenged). <br /> <br /> The taciturn, greasy lawyer (sorry for the redundancy) the father of the lying student actually performed something that probably deserved to be praised in his performance: it was both ridiculous and absolutely annoying, not a little feat. His lawyer was more than an insensitive nerd, not even a stranger in the profession. <br /> <br /> Finally (and frankly, I really liked this part), the police were such a collection of insensitive pimples, that you'd rather depend on Barney Fife, without Andy, to manage all the police and investigations in your community. I know that most of the actual cops are a little less sharp than the sharpness, intelligence and empathy of the level shown by most of the characters of the "Law and Order" series, and the like - but the dolts of this level seem to be a paper clip on "Lifetime." <br /> <br /> Finally, I found a sort of "story within a story" that fascinated Josh's mixture of being the "victim" of his teacher. This scripted performance within the story was even worse than its overall performance in the main story. This was something important, like switching from "F" to "F-minus". <br /> <br /> This entire situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about 15 minutes, following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities, with the husband involved. But this would have precluded the artificial drama that followed and left an empty one-hour film in the air. <br /> <br /> But the writer (s) here, showed by their end, could do even worse. When the situation was finally "resolved" and "corrected", this was accomplished in about 45 seconds, with no indication of what measures could have been in place in any "real world" context for the perpetrator and his parents, or if he could have been able to find some sort of path to redemption. <br /> <br /> This is a 2 * presentation; the second "*" because it has a slight "charm".
