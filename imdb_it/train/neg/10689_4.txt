Cuba Gooding Jr. is an agent of the secret services who reproaches himself for the assassination of the President of the United States, I will underline immediately that this is not the kind of role for which this very talented actor is known, and this film shows us why. He joins a persistent news reporter (Angie Harmon) to discover the conspiracy surrounding the death of the president, and so on, blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Even with a James Woods cast, Cuba Gooding Jr, Anne Archer and Angie Harmon "End Game" fail to attract your attention, simply and easily; part of the action is good, the acting is not so bad and the story, although clicked and done before, could have led to a fun and funny movie - GOOD IT DOESN'T! Writing the script and directing it makes it absolutely safe, in no way engages you in history or makes you think of any of the characters. <br /> <br /> 4/10 It's boring, predictable and boring.
