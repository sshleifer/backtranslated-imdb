The Crater Lake of a meteor (hence our title), awakening a plesiosaur, which proceeds to snack on the hick population (in California, the capital of the hick world). <br /> <br /> There are bad movies, and then there is "The Crater Lake Monster", which somehow managed to escape from MST3K. Featuring gritty acting, a decent stop-motion beast, and more, this is a terrible piece of low-budget 1970s / monster monster exploitation. <br /> <br /> While the film is guilty of many crimes, the biggest is Arnie and Mitch, two heinous rednecks that serve as our comic relief. They stumble, they fight to stock up on "banjo music", they look at women and behave like humanity's pathetic excuses. The characters are so bad that they should be considered a crime against humanity.
