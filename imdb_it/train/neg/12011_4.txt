John Pressman (Michael 'I shoulda called Ditech' Lerner) works as a doctor in a doctor's office. His mother (Zelda 'Poltergeist' Rubenstein) hypnotizes him to ward off people who see him thinking he's wrong. But this turns out to be a movie within a film, but the lines soon become blurred as John goes to a movie theater to kill. Promote a guy who is watching the movie to do the same. Lerner is rightly over the top in this, but Zelda repeatedly repeats the lines of dialogue. This becomes annoying quickly. But it's not as annoying as the two girls who are watching the movie in a movie. Like a horror movie, it fails, it is too busy trying to be intelligent, trying to give a message and seems to forget a slasher film, it must evoke a sense of tension, or at least a jump or two. No, what we have here is the worst kind of slasher: one of art-house. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
