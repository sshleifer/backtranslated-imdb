The back of the DVD box says that Ellen Page is co-star in this movie. She doesn't even appear until two-thirds of the film are finished and so she's in a minor role. I don't even consider it a supporting role, but rather a "bit" part. The plot also has many inexplicable elements. Some examples are: why does the protagonist reject the eldest son? Why does your youngest son drive his head on the train? He says it's a "windy" bet that doesn't explain anything. Obviously the writer does not know the definition of a sucker bet. This film is not worthy of the rental price in my opinion. Save your money and watch it for free on TV if you think it is necessary to see them.
