Nothing to say but Wow! Does anyone really have someone sneaking them up in an open field? Well, this happens about 25 times in this film (clearly the favorite fear tactics of the directors). In one of the opening scenes the talk / hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so that the camera man can sit in front to film. Shortly after arriving in the field, the 5 competitors showed up and, even though it is clearly the last of the 2 in the afternoon, they are all convinced that the sun will set at any moment. After about 30 minutes of down without garbage, we have the privilege of a flashback of the clown's story in which we see some of his previous victims. If you watch this movie, look at the ladies' chest ... its ribs reach up to its neck, it's disgusting. Most horror film actions occur during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day. The few night shots that came to the film seem to have been stolen from the Blair Witch Project or random shots from the directors' backyard. The film somehow redeemed itself at the end when there was a matrix like the one with the clown that we rewound and we looked again and again laughing hysterically. <br /> <br /> Definitely RENT THIS FILM IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN SNUCKED UP IN AN OPEN FIELD. <br /> <br /> SIGNED, THE ANSWER
