The worst film title of all time is the one that is distributed quickly and often. Most often it is an exaggeration of the fact, but I would like to welcome Alone in the Dark to the short list of real candidates: Plan 9 from Outer Space, Battlefield Earth and the Adventures of Pluto Nash. <br /> <br /> While watching the boredom of the 90 minutes, I found it difficult even to stay awake even while I was trying so hard to laugh at the movie. But alas I felt alone in the dark (I tried to avoid the pun but I couldn't resist) while I looked around hoping to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. Unfortunately my friends and I had to provide a comedy for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> So ... of the movie itself. Let's talk about the action and the effects because that should be the only positive part of the film. The film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the Xeno in Aliens (they even call them Xenos) and creatures in Pitch Black. It can become invisible at random (and I assure you it's random) and get hurt by the light. There are also small centipede creatures used to control humans that turn them into something that looks like a zombie. All of these are shown with obsolete special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997. The action scenes are chaotic and are impossible to follow. People shooting at random on a blue stage or on an empty set of monsters that have been placed in posts. The light flashes quickly on a dark screen, making your students burn with overwork while bad rock music peeks into the background. <br /> <br /> And those were the highlights. The story revolves around a paranormal investigator (Slater) whose idea of ​​tough appearance is wearing a black T-shirt with a trench coat and a shave for 2 days. An archaeologist (Reid) who is rather inept. And a government agent (Dorff) whose lines imply the order to bark. All three should be ashamed of their performances (not that they have ever done a good job before) and the casting director should be ashamed. Reid and Slater should be lovers in the film, I guess. The film contains the strangest love scene I've ever seen in a film between the two. Then comes the plot. Quite frankly the parts that make sense are not at all interesting. The rest is illogical at best. The potholes could contain the collective ego of all three stars. The film begins with the text and a voice that explains the background. This opening lasts for more than a minute and the viewer already knows he has something terrible. This initial narrative is then repeated adnausem in the awkward and heavy awkward dialogue in the rest of the film. And the ending didn't make an ounce of meaning. Not only did it make no sense in the film world, it just didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Finally the direction of a Uwe Boll. Misfortune, this is all that can be said. Its use to shake the camera to simulate suspense. His lack of direction with the actors. Just look at Reid in scenes where it is not in the center of the shot. The total waste of money for special effects due to time effects of bullets. And finally choose to use the voice to explain something that should be painfully obvious to viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 1.50 to see this show in a second-run theater. And while the laughter that my friends and I did was worth every quarter, I would advise people to avoid paying more for this movie. Take about 3 friends and divide the cost of the rental and pull a new movie out of it. <br /> <br /> Shame on yourself, Uwe Boll. Shame on you, Tara Reid. Shame on Christian Slater. Shame on you, Stephen Dorff. Shame on anyone associated with this film.
