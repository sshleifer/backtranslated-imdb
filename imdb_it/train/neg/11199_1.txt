The turgid rhythm of this film numbs us with any shock it could provide. There was no real suspense. Most of the characters were insipid. The Irish priest was as lame as the love interest. Interest is misleading. The girl who chose to provide the film's sensuality could be better. The central conflict of the main character was not involving. This film is completely devoid of positive aspects. It's like a boring exercise from someone who didn't want to go to the gym that day, but he did it anyway.
