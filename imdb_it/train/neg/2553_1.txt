Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What else can I say. Kate Jackson had to be desperate to direct. It could be that she should go back to acting ... thinking twice she was a bad actress. Who would put money to produce something so ugly. I like anti-Christ movies and I usually have a good laugh and weird fright, but this is only Bad Bad Bad. The acting of the stars was worse than that found in a soap opera. Special effects, if you can call them that, where it's ridiculous. I wouldn't be surprised if you played the scenes in slow motion, you'd see the tubes whose blood spills out. We had to turn off the disc after only 30 minutes. This so-called film, the original prints should be destroyed, all disks and tapes destroyed and all the people associated with making the film must return money to the people who rented the film. So those people should never be allowed to act, direct or film anything but their movies at home.
