This is really the worst movie I've ever seen. Never. Period. I actually paid Â£ 3.50 to watch this steaming movie fucker. Incredibly boring, poorly interpreted, often incoherent screenplay and too many scenes that don't seem to have any relevance to the film as a whole (like when Heath Ledger's pastor is nailed to a wall by a ghost ... what was the point in that scene ? answers on a postcard please ...) <br /> <br /> I should have a medal to stick with this movie for the whole running time. I'd rather take a strong kick in the groin than go over this movie. <br /> <br /> This should be included on page 100 of IMDb. We hope that my vote of 1/10 will help him in his way.
