Billy Crystal co-wrote, co-produced and acted in this extremely safe and comfortable comedy drama about fathers and sons, irresponsibility of adults and aging. Billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha) that leads him to look for his foreign father (Alan King), an extra movie that he imagines is a big star. The script is a sub-Neil Simon absurdity with unusual jokes, a flat and inexpressive direction by Henry Winkler (stuck in sitcom mode) and a family conflict ready. Crystal and King do their best, but King is exaggerated and often exaggerated. JoBeth Williams has another of his endless roles, but manages to bring his innate and down-home class to the character of the proverbial girlfriend. It's a comedy, I imagine, but one that reflects tears ... shamefully. ** from ****
