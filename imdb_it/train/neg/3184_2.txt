However I was never impressed by JD, and Final Justice (which I had never seen before its airing MST3k) proves to be no exception. It's not that the character is less likeable than Mitchell: it's just that there's less than Geronimo ("Call me 'Heronimo") doesn't like. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is suspected that Mitchell and Final Justice were all schemes of an agent in search of revenge by Joe Don trying to have the "star" killed by causing a heart attack. <br /> <br /> Joe Don must have found a new agent, since he has now graduated in "comic relief" in the James Bond films. The problem is that it's hard to tell the difference between his comic characters there, and his "serious" characters in his action movies like this. <br /> <br /> As for the plot .. .umm, what plot? Repeat the same pieces so you will repeatedly think you were watching Groundhog Day 2. Presumably, the fact that they continue to use the same Geronimo scene to get out of jail should be a comic relief of some Ummm kind, yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> The positive side is that the scenario of Malta is really amazing, so much so that it is pushed up to 2 for me. Licks the Maltese tourism back from a couple of decades, though.
