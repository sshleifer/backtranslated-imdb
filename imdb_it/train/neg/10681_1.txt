What a misfortune, having so many members of my list "a" and a good "b" list of actors agree in making this film, but they did, and that's what awakened me in watching it. I had never heard of this film, but there was Cuba Gooding Jr. right on the cover of the DVD, and James Woods in the background how bad can it be? In a word Very! This movie starts o.k. he has turns and then turns an egg. The ending was so weak, it was as if the writer had been called away and his 4-year-old son sat down at the printer and cut the ending. How ironic for a film called "The end game" to have such a poor film. These are the types of movies that can move "a" list of actors into the "b" list quickly. I hope that Cuba Gooding JR and James Woods do not get used to it.
