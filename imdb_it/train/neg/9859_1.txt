This movie is just lame. A total loss of time and money. The jokes are predictable, the characters are so clich√© and the way he talks about the role players is not fun. The problem is that the writers don't seem to know how an RPG game works and, more importantly, how to make jokes about this game. Obviously there are a lot of losers playing RPGs like crazy retards and total losers. But for me this is not the most fun way to make jokes about this game. History makes no sense. Who cares how long a game is played? The biggest problem in this film is that writers and actors haven't even tried to know what the RPG is about to do about it. I was ashamed watching this lame movie.
