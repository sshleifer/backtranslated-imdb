I was able to wait only the first twenty minutes of this low budget movie. The most obvious absurdity is that while American detainees in a North Korean prison camp are all allegedly suffering from severe food and medicine deprivations, that they go without bathing, shivering in fragile and filthy parka, and sleeping on floors naked, and - let's not forget lasting torture - always manage to show off impeccably combed hair. With the exception of a properly austere Harry Morgan like an army major, casting and acting are simply horrible. Ronald Regan does not seem to stick to portraying a single character and instead creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam of past roles. A mostly Caucasian cast depicting North Korean camp officials could be pardonable, but when alleged Russian officials acting as advisors to Koreans flaunt themselves wearing Nazi uniforms embroidered complete with jodhpurs and boots (the costume department recycles the World War II movie ) and speaking in accents like General Burkhalter of Hogan's Heroes, well, it's just six kinds of nonsense. Don't waste time with this.
