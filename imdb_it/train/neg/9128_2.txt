Although one did not realize that the Sellers were in poor health at the time of filming and died before the movie, THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU would be a painful sight. It is presumably a lampoon of the famous oriental villain of Sax Rohmer, but lacks attention. The potential for a satirical comment on the anti-oriental nuances of the concept of Rohmer is ignored. In fact, the film employs racist insults. There are practically no jokes or gags, only mostly actors who behave idiotic and emit sad lines. It is particularly painful to see Sid Caesar forced to cast curses and racist insults for attempted laughter. Most of the other actors are also embarrassed. <br /> <br /> And then there's Peter Sellers. He plays the double roles of the left Fu Manchu, who is trying to invent a formula to regain his youth and his brave British enemy Nayland Smith. Sellers are not one hundred percent bad; It conveys an eccentric warmth like Smith when he discusses his fetishistic attachment to his lawnmower and moves strangely like Manchu when he expresses his love for entertainment in the English music room. But most of the time, he plays both roles with a tired air, further sabotaging any comic possibilities. Salesman routines where he revitalizes his fade strength with electric shocks are particularly atrocious; seems too convinced to be funny. <br /> <br /> Some genuinely funny jokes, a handsome fan of Burt Kwouk (Cato in the PINK PANTHER films) as one of Manchu's minions, and the fun musical numbers of Helen Mirren cannot save this mess. If anyone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is considered a comic genius, he will not learn anything from THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU.
