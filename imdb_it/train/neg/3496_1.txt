I remember my parents didn't understand Saturday Night Live when I was 15. They also didn't understand the Rock n Roll and many other things. Now that I am approaching their age, I still remember and find I understand many of the things my children love. But this is pathetic. I can't say I saw anyone except a few appearances here and there. They were reasonable. I don't see it as something special. But this show is far below what I expected from her. The IMDb article made it seem like potential. So, just for that, I started watching the first episode. I turned it off halfway. Something else is better than that. Jokes designed for a 5 year old child presented on a supposed adult program. Well, Sarah, this adult is really moved to repel you. I can't believe anyone actually funded this insult with comedy. The only good thing I can say is that there are so many bad jokes deposited here, saving other shows from such embarrassment.
