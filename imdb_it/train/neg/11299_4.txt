The Mummy's Tomb begins with a review of the events in The Mummy's Hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the United States of America where the current priest and the Kharis mummy set out to devastate and take revenge on those who have violated the tomb in the past. <br /> <br /> While I absolutely loved "The mummy" with Boris Karloff as Imhotep's mummy, and I really liked "The Mummy Hand" with Tom Tyler as Kharis (which is the direct prequel to this film), I was not so taken with "The Mummy's Tomb". <br /> <br /> It is made in a style similar to that of the previous film and has a rather similar plot even if in a new setting. Lon Chaney Jr is ok like Kharis, but he doesn't really stand out. And I think this is my main criticism of this film - that nothing really stands out. There is nothing really terrible here, but there is nothing really exceptional, so the viewer is left with a rather mild story.
