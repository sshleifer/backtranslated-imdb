There is a lot to do with Helen and none of these is good. Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds play the mothers of a pair of Leopold & Loebs as murderers moving from mid-west to Hollywood to escape their past. Reynolds, an aspiring star of Jean Harlow, opens a dance studio for children and Winters is his pianist. Soon Winters (like Helen) starts to collapse. It's all very slow and, even if there are moments of real fear (bad phone calls, a visit from Wino Timothy Carey), the film is devoid of any real horror. However, it is still a worthy entertainment. The acting divas are doing well and the production values ​​are fantastic. A soundtrack by David Raskin, Lucien Ballard's cinematography and Oscar-nominated costumes contribute greatly. With this, A PLACE IN THE SUN and LOLITA to his credit, does anyone go crazy like Winters? Directed by Curtis Harrington, a master in this type of exploitation that is not exactly cinematographic. In addition to Carey, the odd supporting cast includes Dennis Weaver, Agnes Moorehead (as Aimee Semple McPherson as evangelist), Yvette Vickers and Micheál MacLiammóir (Irishman Orson Welles) as Hamilton Starr, aptly nicknamed Hammy.
