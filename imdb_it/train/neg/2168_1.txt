After reading another review, I thought this movie would actually be good. I like "B" movies, but this couldn't even be classified as such. Photography is probably the only thing halfway in the film. But the assembly left much to be desired. He was very moved and detached. Anyone who has chosen music and sound has done a terrible job. The music was horrible, especially of any atmosphere or scene setting. If the acting had been better, they could have pulled the movie out. Unfortunately, I saw him play better in porn movies. If you want to see a vampire movie "B", take a look at "Blood Ties". You will be much more amused.
