I grew up watching and loving TNG. I just finished watching the entire ST Voyager series on DVD, which may have increased my sense of disgust with this episode, as the difference in style and approach between the two shows couldn't be more clear. The idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand Riker's character, which is how he would probably be treated on VOY. They could have presented memories that would be "new" to the public, rather than simply regurgitating the old clips of the show. The incoming and outgoing transitions between the "memories" and the "present" in this episode begin as clich√©s in the beginning, and become very intolerable very quickly while the tired model wears on forever. No worst episode ever.
