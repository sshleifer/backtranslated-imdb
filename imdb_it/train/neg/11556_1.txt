Oh, those Italians! Assuming that the aristocratic movies with strange fetishes, castles drowned in a gothic atmosphere and back-stabbing relatives trying to get their hands on a legacy are intrinsically interesting for everyone! If you've seen a movie of this type, you've basically seen them all (the favorite MST3K "Screaming Skull" is also suitable for the mold) ... and "The Night Evelyn came out of the grave" is formidable, - numbers and boring to die for. Even the luscious Erika Blanc is wasted here. <br /> <br /> zero / 10 <br /> <br />
