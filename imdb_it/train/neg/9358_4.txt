From the moment the film starts, there is already a discrepancy. Given that this film takes place on the borders of Normandy and the Middle East, and is also an international film, one would expect the correct accents to be depicted. This is not done like most of the American cast sound. Also, I find the acting to be better, the plot is a bit difficult to follow from the beginning. Who's Who? Otherwise the film is very accurate in costume and set design. If you want to see a movie to get an idea of ​​what it was like in the past (even if you don't have accents), then this movie is worth a rent. If you're looking for an epic movie like Kingdom of Heaven, then look elsewhere.
