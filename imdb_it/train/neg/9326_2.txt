I and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them, trust me it has led to horribly spent money but also some great laughs. S.I.C.K. it's one of the best horror-but-funny movies we've rented. The plot is over, everything brings your friends into the woods and never come back the thing is very old. The most glorious part of the film resembles your visit to the local butcher's shop, except for some dirt and blood on the game dough for meat. And if anyone has ever been afraid of this movie at any time, they should stay with Cartoon Network for the rest of their lives, it's pathetic. The positive aspects of the film are that the two girls are quite hot, one better than the other and you see them naked during the film. The other positive aspect is that this film is so ugly that you sometimes laugh until you cry. I don't like watching recite horribly or renting these horrible videos, I don't find it funny but seeing the amount of effort that these people put in and that still come out so bad is hilarious and worth being rented. Unless you are too mature for Rido to fall on someone, I would recommend it. <br /> <br /> If I rent / buy it for laughter, I'd give it an 8.5.
