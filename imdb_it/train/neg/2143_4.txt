I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and I've always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn. <br /> <br /> As a result, I was thrilled to see that Cinderella 2 would arrive on TV and I would be able to see it. <br /> <br /> I should have known better. <br /> <br /> This film joins the sequel club of the film that should have been left alone. It has absolutely nothing of the original super charm! It seems quite rough, and almost brutal, from the (non) Sing-a-long to the characterization. <br /> <br /> While I remember that the character tells a story through a song, the soundtrack of this movie was placed over the top and didn't seem to fit. Jaq's transformation into a human is a prime example: where he was going around eating an apple and adding a few little jokes here and there, he would have to dance and sing about how good it was to be tall! And in the ballroom there's the country music of the old hay dance. It is as if the writers forgot where and when this story was set. The fine violins certainly did not fit. <br /> <br /> Even the artwork and animation of Cinderella 2 are not up to the original. The art work of this film seems quite raw and less detailed. And we see a part of Cinderella's circle skirt, which doesn't look right. <br /> <br /> The movie itself could have been his story, I think it should have been just that. I wouldn't say I hate it, but I think it has a lot of flaws. It seems to recede significantly from the beloved original Cinderella.
