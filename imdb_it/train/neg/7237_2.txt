Life is really too short for films like this. I knew it couldn't be nice when I realized what I had already suspected - that David Schwimmer would play exactly the same kind of person he plays in "Friends". <br /> <br /> Let's face it, both the boy cannot play anything but a nerd or he is never offered any other party. I have the feeling it's a mixture of both. <br /> <br /> And I must say that it is extremely difficult to appreciate a film that completely wastes the remarkable talents of Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette and Carol Kane !!!
