I really wanted to like this movie and I looked all the way thinking it should improve. Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst movie ever but it's not up to its potential. The premise is good, the cast is fantastic (I was particularly pumped to watch David Naughton return) and, if God loves them, you can tell everyone that they did their best. It's just relapse again and again. "Brutal Massacre" should serve as a constant reminder for directors that only Christopher Guest can make Christopher Guest films and, despite the fact that it makes it seem easy, you should probably just forget to try the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic at this and should be seen more often ... they are the reason they get 4 stars from me. If you're going to have the "Spinal Tap" of horror, I suspect you might want the guy who did "Spinal Tap" to steer him ... just thinking out loud there.
