Returning today, this film would be a very disturbing and very disturbing dark comedy. Stalking, obsession and a network of lies and manipulations receive a 1948 gloss of innocent innocence. Drake plays the stalker, an impassive user of people, alternately pathetic and manipulative, Grant plays the victim of stalking, alternately angry and unaware. <br /> <br /> Vastly disturbing; Since then I have not been able to look at classic stories with the same suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br />
