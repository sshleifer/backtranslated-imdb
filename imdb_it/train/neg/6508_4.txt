This is a rip off of the old premise of Frankenstein. An acclaimed scientist is killed in a bizarre accident and his father, a noted brain surgeon, saves his brain. It is then inserted into a robotic body of its own project. His brother, a genius of electronics, gives the impulse of the "colossus" to transfer thoughts into movement. The whole project goes wrong, when the creation goes crazy. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not developed. The script is lacking. And it's funny that this isn't a little scary. Well, very young children will think this is good. If you are awake at three in the morning and it turns on .... night, night. <br /> <br /> The main characters are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff played the 'Colossus'.
