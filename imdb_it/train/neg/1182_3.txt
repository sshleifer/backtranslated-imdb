This film is little more than a poor quality fetish porn, and this is saying a lot considering the similar crap that was made at that time. This was recommended to me by a friend as "a unique cinematic experience". He was right. I suppose he meant it as a joke. It's not disgusting, not even so shocking. Only mediocre acting and few attempts at the art of shock. A bit of field value, although I don't think the producers of this film intended it. And yes, as a previous reviewer mentioned, it's sex with a boy in a bear costume. Don't spend a lot of money on this. Try to borrow it if you need to see it. Or contact me, I would be happy to sell you my copy at half price. <br /> <br /> I may have to see another of this particular director's films, as it seems to have a certain following. But if it's something like that, I'll regret another 2 hours of my life forever.
