I have to say that I was very curious to see this film, and it was considered a notorious disaster when it was published by 20th Century Fox in 1970. It also appeared on several lists of bad film critics, and this only deepened an interest, such as I just had to see what made this movie so ugly. As long as I saw it, I think I have my answers. Even if I say that he does it out of curiosity, acting, directing and script are so ridiculously bad, that the alleged satire is completely missing. Racquel Welch seems to be trying to bring the film, but after the opening sequence of the sex change operation, the film goes so far that he can't handle this task alone. John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner is certainly not a help, since he licks and smiles at the screen, sometimes it looks like he's wondering what he's doing there. Rex Reed bounces as Myron, Myra's alter ego, and even has his famous masturbation scene. Bravo for debut performances! Farrah Fawcett plays a stupid blonde; she certainly seemed convincing in this role. But of course, probably the best known role went to Mae West. The sight of a 75-year-old woman with a plastic face making sexual allusions seemed more suitable for a horror movie. I do not intend to put this cast personally; but in this film, nobody gets in shape. The direction seems so little reassuring and non-existent, that the film is not only bad, but also boring. Throw in some old footage of old stars, and the movie becomes even more disconnected. To each his staff who liked this, and I was glad to have seen it at least, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be the disaster that has always been thought to be from the beginning.
