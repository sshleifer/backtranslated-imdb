I'm probably one of the few viewers that I wouldn't recommend this movie. The thought is visually stunning like all of Ang Lee's work (every frame seems worthy of a print), I was really disappointed by the uneven rhythm of the film. It was really too long. <br /> <br /> The plot is set in the Civil War era of Missouri, and is about a young man (Roedel) who joins the wild forces of the Bushwackers, a sort of renegade Confederate sympathizers leading the fighting geurilla with the Jayhawkers, their Union counterparts. He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chiles played by Skeet Ulrich, join the group after Chile's father was shot at point blank and his home burned down, presumably by Jayhawkers. The story follows the adventures of Roedel and Chiles and their interactions with other victims of the war, including the former slave fighting for the Bushwhackers (Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright) and a war widow played by Jewel. <br /> <br /> It seemed that whenever the film developed the story on an interesting point, it would turn into some other subplot and leave things undeveloped. For example, the unrest among Roedel's group caused by the former slave Holt participating in the Confederate cause is briefly shown through a conflict concerning property and protocol, and then dropped later into the film. A young villain / bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and directs much anguish and violence against him, but we never know why. Some of the characters never seem to surface; I think it's because the film embraces too many of them as well as occupying large amounts of history. <br /> <br /> The historical detail was excellent. I liked looking at the houses, the furniture, the clothes, etc., And I thought that the main actors did a great job of humanizing the characters, although they had stumbled a bit in the dialogue. Unless you really like the story or are a big fan of Ang Lee, though, take a ride on this.
