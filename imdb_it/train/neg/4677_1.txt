What a weight of the left Hollywood bilge. This film glorifies the brave and noble mutiny if it is for pacifist principles. The fable ends with the pacifist character, played by Danzel Washington, actually promoted for his betrayal. What is it with these Hollywood tools? Is this still a return for McCarthyism? <br /> <br /> If I look cynical, it's because I'm fed up with the films that steal a political agenda. The military brass in this film is portrayed as, what else? War mercenaries Gung-ho. Does it sound familiar? Have you ever seen a movie where the CIA or any government agency wasn't evil? Think about it. Once again, Crimson Tide emphasizes the point. The character of Hackman, Captain U-boat Ramsey, looks like a lunatic delirious, until when he naturally comes to his senses, makes a complete 360, renounces his lust for blood, suggests a promotion for the dishonest Ron Hunter , and repents retiring from the service. A guy falls silent, takes command of your boat, puts the United States at serious risk of receiving a first nuclear attack, and you promote it ???? What nonsense!
