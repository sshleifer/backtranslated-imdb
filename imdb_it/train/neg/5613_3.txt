In my opinion this film has no new thinking. I seem to bring a spear to a spear without looking to one side! the director seems to have an agenda! Duh! I find that his rational lack does not seem to have room for alternative vision. I for example am usually on the opposing side, but this film lacks credibility because it is based on the fantastic observations of the man / woman on the street. really now if you want to create a credible alternative to a creed kept for more than 2000 years, you have to make a greater effort to allow the other party to express their beliefs. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the film it seemed to me an attack on Cristian's faith, I for one am an unbeliever, but I allow the beliefs of others, and I wouldn't want them not to ridicule them but try to understand and tolerate.
