The last two weeks of a vagabond dead woman's life are told in flashbacks. Like the tramp, the film wanders aimlessly and rather uselessly. Mona, the character of the lazy, grumpy and addicted title, is not nice and Bonnaire does little to make it interesting. Although there is a pretentious dialogue that tries to explain why Mona chose this miserable lifestyle, her motivations are never clear. The episodic nature of the film, which involves some random characters, becomes tiring after a while, making it seem much longer than its running time. It is also difficult to believe that an attractive homeless young woman will no longer attract attention from men.
