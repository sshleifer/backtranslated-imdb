Last week, I looked at the weekly Nielsen ratings, and there was Veronica Mars, presumably "the best show you're not watching". <br /> <br /> Well, they are right that you are not watching it. It aired twice and was ranked 147 and 145 on 147. <br /> <br /> Translation: this is the show with the score lower on any national transmission network ... and deservedly. I tried to watch it a couple of times because of all the coverage in the press that praised it as a "fantastic" show, a "realistic aspect" of life and all this nonsense. The reality was otherwise. Veronica Mars is boring. It is unrealistic enough, and fully deserves to be canceled. <br /> <br /> The only Mystery is the reason why CW felt obliged to schedule the lowest program in memory, after two years of continuous commercial and artistic failure.
