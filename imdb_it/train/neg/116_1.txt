I can't believe that those who praise this film don't think of any other films. I was prepared for the possibility that this would be terrible, but the script (or lack thereof) makes a film just as useless. On the plus side, the general level of artillery by the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you have the ear of a sow to work with you can't create a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick to any other film in which he has been. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughter at the expense of those who seem to ask should stick to the incredibly terrible book by Peter B, Killing of the Unicorn.
