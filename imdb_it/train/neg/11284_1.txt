I usually try to build criticisms on reasonably well-argued films, but I can't believe this has outgrown the script. The dialogue is terrifying, the acting is very doubtful, the accents are simply horrible, and the direction and rhythm are at best picky. <br /> <br /> I can't remember the last time I saw a bad movie. Joseph Fiennes, however cute, could have killed his career as quickly as it started. <br /> <br /> Dr. Moreau's island was no worse than this garbage.
