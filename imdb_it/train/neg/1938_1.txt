Where to start? <br /> <br /> # 1 Amitabh's son, played by Akshaye Khanna, is 30 years old. <br/> <br /> Amitabh has been in prison for over 33 years ... he <br /> <br /> A) Telepathically transmitted the semen house? <br /> <br /> B) Asked a nice Pakistani guard to send it for him? <br /> <br /> C) Allow marital visits in secret Pakistani prisons <br /> <br /> D) All the above <br /> <br /> E) The producers were having a little too much bhang <br /> <br /> when did they approve the script? <br /> <br /> # 2) Amrita Rao (Yummm!) wants Khanna - he is yum, yum, yummy ... and apparently he wants her - who wouldn't, right ?! ... But, when his father is killed, and then killed (I don't think it's a "spoiler" like you should be brain dead and blind so as not to see this coming in the film) he is rather emotionless towards this catastrophe and with the tip (metaphorically) of his hat, he leaves it behind to save his father, don't worry about his loss, and he says (to paraphrase) "If God wills it, we will meet again" ... Basically meaning "I will take my father from my job done, I'm sorry for your loss - CYA! Buh Bye! "- callus beyond the low life Hollywood standards ... <br /> <br /> # 3) There are so many holes in this horrible waste of time called a movie, which you can drive all the jeeps, camel trucks and anything else through the pass. Pass - really, complete and total waste of time - Oh! There is a great dance sequence (yes, only one - as in the dance sequence - regardless of quality) great belly dance - but it is NOT worth looking at just for that. <br /> <br /> Rent Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (Hrithik Roshan will ever take acting lessons?) for best Indo-Pak conflict films ... In fact, Veer-Zaara is damn good - 7.5 / 8 I would say!
