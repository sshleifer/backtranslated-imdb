because it is the only way not to think that this film is a total waste of time and money. A remake of "Heaven Can Wait" (which was at least worth looking at) is an excuse for a romantic comedy. It's more a vehicle to give the Rock some time in a movie for a weak stand-by comedy that doesn't sound good on the big screen. Especially because his jokes are generally supposed to come from the body of an old man, fat, rich, dead but are shown coming from the same Rock. While insulting blacks and whites, chemistry is completely wrong. The film is not funny, badly turned the acting is weak at best. Rent "Heaven Can Wait" and a live Rock video and you'll be far ahead of the game.
