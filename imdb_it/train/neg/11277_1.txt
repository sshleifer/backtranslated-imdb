There is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast, but unfortunately this does not help the main negative aspects of the film. I never understand why filmmakers ask actors / actresses to use accents that are not their own when it's obvious to everyone they can't convince. Fiennes does not know how to play Irish and Fitzgerald is not much better at Russian. When the voice is wrong, no matter how good the acting is, the character will never be convincing. As for the biggest problem .... the plot ... was there? I guess there was some sort of plot, but it was so full of holes that I couldn't wait for the movie to end ... it was ridiculous. Save 90 minutes of your life and don't watch this movie!
