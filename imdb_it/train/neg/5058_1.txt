(When will I ever learn?) The ecstatic reviewer on NPR made me think that this turkey was another Citizen Kane. Please allow me to vent my spleen ... <br /> <br /> I'll admit: the setting, presumably New York City, has never been so ugly and unattractive. I remember that the 70s were a bad decade for men's fashion and cars. And all the smokers! If the plan was to minimize the characters, he succeeded. <br /> <br /> For a film to work (at least, according to my simple estimate), there must be at least ONE sympathetic character. Only Ned Beaty approached and I couldn't wait for Nicky to finish. If a stray shot had struck Mikey, well, it might have caused a hint of indifference at most. <br /> <br /> I don't remember when I hated a movie with the same intensity. I suppose I'm a rube who doesn't dig "artistic" gestures. Oh good.
