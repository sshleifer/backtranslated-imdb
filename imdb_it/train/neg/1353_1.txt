What is that? it is a mixture of bizarre recurring motifs (snails, Shirley Temple, swastikas and openly racist music, among others) not conditioned by any kind of narrative or plot or character development. The whole thing struck me in a self-conscious way as a "freak show", and I don't just mean the unusual casting decisions. It has the feeling of a bad acid trip, far beyond any level of drug use that could be attributed to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only film I can compare it to is Eraserhead (my least favorite film of all time), which was much more depressing, but I still found What Is It? a total waste of my time. It is one thing to give me a peek into the inner workings of someone else's mind - even the chemically altered consciousness of someone else - but another thing is to simply throw strange visual effects on me purely for reasons of strangeness.
