I thought this film had absolutely no morals. I mean, how would you feel if your boyfriend left you on your wedding day for your cousin ??? I'd be heartbroken !! It's classified as a comedy, but I didn't find it funny at all. I thought that mostly just found cheap laughs and took them. I normally love Julie Stiles movies, but this is an exception. Jason Lee performs in another shameful show, which shows once again that decent class and morality are not relevant in today's society. He had a total lack of taste and contempt for films like this. I understand that people will defend this film and its morality because it is "Just a movie", but I still remain in my sign that this bad behavior should not be allowed on the screen. I'm not trying to say that if you liked this movie, you're a bad person, since everyone has a right to their opinion and parts of this movie are fun, I'm just saying that in real life people behave like the characters in this movie they were doing is shameful.
