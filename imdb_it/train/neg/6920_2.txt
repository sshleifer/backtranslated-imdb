Body Slam (1987) is a terrible film. The low budget stinks, the direction is pedestrian (at best) and writing and acting are lame. But if you like old school wrestling (between the 70s and the mid 80s), you'll be more amused than the average spectator. I must warn you, this movie smells like ice. I gave it a two because I felt like being generous. This turkey was "directed" by stunt master Hal Needham. The stars are Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid and a group of wrestlers and c-list actors (Dirk Benedict). <br /> <br /> The synopsis of this "movie" is about a promoter who wants to combine "rock" hair and wrestling. But there are others who do not want him to succeed. If you can stand the bad acting and the inane plot, there are some surprises towards the end for wrestling fans. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this to my worst enemy (and I mean it).
