There is a lot of errors in this image, starting with an obvious and redundant script. Courtney Cox plays a comic artist who flees to a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city. She is immediately chased by a local who seems quite upset (Craig Sheffer), and who seems to be attempting a third Mickey Rourke imitation. D.B. Sweeny is a local policeman, who is supposedly there to protect and serve. Meanwhile, does the script manipulate the audience about who the really nice guy is? Logic flies out of the window after the first ten minutes and never comes back, and there are more unanswered questions than there should be. If you think "Blue Desert" can be saved by the wonderful Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. His part is insignificant, just like the whole movie. - MERK
