I'm a wife of a youth pastor and we took some youth to watch this movie. So we spent an hour trying to explain it to him. They didn't understand it and didn't like it. It is based on a concept that has crossed all three of the major religions of the world (the Biblical Code, the Code of the Torah and the Code in the Koran) and is so debatable that it is ridiculous. This is not a step forward for Christians in the arts, it is a step forward for those who believe that we control our brains at the door.
