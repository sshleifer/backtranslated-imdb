This really does not correspond to the Castle of Cagliostro. Lupine is not fun or extravagant or hyperactive. The scenery and the music are not inspired and the plot is not interesting. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this one is the nudity (only in the full version) provided by Fujiko. He helped revive some of the boring scenes. CoC had a formidable villain and created the film for some fantastic set-pieces. The positions in TSoTG are not very lively or engaging. <br /> <br /> Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen don't even offer a decent show this time. It is as if they were simply filling a contractual obligation by appearing. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in full-frame with Dolby Stereo audio. It has a fair amount of extras, including some trailers. But a curious thing. There is no chapter selection on the disc or on the timecode displayed on the player once inserted. Although you can still jump to the next scene number using the remote control.
