Yes, I'm sure it could really be a nation. . . if four of them were all in the four corners of the world and the other two had cloned a few billion times. Friend, I'm REALLY glad to have seen this movie on FEAR.net instead of renting it. I'm a big fan of George Romero's movies and I'm pretty sure that if he saw this movie, he probably would have vomited while laughing too hard. I mean, what was that raccoon girl who posed as zombies and walked around like Charlie's Devils? The fact that the composer chose parade music for when the zombies approached their murderer was also very useful, especially the part where they enter the posing warehouse as the furniture store / police station / apartment / apartment / any room was with the gong in the background, and the live woman was arguing over the closed furniture store. I couldn't even say which nationality the killer was, and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations didn't even help. Oh well, what can I expect from a movie where they throw themselves into a random fight scene without a good reason in a warehouse where they apparently send air boxes all over the world. So, for all those who love the Mystery Science Theater 3000 or if you just like hovering over the bad C movies (C for Craptastic), then this is the movie for you. . . or not.
