Harold Pinter rewrites Anthony Schaeffer's classic comedy about a man who goes to visit his lover's husband and lets everything go sideways. The original film starred with Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. Caine plays the role of Olivier in this version and is paired with Jude Law. Here the film is directed by Kenneth Branaugh. <br /> <br /> The acting is spectacular. Both Caine and Law are gangbusters in their respective roles. I really like chemistry and the clash of personalities. It's wonderful and quite a reason to watch when the direction of the script goes haywire. <br /> <br /> The dialogue of Harold Pinter is sharp and sharp and often very witty and I understand why he was chosen to rewrite the game (which is updated using surveillance cameras and the like). The problem is that the way the script moves the characters is terrible. Michale Caine walks Law through his strange modern home with sliding doors and panels for no good reason. Conversations occur repeatedly in different places. I know Pinter did it in his plays, but in this case it gets boring. Why do we need the couple to go over and over again that Law is sleeping with Caine's wife? It would be fine if at a certain point the law said enough that we did it, but it does not act as if it were the first time each time. Even the script does not move Caine through his manipulation of the Law. To begin with, he is blindly angry to start, so he has no chance to turn around and scare us (no matter a revelation of the late game that makes you wonder why he took the trouble). here we do and while giving an advantage also somehow it seems false since it is so clear that we are forced to ask ourselves why Milo's Law does not see that it was created. There are some other examples, but to say more would give too much. <br /> <br /> Thinking of the film in retrospect, I think it's a film of missed opportunities and missteps. Wasted opportunities are the possibility of having better fireworks between Caine and Law. Step by step, the choice of a flashy environment and strange changes in the plot lead away from the creation of a credible tension and thriller. Instead we get smart dialogues and great performances in a film that doesn't make them real. <br /> <br /> despite some great performances and witty dialogues this is just a 4 out of 10 because the rest of the script simply doesn't work
