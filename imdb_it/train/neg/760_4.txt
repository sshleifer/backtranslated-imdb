A "new" uninspired and indifferent Columbo who sees the man-in-the-mac attending the wedding of his nephew, only that his bride disappears on their wedding night. Columbo investigates ... <br /> <br /> And that's all: indifferently tracks and surprisingly loaded with a flat script, since it was written by Robert Van Scoyk, who wrote the very funny story of Columbo "Murder Under "Glass" in the golden age of the detective, there is not even a murder to talk about and the greatest amount of ingenuity offered to Columbo by the screenwriter is the shrinking of suspects through the photos taken at the wedding, which include all those that they were there! <br /> <br /> Without any traits of Columbo possible, I thought I was watching an episode of Hill Street Blues, an insult to the history of the series, with soap opera-style acting.
