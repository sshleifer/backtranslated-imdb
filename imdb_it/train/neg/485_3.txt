When I saw the preview, I thought: this will be a great movie. And indeed it could have been. The actress who plays the main character was very credible and the beauty of the shooting is undeniable. However the dialogues cast a dark shadow over the entire image. The level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action that took place in 1610 and removed much of the film's magic. However, I must congratulate the translator, because the English subtitles were more refined and appropriate than the original French cues, and probably explains the good evaluation the film received on the imbd!
