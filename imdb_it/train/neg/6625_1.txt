this is the first time I write a comment on a movie on IMDb. but I had to write it for this. its 3 hours of unadulterated torture. from the beginning you get the idea that the film will be bad. acting is pathetic. I'm a big fan of Ajay Devgan (I loved him in Bhagat Singh) but he's at his worst in this movie. Amitabh seems to have worked hard for this, but somehow it lacks fear. prashant raj is a non-actor. and the most irritating part of the film is nisha kothari. I have no idea why the director took her to this movie. the background score is repetitive. somehow I heard that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar, the color theme, the background, the camera angles, but it didn't work. PLEASE DO NOT LOOK
