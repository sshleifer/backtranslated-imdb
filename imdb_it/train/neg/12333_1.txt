A-beep-believable! Meg Ryan doesn't even seem like her usual and lovable in this, which usually makes me forgive her superficial acting suck. Hard to believe she was the producer of this dog. Also Kevin Kline: what kind of suicide trip did his career take? Whoosh ... Banzai !!! In the end this was directed by the guy who made the Big Chill? It must be a replay of Jonestown - Hollywood style. Wooofff!
