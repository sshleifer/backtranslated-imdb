I love Dracula but this film was a complete disappointment! I remember Lee from other Dracula films from when I was younger, and I thought it was great, but this movie was really bad. I don't know if it was my youth that made me believe that Lee was the last Dracula, with style, appearance, attraction and evil below that. Or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me. <br /> <br /> But can you imagine Dracula with a snobbish English accent and body language to accompany him? Do you like it when a plot contains unrealistic choices on the part of the characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension ..? Then this is a movie for you! <br /> <br /> Otherwise, don't see it! I only gave a 2 because somehow I managed to stay awake during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry but if you liked this movie you must have been deprived of sleep and be home alone in a dark room with a lot of uncovered space behind you. Perhaps alone in your parents' home or in a strange house. Because not even the characters in this film were afraid, and I think it sums it up! <br /> <br /> Or maybe you like this movie because of its place in the history of Dracula's cinema, perhaps being fascinated by how The story of Dracula evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today. Because as a film it is not so captivating, it does not involve you in the evocative mystery that for me makes the myth of Vampyre so fascinating. <br /> <br /> And it also has so much of that bad taste on it. The scenery looks like an economic theater. And I'm not saying that rejecting everything that was done in the 1970s. Because I can love the old movie and also the new one.
