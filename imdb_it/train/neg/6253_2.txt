It is not a good film, but according to the information it is quite accurate in depicting torture techniques. The aim of the film was to show the brutality of the NK POW camps and this was done quite effectively, with surprising frankness for the time. Whatever the technical flaws (and there are many) looking at this you will see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some rather unpleasant things - again, bad because they are made north of the DMZ and not at Guantanamo Bay. <Br /> <br /> I don't think any of the Korean veterans brought his torture while running to the office, and if you watch movies like this and Pork Chop Hill in comparison to Vietnam movies. I don't know if it was the people in '54 trapped in the concepts of the Second World War (boys tend to beat a lot) or the war or what, but it's interesting to see it from the same system that 16 years later would have been making films like "Go Tell The Spartans ".
