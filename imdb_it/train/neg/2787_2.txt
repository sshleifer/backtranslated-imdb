From the story of the numbers of the Kid (Prince), a singer, on his way to becoming a star. Then he falls in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). But it has to do with his father who beats his wife (Clarence Williams III!) And his self-destructive behavior. <br /> <br /> I saw him in a theater in 1984. I wasn't a big Prince fan but I liked the three great songs on this movie: "Purple Rain", "Let's Get Crazy" and "When Doves Cry ". The concert scenes in this film are fantastic, full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately this is a VERY small part of the film. <br /> <br /> The story is really obvious and has already been repeated many times - and even better. The subplots are, to be inserted, poorly managed. The love triangle between The Kid, Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I was actually insulted. The wife who beats her father is necessary for the story, but the scenes are handled so badly (in acting and directing) that I couldn't believe it. The script is terrible - very bad dialogues and some really painful "comedy" routines. And there is so much misogyny here - the child's mother is beaten; The Kid hits Appolonia and (without reason) Appolonia strips and goes topless to swim in a dirty river. Even Williams and Princes' characters treat women horribly constantly. <br /> <br /> Acting is where this movie REALLY fails. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful - but no actor. And Prince is (easily) the worst actor I've ever seen. His empty face and his wooden dialogue are so bad that I couldn't believe it. This film comes to life only during the concert scenes, but there are not so many. The "dramatic" scenes are so poorly managed and managed that they make this film a task to sit on. They should have just made this a concert movie. I give this a 2 - only for music.
