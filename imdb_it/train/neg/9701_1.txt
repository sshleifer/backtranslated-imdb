A really bad sequel. The first part has had many funny moments - the second part is simply bad (in a boring way) and obviously meant to squeeze money out of the fans. <br /> <br /> Too bad, Otto Waalkes! <br /> <br /> The only slightly funny moment in the film is Helge Schneider, who apparently seems to be worried about the other characters. It's easy to identify with him ... <br /> <br /> The script is sloppy / non-existent. The director should do everyone a favor and leave his job immediately. Acting is worse than a 2nd grade school play. <br /> <br /> Technically even the film is horrible, but who can blame the filmmakers / helmsmen who had to work with such a talented director?
