How good Gwyneth Paltrow is! This is the right movie for her ... pity it's completely out of role. I haven't read Jane Austen's book, but I can't believe it's so superficial and that the characters aren't much more than caricatures. Probably not so easy to reduce around 600 pages of the book in 2 hours of the show, but I expected more than just seeing old furniture and teacups. I breathed a sigh of relief every time I saw an actor who did not exceed the mark of the excessive (a couple of times).
