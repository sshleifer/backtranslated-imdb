In addition to all the technical errors .... <br /> <br /> How about a female flight attendant who is able to kill 4 of the 7 terrorists (including ex-marines) on her own, 2 of whom without even using a gun. Then the plane lands perfectly. We are not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton; we are talking about a regular, scared but very well composed flight attendant. : D How about the head of the assault / rescue team, who has a plan to test everything (according to the logic of the script) to sleep all of them and have someone from his team fly the plane. Only he decides instantly to change plans and instead conduct an attack on the terrorists, shooting guns, not knowing where the terrorists are, or how many, and not ensuring an advantageous position, so that his whole team can easily be canceled . Yes, he is using the old pumpkin. Only later to decide to use sleep gas anyway. And it turns out to be useless for all intensive purposes. <br /> <br /> As bad as this film was, though, I couldn't stop myself from looking and asking, and then? : D I can't help but imagine all the excellent unemployed screenwriters who think about themselves, it's not fair. lol! : D
