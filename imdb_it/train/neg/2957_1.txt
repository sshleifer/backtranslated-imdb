What a mess!! Why was this film made? This and other films of his "caliber" should be educational tools on how not to make a film. Children might like it, but anyone over the age of 10 may or may not approve it. To make matters worse there was the fact that talents like Whoopi Goldberg and Armin Mueller Stahl were entirely wasted on a movie unworthy of any warning.
