Give Verhoeven "sex on the brain" to invent a useless and youthful version of the INVISIBLE MAN story. If he directed a movie about Pokemon, I'm sure he would turn it into a kind of big orgy. I don't care about sex or even slaving (check my other reviews) on the film, but frankly, it's obvious that the director has a single mind and can't see interesting aspects of an invisible man's storyline that the vicious derive. It's a shame because it would have been nice if the movie hadn't spent so much time having an invisible Kevin Bacon to women to grope. <br /> <br /> The cast of actors does what they can with the mischievous script of a single note, but I felt bad for some of them, including William Devane, who is completely wasted here. <br /> <br /> But then what could I have expected from the director of SHOWGIRLS, which, btw, is much more fun than this tacky movie.
