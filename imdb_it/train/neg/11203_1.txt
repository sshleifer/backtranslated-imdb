The screenwriter tried to recreate "the exorcist", but staged a love story bla bla that makes you sick instead of keeping you boyfriend, there is no substance in this whole film, it has the potential to be something special but does it by showing a lot of people things that nobody cares about. Extremely boring, I wanted to leave the theater when I saw it, but stupid movie tickets were expensive so I had to endure the sad torture that seemed to last forever Nothing on the screen has related relevance to what the characters were talking about. <br /> <br /> They use computer graphics here, which instead of surprising me (as expected, I hate CGI) has ruined the film even more. Some say that this film was horrible in theaters because of how "stimulating" and "slow-without-action-because it's an intelligent film". What is so intelligent or stimulating when the story is basically about the handsome boy H And Ledger as a priest who has a love interest and disobeys his religion? It looks like an uninspired concept. Oh, there's mumbo jumbo on the "sin eater" (the film was originally called "sin eater"). Lame concept but the film took the "sin eater" thing too seriously, making the film pathetic and delirious about how dark and intelligent it was. Yes, I know there were real sinners in the Middle Ages, but this film makes it seem trivial. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the film was performed well and I forgot why I took the trouble to see this movie. Look for horror movies that have depth, look at Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant, Naked Blood, Society, Cannibal Holocaust, Pin, Exorcist, Omen, or any of Romero's "Dead Trilogy" movies. The nonsense dialogue is not equivalent to intelligence people, mainstream cinema fans think that anyway (the same kind of people who think that a ridiculous film like Hulk is a cinematic masterpiece). If you want a boring and disturbing horror, look at the Order. This film makes the church look like a roller coaster ride.
