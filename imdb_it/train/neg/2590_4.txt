American Pie has gone very far from the first. At first I think the actors don't have the slightest idea what they do and instead it's just a remake of a crazy college party. Story looks like two college boys (with the sweetening young man) who expose their dreams of attending college just to experience night parties, sex and, of course, alcohol. The plot is stupid and comes away from the original cake. In fact they have not yet staged an apple pie somewhere in the film. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I work in a video store and can rent it for free. But please remember that it's a waste of time unless you like mindless sex movies with absolute nudity and drinking crowds. I am a teenager too and I believe that even Evan Almighty would have been a better choice.
