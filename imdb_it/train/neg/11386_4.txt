One of those Thank-God-I-don-live-there documentaries. This tells of two factions at war in Colombia, guerrillas and paramilitaries, and the surrounding peoples of Medellin. <br /> <br /> Guns, drugs and death are rampant. The boys, no bigger than 22, not in the middle of fighting a war are in prison. The girls ?? not women, girls ?? always react in the same way when one of them is killed, with tears and screams. They scratch your head; what did they really expect? I don't know what is more disturbing: the night shootings and the civil disturbances, or that everyone seems to passively accept things as they are. Or, seeing that guy drink what obviously isn't his first beer, being all that, 10? If you were to take these of these young people out of their situation and put them in a place where they had the opportunity to do more, be more, how many would have chosen not to stay? <br /> <br /> Based on this documentary, everything, I'm afraid.
