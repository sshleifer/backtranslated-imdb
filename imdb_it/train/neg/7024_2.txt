I borrowed this film because not only because of its gay theme, but the thought of role-playing really intrigued me. I was pleasantly surprised that it was shot in San Francisco since I live near San Francisco. And of course it was nice to see the shots of the Castro district (even though castration is better for me than gay men than women). But apart from that I can't really recommend this movie. The characters are not really developed for me to care about and when they finally started going to the "role play" I was already bored by my mind. And the role plays I saw were a little awkward to watch. Acting leaves something to be desired. Needless to say, I didn't finish the film. I would skip this.
