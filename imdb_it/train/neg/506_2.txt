(aka: The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance) <br /> <br /> A lot of naked girls in this with a couple of lesbian scenes thrown in. The film should take place in Ireland, but it seems more like Rome and the Adriatic to me. <br /> <br /> Gothic lesbians are invited to the castle of the island by a count for the weekend. One by one they seem to lack the head due to a madman running around. <br /> <br /> It is not very scary or bloody and the rooms seem to be illuminated by the spotlights even if the candles are lit. Go figure ... (sic) <br /> <br /> Dubbing is worse than usual and the plot serves only as an excuse for eroticism and nudity. Directed by the euro horror actor Alfredo Rizzo, this is a snoozer. <br /> <br /> Rather boring 2 out of 10
