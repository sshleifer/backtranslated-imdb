The worst movie I've seen in quite a while. Interesting first part with an engaging and tense dialogue between doubtful characters in a night bar. The film degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes that aim at visual shock (read the disgust) without any observation or lesson on humanity or other. <br /> <br /> I wanted to go out, but the director was present at this demonstration and my kindness prevented me from showing him the lack of respect. However, time is precious (as the director observed in his intro) and I really regret the time I wasted in the second half of this. <br /> <br /> The graces saved were the three protagonists of the first half of the film, in particular the female protagonist.
