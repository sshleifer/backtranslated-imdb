Considering the risk of showing same-sex relationships before the end of the 1980s, Personal Best could have done better to interpret the homosexual relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) as a more than experimental phase of life of Cahill. br /> <br /> It seems to me that the creators of this film have thrown same-sex relationships between two attractive enough women to attract viewers. Also consider the 90 seconds horse show of several women jumping backwards on a high jump pole. This random scene had VERY LITTLE relevance to the film and appeared as if this was done just to keep the public interested in this bland film. I suppose the producers were trying to neutralize the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie (the Oregon 1980 athletics competition). <br /> <br /> This review may seem hard, but it's true. The exploitation of the body of the young Muriel Hemingway and the homosexual relationship have ruined every credit I would have given to this film. <br /> <br /> Pepper Thompson
