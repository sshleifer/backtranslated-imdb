I read somewhere that when Kay Francis refused to cut her pay, Warner Bros. took her revenge for entrusting her to smaller projects for the rest of her contract. <br /> <br /> He decided to take the money. But his career suffered accordingly. <br /> <br /> This could explain what he was doing in "Comet Over Broadway". (Although he doesn't explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter are also there.) "Ludicrous" is the word that others have used for the plot of this film, and it is right on target. The murder trial. His sad career as vaudeville. His success in London. His final scene with his daughter. No part leads logically to the next part. <br /> <br /> Also, the sets and costumes looked like B-movie stuff. And his hair! Turner is showing many and many of his films this month. Look at ANYONE OTHER and you will do yourself a favor.
