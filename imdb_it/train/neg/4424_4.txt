Uh Oh! Another gay movie. This time it shows the black side. Bet your last dollar, it will have an unhappy ending! But why? With only less than half a dozen exceptions, ALL gay movies must end with death or a "goodbye" ending. It's like all versions of European Film Noir in the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s. The protagonist ... male or female must die or ride alone into oblivion. Why must writers, directors and producers in the name of God let the public feel depressed? After all, he should be gay ... not gloomy. Perhaps the category should be turned into a "glum" film. A high percentage of gay relationships lasts and couples take a ride together at sunset! It doesn't matter who writes or produces, only shows the negative side of gay life and gives the wrong impression of the gay lifestyle. This film only shows my point. If you rent the DVD, take an antidepressant, because here comes another "gay" movie! This is wrong!
