Perhaps one of the worst teenage slasher movies I've ever seen. I'll start with the negative points of the film, which pretty much covers the whole movie. First of all, something that nobody can avoid: TERRIBLE THAT WORKS. I swear they picked up some random kids from the street based on how they looked. Secondly, WORK / DEVELOPMENT OF A BAD / INCIDENTAL NATURE. You don't even know half of the children who are killed here. All you think is that they deserved it one way or another. The Scarecrow character was exaggerated and a cheap rip-off of other great fantasy killers like Freddy or Pinhead. Next: BAD DIALOG: The Scarecrow was full of horrible one-liners that made you laugh, just because it was so terrible. Lines like "Let's go find some small animals to torture!" really leaves you with a raised eyebrow. Last but not least: Next off: BAD CASTING. How old was the boy who played Lester? Do you like 30? The back of his head was bald for God's sake. There is much more to say about this film, like cheap special effects, it's the "film school" effort, but the point is clear. It's just bad film that does the worst. As for what I found to be "good" in the film: - Intervention for those with low, low, BASSI standards - It would help to put the sleepless to sleep. - A very cheap laugh, or even a little laugh.
