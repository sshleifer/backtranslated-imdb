Lately this film is shown several times via cable, so .. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for these two attractive women to quarrel with both Luke Wilson and the same "vile" villain in this film. The actresses are very nice and that's the only reason to watch this movie. I suppose it's "funny" that Luke is even uglier / dorkier / stupid friend around, but well, that's what we get. <br /> <br /> None of the female protagonists would ever, NEVER talk to any of the males in this film for more than 5 minutes. What we get is that they sobb and cry and argue and so on more than 2 guys who were best described on Friday 13 4. Dead * @ $ #
