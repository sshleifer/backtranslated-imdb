Oh ... my ... god ... this is without a doubt the most exaggerated film I've ever seen. The acting is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker and the whole movie doesn't make sense. Pair this with mediocre direction, really strange scenes (like the one in which the child reaches the ravine and falls mysteriously inside), and a completely abyssal dialogue ("Look!" "Musta put himself on his pants!"), And take a complete failure. Not to mention the fact that the only thing that Mr. Atlas seems to be able to defeat is a case of chocolate bars. But that's part of the film's appeal. Sit down and watch it with some of your friends for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, because it's SO BAD!
