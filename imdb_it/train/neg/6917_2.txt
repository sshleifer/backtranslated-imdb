Once again the same family history of a man (the writer here) who sells his soul to the devil to have his most coveted ambition in life: success. Shameless script (we should "go home and write better"), ridiculous lines to understand the "strong" "Christianity" message (our only aspiration in life is to find love, respect and a good friendship) and a very long long scene at the end, where Agent Hopkins beat the devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is not sexy or evil for nothing) for all the bad things he did to this unlikely character. Not bad the efforts of the actors (Baldwin also as a director, Cattrall in a role of "Sex and the City", Aykroyd with some funny jokes in his limited role). Post scriptum Try also a not very popular movie from Greece called "Alloimono stous neous", an ingenious adaptation of this myth (an old man gives his soul to the devil to get his youth back)
