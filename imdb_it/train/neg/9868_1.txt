I hardly ever commented on films, but I saw the 5 positive reviews of this "movie" and decided to evaluate my review. One of my instructors received this film by mail, mixed with his Academy fencers (AMPAS, or the boys who voted on the Oscars), and was so upset by how terribly this film that brought him into our class to show us how NOT to put a movie together. <br /> <br /> This film has no plot, the scenes are horribly, horribly modified (often using fake "24" style picture-in-picture techniques), and performances (especially the protagonist, who fails not even acting like a bad actress) are for the most part hateful. Someone has really failed to understand the point of an introduction, ie the plot setting. There is no installation! In the middle of the film neither I nor the rest of the class knew what this film should have been. The blow with the opening crane, which creates a kind of murder, is never dealt with, and now that I think about it, maybe it was thought to be a flash-forward, with the rest of the film being a flashback, but it cuts from that scene directly to the next without any indication as such. <br /> <br /> Bah, I could really go on forever. At least, this film gives me renewed confidence in my ability to make films.
