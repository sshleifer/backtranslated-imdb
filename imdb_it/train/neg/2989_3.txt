Although the sympathy of someone who focuses on this comment among the other 80+ for this film is low, I feel I have to say something about this. I'm not the kind of movie watcher who pays attention to the value of production, stimulating dialogue, acting and directing brilliant. However, I argue that this movie sucks. I don't know why I don't like it ... I mean he has almost everything I want from a horror movie: blood, outrageousness, involuntary humor, etc. According to these tests it should be my favorite. Again, Zombi 3 is a Baaad movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many things that make you scream on the screen. Like when the girl leaves the military when their car breaks down to find water (this doesn't ruin anything, so don't worry). Enter what I see as an abandoned hotel or something. Didn't you see that there was a fucking lake in the middle of the building ??? Yes, he is looking for water and passes over a lake. Why? Because she wants to know why people (who are not there because the place is abandoned) will not answer when she exclaims, "Is there someone?" Oh, this is just a small, insignificant piece of the big picture I'm painting. <br /> <br /> There is a reason, though, because I gave this movie more than 1 star. It is one of those films in which, if you forget how bad it really is, as if you had some times, you would like to watch it again because it is so exaggerated in every aspect. I called it blood in the first paragraph, but this film has no blood, it has an ocean of blood. Furthermore, there are also strange creatures: a zombie child (with an adult size hand ???) and a magically flying head to name just two. <br /> <br /> Do you know when you try thinking about the worst and bloodiest movies ever made and inventing science fiction movies from the 50s? I think Zombi 3 and movies like this should be on top. It has all the elements: scientists discussing with the government, apocalypse warnings on the radio, armies fighting monsters and so on. This is the 9th floor of the 80s! While I'm not going to say this is a waste of money if you want to buy it, just wait for the worst. And when you find out that expecting the worst is underestimating Zombi 3, it won't be so bad. You might really like it, I'm not saying it's impossible. <br /> <br /> Don't think that I hate this movie, not ... really. Oh, P.S. Killing Birds (aka Zombie 5) rules! (Did I just blow my credibility?)
