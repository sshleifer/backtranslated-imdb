"American Nightmare" is officially linked, in my opinion, to "It's Pat!" for the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Seven friends (strangely resembling the K-Mart version of the "Friends" cast) gather in a coffee shop to listen to American Nightmare, a pirate radio program. It is hosted by a guy with a beard. This is the most exciting aspect of his show. <br /> <br /> Chandler, Monica, Joey, and ... oh, wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie, and the rest of the bad one-liner that spits gangs all take turns revealing their biggest fears DJ bearded. Unbeknownst to them, a crazed nurse / serial killer is listening ... <br /> <br /> Crazy Nurse then proceeds to torture Ross and Rachel and ... wait, sorry again ... making sure that their fears come to life. These fears include stunners like "voodoo" and are handed down by old ladies with dentures. <br /> <br /> No. Really. <br /> <br /> This film was, in a word, rotten. Crazy Nurse's murderous madness lacks motivation, there is nothing that can make the observer "jump", the final blows and - again - voodoo? <br /> <br /> If you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones, rent "American Nightmare" with them. <br /> <br /> If you worry about your loved ones - even a little - go to your local Blockbuster, rent all copies of "American Nightmare" and hide them in your freezer.
