This film was the longest film and the record-breaking film certainly had 30 actors. After JAANI DUSHMAN (2002) I believe that nobody had the courage to do something like this <br /> <br /> The film as the title suggests is based on the war of Kargil but the problem is that there are too many characters and romantic subplots and the songs of many characters are boring <br /> <br /> Even if there are too many cinematographic freedoms like killing people with knives, I ask which soldier does that? <br /> <br /> The direction of JP Dutta pales in front of BORDER Music goes well <br /> <br /> Among the huge cast Ajay Devgan is tall, Saif is very good of him and he is also the his first film with Kareena, Abhishek is sympathetic Manoj Bajpai has his moments Sanju is wasted, Suneil is in place Akshaye Khanna does his part rest is acceptable Rani is good, Esha is good rest are passable
