I would give this film 5 instead of 3 if it was at least on time ... When I first saw it it was just what you could expect from the work that is based not on the artistic skills of the directors but on the idealist or I prefer to say idiotic habits our government (from Kazakhstan) ... It is a pity, because "Qazaqfil'm" made good films when it was not honored by the name of Shaken Aimanov, but it was actually run by him. Films like 'Konec Atamana', 'Kyz Zhibek' or even 'Aldar Kose'. But after the death of Mr. Aimanov, the production of quality films went down dramatically in 10 years, when very few films were produced. However, towards the end of the 1980s, "Assa" was shot, it was a film about the first organized crime groups in the big country, a year later Mr. Rashid Nugmanov made another film with the actor's co-star. / singer V. Tsoy, at that time he was already a legend of Russian / Soviet rock, - the film entitled "Igla" (The Needle or something of the sort) was completely new, someone called that period as a resurrection or a new wave of films Kazakh. Unfortunately nowadays we don't have a quality film, our filmmakers make films on French and Japanese financial support, so the films are not for the public but for professional critics, some of them get a price at international festivals very few auteur films have become a corporate product ... And again our "nomads". Such films usually unpopular due to vast aspects. The same effect was with Sibirski Cyrilnik of Nikita Mikhalkov on the Russian tsars, who was also shot on equal terms with foreign partners, I think they were French or maybe English. Nobdy liked it, even in the Russian public it became a main topic of comedians and comedies like "KVN". In my opinion
