And that's the only reason I own this DVD. Now I haven't seen the first Nemesis movie, but I checked the information and said: What? Why? Because in the first movie Alex was male. But then again the first one was set in the future, so maybe this Alex is brand new and the scientist just happened to make Alex female this time. Who knows, at least it was not addressed in the film in any way. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief summary of the plot: Alex, still a child then (or how come you want, as he was, is, in the future) flees with his mother using a special-time boat and ends up in 80s in Africa. There the mother is killed and Alex (Sue Price) grows up in an African tribe. Then the tribe is massacred by a cyborg from the future and Alex runs and hides and eventually kills the cyborg. So there. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? <br /> <br /> The Terminator is not the only film that gets ripped out here, even Predator gets its fair share and I think that Fly's first film, Vincent Price, becomes a special nomination to give a solid foundation for build your cyborg head from. <br /> <br /> Let's see, what else? Okay, the film was a fairly small budget film, but it had negative special effects for a mid-90s movie. It would have seemed ok for an 80s movie like never before. The biggest problem is the plot. Things happen and the viewer is barely interested. Nemesis 2 is not the most disgusting piece of cinema I've had pleasure (?) To look at, but it's damn close. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about acting, because we are honest here: did anyone expect performance worthy of an Oscar here? Oh well ... at least I found Sue Price so hot Amazonian warrior. <br /> <br /> A "real" film: 2/10 There are not many quality professionals. And despite the very simple plot, the film doesn't make much sense. <br /> <br /> Evaluation of the film on the field: 4/10 I had occasional laughter from the bad wickedness of the film, so it has small merits in it.
