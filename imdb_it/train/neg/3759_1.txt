Oh where to start. Cinematography was great. When the film first started because of the initial landscape scenes, I thought about making a good movie. Then the Bigfoot CGI appeared. It looked like a cartoon drawing of King Lion and King Kong's love son. It has completely taken away the credibility of the character. Now I knew that there wasn't a Bigfoot chasing people who wandered in the woods for no apparent reason other than a cardboard cgi of cheese. From then on the whole film was shot for me. The money they threw in the toilet for the CG that they could spend on a costume like the Patterson toad. His was Bigfoot's best costume that no one else could match. I'm a fan of the Bigfoot movie and I was warned about this movie, but my obsession led me to watch this movie and I was disappointed as the previous reviews had warned me. I know that after reading this review you will continue to say "I have to watch the Sasquatch hunters, I have to watch the Sasquatch hunters." Then you will say why I wasted my hard earned money on a film so terribly boring and boring!
