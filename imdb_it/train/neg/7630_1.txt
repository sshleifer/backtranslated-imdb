A boring film about a boring city in the 1950s. How can you think this is a classic? The producer practically finished his career pushing his girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, in several films that were far above his acting ability. I think this film gives an idea of ​​how negative Peter Bogdonovitch's future films would have been. Cybil Shepard's career took a dip after being in several films produced by Peter Bogdonovich. It wasn't until "Moonlighting" that his career began to return. I thought that acting was a poor interpretation of the "Graduate". I noticed that this film was not shown in the United States. The only place I saw it was overseas in Europe late at night.
