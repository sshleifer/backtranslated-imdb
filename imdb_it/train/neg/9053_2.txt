I simply found the TV show "Mash" trivial, a preacher, never so "politically correct", repetitive, pretentious and the greatest sin of all, namely,? which is (was) incredibly boring. You have Alan Alda as the main protagonist, "(star)", who is so in love with himself and his intelligence, that he actually made me feel uncomfortable trying to sit in an episode. The original series had both McLean Stevson, and Wayne Rogers, who I will happily admit with a certain panache and style in the presentation of their characters. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan and Mike Farrell, both singly and compositionally together, is like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. Loretta Swit, who I also found boring, even because of her fault was not a wonder to watch, and Gary Burghoff, who was good at the film, got tired of watching and acting while the show went on. He showed me a show every year. Jamie Farr was just a low-level "comedy" and it's not even worth mentioning here. The reason I didn't give him an evaluation (one), that anyone reading now is wondering, is that evaluations of any kind are not just a subjective call, but a relative one. Television, with relatively few exceptions, is so raw. That relatively speaking, Mash had a quality of production, (by television standards) of that era and today, and therefore a two is deserved.
