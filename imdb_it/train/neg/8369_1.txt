Since this image is classified as "pure fun" and since there are already many comments on this topic, with this reference I would like to refer to something pertinent to the abuse of humor. We can see that Marlon Wayans plays the role of the prankster in this film. Certainly, as long as he was involved in casting, he always acted as a little man - an actor can change his usual suit but can hardly change his physical appearance - and the latter can be an advantage when needed. Although far from what I expected, I saw a very disguised image, pretending to expose different aspects of the child's life by mistake by a forty-year-old criminal. And with a ridiculous happy ending. So what's the point? Many elements are confused, some of the main ones are violence, sex and criminal activities, among which the story is badly composed and partly devoid of common sense: where is Vanessa when the peace of her house is violated and life of the husband is persecuted? Moreover, the diamond is even bigger than the number one Cullinan in the world! But the most disgusting side is the continuous attempt to invent the little man as a superman showing his physical weaknesses. And they call it humor. A diamond is precious, hard and fragile; it cannot be cut from any other material but can only be conquered by the warm blood of a male goat. So it is no longer a diamond but pieces of debris.
