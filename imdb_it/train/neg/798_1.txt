OK, the movie is good, but I gave it a 1 because the idea of ​​a computer virus that becomes an organic virus is pure fairy tale. This kind of crap does nothing but add to those paranoid delusions of the idiot non-computer idiot that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus. First of all, code strings and dozens of 1 and 0 are added to the computer virus. An organic virus is much more complex, even if it is much smaller. Although it is considered one of the simplest forms of the universe, the organic virus attacks the dens in the cells and attaches itself to the RNA, so it changes your RNA code. Tell me how something like this could be processed by a monitor? Does radiation have any effect on the cornea of ​​the user who turns your eyeballs into these viruses? I saw it, but obviously the writer didn't think about it.
