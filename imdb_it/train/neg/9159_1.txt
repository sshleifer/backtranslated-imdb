If an author grants 2 credits before the main title and about another 15 credits before the film starts, and the first shot shows the author rolling on a bed in lycra bike shorts, it will not be a surprise to observe that he has said he has the kind of body that should never be seen in spandex. The kind of look that could be useful to a homosexual aversion therapist. <br /> <br /> Others have given this thing the credit it deserves. For me the most painful moment came when the trip from Los Angeles was marked by an airplane that landed in what appeared to be LAX; and the return was marked by a shot of a Fedex cargo plane.
