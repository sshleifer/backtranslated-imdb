Wow! I remember so many horrible movies that revolved freely around the school from the early 1980s. They usually had a fatigued storyline and many 27-year-old actors who pretended to be students. While watching this movie I felt a bit of nostalgia for growing up in the 80s. However, then I discover that this film was made in 1989? What! Well, the nostalgia factor ends right there, this is just ugly. The plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatens to send all the students to the city's high schools. Which is strange, since the students at this school are rich and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in a villa. You wonder how they can't find the money to keep this school alive, they've never heard of property taxes. Oh, but here's the kicker. The school board says they will keep the school alive if the students can raise $ 200,000. So the seniors do this. Hmmm, you earn $ 200,000 but instead of saving for college, you put it to save the high school you're a senior? And why exactly will they close an overpopulated school before the year comes out? And ... oh forget, this movie was stupid and made in 1989!?
