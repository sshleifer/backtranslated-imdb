I agree with the reviews I've read here, and I have no words to define a turkey like this, but in spite of everything, I can still find a reason why there are films like this. Do you remember those happy days when the video was a prosperous business and many films were made with the only reason to fill the shelves of video stores? this film comes from that period and I can imagine that it was the only reason why it was produced and the same happened with many, many, many other skunks. Do you remember the imitations of "Rambo"? and so many woodcutters of the grade Z?, I still feel nostalgic for that period. Regarding this film, I can say that I didn't waste time looking at it because I pressed the fast forward button after the first fifteen minutes, only to find a funny scene in which a guy pushed an ax against the exploding heads because you can see perfectly, they were made of plastic. And in the end, well, it was shot so bad that I couldn't figure out what happened. It's the same, I hadn't followed the non-existent plot. But boy, Video-age was a fantastic age despite movies like this.
