a boring word. <br /> <br /> the young demi looks good, but is pregnant (- point for that = D) the film is not scary at all ... <br /> <br /> the first scenes looked a bit crappy , I could make the clouds better with my laptop and after the effects. but that was then ... and now it's time. some movies don't age well ... this is one of them. <br /> <br /> it is not worth renting or buying ... having something better, like the exorcist, ... <br /> <br /> next = D <br /> <br /> oh the drama part just beginning and simply suxor = D
