I've seen 3 episodes of Caveman and I have no idea why I continue, except maybe wait for it to get better. <br /> <br /> For me this show is just pumping out of commercials, without real humor. While we sat and watched these shows, we all thought about what would happen. <br /> <br /> The episode of the woman-cave with an attitude was actually a big, yes, right for us. she is rough in a theater and acts harshly with strangers, and, to be honest, she needed a slap <br /> <br /> I consider myself a good reviewer, taking everything, but I have to say that Cavemen is comparable to the old show, my mother, the car. I give them a 2, just because they deserve 1 better than a 1 because they actually spent money.
