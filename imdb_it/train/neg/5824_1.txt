I thought it would be at least aesthetically beautiful. It was slow, pretentious and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are some decent songs, but there's this song at the end that's just a guy yelling "Yaowwww!" while someone randomly touches a wooden object. That said, there are some good songs, but it's not worth watching the movie. Go to itunes (they have the album), preview it and choose the good ones. <br /> <br /> Half of the film is a guy who makes tea. Well, this is a slight exaggeration. But you'll see what I mean if you see it. That said: DON'T SEE IT!
