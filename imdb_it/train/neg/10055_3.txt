I grew up in the stage version of "Superman II" ("S2T") and as a child, I loved it more than Part I since it not only contained more Superman and three Superman-type villains, did it start with a bang? ? the best transformations of Clark Kent to Superman and rescue scenes. The children no longer had to wait impatiently for Superman to appear on the screen, as in the first part. Now as an adult, I can see how the mighty fell with S2T (See: my review). I've always heard of the retro-story on how the director of the original, Richard Donner of Part II, prematurely and unjustifiably fired. (It must have been a rarity then to film two separate films simultaneously, now it is common: "Back to the future" and "Matrix" 2 and 3 for example.) Unfortunately, after finally seeing the Richard Donner Cut (or, "S2RD" ) I still can't fully recommend it. Gone, it was Superman's big scene of change, the whole Paris rescue, as was the wonderful summary of Part I in the opening S2T. In fact, everyone wrote the words: "Previously on Superman ??" in S2RD. The special effects weren't great in either part I or S2T, but in the S2RD, they were mostly definitely ridiculous ?? like Lois falling from the window of the Daily Planet. I have to admit that some new scenes worked and some that brought out were welcome departures, like any scene in the "honeymoon suite". Overall, if you grew up with S2T like I did, and loved it as a kid ?? don't be fussy as an adult, you should definitely see S2RD as it's almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler alarm) Unfortunately, the worst change comes last: the strange kiss of S2T's amnesia has also been replaced with the exact same ending as "I." This is not just a lazy and non-original script, it makes no sense as to why Clark would have returned to that restaurant, if those events had never really happened. And will it continue to "go back in time" to any comparison?
