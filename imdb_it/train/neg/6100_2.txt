Effort apart (This is not a good intentions review, it's about the final product), this film is poorly written, overly direct and poorly directed. The story obviously had potential, but that story is not present in this film. <br /> <br /> Clara Barton was a human being. He had passions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness and insecurity just like the rest of us. You would never know from this movie about the performance of the lead actress. In fact it applies to all the characters in the film, but in the case of Barton: every sentence is a speech. An epic on the subject of speech as from an inhuman robot. In fact, the only scene that takes place well in a board meeting, and I understand it's because it's making a speech! Every idea she has is incredible in her context and ideas come to mind that seem to take a life of soul searching directly on the spot. For example, when he sees a wounded man, he will begin to pontificate about the needs of the battlefield and to protect the soldiers and put up white flags, etc. As has been interpreted in the film, there is no WAY that you can come up with such a detailed description of a well thought out idea in a few seconds. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film steals Clara Barton from her difficulties. He robs her of her humanity, and in fact reduces to an enormous extent everything she did because the script is written in clich√©s. The writer does not know Clara Barton, and seems to have based his script on an article in the Britannica encyclopedia. (yes, they had those back then) But hey, nice Technicolor! (who cares)
