I couldn't wait to see this movie. About halfway through the film, I couldn't wait for it to end. All the (white) actors were expressing their lines as Woody Allen had just said, "Say it like that ..." Then they said their lines on the screen as if they were trying to imitate Woody Allen. It was so annoying. We all know how Will Ferrell really talks, and he doesn't trip over his words like Mr. Allen. The comic part of this film was as boring as the tragedy and certainly never fun or even fun. I have to admit I was never a big fan of Woody Allen, and surely this movie didn't convert me. I think his writing was just as bad as his direction. This film will become one of the worst 10 movies I've ever seen.
