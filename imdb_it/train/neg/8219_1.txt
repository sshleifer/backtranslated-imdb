I'm the kind of person who always goes 2 to the horror section when I'm selecting a film, so I chose five through my eyes, I was disgusted with this movie and I thought there was no plot and that you couldn't like it, made me creep skin to think that people liked watching movies that encourage violence, for the devil it was a low and very lousy budget! I think I could do better myself. I think it was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life and you shouldn't worry about watching it while the actors were lousy, the camera was terrible, the image was ugly and the sound wasn't up to it, I think it was a bit It was a bit like a tear from the baler that projects and has not worked at all.
