What a lousy piece of trash !!! Who are all these people complaining about how good it is? Yes, it is "arty"; and yes, it is "foreign", but .... it is not enough. The plot is boring and messy, like a reality show, but it's not made in such a sweet way. <br /> <br /> People are inherently uninteresting; but as characters they don't have enough depth to feel empathy for them. If they are based on real people, I feel very, very sorry for them. <br /> <br /> Violence (and in part violent) seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous. It is as if the producer had the vision of being Quenton Tarantino. Not that I think of him too much. <br /> <br /> And oh yes: if I had neighbors like these, I will move!
