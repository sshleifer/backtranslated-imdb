I was interested in seeing this film because I knew it was based on Christians. The director had good intentions / intentions in making this film, but it could have been better. I can understand why someone would still have feelings for those who believe it is the greatest love of their lives. However, I didn't understand why the director made his friends so insensitive, bad and rude. The main character continued to apologize to his friends when they were the bad ones with him. They didn't understand at all and used God as a reason to explain their behavior. Neither the main character nor anyone else knew if the ex-girlfriend was divorced, still married, etc. But they were opposed to solving old feelings that needed to be addressed. His friends should have been Christians and should have been interpreted as favorable whether they agreed with his decision or not. So many times we do things in life when we don't apologize to those we have hurt in the past and when he was trying to do it they were all against him. The ironic part was that his new friend accused him of having a stalking behavior simply by looking at an old friend, when he did a really strange thing to get his name, address and phone number ... he seemed to be the stalker! . she didn't look like a friend at all, but just looked after herself. God is love ... and I think God wants people to be with the person they were destined for and I feel that the film has committed a terrible injustice making it seem like God doesn't care about true love ... just you're with someone you made a bad choice with. We all make mistakes ... it's all about what steps are taken to make amends. As I said, the film had potential, but I was tired of the fact that the unilateral point of view was constantly repeated and stuck in the throats of the spectators by its so-called ... well-meaning friends. This film was not faithful to the Christian faith of love, but I give it a C for its effort.
