The Hazing is a confused mumbo jumbo that wants to be The Evil Dead so much that it even refers to Bruce Campbell several times. The problem is that it's simply not in the same league as that fantastic movie. This film is not at all original. The plot was used in the past by Kevin Tenney in Night of the Demons, and it was a lot more fun. This film loses too much time with a complicated exposition before bringing the children into the spooky mansion and starting demonic events. <br /> <br /> Brad Dourif, as usual, doesn't have much to do here, but when he's on screen he puts on another over-the-top performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous. As for the acting of children, it is passable but not at all good. The flickering camera work is more annoying than smart or atmospheric. There are some beautiful moments when the first boy is possessed and throws around a deadly fuse while sending his victims, but it has never been scary for a second. The level of gore is medium to low, but the director tries to make up for it by showing topless actresses a few times. All in all, okay, if you have 87 minutes to lose.
