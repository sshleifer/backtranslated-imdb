This film is another on my list of films not to disturb. I saw him 40 years ago as a teenager, staying up late to do so, he was very annoyed to see that it was a 95% love story, 4% of all the rest, 1% of history in that case. It's what I call a lure and I change film, one with an interesting title, the real movie is a scam. This is a topic that deserves a good cinematographic treatment, this film is almost an insult to those who have served. The actual members of Lafayette Escadrille were neither fleeing the law nor the product of abusive homes, they were actually idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect that many of them came from a background of a higher class than the character of Tab Hunter. The flight school is not for intelligent brains and knowing everything, an individual like that portrayed here would not have lasted two days, it would have been the palisade or the infantry. The discipline in the French army was often quite fierce. In short, another Hollywierd version of a historical episode that deserves proper treatment.
