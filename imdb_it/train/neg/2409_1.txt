It was a painful experience, the whole story is really there, so I won't go there, but the acting was horrible. There is this part in the beginning when the scientist brother goes to work, he really wears a white coat at home before leaving work, I thought that working with biohazardous material meant wearing sterilized clothes in a controlled environment and the lab itself seems a school laboratory, there is this monitor on top of an archive that has nothing to do with the whole scene, right there to make the place a technical aspect and a scientist is having breakfast in the laboratory and next to him there is is a jar labeled as a biohazard and his boss comes into contact with him and does not even tell him anything ... not to mention the bad acting very bad can not have anything worse than what my advice does not look and I thought that nothing could be worse than the house of the dead apparently Uwi Boll's films look like Shakespeare classics compared to this one!
