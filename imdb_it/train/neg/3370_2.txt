Just an old stupid movie. Stanwyck's first child gets his foot trapped in a really stupid way, and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really stupid way. In an attempt to save him, Stanwyck becomes unlucky once again and runs into a convict on the run. You have the chance to kill him but he fails in a very stupid way. Eventually her husband is saved and Stanwyck tells us through the narration what the film's stupid message is. It has never been so easy to understand how an unattractive woman like Stanwyck ever portrayed her as one of the protagonists of Golden Era's glamor-oriented golden era; is that nose so beautiful ?? So photogenic ?? The film is mercifully short, lasting just over an hour. It's as if the director had guessed that he was sucking, so he thought it best not to make it.
