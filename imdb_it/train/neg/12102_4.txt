This film is really ONLY the interpretation of the religion of Bill Maher. There are several funny moments and some interesting points, but don't get into this discussion waiting for a discussion on religion fairly. This is what I consider the worst kind of documentary - Everything is organized in advance and being edited to give you the opinion of the director, rather than letting you make your decision. <br /> <br /> EDITING - It is very fragmented, intertwined with pop and media culture clips to reinforce the point. The interviewee barely has the chance to finish a sentence before it is interrupted by editing. The only people who have a good chance to have their say are those who say what Bill Maher wants them to say. Once someone departs from the gospel according to Maher, it is changed. <br /> <br /> INTERVIEWEES - They are meant to represent the most absolute MOST religions. From evangelical TV to the definitive Jewish stereotype, to the TRUCK STOP chapel (Scherzi a parte). He chose the worst money bettors, the heavy extremists and those who do not have the budget to say no to choose. And when he manages to get interviewed by a good person, he brings out hell. <br /> <br /> STEREOTYPING - All religions are portrayed as stereotypes. Muslims in particular are particularly affected. During the Muslim segment, he barely gives anyone the chance to speak before interrupting them or himself by cutting them up with the kamikazes. ALL Muslims are portrayed as armed extremists through assembly, and none of the people interviewed are published fairly. <br /> <br /> ENDING - The message in the end is AMAZING in a heavy hand, and while it is an interesting idea, it is not presented fairly to the countless people who are not religious extremists. Bill Maher explains himself as the destruction clips play in the foreground. This literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous and that it will destroy the world. He also states that anyone involved in religion is stupid. <br /> <br /> With the flaws of the film, it has some positive points, and the humor, though very unfair, is actually fun. But knowing to enter is a unilateral view, the point of view of Bill Maher, of religion. He's not discovering anything. He's telling you what he thinks. <br /> <br /> 4/10 - Some nice moments, but heavy with an extremely irresponsible documentary style.
