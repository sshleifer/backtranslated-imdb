Imagine The Big Chill with a twenty-year-old cast whose characters are all unlikely, and a man-like lizard like an iguana chasing them and you have an idea of ​​the madness here. On the positive side, the film does not skimp on showing the monster. There are no peek shots, or night scenes where you have to imagine what it looks like; he is right out there people. Unfortunately, the design and construction are not so inspired. A little mystery may have helped. Mind you, I've seen far worse, but if you're going to see it in full show for a lot of movies, your monster will be more damn good looking. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Ahead !!! <br /> <br /> Oh, and there's an ending that involves the alleged dead brother that makes absolutely no sense. This was not a surprise given the poor transcription of the script. As for acting; well let's say it wasn't painful bad, but I don't expect that we'll see many of these children in upcoming movie releases. <br /> <br /> Gore Quotient: 2 out of 5; Nudity quotient: 1 out of 5; Intelligence quotient: negligible
