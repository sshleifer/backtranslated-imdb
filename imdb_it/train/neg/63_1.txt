Holy sucks. This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. All the performances are fine, but there is no plot. Really! No plot! A group of clowns talks about this and that and this is your movie. Ug ... The character of Robert Duvall is senile and he always asks the same people the same questions. This always earns him the same answers. I'm pretty sure this movie has come up to six because people think they should like it. Good performances with famous and well-regarded actors, but the real complete job is a steamy asshole. Well, maybe this is a bit deceptive since the steam rising from a new pile sounds like something happening and in this movie NOTHING HAPPENS! Sacco
