Ben & Arthur MAY be a 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, watched and produced this film. Sam should have given his idea to a good writer, director, and leave the acting to someone who could act. this is a good example of a person who controls the entire production. there was no one to tell him "Sam this is bad, very bad". <br /> <br /> Jamie Brett Gabel's acting was the only good thing, but could have been much better with a good director, and better actors to work with. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and show this movie (twice). acting and directing were so bad, this film became a comedy. You just had to laugh, and in the wrong places. <br /> <br /> A second good point .... this would be a great dating movie. after the first two minutes you would stop watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!
