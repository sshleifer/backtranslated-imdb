I don't often watch such a terrible film like this. I kept looking, every minute hoping that this was meant as a joke only to find that it had to be taken seriously. Well, seriously how does this kind require. <br /> <br /> The acting was shameful and the situations horribly invented and clich√©s. If a film had been made in 1920 (for example) and had the quality of Hide & Seek (Cord) in his direction, we would think that the cinema in those days was naive. As it happened, this film was made in 2000 and I have yet to see a film from the era of silence that has the same charm as this. <br /> <br /> Definitely not for the serious viewer. <Br /> <br /> [Not worth an evaluation]
