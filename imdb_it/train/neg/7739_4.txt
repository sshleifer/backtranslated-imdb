Remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest Hollywood star because he made great films? Those days feel like an increasingly distant memory. <br /> <br /> While "Hollywood Homicide" is not terrible at all, it is a routine and surprisingly boring crime film. It's a comedy that isn't particularly fun and an action film that isn't particularly exciting. An overabundance of subplots cannot mask the weaker weft of the central plot. <br /> <br /> Ford seems to enjoy at least more of its latest projects, and is able to bring the film most of the time. Hartnett is adequate, but he and Ford are not exactly Newman or Redford in chemistry. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Hollywood Homicide" is a reasonably fun diversion, but barely. Bring out Ford, and it's not that either.
