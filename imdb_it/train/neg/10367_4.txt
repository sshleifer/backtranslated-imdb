This film was poorly written, badly performed and very predictable. It was a very low budget and I can understand why it was never released and went directly to the video. It wasn't even fun on campers, it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could go back 1-1 / 2 hours! The colors were horrible along with the plot that has holes so big that you can drive a mac truck through them. <br /> <br /> The plot has meant that the young bride did things that she was absolutely unable to do physically: what a nice trait! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre. Almost all the films come to mind that it is better than this. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
