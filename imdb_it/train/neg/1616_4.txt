STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> This second installment of the movies Moving the story forward until late 1960s, where man has now moved his resistance fighters into the hills of South America, surviving without food and water and with increasing tensions between the group. Everything comes to mind when it crosses the border with Bolivia and government forces increase their campaign to bring it down. <br /> <br /> Without the flit between time and places of the last film, the second episode of Soderbergh focuses exclusively on action in the hills, and manages to be an even more boring experience. And more pretentiously, the soundtrack has been smothered, giving the second episode an air of undesirable art that proves to be equally alienating. There is only an unshakable air of boredom for the film that never gives up. You cannot criticize Soderbergh's ambition or Del Toro's leadership in the lead role, it's just a pity that somewhere in production things have managed to make a disappointing turn. **
