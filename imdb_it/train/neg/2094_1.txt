I had to endure teenage angst, high school, and family conflict for most of the show. I don't care much about high school girls who care about their relationships. I spent my time in hell dealing with these problems and I'm not interested in invented teenagers who go through "light" versions of the horrors I endured. I want science fiction. This is the only reason I am here. There were a few seconds of science fiction late on the show. FINALLY we see a proto-Cylon. It was good but with a problem. His red eye-point would be fixed on an object of interest. We all know that Cylon eyedots always scan back and forth, giving the machine a map of the world. The red dot never stops moving back and forth. I really hope the authors correct this abuse before the second episode.
