In the 70s, when I first saw him, I was in high school. It was good then. Now as an adult I look back and tell myself ... yes, yes. What was so funny? It has its moments but they are few and far between. It is so dated that the lines no longer rise. Show this to a younger audience and they will be totally lost. If you like this kind of humor you may want to attack Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon Women From The Moon. Tunnel Vision and Groove tube are too old for today's vision.
