The film is basically a boring series of terrifying clich√©s that don't offer true intercultural insight. The Middle Eastern leg of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way: obviously there are mud brick villages, dirt tracks in the middle of the desert, women dressed in black clothes and belly dancers. I wonder how camels and date palms were missing from the whole image. The personality of the two main characters is very schematically sketched and many situations are hardly credible. <br /> <br /> The original idea may have been interesting, but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural information, you should skip this movie.
