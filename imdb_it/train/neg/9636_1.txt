This amazing waste of production money is the cinematic proof that the rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful as politicians. From a (silly) Tennessee Williams comedy and directed (with a dead hand) by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor, Burton and Noel Coward - this project shot in a spectacular villa on a cliff top in the Mediterranean must have seemed like a a sure-fire winner when presented at Universal in 1967. The result is so absurd and boring that it almost defies belief. Visually the film is spectacular but this is the force of nature that allowed the setting and the fact that a real house is used instead of a set. The shrill antics of a shrill Taylor, the semi-sleeping wanderings of Burton, the crazy dialogue, Noel Coward who laughed at himself, the ridiculous story and the plots of the plot and the absurd costume simply irritate the spectator. BOOM is a disgrace, a waste of money and talent and a clear demonstration of the fact that famous people praised can be idiots like the rest of the populace of the planet. Not even fun. Just a shocking and terrible waste.
