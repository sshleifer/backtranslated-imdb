My God. This movie was terrible. I can't complain too much. I went to see him only to be disgusted. It was enough, a little. It's funny that the most disgusting part of the film is right at the beginning, in which the woman is extremely vividly forced to give birth to a horribly mutilated child. I also think it's funny that he is the most prominent actor in the film was the Hispanic soldier, who was a supporting actor next Friday. Everyone in the film did a horrible acting job. It was one of the worst acting I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I also expected that it would be much more creepy than the first. It wasn't. I expected it to be more creepy because it's a sequel and sequel to horror movies usually have less success than their predecessors. I expected it to be more creepy since gore and violence usually sell a horror movie these days (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, Dead Silence), but in reality it wasn't as creepy as the first one, which was yet another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The mutants of the first were quite disturbing, but the filmmakers were trying so hard to make them disturbing that they were absolutely funny. I also hated the whole concept of showing the clip of the female soldier's son on his camera phone that says "I love you, Mom" ​​FOUR TIMES. It was stupid to show it in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers, and it was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel SIN for her by showing Again three times without reason. This film was a joke.
