Whack !!! I took this movie because there was Elizabeth Hartman. I was disappointed to discover that it was in two short scenes towards the end. Apart from that, I was practically hitting the fast forward button all the time. A teenager goes on a trip to Romania with his father and is bitten by a wolf and becomes a werewolf if there is a full moon. He kills his father and his friends. About 30 years ago, but does not age a little and enrolls in a high school. There he meets a shy teacher who ends up biting and then has children with her. This movie sucked and I don't recommend it to anyone. Read instead War and Peace. Only Mrs. Hartman did a great job. Check out a very young Bob Saget in this !!
