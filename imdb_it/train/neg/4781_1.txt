This could be the poorest example of amateur propaganda ever made. Writers and producers should study German films from the thirties and forties. They knew how to sell. Even the clumsy Soviet-style head as a paternal figure of god was better done. Disappointing. The loss of faith, regained in church at the last second just in time for Dad to be "saved" from Hoover / God was not so bad. Unfortunately, he seemed fast enough and not quite melodramatic. Some misty and mysterious images of the Hamover Hoover in the corner of the screen - which illuminates and nods - would have added a lot. The best aspect is Hoover, which saves only the family and deserving children who have "demonstrated" their value. Unfortunately, other poor homeless people have been portrayed as likeable and even good - yet the Hoover - God does not help them. A better approach would have been to let them drink alcohol to show the justice of their condition. In the end, bright and cheerful shooting scenes (after Hoover had saved the country from depression) should have rolled to an end. We then saw how Hoover-God had saved not only this worthy family, but all the true worthy ones. Amateurist at its best.
