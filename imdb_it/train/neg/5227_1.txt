........ and extremely ugly !!! How long did this train-wreck last? 14 episodes or something ?? Now I understand why. <br /> <br /> I bought the Amazon Unboxed "Serenity" episode. It was my first purchase, so it was free. This is the ONLY positive thing of the experience (incident ??) <br /> <br /> I won't really comment on acting, since these were, I think, fairly new people who hadn't really got the job right just yet . At least I have never seen them before in any kind of big show, theater or TV. If I did, then I would have easily forgotten them. <br /> <br /> But the special effects were absolutely horrendous. True, this is not exactly a multi-million dollar project, but the original Star Trek did better than that and it was THIRTY YEARS ago. Above all I took a laugh from the bad guys (reapers or something) while chasing the exhilarating Firefly, with the smoke coming out of the engines that looked like a giant model rocket. I expected to finally see the Wiley Coyote at the top, while chasing the Roadrunner. MODERN jet / rocket engines are not so bad either. <br /> <br /> And it wasn't even the worst. The wild-west type shoot-outs asked me if I was watching a science fiction movie or one by Gene Autry. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the hype, do not waste time ... did ... all 80 minutes of the disaster called "Firefly".
