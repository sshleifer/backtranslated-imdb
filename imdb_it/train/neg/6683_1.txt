I'm glad that the people at IMDb were able to decipher the genre of this movie. I suspected he was trying to be a comedy, but since he also seems to want to be a dark and solemn melodrama, I wasn't sure. For a comedy it is surprisingly devoid even of the smallest venturing into the realms of humor - up to the ridiculous final "twist", which confirms how completely the whole film is useless. It is difficult to describe how truly THE amateur HAIR is. Has anyone involved in this film had an idea of ​​what they should have done? In reality it is worth looking at so that you can stare at the screen with incredulous disbelief no matter how terrible.
