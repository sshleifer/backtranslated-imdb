I liked it but then I think I could have ironed at the same time. This reworking by Cyrano de Bergerac / Roxanne is a formidable and unpretentious novel, saved by the straight-to-video ignominy coming out of Janeane Garofalo's strong turn. Playing the Frasier of Pets, she finds herself trapped in a love trap when the insecurity leads her to pass her best friend (Uma Thurman) as herself when a call comes by surprise. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting film in the fascinating career of Ben Chaplin. An average British actor, he gave the Hollywood treadmill a shot with this movie. It is irrelevant and his anonymity in studio productions is not surprising on the basis of it, although he has appeared in substantial cameos in both of Terence Malick's later films. Uma Thurman makes a turntable with the autopilot and Michael Lehmann encloses everything competently. But sex by phone is exciting. 4/10
