There is this girl and she runs into the woods but ends up in this woman's clinic and wants to have an abortion. His father is out in a van and he's all angry about it. The whole episode takes place inside and outside this abortion clinic. I'm not really a choice, but I wanted the choice to kill this episode. I was laughing when I saw the baby go out and went to the corner. Even the part where they were doing the ultra sound was pretty funny. I felt really sorry for the poor dad in this episode. He just wanted to protect his daughter and I couldn't really blame him for what he did. I don't know what happened to him in the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room. I was just laughing too much and would suggest watching "Pick me up" instead of this episode. It wasn't the worst episode, but it wasn't great.
