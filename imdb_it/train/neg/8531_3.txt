In this forgettable nonsense, the 40-year-old Norma Shearer plays a worldly childlike girl in Monte Carlo, in a fight between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame the failure of this film on the boring or talking script, or the director George Cukor, who never seems interested in reviving the generally comatose state of the film. Mostly, though, it's Shearer's own fault, who desperately wanted to continue playing "young" parts as long as she could get away with it. This inadvertently makes "Her Cardboard Lover" a bizarre monument to the vanity of an old woman.
