I sat glued to the screen, nailed, yawning, but keeping a watchful eye. I waited for the next horrible special effect, or the next element of the ridiculously cliched plot to show all the strength, so I could learn how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It seems when they decided to make this film, the crew watched every single good / bad action / science fiction / shoot-em-up / movie ever made, and saw interesting things and said: " Hey, we can do it. " For example, the only car parked less than a mile from what appears to be a one-way street with a shoulder not intended for parking, is the only car the protagonist is subjected to, an attractive brunette born with bile . The car crashes before landing. The special effects were obviously my biggest beef with this movie. But what really put into my bad books was implausibility and lack of motivation for so many elements! For example, the antagonist, a flying demon with the ability to inflict damage in bizarre ways, happens on a lone army truck carrying an important VIP. The nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck, you know they're already dead. Then the guy who protects the VIP says "Under no circumstances leave this truck, do you understand me?" He goes down in search of the beast that killed his 3 friends, is hit almost comically by clich√©s. So, for no apparent reason, challenging the logic, conventions and common sense, the stupid VIP VIP TRACKS FROM THE TRUCK !!! Much of what happened during the film made no sense. Transparent acting has turned me away from the film, as well as bad camera work, and the things that just make you go: "Wow, it's incredibly poor." Shiri Appleby saved the film from 1, because it gave the film the only element that always pleases viewers with the experience, the sex appeal.
