This will be best known for the Ferrari that crashed when Eddie Griffin was doing promotion. <br /> <br /> The story of racing and betting is hurt by the numbers that a director who could not see the numbers seems to have. Mostly a point and shoot deal with a group of actors in it for a salary. This is not a good movie, but it is not so bad as to be watchable and end up like a movie that is not worth worrying about anything about the film, no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> Misogyno, despite the fact that one of the protagonists is a woman, this is a film that was clearly made only to bring the producer and director closer to pretty girls. Do you want proof? There are long shots of women in almost nothing that have no other purpose than to provoke the rise of people too scared to rent a porn movie or the swimsuit illustrated on DVD. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs
