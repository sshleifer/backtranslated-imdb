This show seemed to be pretty good. Kyra Sedgwick is an OK actress and I like the crime series, but somewhere in the production this program has gone terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, the writers should have more suspicions than one, you know who did it EVERY TIME !!!!! This makes it boring. The main character is incredibly annoying and is not credible in any way. I know they wanted her to be tough, but it means bad, stupid and mean boss. The crimes are not interesting and insipid, and they are only lame to the end. As mentioned above, I hate it .... <br /> <br /> All in all, this was a big disappointment and really very bad ...
