I've seen all four movies in this series. Everyone moves further and further away from books. This is the worst yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book that is titled in any way! The directors and producers should have called it differently from "Love's Abiding Joy". The only thing of this film that remotely resembles the book are the names of some characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names / age / gender of children are wrong. The whole plot is not that of the book. <br /> <br /> I find a great disservice for Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a film under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. Actors are not convincing - they lack emotion. <br /> <br /> If you want a good family film, this could happen. It's clean. Don't look at it, though, if you're hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope this is the last film in this series, but I doubt it. If there are more films made, I would like Michael Landon, Jr and others to get closer to the original plot and narrative lines. The books are excellent and, if followed closely, they would make excellent films!
