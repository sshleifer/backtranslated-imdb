Disappointing and predictable film in which a woman (Mc Teer) travels with her daughter from one state to another because she cannot maintain relationships and find happiness. In this genre 'Anywhere but here' with Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman gave a much better view of a mother / daughter relationship. With a better acting as well.
