Disney has yet to meet a movie for which it is not possible to make at least two sequels. And this was no exception to the people of Disney to give a weak story to receive a quick reward. Somehow, even if I didn't pay to see it, I feel devalued by looking at it. <br /> <br /> Ariel grew up now and had a daughter. Yet he does not allow his daughter to go overboard due to some useless threat made by the sister of the dead sea witch. So here we are again. <br /> <br /> The daughter is deceived (obviously) and helps the sea witch. After a not so glorious battle, it is defeated and the sirens and humans live in harmony. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to see here. Go back to your lives. "D-"
