It's a pity when a potentially addictive and pleasantly low-key story manages to capture your interest at first and then gradually lets you go further and further until you're left scratching your confused head the moment it reaches its exaggerated conclusion. Unfortunately, this is what happened to me at the end of WHITE NOISE. <br /> <br /> It was not Michael Keaton's fault; it was a pleasure to see him return as the protagonist of a new film, still a bit wrinkled, but still managing to give a strong and sincere performance. Like a man whose wife has recently died, he becomes obsessed with his wandering spirit in the afterlife (not a new idea), apparently he is contacted by her through that funky electric business that you see on the TV screen when nothing is broadcast. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the spirits that communicate through radio waves is called EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) and there are many people who really believe in it, so I won't comment on what I think about it, or them. Let me say that I'm all for the suspension of disbelief when it comes to buying fantastic movies like this, but what I can't tolerate is not understanding what the hell should have happened, which is where I was left stuck when the credits finally started rolling . Sometimes they are really static. <br /> <br /> Occasionally there are films like this that leave me completely baffled, but if a film fails to make me clear, I tend to consider that it's the director's fault, not mine (unless you watch it while I was too tired to focus or something.) Well, for the WHITE NOISE I was completely awake, with shining eyes and a bushy tail - so guess who is to blame?
