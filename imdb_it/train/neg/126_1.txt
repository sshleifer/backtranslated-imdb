"I Am Curious: Yellow" is a laughable and pretentious smoldering pile. No matter what one's political opinions are, this film cannot be taken seriously at any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, this is not true. I have seen films with R classification with male nudity. Sure, they only offer some fleeting visions, but where are the R-rated movies with deep vulves and flapping lips? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those poor cable shows: schlongs that swing in the breeze, but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie films like The Brown Bunny, in which we are treated to the site of the throbbing johnson of Vincent Gallo, but not a trace of rose visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or insinuating) "double standard" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account an inevitably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear naked, and the same does not can say for a man. In reality, you generally won't see female genitals in an American movie in something that isn't pornographic or explicit erotic. This supposed double standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to deal culturally with the inside of the female body.
