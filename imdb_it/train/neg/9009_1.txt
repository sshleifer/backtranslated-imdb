What a terrible movie! For some reason, the laboratories and scientific outposts always have a staff of poor, dirty, mean, misanthropic people who live inside. These people who supposedly work together on complicated scientific projects do not seem to agree on how to survive death at the hands of a CGI dragon. Spoiler: a very obnoxious scientist whose main acting ability is "mischievous" and "the sinister gaze" has cloned a dragon. While the lab had to work on this kind of thing, the other scientists are shocked, because apparently they were all back in their experiments and were taken with their pants down. The rest of the story is like WHAT, or Ten Little Indians, where the staff is hunted and killed while trying to formulate a way to escape and / or defeat the "Dragon". The CGI Dragon creature is dark gray, which seems to be the popular color for most of the cheap CGI special effects. It hardly looks better than a cartoon, and dark gray tones make it difficult to see interesting details in the dragon's body. All that seems is a gray lump. Acting is less than horrible. These scientists behave like a group of children who cannot agree on anything, and this makes it easier for the Dragon to kill them in various escape attempts, concealment, etc. Dean Cain is hardly better than any cast of unknown actors in this film. It seems to sink to the level of its supporting cast. This film is really, really atrocious. The acting is bad. The story is stupid. CGI is very cheap and amateur. There is nothing laudable about this film, nor is it a good killer to watch while doing chores or other work.
