Diana Guzman is an angry young woman. By surviving an unstoppable series of disappointments and traumas, he brings his anger towards the closest goals. <br /> <br /> When he sees the violence transformed and focused by the discipline in a dilapidated boxing club, he knows he has found his home. <br /> <br /> The film proceeds from there, while Diana learns the usual old-age training lessons along with the skills needed for successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good at the role, particularly when she conveys the concentrated anger of a young woman surrounded by all sides and fighting not only personal circumstances but entrenched sexism. <br /> <br /> The image could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors, who pale compared to the older and more experienced cast. There are too many breaks in the script, which takes away the dramatic tension. The general silence of the film drains it of intensity. <br /> <br /> This is a nice picture to see once, if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman, whose femininity is complex enough to include her power. Its limitations prevent it from being included in the "see it again and again" category.
