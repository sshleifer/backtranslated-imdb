This film is about the life of a man who goes wrong. His business is failing, and he cannot fertilize his wife despite multiple attempts. <br /> <br /> The plot is a complete mess. It just doesn't make sense. In reality, nothing in the film makes sense. The story is told so badly that I simply couldn't understand it. It's a shame, because sets and costumes are well made and are quite visually stimulating. The shots are well composed throughout the film. However, these saving features still fail to compensate for the ugly plot and poor narrative. I'm amazed by the big names that have agreed to play in this film. It's a waste of talent. This film is very bad. Avoid it !!
