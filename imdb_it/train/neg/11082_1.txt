I know it's a Power-Rangers stunt and suitable for 7-year-olds, but really why did they take themselves seriously with this movie? If they intend to write a plot with crayons, at least they have the decency to make it silly. It's a little fun if you look at this. We have a typical family full of clich√© characters (father a war veteran who lost his wife and accuses LOLOL), children with their heads in the air try to fill the stereotype but fail with horrible acting and a ridiculous horrible companion serves no purpose to the film but to fill the space of the camera. Funny things! <br /> <br /> However, the real big moment is approaching the end when the war father is the bad agent trying to fight a sword, but then they realize that none of them knows how (probably because they don't are margins of budget for the choreographers), so they devise this setting of the American Gladiator type to run into. LOL. <br /> <br /> Rated 1/10 because they try to treat this seriously.
