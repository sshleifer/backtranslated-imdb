How cynical are the writers, to go along with this. I could be an American citizen, but I don't need to see other Americans beating their shoulders for an hour and a half to enjoy a movie. I am stunned by the fact that so few have commented on how absolutely chauvinistic, sentimental and banal the dialogue is in this film. The film's historical inaccuracies are not as crude and offensive as in "U-571" (which changes British submariners to American submarines), but you still walk away feeling a little slimy. Really, the Germans in this film do nothing but admire the Americans in battle scenes! How sad, not necessary! I would just like to say to the writers: it is obvious to many of us that it is not possible to capture real people, with real problems, under real pressure, and that you have taken very well-tested shortcuts. Luckily for you there will always be nationalist madmen to appreciate your sugar-coated tripe.
