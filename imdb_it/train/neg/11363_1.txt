This film was advertised on radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every number. So when we went to the Kinnepolis multiplex, our expectations were very high. But oh boy, how sad this movie is! It's a Hollywood-style film about a movie in a film. The nuances are so clear that we are not ready to produce "great Hollywood movies". I'm not a film critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. As my theme line says, it is nothing, and therefore it is in a loop. You could just watch television without really seeing anything. This was the feeling we have when we saw the shadows. Shades is a BAD PRODUCTION !!!
