Yesterday was Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the United States and other countries, and I went to see the complete movie version of "Earth" by DisneyNature. I imagine that, like car manufacturers, Disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet. Maybe they really care about the planet, I don't know, but I don't think it guarantees a special unity with the word "nature" contained in it. I know that my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse and who am I to tell a one-year-old boy my personal feelings about Disney? <br /> <br /> In addition to the incredible cinematography, it was a typical Disney disappointment for me. Preceded by half a dozen Disney movie trailers, full of Disney clich√©s ("circle of life", "fall style"), overly dramatic music, recycled footage (Disney claims "40% of new movies"). I was also starting to think that the story of James Earl Jones is getting a little boring. I like James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman making every Warner Brothers story starts to wear down. I really think that Disney bought such a spectacularly naturalistic BBC picture, they thought it would sell itself if it slapped orchestral music and recognizable sound bites on it. <br /> <br /> And what is Disney's obsession with showing predators that chase and kill puppies? There were half a dozen such scenes, complete with young bleats about to have their throats torn. I think Disney must recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of the struggles of life and death that appeal to cinema-oriented action teenagers who have been dragged into this film by their parents. I was also aware of how Disney stopped very little to suggest that the man had something to do with climate change. Are they so afraid of the small minority of deniers who think it's still a controversial topic? <br /> <br /> I recommend skipping this and renting Blue Planet DVDs on Netflix. Natural films seem to be better made by the British at the moment.
