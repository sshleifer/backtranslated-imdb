This film is simply ugly. It is not even worth looking at it to make fun of it. The crazy professor is simply annoying. Even by suspending disbelief to take into account the invisibility (which I gladly do for good bad films) and allowing extremely stupid victims in a horror film, this film also calls for more. If you are looking for scenes of women with locker rooms for women and casual sexual encounters, take a porn, if you are looking for a bad movie, you get something else. If you simply want to waste your time on a nasty bad movie, rent this one.
