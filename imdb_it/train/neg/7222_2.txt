Knowing Enki Bilal's comics for a while, I had to watch this movie. I thought it would be a good way for the artist like Bilal to spread his art and ideas to a wider audience. I also thought it would be a good movie to recommend, and I thought I would like to watch it ... I was wrong! The film was a real torture to watch. The idea has potential ... but the film leaves too much to be desired, and basically everyone who sees this film has left the impression of being able to do it better. I will not make any suggestions if you should see this movie or not. The odds are if you are reading these pages that you have already seen it, or that you will see it, but prepared for bad 102 minutes.
