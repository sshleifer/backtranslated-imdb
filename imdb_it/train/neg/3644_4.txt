This film is rather poor. The acting is abysmal and completely forced. Furthermore, filming the film as a docudrama does not necessarily mean making it more credible, it is not possible to get out of it so easily Mr. Dir. Do not be fooled by my comments, as I would recommend watching this film, as it sheds light on the non-existent psychology behind authors of such crimes. However, the climax of the film is absolutely rubbish! There is no other way to say it! It is pure and simply fails to capture any sense of the atmosphere! What happens does not translate into me any feeling of despair, panic, fear or terror that would surely be experienced in such terrifying circumstances. No, he leaves you with his mouth open "Was that so ?!" escaping from your language, and in no way are you haunted by these actions as boys. Rather, you just feel embarrassed about the umpteenth movie that started with potential, but ended up falling face down in the most crucial point. Zero Day indeed .... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
