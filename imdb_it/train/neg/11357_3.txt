1st good news The 3-D is extraordinarily well done, and they don't go for the gotcha tricks. The film is based on the true story of the highest point in human history, and also features one of the actual participants in that story: Buzz Aldrin. <br /> <br /> And now the meat of the matter: it is VOLA, for the krissakes! Fly with big googy human eyes, true, but still fly. Remember when I compared "Underworld" movies to rats against cockroaches? This was not meant as a eulogy, and I never imagined anyone would take it literally. This has even less empathy. Maggots of the child? Ugh. In one of those strange confluences of Hollywood groupthink, this flik was evidently on the drawing board at the same time as "Space Chimps", even on creatures in space. <br /> <br /> Go to "Apollo 13" and watch a 9-movie movie on the REAL space program (RIP).
