"Metamoprhis" is the story of a charming young scientist, revered at the local college, is being investigated by college financial service providers. This forces him to take shortcuts in the typical Hollywood melodramatic fashion. <br /> <br /> My first thought after this film ended was this. "Not good, but not bad, for the first half of the eighties". Of course, I realized that it was made in 1990, which almost led to a '4', but I decided to keep it at the mediocre '5' that it is. <br /> <br /> 'Metamorphis' on some occasions, it looks like a good movie trying desperately to get out. The acting, although not stellar, is mostly competent. You can even see the occasional sparkle of a modest quality. Pacing is a big problem with the film. After thinking about watching for ninety minutes, I realized that I was only watching an hour. The special effects are not stellar, but the director seems to be quite competent enough to circumvent this weakness. <br /> <br /> The main character, a slightly charismatic male who seems to be attempting a blended channeling by Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves, reminded me especially of the character of Matt Dillon in "Wild Things". The female heroine does a good job, but does not stand out anyway. There is a "bad girl" role here, and the actress does what she can with it, but it doesn't look like much. There is a child actor that the director cannot decide if he is gloomy, cheerful or just strange. <br /> <br /> Rhythm, as I said, is the worst problem with this movie, until a final battle with the villain that would make a Power Ranger blush. It's bizarre and inexplicable, down to the final scene that should be dramatic but simply hilarious, saturated with every bad camera and trick that can be compressed in about thirty seconds. <br /> <br /> Decent time watch the "Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack" movie. Nothing that brings you back and nothing to buy alone.
