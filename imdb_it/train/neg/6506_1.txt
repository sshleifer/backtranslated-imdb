Unless you are a brilliant film student who has to see everything, this film will not only be a waste of time and money and a huge disappointment, but it will make you angry even beyond imagination. <br /> <br /> It could be a story worth telling somewhere inside, but Hopkins has decided to hide it and code it under so many incessant chaotic layers of seemingly random audio video microcircuits, losing patience to the viewer after a short time. <br /> <br /> Because someone like Hopkins could have chosen such a heavy, difficult and highly unstable project, since his first script, the first soundtrack and the third film can guess anyone. Perhaps he played with him in his mind for so long until he became unrecognizable as what he became, not even for himself. The result shows that he does not have enough experience or skill to achieve the desired result. <br /> <br /> Even the weirdest films Carpenter and Lynch, to name just two non-intentional filmmakers, had 90% more coherence, 95% fewer characters and 99% more story flow . <br /> <br /> Sir Anthony has aimed at the stars, but unfortunately touched by a couple of light years. Please stick to acting, in that department you are a giant without equal and nobody should ask more from you, not even yourself!
