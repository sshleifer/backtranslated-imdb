Well, this is perhaps the worst movie ever, at least the worst movie I've ever seen. They tried these 666 children of Satan, the films against Christ, about 1000 times and none of them is good and this is perhaps the worst of them. They think it will be a better film, the more they use that fake blood. This film has no idea in it, the actors and the shots are simply terrible. I can't even decipher that mini line of 10 of this movie. Really nothing to say but that is simply horrible. How they manage to make films like the right ones fail to understand it. This can't be a Hollywood movie, can it? Just don't look at this, use your money more wisely.
