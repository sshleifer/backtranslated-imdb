Wow. This was probably the worst DCOM ever. I saw the first half hour and I laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy, the girl popular with her hot-jock boyfriend and has made friends who are determined to become the queen of homecoming. He should save the world as a warrior, and Shin comes to his aid to help her with her Martial Arts. Shin teaches her the skills of a snake, a tiger, etc. And he must learn some techniques to save the world. <br /> <br /> This film is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and Chinese culture but the acting and casting were horrible. <br /> <br /> Brenda Song is a comic actress and I can't see her playing a serious role. It was a fun laugh to see her cry on Shin. Shin could not possibly act and everything was absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie and tried to think of something similar, and the thing that came to my mind is the Power Rangers. This film is so fake and the stunts were as powerful as those of Ranger-Power which was just trivial and stupid. The characters weren't funny and I just couldn't see it. Disney really needs to take time to make decent movies. High School Musical is the only film that deserves to be on Disney Channel, along with other films like Jumping Ship, Color of Friendship, Go Figures, Read It and Weep, & Stuck in the Suburbs. <br /> <br /> If you like action-adventure and banal jokes, you'll like this movie.
