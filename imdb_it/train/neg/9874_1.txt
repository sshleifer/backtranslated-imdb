A fabulous book about a fox and his family doing what foxes do. that stealing from farms and killing prey. until a trio of peasants decide to get enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem "solved". Obviously they are "out foxed" at every turn and while the trio is encamped in the fox hatch, the family raids against the three peasants. <br /> <br /> The "film" version, and I use the film in the very long term, is more than a terrible mess of American robbery films especially the Oceans movies. They even have George clooney as Mr Fox to add the insult and be able to completely lose the point of the story. So congratulations for them. They will make a lot of money and destroy another classic children's book by Roald Dahl.
