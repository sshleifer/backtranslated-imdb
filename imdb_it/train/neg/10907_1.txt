I was expecting a film similar to Deuce Bigalow, which I liked. However, this disaster seemed to last forever. It is one of those films that enjoys the sad position of PG-13 even though it is not an appropriate child. Jokes are not just low or playful jokes, they are rough, obscene and many actions go beyond the boundaries not only for bad taste, but also for legal and moral decency. Many scenes seem to have been chopped up to get the PG-13 score ... too bad ... it could have made a big splash as an R-rated movie if the funny one was left inside. (Overstation? Probably.) I do not recommend this film. It's a total waste of time ... and I'm a movie buff and ready to give almost any shot. At 45 minutes, the film seemed to be running low ... and the boy was ready to do it. The finish is bizarre but does not recover the rest of this tourist / wound trap of a rent. 1/2 star (glad I saw it as a freebie ... it would have been disgusting to pay hard-earned greenbacks for this tripe)
