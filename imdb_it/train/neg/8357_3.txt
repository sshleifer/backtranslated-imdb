Man oh man! What a bad piece of film! But this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood, even if I hate to admit it. They showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the Cupertino border) we had this thing called The G Channel on our cable system. And in practice they have always shown the same film, again and again. Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. I fell in love with lust and love with the young Brooke Shields and loved her dopamine adventures in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. The script is almost meaningless, the direction is poor, the few highlights are that Henry Fonda makes an appearance, a lot of dialogues so bad is good and a nice song by Carole King reproduced on the end credits. Maybe you have to be stoned to really enjoy this movie. And hey, everyone knows there's no gold in the Grand Canyon!
