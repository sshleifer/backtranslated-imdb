Gayniggers from Outer Space is a short foreign film about black gay aliens exploring the galaxy until they stumble on Earth. Being gay, their goal is to have an exclusively male universe in which all people are gay. So when they discover that women or "female creatures" live on Earth, they are terrified at first; in the end they decide to eliminate all the women on the planet and free the male population. <br /> <br /> An offensive title with a racist, homophobic and sexist plot, although probably intended as a satire, gives this film a shocking value. However, there is little substance below. As another reviewer pointed out, there are some jokes besides the names of the characters (for example ArmInAss); I think I laughed once in a little gay joke. I think I quickly understood the point of the film, a satire of bad science fiction, but later I had enough; I kept wanting the film to end (and it's a short film!). Not brilliant or particularly well written.
