I would like to start by saying that I would read a number of reviews before renting this movie and knew what to expect. However, I was surprised by how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of the werewolf and I got used to forgive a lot when I look at it. Most of these have secondary effects, poor acting and weak plot (at best redone by previous films). So far, with the possible exception of some of the later "Howling" films, this is the worst of all. <br /> <br /> First, the story. It has been mentioned several times in reviews on this site, so I won't go into specifics. However, it is very obvious that the writer (s) has absolutely no affinity with werewolf monsters. As often happens when a horror film is given to a writer who considers himself "above" that kind of thing, they tried to invent a new interpretation of the werewolf myth. Okay, but a non-horror fan who tries to do it generally doesn't take into account the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up writing for them. The plot seems a parody of werewolf films, and the events depicted sound so fake that I seriously insult my intelligence. For example, television news footage never saves the journalist from a close-up view of someone in the crowd behind them. Give the characters and the spectators the merit of being able to identify the villain in the scene without using a flashing neon sign. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> As for the effects, I've never seen a less credible werewolf. I would have been happier with Lon Chaney Jr. in frizzy hair. The beast they used looks very much like ... well, like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with some hair stuck together and some really horrible animatronics. And I know that many people have already criticized the CG, but my God was terrible. A scene presents a woman who changes, and starts with a completely CG version of the actress, naked but for some reason without nipples. My first thought was, "hey, why is one of the characters in 'ReBoot' turning into a silly-looking werewolf?" <br /> <br /> Anyway, I like to look for positives in every movie, and there was a few. Cinematography was acceptable (the film was shot entirely in digital, which is interesting) and some of the performances were not terrible. It was also interesting to see Tippi Hedron as the most well-made homeless woman in the world, and Kane Hodder as the villain of the title. Also, the Yellow Power Ranger has grown and ... well, damn it. And if you're looking for skin, there are some pretty tasty examples. This concludes the male-pig segment of the review. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you want a good werewolf movie, try "An American Werewolf in London", the original "The Howling", "Dog Soldiers", or even "The Wolfen" (although it has more wolf than it was). If you are a more complete werewolf, then take a look. Otherwise, give this miss.
