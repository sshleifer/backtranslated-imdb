I really mean, how could Charles Band the head of Full Moon leave out a stinky ball like DEMONICUS. I mean he should never have the green light to begin with. The story is repetitive, the characters are weak at best, there is no real story about Tiraniano, but then he is a bad guy. Then the writer or director makes his way to a negative ending. It's really a bad ending, Demonicus gets up. The last survivor escapes into a deadly cave, then a photo of Chimera comes to life, little by little I could add and chase it. Then while he is walking towards FUNHOUSE home. A statue that was destroyed centuries ago reappears for no reason only to collapse on her. I mean, it doesn't make sense. What the hell Charles was thinking about allowing this pile of vomit to be done, with four different movie companies that were so desperate for the movies. They could have asked me, I had better ideas then DEMONICUS. THANKS TO TURKEY.
