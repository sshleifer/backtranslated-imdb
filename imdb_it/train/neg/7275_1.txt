"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is absolutely the worst film ever made, surpassing even the "Plan 9 from Outer Space". The film Lampoon takes place in three separate and unrelated vignettes, each with different artists. The only common thread is the total lack of quality of redemption. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe there is one. Another reviewer on this site said that the fleeting nude photos are beautiful, and he is right. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry blink nicely, in the first and second parts, respectively. But their glamorous displays are, alas, wasted. The directors seem to have forgotten that T & A also needs a credible story to surround it, and there's no one in sight. <br /> <br /> The third segment, with Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most disgusting of the three, and an unfortunate choice as the conclusion of this film. Benson plays a young greedy-beaver policeman, who brilliantly reports his first day of service, ready to free the roads of evil. It is paired with an old cynical cop played by Widmark, and when these oil and water partners leave together for their first patrol, we feel a possible redemption of the film's previous failures. Perhaps, perhaps only, the cynical veteran will be reformed by the sense of duty and loyalty of his new partner. Maybe everything will end happily after all. But alas, this film goes straight to the bathroom, without redemption, without a happy ending, without coherent stories of any kind. <br /> <br /> Before "National Lampoon goes to the movies", I thought I had already seen the worst schlock that Hollywood could possibly turn out to be. Unfortunately, I hadn't seen half of it. <br /> <br />
