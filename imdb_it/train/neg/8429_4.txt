This film fails to offer anything new to a genre that has traditionally shown the intercultural romance sustained by mid-20th century / pre-World War II politics in India, where the British and their modern ways are bad and the primitive but honest and true Indians are good. Surely these clich√© representations of the English have rather passed now. <br /> <br /> Apart from the drama that feeds the second part of the film, the narrative is predictable, the acting is pedestrian and two-dimensional, and the direction is clear and unimaginative. <br /> <br /> The story really needed to be enriched and would surely have benefited from another half hour of screen to give more depth to the characters and fiction and give the viewer something to feel some investment in. <br /> <br /> All in all, rather uninteresting. Oh, and Linus Roache can't make tragedies - going cross-eyed with emotional pain doesn't work for me!
