This film was pure pain. Sitting in the theater for x-minutes, I wondered when the movie would start. All settings were in place; the typical love story, the characters must overcome their brief suggestions, the villain must emerge, but none of them has ever begun. By the time these things happened, I was already bored and the devices were completely ineffective. In the scenes that required immense tension and accumulation, it seemed that the necessary frames were cut off. Kid's things don't have to be that way. Children's films can be as compelling and engaging as adult ones. The excuse, "hey, is for children", is bull. I'll take "Sword in the Stone" every day. This was terrible. I have a feeling that Disney will distribute something these days. And as for the children, the 10 years I saw with this will agree ... pure junk.
