A necessarily ridiculous film version of the literary classic "Moby Dick". John Barrymore is Captain Ahab, who falls in love with the pastor's daughter, Joan Bennett. His brother Derek is a rival for Mrs. Bennett's affections. When Mr. Barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident, Bennett rejects him. He must kill the whale and win back Bennett ... <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that could have thrilled the theater audience in 1930; especially the scenes involving Barrymore losing a leg. However, the film has not aged well; there are much better films of the era, both from the 1920s and the silent 30s. The two attractions named, John Barrymore and Joan Bennett are not at their best. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
