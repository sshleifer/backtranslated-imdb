I'll probably give this more credit than it deserves because it's Halloween, I was just at "Knott's Scary Farm" and I was in the mood to watch a really delicious Halloween movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and it only cost me a dollar. <br /> <br /> Usually I will look for a film like this to get "good things", but I resisted the impulse here and I'm still not sure why. It was evident from the initial shots that this was not a "real" movie, not even a B-movie. It's more in the category of "horror" films by DeCoteau like "The Brotherhood" that are shot on a video-look video for about 50 cents (in fact, I was almost scared every minute one of his muscular college boys staggered rubbing himself in his underpants or something like that). There were no sequential shots (too expensive to make more camera settings) and flat lights but ... it's hard to spot. There's something refreshing about watching a director without money take out a half-decent movie. The fact that he is doing even a decent job is commendable, and this film has its share of merit: acting is not bad, photography is good enough (if too bright to be scary), there are surprises, and the everything is somehow ... different in some way. <br /> <br /> A group of college kids are (for some unknown reason) stuck in the warehouse where they are decorating the haunted house. A creepy old man gives them a satanic book and accidentally summon the powers of hell. The result is that people in costumes in the haunted house become the ones that were invented, causing a lot of chaos and human suffering. Along the way we are treated to a strangely complex and reflexive lesbian relationship subplot - it's interesting that this couple seems to be the most well-rounded in the film. Yes, there is a sex scene but it's not salacious - or at least no more than you can find in any legal lesbian movie that shows them to have sex. It is rather unusual for a horror film to take the time and effort to do it without resorting to cheap exploitation. <br /> <br /> The other thing about this that aroused my interest was the way he was clearly trying to emulate "stupid children have sex and get killed" the atmosphere of the 80s. It is difficult to accept because there are so many of those films that already exist, the genre was done to death. I'm not sure it's nice or bad that these directors simply tried to make another voice in that genre, without irony, as if it were still a LIVING genre, but I appreciated the attempt. <br /> <br /> that's why I sat through it; sometimes you just want to watch a horror film without meaning, without budget, "A-for-effort". There was really too much set up, not enough gore, endless holes, blind alleys and clich√©s and the unfortunate general feeling of a film that simply didn't have enough money to be the movie that the producers imagined ... but at least the scenes of the haunted house they were quite beautiful. I'd pay to go to that haunted house if it existed, and I wouldn't mind paying a dollar to see it on DVD even though I wouldn't watch it again. <br /> <br /> Oh, and ** possible spoilers **, but there was a big, short deal with the vampire girl in the coffin: "I was a bit claustrophobic, but I changed". Ha ha, good.
