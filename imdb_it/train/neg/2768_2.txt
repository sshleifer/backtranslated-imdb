This film was horrible. <br /> <br /> They didn't develop any of the characters and the plot was horribly interpreted. It was a definite sleep. You would expect that the action scenes of a film like this are its strengths, but D-Wars surprises you even with a disappointment in that department. <br /> <br /> Also, acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porn movie. And I'm serious. <br /> <br /> I was really happy to see the credits on this because it was so bad !!! Please, whatever you do, don't waste time and money on a crappy movie like D-Wars.
