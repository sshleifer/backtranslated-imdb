Pathetic ... worse than a bad movie made for TV. I can't believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this movie. For some reason the character of Morgan Freeman constantly talks and says "cool" when referring to the girl of the NSync boy. Morgan Freeman who calls women "pussy" is just embarrassing ... What the hell were the people behind this movie they think? Too many story holes to be imagined combined with horrible acting, camera scary corners, a lame script and low-cost background music made this film unbearable. <br /> <br /> I rented this flop with low expectations .... but. .. well ... it really sucked.
