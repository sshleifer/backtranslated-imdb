So they talked about violence and was branded as sick. Well, violence is the best part I'm afraid of, but unfortunately the characters aren't developed enough to let us understand why they go on with their (absolutely predictable) fury. This film has a really terrible script. We never had the chance to meet Robert and his actions are simply pathetic in the end. The acting is not much better, the worst is that I am the TV chef and the school teacher. The direction is clumsy, the rhythm enough to send you to sleep. And what the hell is the school film project? A comment on the film itself maybe? The use of newsreels during climate murder is ridiculous. These guys obviously think they are intellectuals but they are hopelessly out of their depth. How the hell the great Yorgos Arvanitis got to light it, I'll never know. And how they got the money to do it in the first place is an even bigger mystery. Absolutely horrible beyond comprehension.
