Sometimes you have to watch a bad movie just to appreciate the good ones. Well, this is my opinion anyway. This will always be in the category of bad films, simply because everything but Shu Qi's performance was terrible. <br /> <br /> Martial Angel tells of Cat (Shu Qi), a professional thief who turned immediately after leaving his lover, Chi Lam (Julian Cheung), two years earlier. But her past comes back to haunt her as Chi Lam is kidnapped for the redemption of the security software of the company she works for. To save him, he calls his old friends from his days as an orphanage, six other exuberant women, to save the day. .. <br /> <br /> I may have said the synopsis with hesitation, but this is a cheese story. In fact, the entire script and director lacked any quality. Much of the dialogue was meaningless and accompanied by a thin plot like rice paper in water. If you could summarize, take a bad Jackie Chan movie, remove the comedy, remove the choreography, throw away the budget and you have the Martial Angels: a terrific job without any imagination. <br /> <br /> Let's be clear, I have to give credit to those who are owed the credit, and Shu Qi was probably the only person to emerge unscathed from the terrible action, since it was his performance to shine. Okay, it can't be said to be excellent - after all he had absolutely nothing to work with - but he managed to dig a character out of his role. In addition to this, only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin made another impression - although these were mostly flashes and very short. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, the film is just finished. Scenes and dialogues were completely unnatural and unbelievable, the special effects were obviously made cheaply without any attempt to clean up the borders between the people and the blue screen mask, poor editing that involved numerous discontinuities in the combat scenes, elementary shooting angles and unflattering, and the direction I saw best from a lost dog. <br /> <br /> I think this film was a business of too many cooks. Most likely, the budget was swept away by the over-enthusiasm of having seven girls on the same silver screen. This didn't leave much else. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the way this film was made was like a cheap porn movie without porn. Charlie's Angels, it's not. In fact, while the sisters can do it by themselves, none of this is really so obvious here. <br /> <br /> Definitely to forget.
