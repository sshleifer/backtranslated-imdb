I was very surprised how bad this movie was. The beautiful cinematography and the splendid landscapes can only bring the film until now. I was hoping for a Hero replica, but this is much, much worse. <br /> <br /> This film is the reason why kung fu movies have had a bad reputation in the first place. No credible characters (even in the world of Kung Fu cartoons, these characters are ridiculous), practically no plot, and ridiculous twists. <br /> <br /> This movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you to try playing a game with a child. Whenever you think your foolish battle makes sense, they invent another ridiculous twist that doesn't make sense ("Ah, you just think you have me with your super powers and 10,000 beam weapons, but I ate my laced vitamins plutonium and teflon, so your ray guns do not work and I am invulnerable to your superpowers ... tap tap no trade backs infinity PLUS one. ") Children can continue with this madness, because they don't care if someone is listening because you're having fun. However, for the VIEWER, particularly for the adult public, this long film is worse than an attack with harmful gases. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD Note to kung fu filmmakers, (a) if you have a knife in your hand back it hurts unless you are on PCP, in which case your kung fu is not strong, (b) if you fall repeatedly on your back, which has a knife inside, it will hurt more and do more damage, unless it is a false prop, (c) when you are stabbed in the heart with a knife, you die, especially in ancient China where there is no Kaiser Permanente around the corner, (d) kung fu fights do not last for hours while 3 falls a little snow and (e) sometimes it is worth explaining your characters and their motivations. <br /> <br /> In any case, go see Hero again, because at least in his little world it is understandable.
