It's one of the fun things about being young that you can be easily fooled by advertising. I spoke before another film, in which the commercial for the film (comedy) makes it more fun than it is. Seeing the announcement for this in 1981 made me think that this would be a very funny movie. What my brother and I went to see with me didn't know is that the scene used in television advertising was the last scene of the movie! <br /> <br /> Since this scene is the end result of everything that happened in the film, I can only imagine that there was nothing else fun to use! The last scene is, thanks to a youthful potion, dr. Fu Manchu transforms himself from a long bearded old man into a bright young Asian / Elvis like rock star! (With back up singers no less!) <br /> <br /> Set up for no real reason, in the 1930s, Peter Sellers did his best with the material at hand but was given no reason for the his "comic" moments. The rest of the actors were simply boring and my brother and I just sat all of this just laughing at anything. It was natural that we expected a "Pink Panther" -like comedy, Peter Sellers was so good at it. <br /> <br /> It's a shameful shame this was his last film before he died. His appearance on the Muppet Show was more fun than this ill-conceived flop. However, I don't complain. I hit all the others involved for not trying to make a better film than this. 2 stars is generous !!
