A really horrible film that made me feel dirty having watched the forty minutes or so I could stand. It is not the actors' fault, but the writer / director, the producers, the financiers, etc., need to speak with great rigor. Maybe he thinks it's deep. It is not. This rape and ultraviolence, unlike the central one of Mechanical Orange, has nothing to say or add to the sum of human understanding. It's not even about Straw Dogs, which I've seen him compared to. Rather, it seems that Pete Walker has touched something, yet in saying that I'm probably a little unfair to Pete Walker. <br /> <br /> Revenge is a strong human desire, but The Bedroom Window has more to say about this and the male evasion of this pitiful effort. <br /> <br /> I don't think it's particularly misogynistic, just too cheerful in describing certain details - the blood that runs down the GA leg, for example. It is neither provocative nor conflictual, although I am sure that the directors consider themselves very 'bold', only deeply unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Is it as high as we can aim? Is that why the people involved wanted to make movies? (I wrote the Latin phrase here which translates as Oh the Times! Oh the customs! But the new spell check on IMDb would not have allowed me to post until I removed it. Likewise I had to remove square brackets. IMDb.) <br /> <br /> Where is the noble aspiration? The noble impulse? When you watch the British film - the joyous comedies of Ealing or the Boulting brothers; The work of Carol Reed with Graham Greene on Fallen Idol, Our man in Havana or the sublime The Third Man (a film that has much more to say about the evil of a thousand straight heads); the work of Powell & Pressburger; or if you want to talk about sex, violence and masculine emasculation, look at "Director of the offense" Sidney Lumet, from an original play by John Hopkins, take a look at "Tunes of Glory" for something that is worth doing, which has something to say. <br /> <br /> Unlike the foregoing, Straightheads is, alas, a completely hateful celluloid waste.
