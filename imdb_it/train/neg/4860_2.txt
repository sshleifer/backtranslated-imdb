Horrible and horrible TV show! Because Comedy Central has decided to repeat old episodes of this program is beyond me. It really sucks! Of course I talk about the seasons after the first two. The first two seasons were golden, and if I was talking exclusively about those seasons, this show would have gotten eight out of ten stars. None of the comedians who appear after the first two seasons and who were not part of the original cast are useful. They were and are horrible. Comedy is not fun at all. AT ALL !!! <br /> <br /> The original cast was full of talented comedians, such as Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr and Mary Schorr (or whatever it's called), who should have gotten better deals after leaving MAD TV. This show is very overrated and less worthy of your channel's browsing time than Saturday Night Live, another horrible show. Come out Saturday night and have fun, and leave Madam TV to wither and die, as it deserves.
