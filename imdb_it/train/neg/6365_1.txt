Wow, I knew this movie would be bad but not so bad. The result is spoilerific comments. <br /> <br /> Roddy Roddy Piper is a retired police officer who is sickly sweet (cliché!), which helps everyone - he smiles like a postoperative lobotomy patient who complains about his dead son. The adopted son returns from the "Special Ops" of the Armed Forces and because he "saw things" - gritted his teeth if someone mentions something about the past. It's time to clean up the streets from another guy who once knew Piper and his dead son (killed by the bad boy) and his adopted son. <br /> <br /> Oh, love interest is a cute girl who decides there is no reason why she wants to skip the bones of the ex-army. This happens in about 2 minutes of 1 scene. <br /> <br /> The action may have saved this film, but it's even worse than the plot and the acting. It has already been done before, it has been done much better (Ong-Bak is a great example). This is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen Waterworld, twice. <br /> <br /> Erm, the film is called HONOR (Spelling Wrong for the Americans) and the tag line has "from the creators of Bloodsport and Kickboxer" - watch director David Worths' other films and you'll soon understand why they put these 2 films there, even though they are over 10 years old. Classics like "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" - says it all really. <br /> <br /> I'll give you £ 10 if you don't go see this movie. <br /> <br /> PS - To apologize for not knowing the names of the characters, tells you something though.
