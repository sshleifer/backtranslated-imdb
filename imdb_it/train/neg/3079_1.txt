My favorite quote from Crow was, when the car was going down the cliff, "The movie is so ugly, even the car wants to get out of it!" <br /> <br /> This had to be the funniest movie I've ever seen. It was seriously out there to scare you, which makes it even more fun! If it weren't for the Mystery Science Theater, I wouldn't be here today! :-P
