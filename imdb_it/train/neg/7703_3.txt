A famous show master enters the elevator with his girlfriend. Suddenly, she kills him and escapes while an old woman is hit by a heart attack. The name of the female murderer is Sawa. He's still going to school and working for a vicious criminal, Akai, who is sleeping with her. One day Sawa discovers he has killed his parents .. <br /> <br /> ------- <br /> <br /> Even the biggest fans of anime will have to admit that this brutal thriller of action is a fest of disappointing disappointments. "Kite" has style, but it's still rubbish. The strange plot of a teenage girl who kills people like a murderer tried to be scary and moving at the same time, only causing the story to fall flat on her face. One of the highlights is an action sequence in which the good / bad heroine Sawa is falling along with a building bodyguard, however the dramatic structure is not as orchestrated and the bizarre and grotesque animation of the director Yasoumi Umetsu of the character's faces is terrible Not only that, the sequences of the reports are simply terrifying. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10
