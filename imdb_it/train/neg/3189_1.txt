I imagine this goes to show that Joe Don Baker will do anything for a dollar. The concept of the film was not very good to start with. This movie has so many bad things about it, I don't know where to start. The acting is horrible. Cinematography is marginal at best. The soundtrack was pretty bad. The score is terrible. There is a reason why this movie ended up on the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before writing this and I can't believe that 9 people actually thought this "movie" was excellent. They must have appreciated the two go-go dancers. The final justice would be if they close this stink in the vault of the movie outside Wichita and never let anyone see it again! A 1 in 10 rating is far better than it deserves.
