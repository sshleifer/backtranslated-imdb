I still can't believe this movie. There are so many amazing things in it, that it's hard to believe that someone wanted to make it. <br /> <br /> History is a joke, but in the sense of being fun, but more like no story. How can you mix a slapstick comedy with a train robbery, a prison film, city conspiracies, sex jokes and an FBI agent? You can not. <br /> <br /> In addition to the terrifying direction, the most obvious thing is the actors. I saw this movie and thought, "Is it really Marlon Brando? No, it can't be. (5 minutes later) Is this Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando is true. (5 minutes later) This can't be Donald Sutherland. (5 minutes later) No, not Mira Sorvino. This film is a shame for all of them. (In the end.) No, no, no, this absolutely cannot be Martin Sheen !!! Not for 10 seconds of a film of the kind. "Then it's over and I with my nerves. So many good, oscar-winning, usually convincing actors in a film so stupid, stupid, horrible. I rarely wanted to know so much about how they came to act in this. They couldn't have so much money. <br /> <br /> Just an incredible silly idiot movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 1/4 5 (1+ - 6-)
