This failed, impractical TV Pilot can be found as an extra on the DVD of the 30th special edition "Blazing Saddles". Imagine the film without satire, humor or writing skills. But with all the traps of a typical Lame 70s sitcom show complete with an intrusive resonance track and you still wouldn't have the slightest idea how rotten this failed show was. What the hell was Lou Gossett Jr. thinking when he signed this disaster ?? This was probably the worst thing he was (and yes, I'm including the first movie "Punisher" and "Iron Eagles 3." Steve Landesberg, I understand why he can't say no to crap. <br /> <br / > My Grade: F
