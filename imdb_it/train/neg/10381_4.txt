A boring haunted house thriller finds an American family who moves into a 200-year-old house in Japan, where a violent suicidal love triangle has occurred. <br /> <br /> The new settings represent the only element of interest for this very slow horror film by the director of the Motel Hell. The film generates zero suspense and is composed of slightly discontinuous scenes that rarely seem to lead anywhere in the complex. <br /> <br /> An obvious example is a fairly early scene in which the male protagonist visits a temple after realizing that his house is infested by the previously warned monk. The monk tells the story of the house (with which the viewer is already familiar with the opening sequence) and therefore the film merely cuts something else. Previously the monk had offered to help. Well, where is the help? The family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and there is no mention of the monk until almost the end when he returns to do what he should have done an hour before - try to guide the spirits away from home, even at this time it is difficult for the spectators to look after. <br /> <br /> There are some (probably) unintended campy laughs in seeing American actors eventually become possessed by Japanese spirits and suddenly I start doing bad martial arts, I say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel of the same director of the Motel Hell that was most obviously destined to be fun, but overall this is a forgettable disaster.
