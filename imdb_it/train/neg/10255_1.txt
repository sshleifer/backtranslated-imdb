He has Christopher Lee, he has huge computer banks from the 70s that emit Teletype noises when letters appear on the screen, he has radioactive isotopes that not only emit light in the darkness but emit pulsating noises, they have volcanoes! evil aliens disguised as nuns! tsunamis! earthquakes! cars that explode! coffee explosion machines! and as the climax the whole planet explodes. Why did this film manage to be so incredibly, incredibly full? The answer, my friend, is that 90% of this film consists of shots, most of which involve long tracks, panoramic or zoom in combinations, or occasionally all three, which do nothing but give the crew something to do. There are endless shots of our protagonists driving, getting on and off cars, driving again, walking around looking at stuff, getting into cars and driving ... I sat there watching the endless parade of nothingness in muttering amazement " Say something, please Somebody, say something ... DO something ... anything! ... "<br /> <br /> Dialogue, when it comes, is terrible. <br /> <br /> "Perhaps their minutes are measured on a different scale from ours." It was a meaningless line. The script culminated in the destruction of the world by archival footage, justified in this speech by Lee as the alien leader: <br /> <br /> "The planet Earth has emitted an abundance of diseases, are contaminating the Universe All light-year-old planets will suffer from this unless they are destroyed! "<br /> <br /> This is the text written by Neanderthal SF. This is the kind of motivation you find in the Japanese monster film genre of the 1950s aimed at 7-year-olds. It is, and I gather these things, the most terrible part of a science fiction film in English since Buster Crabbe retired. The belief that this film was released in the same year as Star Wars and Close Encounters is begging. <br /> <br /> Lee, who has always struck me as an intelligent and useful actor with a certain knowledge of his limits, offers his lines as if he were going to kill his agent to get him into this pile of dreks. I don't blame him.
