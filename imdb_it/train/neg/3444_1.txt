This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. From the plot, even if the shots, the "special effects", the acting, and I mentioned the plot? Every single thing in it sucked his ass! <br /> <br /> This is a good example of what "over-doing" means and I will try to explain: <br /> <br /> I understand what the creator of this film was trying to do; this was supposed to be one of those movies that you can't really tell what the hell is going on until the end. You sit down hypnotized, not knowing who died and who is alive and who killed who and why and just when you think you have the right timeline find out you're wrong and the movie ends - leaving you with your mouth open for the next 5 minutes! Something like "Unbreakable" or "The Job" if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> But Olga Levens, the writer of this stuff, yes, Olga ?? The writer, director, producer, screenwriter, Caster, set designer, art director, costume designer and even double of one of the characters are some scenes ... this is basically a film about a woman and when it comes to Olga Levens from "Levens Productions "you can't go wrong :-) <br /> <br /> Well, this might sound shocking but" this time "Olga made this great moment, jumping from stage to stage, from dreams to reality ... but wait! this was all a dream after all ... or was it ?? The photo fades and I realize that nothing like this has ever happened, the girl was all alone on the ship ... in reality there was no ship ... no wait! There's the ship again, and the boys! They are alive! Thanks God! No, they call her to join the cruise ... but then the ship disappears, so maybe they died after all ??? or maybe they were never alive to begin with ??? <br /> <br /> If you understood what I just said you might like this movie - otherwise it's a boring job and the only reason I made this crap is to find out how the hell this movie can end ... <br /> <br /> Don't look at this if you appreciate the weather, never 90 minutes is a waste in this case ...
