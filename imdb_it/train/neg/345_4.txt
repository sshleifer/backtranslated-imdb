This can't be the last Mandy Schaffer movie. Someone, do something! :-( <br /> <br /> Argh. <br /> <br /> What a little life he could have had, the director finished. Don't blame the cast, they did OK. Even the winemaker is young brother was pretty well "Yes, done. And he's not even entered the film until the middle of it. And please, please put Mandy in some other movie! He's too beautiful to bury his career at such a young age., heah .... <br /> <br /> Two specific criticisms, in case anyone cares (apparently nobody liked this movie very much.) First, the way Traci kept popping up at the right melodramatic moment, in order to see what he should have seen, and never been seen in return, it was very annoying Hollywood: please stop giving the bad guys a perfect temporal fortune that runs out exactly when the climax comes. It's stupid, write better scripts so you don't having to use that lame plot device more If your script is not good enough to stand up without that, then don't produce it. <br /> <br /> Second, Carmen would not have fallen for that fake makeup that Traci pulled. He had already had Traci with his fingers. More bad writing / directing there. <br /> <br /> I could trash this movie further but mercy forbids it. Actually, I didn't hate it as much as others seem to have. He simply didn't have much reason to be done, unless it was a simple vehicle to show off adorable Mandy. Oh, and to anyone who didn't think she was sexy ... the character wasn't written very well, but how can you say she wasn't sexy?!? One or the other of us needs glasses, and I don't think it's me. <br /> <br /> OTHER MANDY. (Not to be confused with "Moore, Mandy" - although I'd like to see it again too. ;-) <br /> <br /> P.S. Did I mention that I hope Mandy gives me more films? <: - D
