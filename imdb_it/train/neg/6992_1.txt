The plot is about a nurse, named Anna, who is captured in the midst of a global chaos in which meat-eating zombies start to rise and conquer the world and attack the living. She escapes to the streets and is rescued by a black police officer. So far, so good! I usually like horror movies, but this movie doesn't deserve to be called horror. Nor is it exciting, just ridiculous. Even the "Flintstones" or "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" will give you more excitement. It's like watching a group of bloodthirsty drunks who can't get into a mall from other liquors. The heroes who shut themselves up inside the mall to avoid being eaten by the hooligans outside are not even better. Even if they don't seem drunk, they give the impression of being mentally disabled. Save your money instead of spending it on this!
