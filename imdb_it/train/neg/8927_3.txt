Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) gets a sex change from a doctor (John Carradine - drunk dead) and comes out as Myra (Raquel Welch). He decides to destroy male masculinity (or something like that) and proceeds to teach film history in an acting college run by the lascivious John Huston (don't ask) and break up a happy young couple (young, handsome, hunky Roger Herren and Farrah Fawcett - yes THE Farrah Fawcett). <br /> <br /> They took a great novel by Gore Vidal that was adamant and, of course, tried to film it. They also hired an Englishman with a decidedly anti-American attitude and hired a group of actors with questionable "talents" (Welch, Reed) and embarrassed old professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West), they launched it all together and ... SURPRISE !!! A real disaster. <br /> <br /> The film received an X rating at its release (it was lowered to an R), mainly due to a really insipid scene in which Welch sodomizes Rusty (Roger Herren) and a scene in which Welch try to have sex with Fawcett. <br /> <br /> The film is very scattershot ... the scenes jump everywhere and people say and do things that make no sense. It's not good at all but I've never been bored. <br /> <br /> Acting varies wildly ... Reed is horrible ... really sad. Huston chews the landscape again and again and STILL to a nauseating extreme. Welch is actually not as bad as Myra, but his jokes make no sense, so you never know what to do with it. West is hardly in the movie (a blessing) and it's really kind of sick to hear a woman of almost 80 years having sex jokes. Roger Herren (whatever happened to ...) was very young, handsome and not as bad as Rusty. Fawcett is OK. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find things to say about this ... you look at him incredulously. A movie to see - to believe !!!!
