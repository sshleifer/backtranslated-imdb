Sorry, but apart from Kim Basinger doing a good job playing fear, this was one of the worst thrillers I've seen in a while. The logic is banished as 4 young boys terrorize this woman outside a crowded mall and shoot a security guard. Yet no one seems to notice. Then, instead of shouting for help or returning to the mall, he leaves and ends up in the woods with the boys in pursuit. I can't even describe how stupid it is to see this woman running away from 4 retarded thugs, carrying a red toolbox, screaming that God is coming to help her and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing others. Please trust me, this is bad and a little bland.
