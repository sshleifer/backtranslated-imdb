I giggled a couple of times during this movie. I laughed aloud during the authenticity of the delivery of margarine (pun intended). <br /> <br /> There are three segments in this film. The first should be a parody of "woman" that grows "and launches career films". The TampaxÂ® box was the most fun in this segment. Most cast members are not listed here on IMDb. They are the lucky ones. Few other people will be able to connect this to the ruin of their acting careers. <br /> <br /> The second segment is a parody of "penniless woman sleeping to the top and taking control of the huge industry films". Robert Culp has several funny moments, all physical humor, including the aforementioned handover. After his character dies, the segment sinks lower and lower while Dominique Corsaire rises higher and higher. When he became First Lady, I wanted to tear the cable from the TV and watch "snow". Instead, I switched to Pakistani music videos. I don't understand Urdu, or the language in which the videos were. It was even better than listening to the dialogue in this painfully boring "story". <br /> <br /> Then came the "municipal" with the * big * star, half of which on the screen for less than a minute: Elisha Cook, Jr., Christopher Lloyd, Rhea Perlman, Henny Youngman, Julie Kavner , Richard Widmark and ... * Robby Benson. * It should be a parody of "a young policeman fighting with an old and abused policeman, who needs retirement * badly *. The horizontal flash bar on the police car is very impressive. It was interesting to see the old RTD buses, a sign of the Shell service station and an American Savings sign - none of them is around anymore. "Never stop anywhere you might have to get out of the car" of Nagurski made me smile momentarily. Then they discuss how boring the young cop is. "Back and forth about how boring it is. It was as boring as this description of how boring it is. Nagurski's law number four," Never go to a music store with an acetylene torch, "made me think that the store of music is a real bargain in the place where the dispatcher gave it. Thinking about this was more interesting than the gag set-up that followed, the young Falcone (Benson) being hit. A lot. Become a hardened cop like Nagurski. The segment continues. Again and again. And go. Will not stop. Roll forward ceaselessly, no matter how many times you want to die * already * so this thing will end. It is not so. It goes on and on and on .... Then an episode of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" that I saw four times has already arrived. Thanks God! This abysmal film ended up going to get the mail.
