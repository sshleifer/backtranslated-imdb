Filmography: excellent, beautiful shooting angles (I don't remember seeing a film recently, with good close-ups, up to this). I could have avoided gruesome scenes with a soft video camera. NY is well depicted. I liked the upside-down corners, in particular (a different touch). <br /> <br /> Music: not impressive. The songs don't stay in your mind even after watching the movie. It could be, I expected the same quality as "Anniyan". A delusion. <br /> <br /> Actors: Kamal needs to move away from the hard-core action sequences slowly. His age and his belly really show. Also, it should avoid closing ongoing romantic sequences. It was very embarrassing to see a mature / elderly star who is still trying to play like a 20+ hero scene. Love can be expressed at any age; as we age, you can still express love from a distance (without touching the woman too much.) For example, the love expressed by Rajinikanth in "chandrmukhi"). Jyotika appears for the namesake in the film. I don't know why he accepted it. Well, it's not my problem, I guess. <br /> <br /> The others have only a small presence. <br /> <br /> Direction: I expected Gautham to excel (or measure himself) with the other movie "Kakka Kakka". I was disappointed. It took a long time to publish the film due to various problems. It slides into a few scenes. Even the most abusive things have slipped by a famous director. <br /> <br /> Overall: just a movie ok. Too much graphics. Definitely not for children (and adults who expect some sort of "entertainment"). <br /> <br /> Thx
