Looking at "Kroko" I would have liked to leave the cinema for the first time in my life. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie: main flat characters - absolutely no development for example. Kroko, the metaphorical problem of the German child, remains a pure metaphor without any capacity for positive involvement, despite the many plot possibilities to do so. Uninspired actors, plot not evolving. I imagine that the film has tried an environmental survey but it has not succeeded: the camera has seemed shaky rather than motivated. The images were low-contrast, gray and dark: I'm sure, but the components didn't help to give a convincing impression of the social environment. The story had a certain potential, however, it could have made a nice short story.
