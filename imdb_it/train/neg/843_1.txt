A BDSM "subculture" in Los Angeles is the backdrop to this low budget and a shabbily built disorder, clearly a piece of vanity for its top-billed player, Celia Xavier, who also produces and scripts while performing a dual role as twin sisters Vanessa and Celia. A question soon arises as to whether some rather immoderate, enlightening and editing pyrotechnic can ever reach a connection point with a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensible observer. Celia is employed as a probation officer for the County of Los Angeles, while her indomitable twin has become an iconic figure in her fetishist world, largely due to erotic performances on CD-ROM, but when disaster strikes "Mistress Vanessa", virtuous Celia, determined to unearth her sister's evil aggressor, begins a new job as a "sex slave" in the private Castle Club, where the house specialty is a "dungeon feast". Two FBI field agents (whose deployment on the Vanessa case is apparently requested due to his involvement with BDSM Internet sites), as well as a Los Angeles police detective, are in charge of investigating the crime as they try to provide security to Celia, whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is considered avidly enough by her clients to create conditions of personal danger for her. Faults in logic and continuity abound, such as the murder assigned to the South Operations Office of L.A.DP., a region of the metropolis that is very far from the setting of the film. The direction is not focused and is not supported by incorrect editing of post-production and sound reproduction. The mentioned photographic gymnastics culminates with a batty montage near the end of the video clip of the previous movie but which is a tangential reference to the scenario. Among these slag appears a solid drama: Stan Abe as a zealous FBI agent.
