Well, here we have yet another role-reversal movie. There were many things to look at, despite the tired plot of gender inversion. However, this is not the case. In previous reviews, I think I expressed my point of view on the general decline of enjoyment for Haim films that followed in the late 1980s. This is one of these. <br /> <br /> 'Just One of the Girls' is about a high school boy (Corey Haim) trying to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school. He joins the cheerleader team and makes friends with fellow cheerleader, Marie (Nicole Eggert). Obviously, he can't keep the charade for too long. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was shit, and it wasn't even funny. But judging by most of the reviews, it seems that the fans of Alanis Morrisette or teen sex queen, Nicole Eggert, are the only ones who want to see this. If you are looking for good Haim functionality (or comedies for the role change), look no further than 1989. This is where Haim's career ended.
