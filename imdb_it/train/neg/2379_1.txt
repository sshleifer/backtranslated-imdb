I admit I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and she has done a mission to see all the movies she has been in (unfortunately it includes the horrible films Batman and Robin, The Avengers) and this. <br /> <br /> this must be considered the worst movie I've ever seen. (yes, it is even lower than The Avengers). everyone seems lost and is inconsistent beyond imagination. <br /> <br /> even if you think Uma is a goddess like me, PLEASE don't be subjected to this movie. you would hate yourself the next morning for this.
