There is a bit of a spoiler below, which could ruin the surprise of the ONLY unexpected and really funny scene in this movie. There is also information on the first film in this series. <br /> <br /> I took this movie on DVD, which someone gave to my roommate. It was a set together with the first movie in the "Blind Dead" series. <br /> <br /> This film was certainly much worse than the first, "La Noche del Terrore Ciego". Furthermore, many of the features of the first film have been changed significantly. For the start, the film was nicknamed in English (the first was subtitled), which I tend to find distracting. <br /> <br /> The concept behind the series is that in the distant past a local branch of the Knights Templar was involved in odious and secret rituals. After the discovery of these crimes, the local peasants put the Templars to death so that their eyes can no longer be used, preventing them from returning from hell to demand their revenge. We then move on to modern times where, due to some event, the Templars arise from the dead to demand their revenge on the villagers whose ancestors messed them up in the first place. Of course, since the undead knights have no eyes, they can find their victims only when they make a sort of noise. <br /> <br /> The Templars were a secret order, dating back to the 12th century, which came out of the Crusades. They had only been present for about 150 years, before being suppressed in the early 1300s by the Pope and others. Because they were secret, there were always rumors about their ceremonies, especially initiation. Also, because of the way society was organized, you didn't necessarily have church officials supervising things, which meant they didn't have an inner man when things overheated. And, due to the nature of their trials, they were tortured into confessions. The order was stronger in France, but existed in Portugal and Spain, where the films take place. <br /> <br /> Where the first film had a virginal sacrifice and knights who drank blood directly from the virgin's body (chest strokes here, of course, this is a horror movie after all), and then, once that the knights come back to life, attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood; in this sequel, everything disappears. You still have the same scene (redone, not the same footage) of them sacrificing the virgin, but they drain the blood into a bowl and drink from it. So when they come back, they just frame people with their swords or claw people to death, which I have to say is a much less effective means of disturbing the public. There is also a problem over time: in the first film the dating is much closer to the Templars, where they are now saying that it is the 500th anniversary of the peasants who burn these guys at the stake, who date back to around 1473. And the way that the Templars lose their eyes is much less interesting. In the first, they got caught by crows. Now they are simply burned, and in a rather ridiculous way. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and maybe it was just me, but there seems to be a lot of people in the first movie that reappears in this movie (despite having died). It is not really a problem, since the film is completely different and is not a continuation in the sense of a continuation, but not at all strange. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film is the rich man who uses a child to distract the undead while taking a break for the jeep. The child's father had already been sucked into this rich man in an attempt to take the jeep, so he went out and told her to find his father. It comes out of nowhere and is easily the most entertaining scene in the film. Of course, because the child does not die at this point is beyond me, and disappointed by horror fans. <br /> <br /> I could never recommend this movie to anyone. It's not so bad that it becomes fun, so it ends up being a mediocre horror movie. Most of the film has several people holed up in a church, each making various attempts to make it on their own to escape the blind dead around them. When the film ends, you are not surprised at all by the result; in fact, quite disappointed. If you are interested in the novelty of watching a Spanish horror film, watch the first film, which has at least some innovative ideas and unexpected results.
