Watching Tom Hanks as a hit man for the Irish mafia is a bit like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serial rapist that just doesn't work. I really had trouble accepting it. I don't think Tom can't act, but I may have followed his career with Mazes and Monsters, but for some reason this fell for me. Maybe because I'm a fan of the graphic novel and is likely to look like a fanboy (the only life form below a fanboy is a cockroach). The film as a whole is not successful for me. The Jude Law additions, and the subtraction all the rest made me feel cold and more than a little disappointed. I was expecting a great crime film more in the wake of Bonnie and Clyde Mendes took all his heart out of history and left us with nothing but bare bones. There are things that like this movie, but the cinematography is breathtaking and fills the screen with beautiful images Paul Newman is excellent as usual and I really liked the score, but Tom as "the angel of death" Sullivan was completely flat .
