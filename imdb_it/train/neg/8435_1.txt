Very disappointing film. In the end I didn't care about any of the characters anymore. I liked seeing Ving Rhames in a very small part, and William Macy was as good as ever, but it's not worth watching. It starts strong and continues to weaken more and more. The insomniacs will appreciate how confident I am that they will put them to sleep.
