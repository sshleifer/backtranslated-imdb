This is a great story and it was only the beginning of equality in the United States. (We are still working on this as well.) However, although this is true, it is still a movie and this is a movie site. I realize that independent films find it difficult to find good actors, but wow. The only one, even mediocre, is the excellent Ossie Davis. But he too could not compensate for all the actors (including the one who played him as a young man) acting absolutely atrocious. Assuming the script was terribly clich√©, but even then you have to take decent actors! I would not recommend it to anyone because it is so badly done in every category. Read some books on the true history of the United States Mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve.
