This could be the worst movie I will see if I live up to 100 years. I think a group of first grade students could have invented better lines as a class project. I am more stupid to have seen it, and God pity the souls who have been paid to produce this film. <br /> <br /> And after finally turning it off, I really had the urge to throw up. <Br /> <br /> No one had an idea of ​​photography when he did it. No one had the slightest idea of ​​acting. No one had the slightest idea of ​​anything. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that F / X shows this shit on some occasions. The only time I saw him was on one of the Starz! channels - not even the main one. And it was about 3:00 to that.
