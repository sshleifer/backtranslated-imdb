Believe it or not, I have my DVD copy of this "movie" that I bought at Walgreens for a big and big dollar. I'm still not sure if it was a good dollar or a foolishly wasted dollar. <br /> <br /> Surprising set designs and costumes. Many efforts and thoughts have apparently been made. The sets are very Mexican in stylization. I liked them very much. And Santa is awesome. One of the most impressive Santas on the move. <br /> <br /> I am guessing the original intent and the purpose of this film was to be something uplifting and cheerful for an audience of children. But, somehow, it is rather unbalanced. In fact, I was amazed how unbalanced he is. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is the English dubbing that makes it so unbalanced and bizarre. One of the reasons I prefer to try films in the original language have been created and the use of English subtitles as dubbing often gives an involuntary oddity. The children's voices have at least been nicknamed with real voices for children compared to women who pretend to be children, which tends to seem very, very strange. <br /> <br /> Did you know that the demons of hell spend their free time dancing while doing ballet in their longjohns? You did not? Me neither until I saw this movie. You learn something new every day. <br /> <br /> Is it really worth watching this movie? Now this is a problem. I cannot conscientiously recommend it to anyone as it is rather disturbing in its bizarre way. Yet, its involuntary oddity is what is worth looking at. You decide what you will do. I don't know ... for myself, it made me feel uncomfortable seeing the demons constantly doing cutesy ballet moves. Now, it's just wrong ...
