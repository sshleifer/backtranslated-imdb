Another case of a worthy DVD case that betrays the shot-on-video quality of the film. <br /> <br /> It wasn't that bad. Rochon does a useful and damn job! the cast is beautiful. I've never seen many muscular guys hanging out together on a regular basis. This movie really wanted you to think that Rochon was the murderer, but he didn't have to be. My biggest problem with the film was that in the end I didn't care much about who the killer was, and the real killer made little sense, since it was child's play and the filmmakers were thinking 'ah, it wasn't betcha you see that come, windy! "Yes, there were errors of continuity (mainly with Ms Rochon's evolving wardrobe), but for an independent slogan it is not so bad. I was pretty sure that in the beginning it was just a subtly veiled excuse for the topless girls, but that was just a trick. The dialogue was overly thoughtful and painful at times. <br /> <br /> I simply don't have high expectations of this, and it won't be so bad. Lloyd Kaufman is wonderfully underrated.
