I wish I could give this movie a zero. Effects and acting The only reason to see this movie is that you can see how ugly it is. Let's start with the child who plays Brian. What a geek! I couldn't believe the mullets! Then there was talking alone. I guess they couldn't just make the movie quiet, but anyway. Of course they also had to have thin skin, not something I wanted to see. But Jared did a great job compared to the special effects department. Everything from bear to arrest was something I could do on my own, and better. I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen has anything to do with the production, since the film was not even called Hatchet. Finally, I don't think the writer has ever read the book, since nothing was the same. I think the book was great, but this movie smelled like a smelly goat!
