No, I've never seen anyone from the "Santa Slasher" series, meaning "Silent Night, Deadly Night", the original "Black Christmas" or this, "Christmas Evil". I heard all about their reputation, or, MADS (Mothers Against Deranged Santas.) I thought I would rent this as I heard it appear as a reference on a "Fat Guys At the Movies" segment. /> <br /> Mothers should be against, but not for the "killer" ooooohhhh Santa, but for the fact that this movie was just crap. Boring, for a long time ?? even just 92 minutes, sucks. <br /> <br /> The boy sees Santa Claus descend into the fireplace in 1947, deliver presents, eat something and miraculously, float on the fireplace. The boy goes to bed, but returns to the living room to see mom and Santa Claus (somehow) wearing it. Apparently this messed up that guy for the rest of his life, even though the scene was just as smoky as when Ralphie's father got the "Lamp from the Leg" in "A Christmas Story". He was so disturbed, he went to the attic and, well cut his hand. <br /> <br /> Fast forward to the future! Now, it's 1980 and the messed-up guy works in a toy factory. We have the feeling that she's a little crazy, and she's chasing both children and parents alike. Who's bad, who's cute, blah blah. It takes a good two-thirds of the film to finally make it pop ?? as if this were not prefigured by the first frame. NO FILM should last long. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that this film had its tension, but only because I expected him to do something, something to anyone. When he finally does, well, he punishes "who's bad", he's graphic like a "Garbage Pail Kid" card. And I didn't mention the WTF finale. I think it was a metaphor, but in reality it is as strange as the rest of the film. (Take the brother who is upset that his brother is killing, and his solution is ... to kill.) Don't open this mess, not even on Christmas Eve or evil. Once again, I did not see the other "Santa-Slashers", but this sucked badly. He accumulated suspense because of the nature of the film and never once delivered a decent gift.
