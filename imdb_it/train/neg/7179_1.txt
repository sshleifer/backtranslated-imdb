No matter how good his "message" means - this film is a terrible fuss - horrible acting, lame chamber work - I don't know why Carr agreed to try to bring out a stutter - it's bad. Watch the extras on the DVD and the way it has a camera to follow it, it absorbs it: it loves to be the center of attention. He is a bad actor - another arrogant filmmaker reminds me - Eric Schaffer. Some like Carr showed this film to the city's youth centers and New Age churches - where damaged people seek reinforcements and attention talk about the way the film touched them and maybe did - but like a movie itself is choppy, predictable and sappy.
