Of course, he had some of the ingredients of a good movie. The plot is good, albeit a bit bland and the acting was pretty good although I didn't understand why Olivia d'Abo had an Australian accent so pronounced if his character should have been raised in the United States. My biggest problem, however, was with the wardrobe. As a rule, the average American is considered a misfit apprentice from any self-respecting European, but this was beyond. Anna's color combinations were pretty awful !! And that potato excuse, sad excuse for a coat he wore throughout the film, blew me up in the hives. I suppose the idea was to be as realistic as possible (how many school teachers go around in Prada?) But simple does not mean absolutely lack of taste. A word to the wise ...
