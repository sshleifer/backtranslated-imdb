I went to see this movie just to see what it was, and I was disappointed how surprised he was to get 6 (?) Oscars and 7.9 on IMDb from today. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Bigelow should be the luckiest director ever to win the best image and Oscar's best director for this really bad movie and wonder why? Has the totally unrealistic plot of the "bombing" of the "cowboy bomb" meant anything to someone I haven't seen? Because I kept having the mental image that this movie was a remake of an old bad Western movie about a cowboy doing "brave actions" in the wild Wild West infected by "bad" Red Indians; but only that this time it was set in a different scenario? Was he given the Oscars because the director was a former James Cameron, and he made a good (gossiping) story for everyday television programs? Or was it some kind of Emperor's Clothes syndrome - where most people realized that it was rubbish, but couldn't say because the others didn't seem to say it out loud? <br /> <br /> And finally what was with that sniper scene in which they showed the cartridge case coming down in high resolution-super-slow-mo as to convey a 'deep message' or something like that? Something along the lines of "EOD, the good snipers suddenly make a hit and they will always have the dirty terrorists"? Was it just me feeling like there were so many pieces here and there in the film squeezed out for no apparent reason? And can you get the Oscars for editing and directing for this ?? <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this yet, don't waste your money on tickets. Wait till they do it on TV in a few years. You won't miss much.
