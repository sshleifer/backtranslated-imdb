This is a nice little paranormal show, although it seems that Art Bell and his people have figured out how to carve out a career from the attitude that Carl Kolchak has exemplified. Of course there probably wouldn't be an X-File if this show hadn't prepared this audience for so well. Darren McGavin is not exactly the super-heroic type but he is a fairly plausible guy to accomplish heroic deeds. Watch his work on some of those old Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Here is the main attraction, there does not seem to be a girlfriend or a wife who is a distraction. In reality there is not a lot of sex appeal for the show. Something I'm noticing is that the rhythm isn't really full of suspense in a typical way. There is a lot of disposable humor in this show. Sometimes it's just pokey to get to the climax. There is a discussion from this show that goes up to the MAD MEN show in terms of style. Not that David Chase is writing Mad Men, but the people who worked with him on The Sopranos have certainly emulated and inherited his serious-comic tone.
