The book is fantastic, this film is not. There is no reason why this film could not embrace a futuristic technological vision of the book. Hell, the total recall was released a few years later and this did a good job, even though an orange watch produced in the 1970s did a good job trying to create a futuristic world. The squalid German expressionistic colors, the black-and-white movie with vision screens, there is no reason for this approach when the film was made in 1984. The main character is in a white-collar writing job, but he dresses as works with oil and grease in a garage. This film decides to adopt a fake-communist approach to set the design, the atmosphere and the theme, but the novel has not necessarily dictated a communist, cult-humble-worker theme itself. This book needs to be adapted in a modern context as this book is more relevant today than ever. I couldn't watch more than 20 minutes of this shit. The soundtrack is annoying, the lack of foresight is annoying, this film seems to have been made to deny a sense of realism or credibility when this is exactly what is needed to beat the messages of the novel to the viewer.
