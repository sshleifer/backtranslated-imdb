This collection really sucks! <br /> <br /> I rented it, thinking that I would really enjoy a good fight. The man is sucked! Fast and eye-catching cuts, an extremely annoying speaker, and clashes with oneself have been heavily modified and shortened (I think mainly of the fight of Jet Li in Fists of the Legend and the fight of Jackie Chan of the drunk master 2). > <br /> And what is the deal with those fighters on the street ?! What's so cool about it? I've seen more interesting fights on Martial Law! <br /> <br /> This stupid collection of cuts for stupid people. <br /> <br /> Never buy this movie! Don't encourage people who made this shit to do more than this shit! <br /> <br /> Instead, go buy the movies that the fights came from and the battle in their unconditional glory!
