LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And is he the star? I should have known better than renting EDISON FORCE. In fact, I knew better. But in a moment of absolute weakness, I rented this STV. When you have important names like Freeman and Spacey in an STV, you know it's one of two things: an indie or a dog. Like on the sat-up shelf. What did he do And rightly. The plot as such involves a team of corrupt assassins at MAGNUM FORCE, and the "journalist" Timberlake is the only one brave enough to discover them. He is targeted for his efforts - or maybe I should say for his horrible acting. I turned it off after one of the villains was hit in the forehead and still had the foresight to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing. Just awful. The real suggestion of how bad this film is is to see Freeman on the cover and throughout the film with an unruly beard, which looks like nothing like a hobo. You only know that the director was not in control. Freeman is clearly staggering.
