I was very excited when this series was first presented in 2005. The premise was very simple and captivating: each episode would be a one-hour mini film directed by a famous famous horror director. Then when I finally looked at them it was a bit disappointing. Some good episodes emerged from that first season, but all in all it was a mixed bag. I attributed it to the learning curve, and I imagined that the second season would be much better. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was in a shock. At least the first season had some good stories here and there. Season 2 (with the exception of "The Black Cat" with the excellent Jeffrey Combs) was a total and total loss for me. The "Sounds Like" episode could be the worst thing I've seen on TV in the last 10 years, and most of the other episodes aren't much better. I really hope that season 3 will change this around next year, but I'm not holding my breath.
