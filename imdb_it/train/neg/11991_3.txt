- Bad Stuff: this movie is a real shit. Bad stunts for one thing, they seemed so fake that I thought it was "The Twilight Zone". Flashbacks are practically useless. A part of the film that thinks bringing his anger to a window will make his life better. I want to meet the casting director and if he was tall because the acting, even from adults, was horrible. A scene of kisses in this film has even been sucked. This film killed the book. The book was great. I absolutely don't recommend this movie. Not even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> - Good Stuff: I don't know what I can really say. There are some parts of suspense that keep you going, but they are quickly knocked down by bad acrobatic actions and acting. <br /> <br /> - My Verdict: Do not watch.
