A film without conscience. Drifter agrees to kill a man for a mobster for money. Then they cross it. In the meantime he falls in love with the dead man's wife and, without her knowing he is the murderer, he moves in with her. Then "casually" kills her when she finds out. Then, in a kind of WALKING TALL heroism, he took revenge on the mafiosi who crossed him. The first problem is that, by accepting to take on the murder with an assault assignment, the vagabond loses all sense of sympathy, dignity and heroism. We cannot accept any kindness in him and as a result the rest has no moral center. We can't worry about that kind of guy. And his wife (played by Kari Wuhrer, the sheriff of EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS), a high-class lady who carries out a homeless mission, also loses a certain degree of sympathy by jumping into bed with the homeless tramp (despite her obviously weakened after her husband's death). And when do you find out you're the boy ?? what does she do? He locks it inside the house (as if ALL the houses had locks that can't be opened by INSIDE) with her and proceeds to scold him. Stoo-pid. George Wendt, however, is terrifying in the role of a robust hooligan. Director Stuart Gordon went much better with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
