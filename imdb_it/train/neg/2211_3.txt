Hahahaha !!!!!! Funny, which sums up this film in a word. How disgusting this "thing" was, since it could kill me to use the word film!?!?! I hope that the director, writer and producer did not intend to be good for this, because he certainly didn't! A scientist turned his son into a hammerhead shark, and the shark killed a group of people whom the scientist had invited to the island !!! Oh my Gooooooodddd !!!! I hate this movie so much that when I watched it I was laughing at all the serious parts, because they were so squalid and unprofessional ... and they couldn't make the shark more unrealistic, even though this "thing" has a little more budget big compared to most low budget movies. All I have to say is watch this movie waiting to laugh at all the bad recitations, and stupid dialect, because if you expect a good movie it's you I'll be very disappointed.
