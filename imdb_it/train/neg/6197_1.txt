At the end of the film, I just asked myself: "Is this the worst film I've ever seen or is it the worst film I've ever seen?" And the answer is ... Actually, after seeing this movie and thinking a little about its meaning, you can't find any meaning and you can only remember the two rape scenes, which are incredibly brutal and useless. It seems to me that the director has tried to push this question into the mind of the crowd: "What are these crimes compared to the horror of war and extermination?" because I noticed that the two terrible scenes are directly linked to the war and its horrors (during the first scene you can here the girl who is raped screaming and at the same time hear one of President Bush's speeches about the need to start a war with the Iraq and in the second scene, the images of the three criminals who put a sword in a woman's vagina, are directly followed by archive images of World War II, but in reality I could not really think of the relative gravity of with these two different types of expression of human horror, being over I was too shocked by what I had just seen and heard (sorry for bad English)
