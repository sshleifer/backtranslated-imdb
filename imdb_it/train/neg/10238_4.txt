This film looked like it was good at first, but never matched its expectations. The director is talented and has good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical of Asian directors), but he doesn't know how to create or tell a good story to follow. The story was fragmented and seemed to go in all directions throughout the film, without ever finding a solid, explicable and interesting point of view. Basically, the film does not correspond to the explanations of the press releases. The acting was however very good. All the actors performed well, and Jude Law was as exceptional as he always is. Too bad he chose to make such a weak film.
