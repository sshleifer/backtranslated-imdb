This film had all the elements to be a brilliant and brilliant comedy, but for some reason it took the path of stupidity. Maybe he didn't really know who his audience was: but it's not the film of a man given the cast and the plot, but he's too lousy and stupid to appeal to women. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Legally Blonde and its sequel, then this is like the perplexing terrible sequel. Great actors like Luke Wilson should expect better material. Even Jessica Simpson could have handled a lot more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller languish in more stupid than amusing secondary roles. <br /> <br /> Many things in this film have been painted by numbers, various uber-clich√© montages, last-minute misunderstanding ", even the chaos of children's party. This suggests only a lazy scriptwriting. <br /> <br /> It should be possible to find this movie entertaining if you don't take it seriously, but it's a way of doing it so sensational that you may feel frustrated and increasingly disappointed as the scenes go by.
