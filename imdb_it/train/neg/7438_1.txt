This film is a waste of time, the plot is terrible, the dialogue is horrible. <br /> <br /> Acting is OK, but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with. Even photography and some of the special effects are OK, but again there is nothing interesting about this movie to watch. There is no logical progression in history, the plot is an absurdity. It's not even scary. For a film to be scary, there must be at least a small element of credibility. This film has no credibility. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the movie. Each character is superficial and has no personality. <br /> <br /> Most special effects and make-up are both bad, or at best mediocre. I hope you read this and don't waste time in this movie unless you are curious to see a totally horrible movie.
