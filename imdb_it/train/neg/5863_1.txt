I really can't believe this movie is in the worst edition of IMDB 250, it's absolutely terrible. When I saw it originally I remember talking about it in a university class and two other people had also seen it. We all told the other members of the class not to see him because he was so horrible. When they were finished, some others wanted to see him just because they couldn't believe that nothing was as bad as we were saying. Don't be like them, pass this. I'm sure everyone involved in this movie would prefer that I never see them in this movie.
