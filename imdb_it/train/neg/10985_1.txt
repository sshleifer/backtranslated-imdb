I don't know what Margaret Atwood thought to allow this film to have the same name as her book. I've always been a big fan of The Robber Bride and I was so happy to know that there was a film in the works. I am aware that the translation of a book into a film is not perfect, but this film was the worst ever. The women's names are correct and some of the background is correct but that's all. I feel like I've lost a good part of my time trying to get past this movie. This really should have been a mini series to tell the story the way it was written. <br /> <br /> The actors of Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia were well chosen although at first I was skeptical about Mary-Louise Parker. I just hope they had a better script to work with, because this has absolutely nothing to do with the book.
