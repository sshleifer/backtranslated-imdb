it's incredible! Fidani (who was also a spiritist) was one of the cheapest directors in the world. This film has stolen the original title of "Duck you sucker!" Di Leone but tells the boring story of an agent of Pinkerton against the murderer "Head of Iron" (the unlikely Gordon Mitchell, a stuntman). Everything is poor and crazy in these films filmed in the dear landscapes of Lazio. The story is ugly and crazy at the same time. Fidani was not capable and naive at the same time. A kind of crazy illogical thing happened in the story (like the discussion in the Sheriff's house and the demented aspect of Butch Cassidy!?!?!?!?!? Yes, precisely Butch Cassidy, who is portrayed as an idiot). Terribles nuit americaine, absurd attitudes, illogical plot, bad acting and a fleeting appearance by one of the most awarded anchorman in the history of Italian television, Renzo Arbore. Ah, of course: Klaus Kinski. Yes it's big and terrible, but I'm sure there was only for money and to play with iron horses) 2 out of 10 but ... DON'T MISS !!!!!
