Charles Bronson continued his collapse in the 1980s with what could be his worst film of the decade, if ever. In it he plays a detective who does his best to track down a pimp who has kidnapped an Asian girl and who is currently selling it to the highest bidder. It's a shameful attempt at action and it's probably the most depressing movie ever made. Many people consider the sequel to Death Wish to be Bronson's worst movies. Death Wish sequels were not great films, but in most cases they were done competently and very watchable. However, Kinjite is an absolutely boring thriller, punctuated by petty racism and child molestation. It is really a reformable film and all this is compounded by the fact that it tries to preach a "Justice and Justice" mentality that is too exaggerated to really say anything. In fact the film begins with the minor sex interrupted by Bronson and then anally raping the pedophile with a dildo. I watched the Chicago theater, panting from the embarrassment of this scene, only to gasp for the embarrassment of the pimp who raped the girl in this movie. It has no other purpose than to exploit and in reality the film was not written well enough to overcome the level of exploitation and provide something that would work. Bronson seems more into things, but clearly this is too repugnant to save. I want to emphasize that I think Charles Bronson is the coolest actor ever, but this effort is ultimately his worst. Also the action sequences are scarce. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * on 4- (Terrible)
