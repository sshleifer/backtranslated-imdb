But I passed it. For me, it seemed that even the author of the book favored Caroline. I felt so sorry for the character Louise, and she was constantly confronted with Esau which was bad, I just felt that the confrontation was a bit harsh and unrealistic. Really, the film was bad. I wouldn't really see it unless you're ready for a big disappointment.
