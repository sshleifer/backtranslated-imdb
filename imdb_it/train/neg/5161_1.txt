My life is about saving animals. I volunteer with a cat rescue organization. I'm a vegetarian because I couldn't kill an animal even to support my life. I can't even kill a spider, I put it outdoors. The scene in which the children throw stones at the bird until it dies, with Sooner participating in an attempt to be accepted by the other children, made me sick and persecuted me since then. It simply convinces me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance. The ending - adoptive parents adopt Sooner - does not redeem the representation of animal cruelty. Why would anyone want their children to see this movie?
