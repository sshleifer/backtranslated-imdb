Don't see this movie if you appreciate your mind. At the end of our collective vision, my friends and I estimated that each of us lost 5% of our brain during his course. The only person involved in his accomplishment who was not clinically mad was the production designer. <br /> <br /> Most films leave a bad taste in the mouth. I realize now that instead of a feeling of repulsion, this film has generated a deep hatred within me. I hate this movie so much, a lot. <br /> <br /> Some might say that this film is not meant to be taken seriously. If only he didn't take himself seriously. But it does. The plot is a superheated version of the Blade Runner universe that blends into the cheap rubber clothes so widespread in bad dinosaur movies. Dialogue is not only puerile and insignificant, but often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg is not even trying, but George Newbern as Theodore Rex's voice is like the nails of the soul. And if his Juliet Landua with her again on British accent or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as the blustering commissioner, you will sink into an ever increasing sense of disbelief and disenchantment. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film only to anyone who wants to see the depths of stupidity that humanity can fall into.
