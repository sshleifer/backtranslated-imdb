Well, did they have to start? This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever paid good money to see. I don't want to comment on the story itself, it's a wonderful classic, but here it looks like a soap opera. To begin with, the acting, with the exception of Eric Bana, is the quality of the soap opera. I've always been a Brad Pitt fan, but every actor in The Bold and the Beautiful makes him feel ashamed. The action of the camera does not help either. As he lingers over him when he thinks, he takes me back to Brooke Forrester's days in the lab! Peter O'Toole has had a bad plastic surgery, or he desperately needs it. Anyway, it looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And to finish my comments, Diane Kruger is a pretty girl, but she's certainly not Helen from Troy. Peterson should have preferred Saffron Burrows for the role, as Elizabeth Taylor would have been rather annoyed.
