I saw him recently with my wife and I found out that it's better than Caine believes, even though he's not a great cop. The greatest British film actor does not seem too interested in this role, which is a shame because he could have increased it with more conviction in his way of playing. Rex Harrison seems even less annoyed, perhaps not surprisingly, since his character is written very badly. William Holden is better, but his time on the screen is fleeting and, again, his character is not well scripted. <br /> <br /> Beverly Johnson is such a beautiful woman as I've never seen her, but she has very little to do, the film could have made a lot of money by focusing more on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but basically interpreting a comic character who does not respect the serious tone of the film. The music is poor and Omar Sharif makes one of his many meaningless cameos (his career has been based on this for decades now). Richard Fleischer must be blamed for not directing this more effectively, he was an exasperatingly unpredictable director, and this is one of his weakest films.
