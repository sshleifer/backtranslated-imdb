I read the book and the book was fascinating. <br /> <br /> This film, its direction, screenplay and acting were totally unbearable. I scrupled for the lack of a script that could not follow the novel, a novel that has all the action, simplicity and courage to illustrate the temerity of a great story based on facts. <br /> <br /> I can see why this film was not released to the public in most cities. I would never recommend this movie to anyone who knows it. <br /> <br /> Simply, one of the worst adaptations I've seen has turned into a less exploratory plot of heaven on earth. <br /> <br /> Cinematography really was the only attraction. But how could he fail when shot in a country as beautiful as Peru. <br /> <br /> For potential spectators, don't waste time or energy on this flop.
