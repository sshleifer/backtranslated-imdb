You know you're in trouble when the initial narrative basically tells you who survives. Everything goes downhill from there. Unnecessary "Matrix" bullet-proof camera work. Unnecessary cuts to video game shooting. Old crisp sea captains and extravagant sailors. Ravers who become skilled fighters in the blink of an eye. Zombies are also boring. <br /> <br /> I was hoping at least one zombie movie "so bad is good", but this is "so bad that those involved in its creation should be excluded from making a film again". <br /> <br />
