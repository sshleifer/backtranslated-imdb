I took it for 50 cents at the flea market, it was pretty excited. <br /> <br /> I found it fascinating for about 15 minutes, then only repetitive and boring. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Mick and the band in the prime of life, I wish there wasn't so much dubbing for dialogue, so I could hear what there is to say and play. <br /> <br /> The skits are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple, like Monty Python spelled wrong on acid. I spent more time looking at the last drops in England in the 1960s than at what was actually happening in silly scenes. <br /> <br /> This film is a good reminder that times really change, and what was important quickly became a simple fool. Good song, but now it has been played to death by this DVD.
