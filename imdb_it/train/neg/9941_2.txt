I really mean. This will not help the Australian film industry to make this kind of film without values ​​of any kind. Ok, if you're a bully and you have nothing better to do, then maybe. I think filmmakers here should try to show the rest of the world what great talented people we have, and this is not the vehicle to do it. Come on now, this movie is just tacky.
