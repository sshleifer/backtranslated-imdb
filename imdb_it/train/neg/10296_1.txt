It was probably just my DVD --- but I wouldn't recommend anyone trying to watch this image on a DVD. <br /> <br /> I had to increase the volume of my TV to the maximum level possible, in order to hear about 80% of the dialogue. Some of the speeches still remained sub-audible. If you come from Scotland, you may have a chance, even a thin one. <br /> <br /> The voices of the Peoples have been suffocated by almost all the environmental sounds, including discarding a package, some steps, even snorting with a cigarette. <br /> <br /> With the volume reached at a level where voices can be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will call the police when the scene changes in a noisy environment, like a disco. And that you will hurt yourself by diving towards the remote control to reduce it backwards. <br /> <br /> There is art and art, even in the field of audio mixing. But this effort, in time of war, would have met the international criteria to be classified as an atrocity. <br /> <br /> After about half an hour, I gave up, not having seen anything else redeem in the picture, either.
