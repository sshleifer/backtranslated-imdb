Warner Bros. made many poppers in the 1930s and most of them are fast, cheap and very fun. I really like how the studio has exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life. This is one of the few Warner melodramas that simply doesn't work. Edward G. Robinson plays a ruthless newspaper editor who revives the twenty-year history of a murderer with tragic consequences. Robinson gives a lively performance but is surrounded by actors who don't cut mustard. H.B. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the bad acting of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the second door really hurts the movie. Starr is particularly bad during his great dramatic scene towards the end of the film. Furthermore, the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of Hollywood pre-code. The direction of LeRoy is full of innovative visual touches, but fails to overcome bad acting and unintentionally funny situations. The work with Sol Polito's camera is strong. Somehow, this piece by dreck got an Oscar nomination for best film (in a year that gave us "M", "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
