"Don't worry about watching this movie" would be better advice if you like Marilyn Monroe in her other roles. This was a huge disappointment considering the excellent cast, not just Marilyn. <br /> <br /> The story was nothing, certainly nothing like the one described on the VHS box, of course. There was simply no suspense, precious excitement and too many boring points, many of them trying to show why "Nellie" (Monroe) was so messed up. This was not a good role for Monroe, although I didn't need to see this character to know he could act. "Some Like It Hot" alone was a pretty good test for me. But this role didn't suit her and it's no surprise that it wasn't one of her most popular films. <br /> <br /> It is also a pity that a film had the waste of the talent of actors like Richard Widmark, Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran and others. <br /> <br /> Summary: it's not fun and entertainment is the name of the game.
