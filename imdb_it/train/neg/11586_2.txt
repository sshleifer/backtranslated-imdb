A nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. There is no way to escape it. I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best horror character ever. But even if I'm a fan I can't help but see this film is mediocre. <br /> <br /> There is not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters. They had just given up by now. They don't even try. I'm obviously manufacturing, hoping for some easier dollars. <br /> <br /> History does not attract your attention. It is so simple that it is almost absent. <br /> <br /> Alice, a survivor of the fourth part is now pregnant. Freddy is returning to the child's dreams. At the beginning we learn that to stop him Alice has to find her mother. And this is all. <br /> <br /> The story progresses slowly as there is so little plot which means it gets rather boring after a few minutes of wrong dialogues and horrible acting. In fact this is the only scary thing, acting, since the deaths are not even slightly fresh. <br /> <br /> The characters are so uninteresting that they couldn't care less for them. <br /> <br /> Girls are less attractive as possible. The whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theater group. I've seen better actors in school games. It's really embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wilcox still manages to bring some class to this. She is beautiful, sexy and has a certain talent. But the material didn't make it shine. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Stephen Hopkins' work is by no means close to the brilliant direction of Renny Harlin in Dream Master. Try some imaginative shots towards the end, but the tension that Harlin and Craven have created so well in the previous films is nowhere. <br /> <br /> The Dream Child is just another imaginative sequel. It's the kind of movie that gives the horror series a bad name. <br /> <br /> The end for a scary time Freddy. It is too sad to see it now. A clown who is not funny. A bad joke. Goodbye Freddy.
