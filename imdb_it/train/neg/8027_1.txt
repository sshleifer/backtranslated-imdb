I saw this movie. End. And it wasn't easy. It's so boring, badly played and in almost every detail stolen from "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" that you can't believe the producers take this seriously. Even more difficult to believe, it's how this "product" arrived on VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to watch a horror movie, look at "Scream", but if you want to laugh loud and have fun, watching some guys running through the woods shouting at each other and showing their incapacity, looking at the dark area.
