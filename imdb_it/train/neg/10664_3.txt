Burt Reynolds, a very tired man, plays a mercenary who fights his former employers for a contraption that these non-heroes plan to sell to "Iranians". The unreliable video of the producers of "Silk Stalkings" offers some decent action videos and a large number of inept "dramas" ... a lack of logic and a really terrible dialogue are the defining aspects, even if the twists and turns the definitive slips may have been an elegant end to a better film. Burt still has the presence, although it also means that he notices more when he mutters insulting "one-liner".
