I love Columbo and I've seen more or less all the episodes, but this is without doubt the worst of all. An incredibly boring, useless, confused, tangled swallowed pile that wastes both the audience's time and the vision and acting talents of an extraordinarily bored Peter Falk. The "plot", as it is, seems to have been invented as soon as the film goes on with the slightest hint of the ingredients to the formula that made the show such a brilliant success. Part of the process that I found extremely baffling (or perhaps annoying) was the presentation of Peter Falk's character to the wedding guests as "Lt" Columbo. If the producers insist on keeping Columbo's name secret, why couldn't they omit this sentence altogether because it seems ridiculous? As I said, this is the hole and all the real Columbo fans would do well to avoid it like the plague.
