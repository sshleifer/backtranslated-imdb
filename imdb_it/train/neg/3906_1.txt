I managed to sneak away one evening and go to the cinema to see this, thinking I was expecting a surprise. Boy, I was wrong. Considering the talent involved, this must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Everyone in it was uncomfortable, and I find it incredible to read on this site that there are people out there that they really liked.
