Eytan Fox, while generally relying on the apologist side of Israeli politics, has made several interesting films in the past such as "Walk on Water" and the simply wonderful film "Yossi & Jagger". In "The Bubble", however, he took this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme. <br /> <br /> Far from giving this film a standing ovation, the people at the screening in which I participated in silence got up and left. I too went away quietly, fuming with rage for such a ridiculously one-sided film that translates self-preservation as racist bullying and racist bullying (and terrorism) as outbursts of justified anger; which implies that the Arabs are so offended by the bad Israelis that they react angrily to a constant stream of unilateral Israeli aggression against them, and that therefore they should not be held responsible for their actions. <br /> <br /> This film was not worth the money I paid for the ticket (in fact, I was thinking of asking for my money back), and it was basically an Israeli monkey of the Palestinian film "Paradise Now". If you want to be an anti-Israeli, then look at this film by all means, as it justifies precisely this belief system. The fact that this film was made by an Israeli director and, worse still, by such a talented Israeli director, is a real shame. In fact, just as Israel may be surprised to be considered a pariah state when the Israelis themselves make such anti-Israeli propaganda, the beggars' belief. <br /> <br /> What a shameful and horrible little movie!
