I saw Chan Is Missing when it came out, about four years after moving from San Francisco to New York. Perhaps it was the prospect of some years later, but this film seemed to capture the essence of the city and its people better than anything I had ever seen (it still is). It focuses on a particular community - the Chinese one - but that's okay, because a lot of the soul of the city is refracted through settings, faces and perhaps the voices of the characters. <br /> <br /> is not the San Francisco of tourists. The settings are humble and everyday: a taxi, the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant, the terraced houses of the Richmond district, the small apartments of Chinatown and the offices of small businesses, the piers, an ancient center of the Philippines. This is what the city looks like from day to day to the people who live there - even now, in the era of urban renewal of Silicon Gulch. Unlike, say, of Dirty Harry (in his own way also an excellent San Francisco film), everything is shot at street level: we come to understand the points of view of the characters from the point of view that surrounds them, not from some fantasy dizzying shoot. <br /> <br /> Wang apparently filmed in B&W because he didn't have the money to do otherwise, yet one of the strongest visual elements in the film is the natural light it reaches. The often harsh and pervasive quality of sunlight is one of my closest associations with San Francisco: it seems to expose everything, bring back buildings, hills, other landmarks to scale and, in a fun way, get people through that passes through the streets seems more individual and potentially closer to you than they could in another place. Wang's photograph conveys this perfectly, and even helps the story along the points. <br /> <br /> Wang captures the language and colloquial style of Chinese and other Franciscans better than anyone else, I think. If there is something like a true "Francisco" accent, that's what you hear from the bald mediator of the medallion taxis (I think) that appears talking on the phone in a scene (listen to the way he calls the person on the other side ") ya dingaling!"). <br /> <br /> The story is moving and, despite some small missteps, it highlights its points about the desires that attract the hearts of people living in the old immigrant communities - including justified political and ethnic resentments, and small ironic amusements, which help feed them. All this is communicated with delicacy - perhaps because some interviewees think that the film becomes a meander. Not so - suffice it to say that Chan's search for the two drivers becomes a quest for something more personal. <br /> <br /> Chan Is Missing ends with a slide show of Chinatown supported by a silly novelty song from the 1930s (I guess) on San Francisco and all its crazy diversity. An American caricature, yes, but somehow not quite even in the sign.
