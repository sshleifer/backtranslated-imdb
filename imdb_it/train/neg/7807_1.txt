I chose this DVD at the Dollar Store. The DVD was on the $ 1 rack, but since it contained Michael Madsen, I thought that since I had never seen the movie, I bought it anyway. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I did not like the film. The film played more like a documentary or an advertisement for the religion than anything else. I discovered that the director's use of flashbacks didn't add to the plot. I would have preferred to see the plot in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I won't throw it away like one of the other commentators, but it might be a while before I considered watching this movie again. <br /> <br /> Who knows, since it was the film debut of Michael Madsen, perhaps it could have some archival value at some future date.
