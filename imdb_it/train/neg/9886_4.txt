This is Peter Falk's film. Period. <br /> <br /> I was 10 when this movie came out; At the time I was already a film expert. Of course neither my parents nor I saw this movie when it came out, but I was in love with the typeface of its commercials and the aura that this was an important film. Ok, 34 years later I finally saw the movie - having never seen any Cassavetes-directed film before. It's a hack, overall. Zero sense of time, editing. Gena's performance reminds me too much of Dustin Hoffman's "Rain Man" period: technically on a par but entirely monotonous. As Tom Cruise stole "Rain Man", Falk takes the cake for this movie. <br /> <br /> It bothered me with Gena's performance, actually everything - it seemed more suitable for "Awakenings" (blecch!). It's not all his fault: it's a briefcase from the first scene to the end. We never find out why ?? But the character of Falk seems real and is interpreted WONDERFULly by Falk as a seriously imperfect man. <br /> <br /> Discard at least an hour (an editor needed!), and this would have been a very interesting portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple, Cro-Magnon, the man who is struggling with a wife who does not work and yet cannot face her three children and her husband's long working hours. <br /> <br /> Rather, I remember Cassavetes for "The Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby". He would have been a better director if he had cut his own tendency to excess, as amply demonstrated with this film. <br /> <br /> Bob
