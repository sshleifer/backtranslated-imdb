I saw this film for the first time not too long on the "Essentials" series by TCM. The eye of the clich√© of the beholder has never been more appropriate. This observer has seen little of value in this. I was puzzled by the endless attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) had. Of course, Mrs. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this film her character is milder than attractive. I thought men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would more likely ignore Lucy than fall into an instant infatuation with her. In defense of Bacall, this film was made at the time of Humphrey Bogart's last illness and the weight of his deteriorated health may have affected his performance. Of course, part of this activity on Lucy 's part was to put her in contrast with Marylee' s pig, played by Dorothy Malone. The scene in which he engages in a wild and sensual dance while his father wearily scales the stairs for a fatal heart attack is by far the best scene in the film. Malone's performance surpasses the rest, although Jasper Hadley's weariness over the disappointing behavior of his two sons is brilliantly played by Robert Keith. In general, though, I should say that I'm not a big fan of melodrama. The cartoonist behavior of the characters creates a story that is too implausible for my taste.
