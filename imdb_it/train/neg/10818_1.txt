Having read the novel before seeing this film, I was hugely disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their brazen disregard for the plot. I believe that this film in no way reflects the splendor of Bronte's work, and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story. In the condensation of the film in a short interval of 2 hours, the film has lost many of the key features that make the book understandable and progressive, resulting in a somewhat nervous plot with little grounding. There is nothing to do for the romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so this looks rather blunt and unfounded as the two characters have such an infrequent interaction that you can't help but imagine that their "love "is superficial. This is such an injustice to Bronte's novel: you are not given any impression of Jane's strange boldness and audacity that draws Rochester to her, and of her arrogance that attracts Jane to him. <br /> <br /> Despite the poor scripts, I think some of the characters have been very cleverly portrayed, namely Mrs Fairfax and Grace Poole, but overall the production was poor. Given a better scripting, perhaps the film would have been more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for an exceptional production.
