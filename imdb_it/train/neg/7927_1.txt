This film is exceptional. I saw him the other day with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said it was fine, but I think it was made by RULEZZZ! I mean, it's so beautiful. Ted V. Mikels is so brave and intelligent. He made a totally different film than those terrible Hollywood movies, like Matrix and STop or my mother will shoot. It could have been better, though. I like ninjas and pirates. I also like that big talon wearing the funny guy. I think he's the coolest guy from that kind of Domino Pizza claymation. Not only does this film look really nice, like those out-of-focus movies that my dad made of my birthday when I was 6 years old. BUt tells a complex story with dozens of characters that seem totally unrelated, but all meet at the end. It is brilliant how this web is woven to make everything meet. I wish Ted V. Mikels made a sequel. But he needs more aliens. And a pirate.
