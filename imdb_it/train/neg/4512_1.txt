Having lived in Japan for several years, this film does not reflect Japanese culture and does not even come close to explaining what a geisha is. Unfortunately, a great opportunity was lacking to bring Japanese culture closer to the vast Western public and help demystify the country from which Zen, Samurai, the world of Kyoto Geisha comes from. Some of the film's most touching moments are when Americans are shown in a Japanese environment. The geisha dances were not authentic. There was too much use of Chinese music. A minor but essential detail: the correct use of incense sticks could not be seen anywhere. Sakura's scenes were almost obscenely kitsch! Interestingly, some of the Chinese actors were quite convincing as Japanese people.
