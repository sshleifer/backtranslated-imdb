This film was horrible and offensive to the viewer. Stupid scripts, bad casting, endless boredom. <br /> <br /> In the usual Hollywood tradition, the US government is shown as always evil. Hollywood idiots Communist-idiots, most of whom are as stupid as a box of stones, love to take the lone madman Eugene McCarthy and imagine him as the leader of a vast movement. The truth is that at the time he was considered a marginal character who was exploiting a legitimate concern for Soviet communists to gain political gain. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and the United States brought all those bad Nazis. Like Werner VonBraun, without which we would have no space program. In reality he loved being American and became a great resource for the country. <br /> <br /> Yet the irony is that the fools of Hollywood, an uneducated lot that lives a fantastic existence, still believe that the government should run EVERYTHING and give us everything we want. Still, this is the same government that they continually portray as an evil consumed in films like this.
