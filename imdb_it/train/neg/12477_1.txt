This is one of those movies that you and a group of friends sit around drinking beer, eating pizza and laughing. Unfortunately for me I found myself looking at this alone. My friends and I have rented a large block of films and have never been able to see this. He had to go back and I thought it was a waste not to look at him. So I did, and I was impressed by how absolutely awful this movie is. <br /> <br /> Now, I love bad movies quite a bit, and I probably would have liked this if the "hero" wasn't so absolutely disgusting. I was hoping that the whole movie would put that stupid sword down and let someone kill it! He does very few heroic things in the film. It's a sturdy, disgusting and stupid thing. It has less quality of redemption than the bad ones. And what was it with all the naked chicks? I mean, I love naked chicks as much as others, but this movie has become a bit exaggerated in that department. <br /> <br /> Well, anyway, if you love bad movies and you can stand a disgusting "hero" "then I'm sure you'll like this movie schlock.
