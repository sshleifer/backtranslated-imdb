It completely defeats me because Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a great example of his ineptitude both as a filmmaker and as an "intellectual" polemicist. It is hard to believe that Godard really believed all that Marxist and Maoist kant. Anyone with a brain half way could solve the bankruptcy of those "isms" and how many people had destroyed and continued to destroy even if Godard was making his films to support them. As a director, ask yourself: you would have boring voices off-screen by reading boring political diatribes to your audience, and then, when you can't think of anything else to do, put another voice on the first voice over, who lost his listeners after the first 100 words anyway? Brilliant, Jean-Luc! As for Godard who insists on making a film with the Rolling Stones: of course he did; it's not true? It was the only guarantee of getting such rubbish garbage in the first place: the genius of the Stones that eclipsed a political idiot with no talent and talker unleashed with a camera. The library scene was not even worthy of the worst theater theater, and it was an insult to the intelligence even of small children who used to play in it - as was easily seen. Copping-out allowing friendly critics to assert that all this shit without art was a satire on mainstream film production is nothing but a sure exit to offer those who clearly see Godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his public. Ironic that Godard's great friend, Truffaut, with Nuit Americain, made the best film about creating films ever, and Godard did the worst with Le Mepris! Incidentally, Godard did not choose the Stones track by Sympathy With the Devil. It was just the song they were working on when the "movie" started shooting at Barnes Olympic Studios.
