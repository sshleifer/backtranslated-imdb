Dialogue: stilted, cliché; Acting: hammy, cliché; Plot: predictable, cliché. <br /> <br /> What is Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski doing in this "B" garbage? Plummer was well established decades before this film was made, Kinski had masterpieces like "Tess" and "Cat People" behind her ... He must have been desperate. <br /> <br /> The bad guys all have bad accents - * bad * bad boy accent! (Especially Plummer! Where * he * learned to do "German"?) And most of them also have a grin in a bad mood. Innocent onlookers exaggerate in their panic enough to make you laugh. The bravo survives, among other things: * a 5 "throwing knife is buried deep in his shoulder - he pulls it out and a few seconds later uses his arm without any difficulty, * marines machine gun fire (I think someone did referring to a .50) to the leg that he eliminated by tying a bandage around the leg of the trousers and then he just limped; * several fists in which he supports several punches on the face besides being a skull -first in a door frame * a fall , backwards, from what appears to be the third floor, on the pavement, without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other minor inconvenience. The script has exactly 3 clever lines, the rest of the time it's all so boring and boring. <br /> <br /> OK is not bad at all, Plummer brings a certain class to his side, and he is undoubtedly the best actor in this film, very much, but he can make the rascal insensitive without resorting to the prosciu techniques As most villains use here they sell their "Ve haff vays and meance" lines with some threat, but you are always aware that you are watching Christopher Plummer play the villain role. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a terrible waste of time. Acting, as it is, is a kind of movie from the 70s. The delivery of the wooden lines meets Bruce Lee's very muffled fighting scenes, but it's not nearly as beautiful as Roger Moore 007 or a Bruce Lee movie. Do not worry
