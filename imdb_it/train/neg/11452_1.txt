If I could have voted this movie for 0, I would have it! I see a ppl on IMDb says this is the funniest movie of the year, etc. Etc. Excuse me? are you puffing LSD or ........? There is absolutely nothing funny about this movie N O T H I N G! Actually I want my 27 minutes of my life that I spent watching this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> I read someone sitting on a plane watching this movie that stopped watching after 30 minutes, I understand it perfectly, actually I watched the snakes on a plane twice instead of watching this movie one time! <br /> <br /> DO NOT watch this movie, do something else useful with your life, do the dishes, walk with the dog, hell ... everything is better than spending time watching TV while watching a hot rod.
