This movie was so terrible that it was almost good ... almost. We love musicals, but not this one. Even with the terrible sound quality, poor cinematography and many actors who can't sing or dance, Anthony Rapp managed to perform well (especially towards the end). Even the character Marjorie, a drunk lady, was pleasant to look at. <br /> <br /> The plot is very unexpected and could have been fun without a terrible song and piano cheezy music. Admirably, some of the songs (fantabulous) are quite catchy (but not in a positive sense). <br /> <br /> Open House is a fun movie to watch simply because it's horrible! We think it could be a good musical stage (with excellent actors).
