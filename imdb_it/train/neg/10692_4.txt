The poor Ingrid suffered and suffered once she left for Italy, tired of the glamorous treatment of Hollywood. Before he was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in Stromboli, an artistic failure that would have killed the career of a less resistant actress. And now it is EUROPA 51, another boring exercise in feeling drenched. <br /> <br /> Nor does the story do much for Alexander KNOX, in another thankless role as her long-suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son. At least this has better production values ​​and a more coherent script than STROMBOLI. <br /> <br /> Bergman is still attractive here, but he is moving towards a more matronical appearance as a society-rich woman. He is never able to endure the sudden loss of his son, despite the attempts of a kind male friend. "Sometimes I think I'm going crazy," he tells her husband. A portentous statement in a film that is totally devoid of humor or grace, but gives us an idea of ​​where the story is going. <br /> <br /> Bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post-war Rome, but being a social worker with poor children does not improve his emotional health and from that moment the plot takes a bad turn. <br /> <br /> The overall effect of the film is that it is not interesting enough to turn into a project for an important star like Bergman. The film loses rhythm in the middle of the story while Bergman becomes more and more upset and the husband suspects that she is doing two times on him. The story comes down from there after she nurse a peddler through her terminal illness. The last thread of the plot is that her husband needs to put it for observation in an asylum. <br /> <br /> Ingrid suffers nobly for everything (over-compensating for the loss of her child) but it is useless. Not one of his best films, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Note: if he wanted neo-realism with mental illness, it would have been better to accept the lead role in THE SNAKE PIT when it was offered to her by director Anatole Litvak !! He would have done more for his EUROPA 51 career. <br /> <br /> In summary: another squalid indiscretion by Rossellini and Bergman.
