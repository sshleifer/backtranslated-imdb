I loved "Anchorman; The Legend of Ron Burgundy" and I hoped it would be just as fun, but unfortunately it wasn't. Some bits are excellent though. I thought the sporty guy, Champ Kind, who professed his love for Ron Burgundy in the car full of other news team members, was hilarious. Everyone ignores him and he gets stronger and stronger and finally kisses Burgundy who isn't even recognized. But on the whole the story does not gel. It is a noble attempt, however, to save the unused parts of the first film, including a whole plot about some benevolent aspiring domestic terrorists called "The Alarm Clock". Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has a couple of funny lines, but in the end this unused plot has good reasons to be used in the first movie. The extras on this record are pretty good, with the best two being the rehearsals filmed with a lot of improvised comedy, and the fake comment with Will Ferrell and an "executive producer" that Ferrell first discovers was not even a part of the movie in any way, shape or form. It turns out that he is "just a boy" who walked into the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer. They are pretty funny things and go on for about 10 or 15 minutes
