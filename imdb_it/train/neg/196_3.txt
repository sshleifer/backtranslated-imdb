This film is imperfect on many fronts. Like many before, it depicts more of the mythology of the Alamo than of history. Production is scarce, overall giving the impression of a wellness project for many actors who would otherwise have had to work on Hollywood Squares. This was the biggest flaw for me - I know the ages and general personalities of the real protagonists of Alamo and the geriatric ensemble of television actors chosen to portray them without ever interfering in any sense of credibility. <br /> <br /> Texan, I grew up with mythology. Later I learned more about history. I can accept decent production from both perspectives (although I prefer greater historical precision), but this has never given me the chance to enjoy it. Even the versions of John Wayne or Fess Parker have had more life than this confusion, despite being only slightly less accurate. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing, avoid it.
