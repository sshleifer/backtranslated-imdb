I had high expectations following "My Beautiful Laundrette", "Bend it like Beckham" and (less so) "East is East". The stories of Asian Brits entering their foster home have had many good tracks on the big screen, as well as a series of excellent TV and radio series (Kind Goodness, etc.). This falls flat. Despite a good start he quickly went down the hill. <br /> <br /> After all it was a terrible BBC effort, complete with strong regional accents, extravagant characters, a "those were the days" soundtrack, and a lot of "problems" in the attempt to be worthy. <br /> <br /> I found myself giving up on many points during this movie. Writing is predictable. Every possible click has been dragged and transmitted. In fact, I find it difficult to think of any intercultural / intergenerational device that could have been used that was not. The characters were thin and cliché: the eccentric anti-conformist minister; common sense, but in the end the old racist woman; the overweight, domineering aunt; intrusive Indian parents; the neighbor of the working class; the "deep" grandmother "wise"; the motorcycle hoodlum. The script was weak, with every chance of surprising the audience with a clear racist dialogue by the two forgotten racist white characters taken. And because it had to be set in the 70s (apart from the need for an excuse for the soundtrack of the 70s) it's a mystery. Maybe it makes the incredible characters a little more believable for people born after 1979. I don't know. <br /> <br /> Apart from these things, good acting could have brought this into respectable darkness. Instead, the usual suspects of the "BBC comedy" have been brought out. "Bend it like Beckham" had a much better acting (and a serious acting, indeed) of this, with a virtually unknown cast. In summary, a lazy cliché script, more acted, in a boring predictable story. Give it a try. <br /> <br />
