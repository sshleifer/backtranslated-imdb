this film tries to be immensely intelligent, and similar to Tarantino <br /> <br /> before trying it out, however, you need solid filmic fundamentals. these include a good sound, editing, set design etc ... <br /> <br /> lets you talk about the sound in this movie. absolutely atrocious I have never been more distracted by a soundtrack, never <br /> <br /> and before speaking of reduced budget, films made in Chile, etc., we keep in mind that the sound of the desent in these days is very more achievable than ever been anywhere. and more information on the technique is available then never before <br /> <br /> the sound in this film is simply ugly. foley in particular is out of place and inappropriate, the atmosphere is just as terrible. I heard at least four loud shots during the movie, which are the result of a bad sound change. the sound inside the cars is terrible, the sound of the car doors being closed is horrible. the sound of the singing lady is wrong. Foley is either overboard, or simply there is no such thing as the sound person just got bored and gave up. the spaces are wrong. everything is wrong <br /> <br /> and yet, not letting creative limits intrude, at the same time the film boldly tries to be intelligent. for example the sound of the aquarium is used in the following street scene. we listen to the sound when we shouldn't. the sound changes precede the visual cuts. every trick in the book is used, yet the basics are not only there <br /> <br /> editing-wise we have scenes using heavy jumps, we tinkered with the time line etc etc etc, yawn. all these techniques are imitated in a beautifully low standard <br /> <br /> overall the mix is ​​disgusting, the sound is disgusting. and so, the film is crap. how can a movie with so many fundamental flaws be considered for prizes and praise? The new cinematic wave of Chile? the best creative production that Chile has to offer? I hope not, and I think not. <br /> <br /> My theory is that the most selective and best talent in Chile has avoided this film like the plague, perhaps because of its captivating content. likewise, the film has probably received so many unjustified critical acclaim from so-called "world cinema" fans for the same dirty reasons. they probably enjoy their trashiness. obviously film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality <br /> <br /> this film is rubbish. it's all mouth and no pants and never deserves a rating of 6.8. the film has all the production quality of a cheap Tarantino, a porn inspired by the new wave!
