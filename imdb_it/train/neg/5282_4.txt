I must confess that I am seriously disappointed. <br /> <br /> This version can in no way compete with the 1995 version. The reason I saw that I was not entirely satisfied with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth thought that Rupert Penry-Jones looked much more like to the Captain I had imagined reading the book. And he was too. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this is the only saving quality of the film. The rest is as non-Austen as possible. <br /> <br /> Miss Elliot would NEVER run the streets of Bath this way. He was not in his character and was not made by a lady of those times. Anne Elliot of the book was a lady and had dignity. There are other painful anachronisms, but this was the worst. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 important quotations from the book, they are found in completely inappropriate moments, warning those who know the book that another important part of the book will be missing or completely changed. <br /> <br /> And although this version is not much shorter than the other, it seems that everything is rushed. Very little care was taken to introduce the characters, to show their dispositions and motivations. Important scenes have been omitted. How could they have slaughtered the final scenes this way? A disaster ! And it was by far not as well photographed as the other. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you love Austen, don't waste your time with this.
