This could be a strong candidate for "The Worst Flick Ever". Perhaps without the presence of John Hurt, it could be tolerated as a children's movie. However, the TRAGEDY of this entire effort is that John Hurt, one of the greatest actors on the screen, belittles himself in this .... I gave him two points just because Mr. Hurt SHOWN ... I take 8 points, he didn't run away fast enough. As for the rest of the cast, they are simply terrible. Janine Turner, however beautiful she may be, cannot act to save her soul. And the main actor is, in effect, terrible. If you can spare yourself this embarrassment, please do it. It's so ugly, almost HURTS.
