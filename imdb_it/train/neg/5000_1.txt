This is probably the worst excuse for television programming since, oh, I don't know, WHAT HAPPENS NOW? Nothing has ever happened on this ridiculous "series". Although it is shot mainly by Britney and Kevin themselves, they do not get good details in their personal lives. Mostly they are the only ones who make silly jokes and behave like white garbage. Listen, I love Britney's music as much as the next one, but this show is just a pure filler for a nation so dedicated to Britney that she would watch her cut her toenails (yes, it could be a real episode). Thank God these two broke up, because they were painfully boring together. This show is TOXIC!
