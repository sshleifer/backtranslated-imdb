Wow, a film about New York politics apparently written by someone who never set foot in New York. You know there is a problem when you expect to shoot credits at a time and the movie continues for another half hour. The characters are boring, John Cusack's accent is ridiculous, and the plot goes between boring and ridiculous. A horrible film.
