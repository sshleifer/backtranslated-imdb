My personal vision of hell is locked in a room without the possibility of closing my eyes or blocking my ears and making this film run for eternity on every surface available in that room. The whole idea that Streisand plays a guy / man only begins to scratch the surface of how ridiculous a premise of the film is. The only thing more important than watching a film is the concept of "voluntary suspension of disbelief". . . it is impossible to do this in this film.
