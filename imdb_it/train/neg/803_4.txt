I read Ben Mezrich's novel Reaper a few years ago and last night I saw this adaptation by accident. <br /> <br /> Even though it's been years since I read the story for the first time, the differences between the novel and the film are enormous. Very important elements, which have made the whole matter plausible, are only incorrectly written or modified. <br /> <br /> If the plot seems interesting to you: go get the novel. It is much, much, much better. <br /> <br /> Still 4 out of 10 because it was difficult to stop looking because of the fundamental plot of Ben Mezrich.
