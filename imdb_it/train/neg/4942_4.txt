Every new autumn line-up deserves, at least, my "3 hits and you're out" policy. I give a play 3 chances to make me laugh, that is 3 full episodes. After episode 1, I actually told TV, "Canceled tomorrow". It was so bad. Now I've seen the first 4 episodes of "Cavemen" and I still have to manage a smile. Not a titter, a laugh, a chortle, actually, no facial movement. I will continue to punish myself by watching every future episode because I am convinced that I clearly miss something in this show. I'm just not "doing" it, but I think a comedy on a big prime time television network should be simply fun; but there are never laughs from me. At 8:00 there is no way that ABC has put the comedy less fun of all time. I know there must be an internal joke that just isn't living with my brain. I read each of the previous comments, "I get" the social aspect of it, but, WHERE ARE THE JOKES ???? I will continue to suffer for at least 30 minutes a week, until I have a moment of light and I will crush myself in the head shouting "Eureka".
