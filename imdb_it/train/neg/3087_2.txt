A group of extremely unpredictable A-holes are tormented by limping puppets that some elderly night watchmen have been stuck in a film vault for twenty years without any reason. <br /> <br /> Many people know this movie only from the constant grooves of the MST3K movie. But I saw the real movie and I can safely say that yes it is bad, really, REALLY bad. From one of the most horrible "fight" scenes I've ever witnessed for the "plush aliens" who suffer from lack of movement (I had a My Pet Monster that was scarier) until the atrocious acting (I had a My Pet Monster which was more charismatic) However, the fact that Rick Sloan's "Vice Academy" films are somehow, and trust me, I have no worldly idea of ​​how much, much worse. This does not mean that this film is anything but disgusting, because it is not. Just throwing it out there. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: no nudity in the movie itself, but there are 2 pairs of boobs on the DVD Introduction to the movie <br /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD Extras: Introduction by Jim Wynorski; Image Gallery; and Trailer for this movie
