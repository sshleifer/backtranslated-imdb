This film is really bad, with a script full of "memorable" lines and incredibly bad performances. Even the special effects are bad (not the worst I've ever seen) and the music is so bad you have to listen to it to believe it. Only two short themes (30 seconds long or so) are repeated constantly throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
