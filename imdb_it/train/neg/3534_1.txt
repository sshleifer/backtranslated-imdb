I'd rather have my eyes ripped open with rusty icebreakers than those who had to endure this abortion. There is no plot. There is no acting ability. Ray Liota was ashamed and should be blacklisted by other jobs. I'm so sorry that the industry allows crap like this to be shown on any kind of support. <br /> <br /> It is said that Maddona threw herself on the ground to break her other arm so that she could be carried away on a stretcher. In fact, she deserves to be married to this loser and want to be an actor-director. I hope he stays in London and never returns to the United States. Please don't waste your money on this so-called movie. Please.
