It's a shame you can't vote for zero stars on IMDb, because I wouldn't hesitate! In fact I would go so far as to say that this film was in negative stars. <br /> <br /> Like many others, I bought this film thinking that because it contains Michael Madsen, it could be good ... No chance! This movie was shocking! Imagine a length of the movie 'The Bold and the Beautiful', well, Primal Instinct didn't even come close to that good, and I had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than a length of the movie 'The Bold and the Beautiful '. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how could you do this to us? The worst part is that I didn't take a step forward, I was hoping that in the end they would reveal that it was some kind of sick joke, that they thought it would be fun to make us watch a movie so horribly ugly. <br /> <br /> Where do I start ...? Directing - Zero Stars, Screenplay - Zero Stars, Acting - Zero Stars, Cinematography - Zero Stars, Digital Effects - Zero Stars, Production Design - Zero Stars, Makeup - Zero Stars, Casting - Zero Stars, Editing - Zero Stars, Trailer - Half Stars to Star, Graphic Design - Half a Star, DVD Menu - Half a Star. <br /> <br /> However, I think it's very important to have seen bad movies just to know what a really bad movie it is, so for that reason I'm glad I saw this movie, just to have a bad movie to put at the bottom of my list.
