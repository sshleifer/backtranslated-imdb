This can be one of the funniest movies of all time if you don't take it seriously. It's a little dated and the effects are lame, but it's so pleasant. There are giant crabs that attack a girl. oh, and the crabs sing Japanese. It's incredibly bad. And the ending, which was wired throughout the film, is horribly fantastic. Predictable, but seeing the final fight will let you roll on your seat. Don't even give this movie a chance and you'll love it. Susan George is fun to watch and yes, she looks naked. His daughter is not worth enduring, but is attacked by giant crabs. They are the size of big cats. This is a 2, but I love it. As a movie, my God, but for fun, I give it a 7. Did I mention that there are giant crabs?
