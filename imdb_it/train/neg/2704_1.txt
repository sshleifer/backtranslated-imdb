I don't understand why people would praise this junk. It's wrong, stupid, unrealistic, terrible, and almost everything else. The film is a vision of life, racial issues, prejudices and everything that strangely happens in College. This is where it fails. He did not grasp reality. From many questionable scenes with no sense of the film such as <br /> <br /> A black man chasing a white man with a gun, the black man stopped by handcuffed security guards and taken out while the bandit passes their own. <br /> <br /> The same white who buzzes people from a rooftop argument that is stopped and shot down by the same black man is then stopped and given a Rodney King style beat while the gunman runs free while a moment later he is tucked in by one of the four guards. <br /> <br /> As a previous reviewer he pointed out several 230-pound white men beaten by several black men weighing about 160 pounds, including the 105-pound Bust Rhymes <br /> <br /> Another a critical point in the film are the uninteresting and uninteresting characters. From the frightened and confused white people and the petty black people, angry and yet just (?). It's almost an insult to whites and blacks. I am a white male and I know many blacks and Hispanics who agree that this film is wrong in portraying characters and giving them those characteristics solely because of their race. <br /> <br /> The plot I will explain now revolves around three characters. One is a black athlete, the other a white and confused and scared girl who interrogates her sexuality, and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared, so he blames his problems on people of color where he becomes a Nazi later in the film. They all have their share of problems and adventures including sex, rape, struggles, love, hate, prejudice, racial warfare, and oh yes, don't forget education. That all comes down to the fatal shot. In which, after returning to their boring lives and thinking that "being white is bad". Does this sound much like the college years? I don't think so. I don't think the director attended college, especially if he had to make this mess. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a really bad, bad, ugly movie. If you want to see a more accurate vision or racial problems, go see American history X. If you want to see a more accurate view of the Porkys college rent. Just avoid this mess.
