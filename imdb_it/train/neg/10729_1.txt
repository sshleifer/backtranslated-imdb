Let me start by saying that I consider myself one of the most (most!) Open-minded movie-viewers ... Movies are my passion, and I am a great visitor to my local movie rental venue. .. I also feel the need to add that they often ask ME for advice about films every time I get there and I can never leave the place without having had an elaborate discussion or exchange of ideas on what is happening in the film area cult ... I love renting strange things, and that's exactly why this film was recommended by one of the cult movie-video-place guys. He told me he thought I should see this, and since the cover said it was a Jodorowsky movie (one of my favorites!), I rented it. <br /> <br /> The vote I gave here is not right, because I didn't do it I thought it was horrible, I didn't know how to classify it otherwise. A question mark would have been more appropriate ... <br /> <br /> This is the first and only film that literally made my stomach sick: I felt really bad physically! Am I the only one whose stomach has literally changed? I still didn't want to turn it off, or maybe I just couldn't because I was fascinated in an obnoxious way ... <br /> <br /> I don't want to see this movie again. <br /> <br /> Not terrible, a 1 like I said. Not just my cup of tea (or wodka for that matter) ...
