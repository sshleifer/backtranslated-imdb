Ah, channel 5 of local Mexican t.v. Every day, at 2:00, they broadcast horror films from the 70s to the early 2000s. It was "Return To Cabin By The Lake" the movie that aired yesterday. I'm sorry I watched it. <br /> <br /> The original "Cabin By The Lake" was a popular and regularly acceptable bass budgeter. The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in every sense of the word. <br /> <br /> The film in some places looks like a soap opera due to absurd dialogues, cinematography and direction. <br /> <br /> My advice is: avoid this at all costs. It is a film that should not be watched by anyone. Not even for lovers of mediocre film making. <br /> <br /> You have been notified.
