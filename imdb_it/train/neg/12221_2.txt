With the exception of sound, none of the above remarks is really critical for this kind of no budget, (really) independent horror film. The tricks and sound effects are very good and the leading actor was effective, the leading actress, even if attractive, needs some coaching as she is particularly poor. <br /> <br /> The main problem of Frightworld is its length, at 108 minutes its half an hour too long to be as effective as a slasher movie, wise plot only about ten minutes of the first fifty are relevant. <br /> <br /> In places it is visually appealing and sometimes the lack of lighting works in favor of movies. However, when this is combined with the poor sound as in the case of most of the film, large sections are difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> This could certainly be a fun if not original "serial killer back from dead" movie with a judicious and ruthless montage, in its current form it plays like an unfinished rough cut.
