I read Rice's novel with interest, and I was enchanted with his characters and his harrowing story based on historical truths. <br /> <br /> However, I was simply HANGED in this disastrous adaptation. The casting was based only on the physical aspect and not on the acting talent (with the obvious exception of Peter Gallagher, who was neither blond nor able to get out of a wet paper bag). The embarrassing, awkward and inconsistent attempts of the cast to influence a French accent were hilarious, but not in a fun way. I found myself wincing through this confused and melodramatic tripe, and was surprised to have done so until the end. <br /> <br /> A warning to fans of the novel - stay away from this.
