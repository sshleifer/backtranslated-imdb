Caught this by chance on a t.v. showing - and I could hardly believe how terrible the whole experience was. In comparison, the original "A Man Called Horse" was a binding spell because it kept its interest all the time. But this piece of nonsense - the words betray me. It was bad enough to have a sort of "story" presented with all the impact of a wet loaf, but that mistake was compounded by the obvious lack of subtitles wherever the so-called "Sioux" was located. For heaven's sake, couldn't filmmakers have found enough North American Indians who were also actors and actors close to performing as "Indians" in this farrago instead of the impostors they actually used? I also found it rather embarrassing to watch Richard Harris go around the countryside for the obvious will of the director behind the camera, telling him to run and jump from pointless Point to pointless B just to shoot and minutes. Absolutely terrible in all respects!
