Based on the positive reviews above, we saw a free screening of this last night. Now I know that filmmakers are planning positive reviews, because in no way could a target individual write them. "Destined to become a 'cult classic'" ?? The theater was full, apparently with friends and families from the production team, because only a few of us went out for the first hour. <br /> <br /> Were the songs the most literal I've ever heard in a musical ?? "Don't take the shortcut, honey, there's a wolf in the woods ...". Debi Mazar's eyes slammed furiously as she struggled to sing. Fortunately, most of the songs lasted only a few lines. <br /> <br /> Now, whoever plays the wolf in this story should be fascinating and seductive. Instead, we get Joey Fatone, former N'Syncer, who lives up to his last name because he hasn't aged well. It's not exactly agile with its extra 50 pounds and junior high school makeup and off-tone singing. Seriously, was this guy in the vocal group? The rest of the actors are semi-adequate, but can't do much about the script without fantasy. You know, it's possible to write for adults and children at the same time ?? see below "Pixar". <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the virtual sets are beautiful and well integrated with the actors. And it wasn't as offensive as "Crash".
