Unfortunately, this movie is so ugly. The original Out of Towners were manic and very funny, obviously they used the script written by Neil Simon. For some reason, the screenplay by Neil Simons is not used in this film, so it falls continuously. Even the audience I was with never laughed. The management is very slow and boring and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies, that is, the couple has sex in the park. They announce that it is an illumination ceremony for New York, well we all know that the lights will turn on and we will be able to see Goldie and Steve being nice and aggressive doing a little slap. The whole film ends up being so ... a joke is set and given away. Because Goldie's hair is never messed up in the film. You'll also notice every detail of Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). I suggest you hire the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, if you want to laugh.
