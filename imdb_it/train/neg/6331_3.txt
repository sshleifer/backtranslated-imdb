Mr. Mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time, so I was interested to see what he would do with total creative control over a film. Unfortunately, it is unwatchable, although not because the jokes are not funny - some (I won't say most) of them are, and in fact Mr. Mike did a good job translating his mentally unbalanced badges into visual gags . The trouble is that the technical quality (set, lighting, sound, editing, name) is so terrible, the film is intolerable. Some outfits called "PKO Productions" get the production credit, but it doesn't look like a product at all; it seems more like Mike stole one of the cameras from the SNL set and did it all in one afternoon. I realize that Mike's goal was to torture the public, but that also deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to actually see, hear or understand anything that should be shocking. Still, the DVD is not a total waste: it includes a funeral eulogy for O'Donoghue by Bill Murray and three "Least Loved Bedtime Stories" by Mr. Mike from SNL. Moreover, the "cat swimming section" of the film is a fantastic scene to capture by watching if you want to scare someone. 3/10
