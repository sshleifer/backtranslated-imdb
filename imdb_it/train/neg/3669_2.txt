I really can't think of anything good to say about this movie ... not a single thing. The script is a nightmare ... the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and does not seem to understand the difference. You would think that at least they would get a technical consultant. The shows have been hurt by most of the cast ... even if I don't really blame them ... the stuff really stinks. The editing was just as bad .. I only stop now .. it's all bad 2/10
