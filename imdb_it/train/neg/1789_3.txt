Although I enjoyed Bing Crosby in other films, I find this film particularly rewarding. Perhaps because I come from a different era and from another country, but I found Crosby's continuous references to Good Old USA at the beginning, trivial after a while and then finally annoying. Don't get me wrong - I'm not anti-American - but it seemed that the British could not do without and / or needed this brave, oh so clever American visitor to show them the way. It's a story of "fish out of water", but unlike most films of this type, this time it's the "fish" that has the upper hand. To be honest both for me and for the movie, I watched it a few times over a few years and had the same impression every time. <br /> <br /> (I saw another Crosby movie last night: The Emperor's The Waltz - and this also produced the same reaction in me and to my surprise even my wife - who for what it's worth is American - he found American Crosby's "in-face" attitude irritating, Roosevelt, as you say. it's obviously very good. The scenery and the music are also good, as are the great costumes - although I agree with a previous reviewer that William Bendix's wig looks horrible (photo by Moe of The Three Stooges). <br /> <br /> All in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable photo without the attitude of Bing Crosby but since it is practically in every scene it is rather difficult to go through this film.
