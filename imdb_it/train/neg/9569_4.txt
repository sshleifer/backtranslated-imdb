It certainly isn't horrible, but definitely not good. <br /> <br /> Cry, The Beloved Country (1995) was directed by Darrell Roodt and written for the screen by Ronald Harwood (adapted from Alan Paton's 1946 novel). Played by James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. <br /> <br /> The film is about pre-apartheid South Africa and the stories of a black man and a white man who intertwine. The pious but naive preacher Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) receives a letter from Johannesburg saying he must come immediately; later he finds out that his son killed a man. The wealthy farmer / landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris) discovers that his son, a fighter for black rights, was killed by Kumalo's son. In this they connect. <br /> <br /> I can't compare it to the 1951 film of the same name, because I didn't see it. Or the 1974 musical, Lost in the Stars, I haven't seen it; both look better than this. But Cry Freedom, on the other hand, I've seen; he looks a lot more urgent, like he's trying to say something in which the movie Cry, The Beloved Country seems to have no idea where he's going. Very "wishy-washy". I refuse to compare the film to the novel (except that I liked the novel more than I liked the film) because novels and films are two extremely different media and it makes no sense trying to transfer them directly to one another or compare them by the same means. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this film has blown. Well, I guess it wasn't so bad, - five-ten, - but it wasn't even that good. Both protagonists, both very capable actors, play some of the most wooden performances I've seen with some of the most difficult dialogues in the history of cinema (but this can be attributed to the screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, who is also strangely out of play with this film, having also written the sublime The Pianist and Being Julia). Among other things, the point and themes of the novel are almost entirely lost in its transition to the cinema for the third time; there is little, if any, tension with any moment of the film, racially or with suspense. Music doesn't help. The traces of a painfully misplaced and boring pastoral orchestra are of great help for this debasement of the film. A positive side is the cinematography, with many rather good or fantastic shots, but unfortunately, this does not help the film too much. <br /> <br /> The last surprising words of the novel by Alan Paton are shown in the last moments of the film. Too bad they seem so disconnected from the movie that was just shown. I don't know what Nelson Mandela might have seen in this film. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
