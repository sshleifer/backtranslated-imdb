I joined this site to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster of a movie. I wasn't even involved for a second. The characters were all one-dimensional. They threw all the arguments they could think of hoping that something would remain. I would bet (and I hope) that all those involved in the Teachers look back with embarrassment. There are some great actors here but you'd never know. Thank God he didn't destroy the careers of Morgan Freeman or Judd Hirsh's or Nick Nolte or Laura Dern. There was no vision, no labor of love, just a horrible effort gone wrong. By the way, I don't think the writer ever set foot in a real school.
