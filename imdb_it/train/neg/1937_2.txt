I liked the first half hour of this film. The obvious budding love story between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was nice to look at and I wanted to see the inevitable happen between them. However, once the action was over at Ingrid's boyfriend's house, everything collapsed completely. Instead of romance and fascination, we see some atrociously atrocious parallel characters emerge that ruin the film. The girls of the boyfriend and the military striker who competed for the maid's attention seemed stupid - a bit like a subplot of an old episode of the Love Boat. The way in which the charm and elegance of the first part of the film can give way to dopamine is beyond me. This film is an obvious attempt by Renoir to regain the success it had with THE RULES OF THE GAME, as the film is very similar once the action passes to the country estate (just like in the other film) . I wasn't a big fan of THE RULES OF THE GAME, but ELENA AND HIS MEN made me appreciate the art and nuances of the original film.
