Oh man, I know what you think: "With a title like that, I can't go wrong!" Uh yes you can I too, I loved the title, but the man I hated the stupid kid who played "Satan's little helper" I also hated mom, and sister / daughter, and her boyfriend - I hated all those people! Friend, it was anguish watching him sometimes! The only reason this doesn't get 1/10 is due to the small budget, they did well. But oh man I hated those actors, so stupid! I knew it would be bad, I guess they saved a lot of money using only the Halloween masks for the killer, and even Jesus' costume was really stupid in the end. Oh the agony, don't look!
