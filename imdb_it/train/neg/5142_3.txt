After Chaplin made one of his best films: Dough & Dynamite, he made one of his worst: Gentlemen Of Nerve. During this first year of film, Chaplin made about a third of all his films. Many of them were experimental in terms of advertising, editing, gags, location shooting, etc. This takes place in a circuit where Chaplin and his friend try to enter without paying. Mabel Normand is also there with her friend, and Chaplin manages to get rid of both his and Mabel's friends. Then Mabel goes around in the stands with no apparent repercussions on his behavior. A lot of slapstick here, but there is very little else to recommend this film to others, so look at the development of Chaplin. The press I saw was seriously damaged, which may have affected his enjoyment. Charley Chase can be glimpsed. * of 4 stars.
