How can there be so many corrupt cops without any of them being resolved? With enough cops to run a mini-war that includes weapons like flamethrowers, you'd think they'd be discovered before someone writing for a weekly coupon heard someone say "thank you" to a corrupt cop. <br /> <br /> You will never have your 90 minutes back. Life is too precious to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the great actors who made the mistake of making this film. <br /> <br /> If you like Justin Timberlake, feel free to rent this movie. It has a very important part, so fans could have fun seeing it. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that most of his fans are young girls, who could be excluded from violence in this film.
