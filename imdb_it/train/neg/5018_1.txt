I rented this movie just to see Amber Benson, although after reading the box I thought it sounded like a good story ..... however the first problem was that there really wasn't a story ... or actually c It was a story but it made absolutely no sense. The second problem was that there was no set for these characters ... yes, I realized that they all went to school together, but in the first 3 minutes of the movie you knew they had nothing else in common and they didn't love each other one another ... so why they kept together. Flaw number 3 ... the director, even though the long pauses and close-up shots of the camera matched the suspense (especially with the typical dubbed suspense music) ... he was sadly mistaken. It was painful to see a formidable actress like Amber Benson waste time trying to bring him back to life ... my only hope is that the money he made here was for the production of his film.
