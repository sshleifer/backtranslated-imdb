It's hard to know where this adaptation starts to go wrong, because I think the problem starts with the books themselves. Alexander McCall Smith has understood that he does not read them for detective stories, but for his deeply condescending and completely spurious vision of an Africa that does not exist. It has done for Botswana what Borat has done for Kazakhstan - not so successfully, but based on a fact. <br /> <br /> Once I understood this, I stopped realizing that Jill Scott, an American singer / actress, is cast as Mma Ramotswe. If it is to represent a land that is not Africa, how appropriate is it to be a black woman who is not African? She is not the only American in the cast; Mma Makutsi is played by Anika Noni Rose. Both women are far away, too young for the roles they play and too glamorous. Both brutally murder local accents, and both focus so entirely on this brutality that they fail to offer much in the way of acting. Scott's Mma Ramotswe is lively, cute and soft. Rose's Mma Makutsi is an annoying open mouthed whore. <br /> <br /> The result is almost unwatchable. The main cast is redeemed only by the presence of Lucian Msamati, who turns into a decent performance like Mr. JLB Matekoni. It's smarter and more intense than in books, but I can't blame Msamati for this: it's a shining light in an ocean of suckage. The contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly placed at the feet of any butchers' committee to write the script. <br /> <br /> For me, McCall Smith's writing has always been very funny but notoriously bad. Refuses to be modified. As a result, his books contain grammar experiments that border on science and characters that change names in mid-sentence. It is therefore something of a result that the team of screenwriters of this project has actually made things worse. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is now widely anglicized. The characters speak of "openness" and "sensitivity to needs". Mma Ramotswe and Mr. JLB Matekoni openly flirt. Mma Makutsi groans about not having a computer, but given her constantly renewed hair, make-up and jewelry, I'm surprised she doesn't have a MacBook in her purse with her Visa card. <br /> <br /> So we left here? It is difficult to be upset by this lousy adaptation because, honestly, most of the things I like about original books are in any case apocryphal. McCall Smith paints a fake Botswana populated by nice and non-threatening black people, full of wise and funny nuggets. We read well despite the linguistic parody, but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wishes were blacks. It's not true. <br /> <br /> Having said that, it's not surprising that this show sucks as much as it is. It remains to be seen if the European and American public is aware of it, however.
