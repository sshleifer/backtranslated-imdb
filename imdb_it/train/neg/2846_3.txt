What a terrible movie this is. The only reason you want to sit in this mess is the pleasant show of Miss Eleniak. McNamara's painful exasperation, which sometimes became embarrassing, ruined what could have been a reasonable film if the right actors had been chosen. Mr McNamara is not Tom Cruise, the actor who obviously wants to be.
