Bad movie for sure. It's such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of cheap special effects, lots of hurried scenes (the one at the airport for example) and a real little fun time. (Charles Dance) is as horrible as the evil one and he is much better at (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) is playing a non-comedy joke, and I heard that this sinking has already been successful, happened in big time ?? !! I will never understand why or how? In a television interview I heard (Eddie Murphy) himself, when he was nominated for a 2007 Oscar, he repented in a comical way !! <br /> <br /> One of the comments said (hey ... it's the 80s!). Well, no my friend. It is the cinematic folly that made a lot of RAZZIE films over the years, both in the 80s and in the 50s! <br /> <br /> There are 2 reasons why I wrote about this movie. The first is that I will never forget the long and fascinating tanned legs of (Charlotte Lewis) especially when she was in bed before the bad guys attacked her house, wearing only a blue shirt and OH BOY the camera was pouring on her bare legs like it should be. But how strange! How did I look at her in later films and was she still not beautiful? !! However, the second reason is that I recently found the title of this film on my list of the worst 100 movies ever! <br /> <br /> The bottom line: bad movie, Greeeeeat legs.
