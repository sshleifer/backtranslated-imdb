This film was nothing short of terrible. I was hoping for a lot better after seeing "High School Musical". The whole movie was a real rip-off of "The Simple Life", only it wasn't a reality show. <br /> <br /> The acting was not good at all. Amanda Michalka had her moments, when it wasn't so terrible. On the other hand, Alyson Michalka was hurt to the core. Chris Gallinger, who played Amanda's love interest, was playing a French guy, but he had a horrible accent. A positive thing about this film was the lovely Michael Trevino, who played Alyson's love interest. Just something to keep in mind, if this movie had been broadcast before "High School Musical" it probably wouldn't have looked so bad. But there was no comparison. <br /> <br /> In general, I give him a 2.
