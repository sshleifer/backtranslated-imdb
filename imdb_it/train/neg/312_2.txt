If you've ever seen this movie, you would know it! If you don't have it, and you want to see a classic BAD movie, I suggest you see this movie, because it aligns to the worst. So, if you are REALLY bored, go and rent it. If you want to know how it is, here is my little summary: Adam Sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some Ms Universe models and five other people. Adamo does not like the way a passenger gets all the girls, and tries to take over with jokes. BUT WAIT! It just gets worse! You will have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it really is.
