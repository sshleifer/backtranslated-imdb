Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett have been the most incredible couple on the screen since John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. The direction of Larry Peerce wavers uncontrollably between black farce and Roman tragedy. Robert Klein surely thinks it is the first and his self-centered performance in a minor role underlines the total lack of balance and chemistry among the players in the film. Normally, I don't like letting myself get caught in the dry, but The Bell Jar is one of my favorite books of all time and seeing what they've done makes me literally crazy.
