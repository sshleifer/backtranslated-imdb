"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" is the worst movie ever made, surpassing even the "Plan 9 from Outer Space". At least that movie was simply inept; Lampoon's film, on the other hand, is both inept and bad. Once upon a time, there were films used to respect the intelligence of their audience. This, however, is holding a fetid and decomposing carcass - and then tries to rip our nose. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good parts of the film are the nude scenes; and I agree, Miss Ganzel and Dusenberry make some flash meat, and the meat is very beautiful. But the directors don't seem to realize that T & A also needs a good story to surround it. There is none of this. <br /> <br /> Perversely, the directors saved the worst for last. The third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio. In this cartoon, Robby Benson plays a rabid young policeman who does the service on his first day at work. It is paired with a tired and cynical oldtimer played by Richard Widmark. For a moment, we are given the hope that this film will end up triumphantly. Surely, we think, the bold attitude of the young man will be felt by the cynic and will change him for the better. <br /> <br /> Hope! Instead, the cynic wins the day - and the young man's spark is turned off forever. "National Lampoon goes to the cinema" and heads for the toilet, asking us to follow him to the end. Nominally, this is a comedy. But where is the humor?
