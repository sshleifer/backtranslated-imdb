As has been noted, this formula has been filmed several times, most recently as "You've Got Mail", with Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" Ryan. Among the various versions, this is my favorite. The problem I think is that the studio had the charisma of Stars, which doesn't cut it here. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two protagonists never comes to a boil in this film. There are no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of the pleasant but insipid day donuts. And when the cables are boring, the rest of the film can only follow. Judy in particular is disappointing. Looks like he doesn't have a neck! I don't know if he had problems with pain or something like that but he looks like a tortoise trying to put his head in his shell, all huddled and all the rest. I couldn't understand what Van Johnson was getting so hot. I would have made a bee line for that cute violinist. And even Van wasn't great. I always thought of him as a rather generic Hollywood leader and he does nothing to dispel that image here. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the stars or the early 1900s, then you might like this movie. But there are many more fun romantic comedies out there, and they offer you much more than a mouthful of stale confetti.
