I would give a 2/10. <br /> <br /> I was really very sorry. <br /> <br /> The plot was underdeveloped, for example the incidents were too short and brief, so the moral was not clearly brought to light. I thought Brenda Song had done a good job, but Shin Koyamada seemed to have trouble managing his role. I could see the need to insert western elements into the show, however, there are some parts, where Chinese elements were needed too! The bad guy for example. His physical appearance looked like a robot, instead of something out of Chinese culture. The last and worst defect were the wrong and distorted facts included in the show. <br /> <br /> Others might point out that this is a "Kid's show" and therefore, there is no need for such a high standard. However, there are other Disney shows, such as Mu Lan, that have been much better in terms of developing and presenting the story. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I believe that Disney movies should be better researched and better planned. A good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves you can count on.
