This is one of those movies that appear on cable like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while ironing. The acting is second level. Poor Mathew Modine looks like a sleepwalker through the whole movie. And God helps Gina Gershon. His accent is too exaggerated. He doesn't look like a real English woman. He seems forced and fake, very similar to his acting. He should stick to what he does best, lesbian with artist-showgirl who plays in a rock & roll band and has a drug problem. The other characters are no better. They are two-dimensional. empty, dull and silly. How we should care about these people. At one point, Christy Scott Cashman gets lost in Central Park. Really? It is not so difficult to navigate in Central Park. Simply follow any path. Not only did I not care about any of the characters, I completely hated them. The only reason I stayed with this shipwreck was Fisher Stevens. Even his brilliant humor could not save this dying fish. Every scene is typical romantic comedy and nothing is left to surprise us. The script was horrible, as was acting. If you take this fish, throw it back!
