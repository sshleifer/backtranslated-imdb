After the lively action of Disney, George of the Jungle, I had high hopes for this film. Big disappointment. Plot bare texture, bad acting, bad visual effects. This film relied on limping one-liners, positioning idiotic (and useless) products, and the most boring kick-off in that gadget machine. I took two kids to see it and they were bored by their mind. The only laugh received from this movie was the bad expectation of when you need a laugh, show a guy to take him in the groin!
