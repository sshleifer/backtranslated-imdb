This film was terrible. The first half hour is very similar to ... well, I apologize for the lack of articulation, but it was simply a bad version of A Clockwork Orange. The first scene is almost photocopied from one of the first in Clockwork! Presumably it was a tribute, as for the appearance of the Clockwork poster on the protagonist's wall, however "ripoff" is the most appropriate word. The film seemed to be ripped directly from Kubrick's classic, shot only through the eyes of a new director. A blind director. Unfortunately when the slaughter of Kubrick's work stops, the film gets even worse. As another commentator has said, the depth of this film is simply thrust into the throat. Arrogant, self-absorbed and ultimately meaningless. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the protagonists' digressions would be a panacea if there were a real development of the character in this film. I heard absolutely nothing for this boy. And I'm an alcoholic, so I guess if anyone could prove something to him, I'd be me. The terrible development of the character, the dialogue and the plot. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this film is the title. For a film called "16 years of alcohol", alcoholism is certainly not a factor in the film. See the first paragraph - it was such a mess of A Clockwork Orange that I can't get over it. A more suitable title would have been "16 years of violence" or, even better, "A Clockwork Banana". <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. If you ignore my advice and remove it anyway, drink. Trust me.
