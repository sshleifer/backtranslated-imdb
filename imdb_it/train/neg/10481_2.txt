The film is scarcely cast, except for some old Hollywood names. Other interpretations of unknown names (for example, Jennifer Gabrielle) are of little interest. I've seen other films by this director, unfortunately this is one of his worst. Maybe this is a reflection of the script? <br /> <br /> On a positive note, the performance of Kim Bassinger and Pat Morita saved the film from oblivion. I liked it a lot more in Karate Kid, though. There are many good movies to watch and, in short, this is not one of them. Save your money and celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
