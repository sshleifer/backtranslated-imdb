Generally I like to watch Burt Lancaster films - especially when it's necessary to go crazy with his impressive on-screen presence like in Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest strength, his magnetism, was occasionally also his greatest weakness, since he rarely, if ever, underestimated ANYTHING. And it is this lack of subtlety that really hinders The Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character had to be a kind of showman, but as Katherine Hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable. It should be smart, but it doesn't look like that when Lancaster's emphasis is launched on the screen! In addition to this, the story is perhaps one of the most seasonal films I have ever seen and it is too obvious that it is a game based movie. It seems only that it was mostly filmed in a sound stage instead of in the large and open West, as it should have been. <br /> <br /> Overall, a highly overrated film.
