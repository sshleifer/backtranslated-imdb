A disappointing film. <br /> <br /> History has established our protagonist as Chrissy, a "young" individual, rather grumpy, adrift, not doing much. Actually she does very little to move the narrative so that it doesn't surprise me to see the attention shift to her relatives. Too bad, Chrissy looks like an interesting character. <br /> <br /> The story was predictable and at times seemed quite formulated. So the question now is, when will we see Campions, Jacksons and the ground breaking of the Tamahori with compelling stories told by a movie that will inspire instead of amusing for the cost of two hours? <br /> <br /> Technically, a disgusting hit movie.
