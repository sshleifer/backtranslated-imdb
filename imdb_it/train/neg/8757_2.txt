Apparently a film that predicts the trends coming in British folk music is wrong on so many fronts that it's ridiculous. Tommy quickly? The honeycombs? The DOES movie includes a song by the band Spencer Davis, two by the Animals and one on the Beatles live movie with the live version of Twist and Shout (all 1:20). But all in all, an unusual display of British music around 1964. Oh, and Herman's Hermits.
