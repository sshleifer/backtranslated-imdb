The thing that viewers will remember most is the ugly headache that the film gave them because of the too showy, flickering, photographic work and fast and confusing cut. I'm not against this kind of stylistic devices if they are made just like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh to test most of their films, but in this case it was too STRANGE. It seems that the flashing jumps and lights that accompanied every flight over Mexico City and every important scene were there to distract you realizing that the story is pretty thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment is that you can easily understand how the whole thing will end. For a film that pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt, it is unforgivable that his story was told many times and with greater depth and character development. This is another disappointing aspect of the film. If I want to see an action movie over the top, I don't need any justification, but this film tried to justify the murderous madness of the Denzel Washington character and failed to provide credible performance. The first half hour or so nothing happens except that stupid archetypes and clich√©s are shown and when the action machine starts rolling it is cut so quickly that you don't know what's really going on. So the film does not work on the level of a credible drama / thriller, nor as a pure action film. Of course, the film is not as bad as some of the messy movies of the last few years, but I can't quite understand why so many people claim that this film is something fresh and so beautiful. For a video clip it is too long and for a film it has too little substance.
