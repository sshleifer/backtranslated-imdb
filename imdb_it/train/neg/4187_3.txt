A film written and directed by Neil Young, "Greendale" is little more than an 87-minute music video set on a doxen of the songwriter's works. Instead of dialogue, the film relies exclusively on Young's texts, which are heavily intertwined with socio-political comments, to tell the "story" while the actors play the scenes. <br /> <br /> Given the performance of the hammam and the poor grain of the photo, the effect is the equivalent of Young which makes some of his films explode at home and frees them for public consumption. Although there is presumably a "story" going through the film, we really have no idea what is happening, especially thanks to the unpolished aspect of the film, the lack of dialogue and the amateur ineptitude of acting. All we get for eighty-seven minutes is a group of old hippies silently jumping through an incoherent narrative while Young's songs play endlessly on the soundtrack. Everything turns into a boring exercise in self-indulgence. "Greendale" starts Hollywood, the low-budget movie is a bad name.
