I thought before starting with these films that it could be a good movie, but when I started I found it really terrible. They said the film was shot in Afghanistan, but I think 95% of the film is shot in India. you can see machines made in India. you can see lars bere bisleri (an Indian water brand), written in Hindi on the road, you can also see temples in Afghanistan * hahah * it's really fun and many other things that prove it wasn't shot in Afghanistan. I think one should not waste his time watching this movie .. pure waste of time .. I would recommend doing something else instead of watching this movie or it could be the heart is a better idea but don't watch this waste of time
