Lynch. Man has really fantastic things! He knows how to disturb us, then reward us by making us think in different ways. This, however, is completely different. Dumbland's reward is an absurd 1% comedy, earned by enduring 99% stupidity. I might have laughed once, but somewhere around episode 4 I just started looking forward fast. He has lost nothing. I felt relieved when it ended, and that's part of the point in this series. It's a boring series of annoying characters in annoying situations, complemented by boring animations, voices and sounds. But recognizing this and its other absurd qualities fails to make Dumbland useful.
