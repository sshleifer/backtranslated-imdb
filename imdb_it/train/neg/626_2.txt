The spirit of a murdered high school geek animates a scarecrow who then takes revenge on everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie really bothered me. He has a great looking monster, has good low-budget effects, a bit of atmosphere, but manages to short-circuit good things with bad things. Halfway through I started to go fast and then scroll through the chapters on the DVD. <br /> <br /> The problems with this film are many. First of all, the cast is about thirty, yet they should be in high school. Consequently, you don't believe anything from the start. The scarecrow, while it looks great is not much further. He says stupid a liner and moves in a way more designed to be fun and then scary. Is it a comedy or a horror movie? It is a problem that goes beyond one liners to most dialogs and configuration windows. It seems more like a feeling of every clich√© than a sincere horror movie. I somehow expect the film to have been designed for a very small audience, horror fans who want to make fun of the genre rather than hug it. <br /> <br /> Despite the beautiful monster, this is a film to avoid. Even if you collect it in the business basket for less than five dollars, you're paying too much. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
