I think we will all start many reviews with "This could have made a GREAT movie". A demented ex-convict, a clean suburban family, his goal. Revenge, punishment, manipulation. The usual Marty pose on Karo's syrup. But unfortunately somewhere in Universal's skyscraper a memorandum has come down: everyone is blocking it. <br /> <br /> Nolte speaks only with raised eyebrows, Lange makes her way through cigarettes, Lewis "Ohmagod's!" in his own way though his scenes, and Bobby D ... well, he's on a whole other magic carpet. Influencing a sort of hybrid Cajun / Huckleberry Hound accent, he chews big cigars and random atrocious shouts like "Problem Child". And I want you to imagine the aforementioned accent. Now imagine spitting out the religious rhetoric that beats the brain at full volume as if it had swallowed six bibles, and here you have the schtick of De Niro. The most distracted of all, however, is his more OVERDONE use of the "face of De Niro" for which he is so deceived. Half-closed eyes, rippled forehead, curled lips. Crimea, Bob, you look like a Plastic Man. <br /> <br /> The story apparently started off-screen 14 years earlier, when Nolte wasn't able to save De Niro time in the bighouse for various assaults. At the time of release, he feels that the discontent of Nolte at the time guarantees the terror of him and his peers. And we should give a small step to the character of De Niro because Nolte has hidden information that could have shortened his sentence. De Niro is one of these criminals who, while guilty of unspeakable acts, feels that his lack of freedom justifies the continuation of these acts on the outside. Mmm-kay. <br /> <br /> Goes behind Notle's neighbor (in a scene someone might want to dismiss), his wife, his daughter, the family dog, you know. What is one of the flaws in Wesley Strick's script: maximum predictability. As each of De Niro's harassment becomes more gruesome, you can practically call the rest of the action before it happens. Strick does not have to be totally discredited, since he manages some exciting moments of dialogue (the squalid exchange of De Niro and Lewis in an empty theater is the best scene in the film), but for the most part it is all distorted. Scorsese's cartoon-like approach is presented as forced, not to mention the horrible rhetoric of HORRIBLY Bernard Hermann (I continued to wait for the Wolf Man to present himself with a genetically enlarged tarantula). <br /> <br /> So we get to the comic part of the film. Involuntarily comic, that is. Do you know those scenes where something graphically horrible is happening, but you can't help but giggle at the sight of others? You'll do it here. Nolte and Lange who screamed with infidelity, De Niro's flirting, dressing up and a kitchen slide on a certain substance that must be seen to be believed. And the infernal, incessant, constant, harmful intentions, insignificant arrests of Bob of all the "philosophy" he discovered in prison. I wanted him killed to keep him quieter than to save this boring family. <br /> <br /> I always hate to borrow thoughts from other reviewers, but here it is necessary. This is really * Freddy Krueger's version of Scorsese. The way De Niro tastes, talks, pursues, endures pain, up to his jokes, it's vintage Freddy. After being burned by a pot of thrown water: "Are you trying to offer something warm?" Please. And this is just an example. <br /> <br /> Unless you were a fan of the original 1962 film and want to experience a thrill to see Balsam, Peck and Mitchum almost 30 years later (or want a serious movie to shake your head) experience), avoid a trip to Cape.
