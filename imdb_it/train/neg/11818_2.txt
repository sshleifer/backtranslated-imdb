On a distant planet a psychopath is saved from execution by a space monk. Release some prison companions and escape from the prison in a spaceship. They anchor on a huge and ridiculously spaceship in orbit around a supernova star. This huge trade is populated by just three people, presumably because the film's budget did not extend to the recruitment of many actors. In any case, to make it short, the three objects end up in a cat and mouse game with the bad guys. <br /> <br /> The psychopath in this film is curious to know that it is boring. 'Annoying' in general is not a term that could be used to describe a madman - upset, frightening, dangerous perhaps but not "annoying", but it is. The three people who patrol the giant ship are not very convincing in justifying such important roles: this ship is practically the size of a city! Considering that the film is set in about 50 years in the future, it is a bit optimistic that such a huge trade can exist, regardless of whether it is used for such a relatively trivial task. Despite the enormous dimensions of the spaceship, all the crews have frighteningly arranged the tiny rooms and the dining room is composed of what appears to be a plastic table and chairs. But there are many corridors. <br /> <br /> The film is fairly well interpreted and works like a mediocre science fiction thriller. But nothing exceptional.
