Note that I gave this 1 star if the option was given I would have given this zero. While I was putting this DVD on my TV and sitting on my couch, I expected some of the worst movies to produce the best. I saw this movie on IMDb and saw that it was the worst movie, so I think it went into every mistake. But he didn't prepare me for the crap he was about to throw up from my TV screen. <br /> <br /> The box makes this film look good ... at its best. DO NOT LEAVE THAT TOO. This film must be banned from all shelves around the world. <br /> <br /> The best way I can describe this film is like porn but without sex scenes. The acting (if you can call it that), the "plot" (so many holes must look like Swiss cheese), and the special effects are really terrible. <br /> <br /> Please, don't be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be fun to watch. <br /> <br /> In the end I'm not saying that I can make a better film than this, but I'm thinking about it.
