This film will be a success with those who have an exponential, senseless, explicit enjoyment of sexual exploits and F ... in almost every sentence. Do you like a good plot? Do you like comedy? How romanticism or other human values? Stay away from Whipped. It was so bad that I left after about half an hour. I saw two children slip around who looked about 10 - very harmful - this deserves an X.
