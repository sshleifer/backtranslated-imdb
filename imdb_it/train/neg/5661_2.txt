The premise, although not entirely ridiculous, was decidedly ridiculous. What SHOULD have happened, since the second meeting with Tritter was that the Mincer should simply be wasted. House hires a boy and de-physicalizes Tritter. In real life, Tritter would have been pulled up for harassment, the rectal thermometer episode would have been exposed in court, giving reasons and opportunities, and hospital lawyers would have munched meat grinders and the particular department he worked for. He would have been in jail as anyone would have done with the harassment of House, Chase, Foreman, Cameron, Wilson and Cuddy. The case would have won House a tasty taste, enough to keep it supplied to Vicadin until old age. While Tritter would have ended up somewhere driving a taxi, trying to rehabilitate himself by doing good to people for two years before people fell for having seen it all before.
