I'm still trying to figure out if there was a point in this movie. <br /> <br /> For content that should be so "rebellious" and "controversial" the things that Maddox distributes to students are terribly lame. Students seem to be easily influenced by vague anti-authoritarian sentiments and fragments of words scribbled illegally on flyers. Rebel, everyone. <br /> <br /> I suppose it would have been too much to ask for a teenage rebellion movie in which a fire alarm is not triggered. <br /> <br /> Apparently a huge fight on the football fields is a fight consisting of two people. <br /> <br /> Characters of the characters seem to vary wildly at random. A football athlete Maddox was fighting (and later got a paper clip in his face) is all smiles and apologies the next day. <br /> <br /> The fact that you don't arrive at any real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that the whole thing could have been inserted in half an hour after special school. If they had cut off most of the attempted pseudo-glitch soundtrack.
