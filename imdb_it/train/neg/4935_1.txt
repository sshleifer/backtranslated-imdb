"Cavernicoli" has exceeded my expectations, and not in a positive sense. It was even worse than I thought. Basically, here is the show: The Cavemen are an alternative race, they face prejudices, etc. Most probably the most stupid idea ever created; almost worthy of prison for writers. A show showed the cavemen entering a club, trying to pick up girls, and then nothing else happened. He remembered listening to a 22-minute dialogue by Andy Rooney, followed by the death of steak knives with midget cannibals. For those who have not seen this show, here is an example of the dialogue: "You are sure that you are well out with a caveman". "Yes, all right, I had 10 - a thousand!" Hilarious ... Perhaps the best script I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 22 minutes of cavemen with a horrible trick, facing difficult social issues ... It sounds like a fun evening. I also like how bad recent ideas are that they were forced to do a sitcom with auto insurance advertisements. I wonder if they will do the Gecko later, so I can get a new title for the worst show I've ever seen. I would even say it's worse than "Viva Laughlin". At least "Viva Laughlin" was torn away from something that was somehow inspired. <br /> <br /> Show how this makes me hope that there is a comet up there somewhere pointed to Earth. <br /> <br /> (Honestly honestly ...)
