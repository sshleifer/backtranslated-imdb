SPOILERS myths contained here. I'm ruining this film to spare you the trouble of having to watch it. <br /> <br /> The films of Jet Li fall into one of these two categories: films and films of the Shaolin period set in today's Hong Kong that revolve around triads or organizations similar to triads. Each genre has its best and worst films. `Twin Warriors' is the best Shaolin film from the Jet Li era while" The Evil Cult "is its worst. `Fist of Legend 'while in the recent past it is the best Jet Li movie of the modern era. `Black Mask 'is undoubtedly the worst. <br /> <br /> Jet Li plays a self-exiled mercenary who has received an injection that gives him a superhuman ability, but reduces his duration. In his "new life" in exile, he plays a pacifist librarian. When his old mercenary team continues to lash out, Jet Li becomes a vigilante determined to stop them. He wears a very silly corrugated cardboard mask to hide his identity from the police (and the public) as a librarian, as well as hiding his true identity from his former comrades in arms. <br /> <br /> the version I saw was dubbed, and horribly so. Why does Jet Li capture and hold his library colleague hostage if he is a pacifist? Is there a love story between them? Why doesn't the chief of police worry when he finds out the true identity of the Black Mask? The plot is simply BAD. Bad for the superhero cheesiness, bad in the sense that the characters are never properly developed, bad in the interactions between the characters, all complemented by a half-explained story to which I quickly lost interest. <br /> <br /> The martial arts action and sequences are really exaggerated. Lots of blood, cold blood (body parts truncated in abundance), explosions and flasks of super-human Matrix-style martial arts are featured in the film. Unfortunately this is the best and only selling point movie. If you want to see Jet Li playing a vigilant superhero in a Mission Impossible style movie, "Black Mask" offers. For the rest of us Jet Li fans is a real disappointment. This is one of those films in which Jet Li does not become Jet Li: he has no chance to fascinate us with his charisma, nor the chance to impress us with his impressive but realistic martial arts skills. <br /> <br /> Normally a Chinese Ozzy Osbourne knockoff would be enough to get me involved in a movie, unfortunately "Black Mask" turned out to be an exception to this rule. In fact the antagonist of this film, from the way it dresses, its long straight hair and round brand sunglasses, resembles the modern and aged Ozzy Osbourne. However the villain is not on the screen long enough to make the gimmick useful. I'm assuming that the resemblance to Ozzy was intentional; in addition to the appearance of the villain, he also ran a hiding place with a satanic aspect. Much more could have been done with the villain Ozzy Osbourne's stunt! If only the writer, the director or SOMEONE had taken the trouble to fund and develop the villain character of the film arc! <br /> <br /> `Black Mask 'was the first Jet Li movie released on video in the United States after Lethal Weapon 4, and I'm glad I stayed away from it so far. It may have ruined my entire perception of Jet Li as a martial artist and actor. If you want to see Jet Li at its worst, rent "Black Mask" and "The Evil Cult" and make it a double movie or a horror movie, both intentional and unintentional. Otherwise, stick to the moves that Jet Li's talents use, and have plots that are semi-well thought out and plausible. 3/9 stars.
