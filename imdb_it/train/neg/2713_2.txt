I like many actors / actresses involved in this project, so being insulted by the film was even worse than if they had used a stranger. The main problem was that this film was clearly just a concept created to please baby boomers. In 20 or 30 years NBC will probably make a film just like this in the early 90s. Now I can see it, a black family where children are involved in the uprising and the white family has rebellious children and listen to grunge rock music. The soundtrack will feature groups such as Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden etc. in this way I will be as picky as the 60s and I guarantee you that NBC will do it. See the biggest problem with vintage pieces when you're done buying nets is that when you live in a certain period you don't think that I live in the 60s or any decade are trendy at the time. The next time someone does something like this they should put more weight on the project
