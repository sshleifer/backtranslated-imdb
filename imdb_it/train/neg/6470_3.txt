Disney goes to the well too many times as anyone who has seen the original LITTLE MERMAID will feel brazenly robbed. Celebrating the birth of their daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric plan to introduce her to King Triton. The celebration is quickly crashed by Ursula's sister, Morgana, who plans to use Melody as a defense tool to get the king's trident. Arresting the attack, Ariel and Eric build a wall around the ocean while Melody grows up wondering why she can't get in there. <br /> <br /> Terrible and terrible is what describes this direct video sequel. LITTLE MERMAID 2 gives you that feeling that everything you watch seems to have come directly to other Disney movies. I imagine that Disney can only plagiarize itself! Don't tell me that the penguin and the walrus don't remind you of another couple from the LION KING! <br /> <br /> Other disappointing moments include the revenge between Sebastien and Louie, the royal chef. They played terribly! The climax between Morgana and TUTTI seemed to be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> I won't give anything, but in 75 minutes, everything seemed incredibly cramped and too much to handle. An embarrassment for Disney, LITTLE MERMAID 2 is best left in rent and laugh. So you can prepare the rest of the other sequels that Disney will drown in later.
