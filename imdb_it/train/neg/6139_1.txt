Thanks to G_d it was bombed, or we could be treated with delights like "Skate Fu" where we can see the likes of Brian Boitano performing a triple lutz and cutting the bad guys to the ribbons with his razor-sharp skates, but I digress. One thing that could have helped this turkey would have been some T & A by Mrs. Agbayani. It is not that the world would have seen something new (at least that part of the world that has seen its spread in Playboy). I truly believe that porn is suited to his "talents" so much better, even if Aubrey Hepburn couldn't have kept this sewer afloat. An explanation for the presence of Kurt Thomas could be a traumatic brain injury, perhaps resulting from coming too often to the landfill. It is a good thing that the CIO was not as diligent in "doping" as they are now, or Kurt would surely have been deprived of his medals. To be avoided at all costs.
