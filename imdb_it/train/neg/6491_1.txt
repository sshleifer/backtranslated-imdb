This film was a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> I saw this film with a group of film enthusiasts, who have a varied taste in the movies and are always a keen eye for a work of "genius" (as my fellow commentators on this site have had the guts to label this steaming pile ??); none of them found a single saving quality. We have closed the film with a thrilling chorus of imprecations that I will not reprint here. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the positive reviews reported here were written by Sir Anthony Hopkins himself. After all, as one of those reviewers will tell you, did he finance the movie himself? because no one else in Hollywood or anywhere else in the world, for that matter, would risk a single penny or their good name in association with this film. Don't let the semi-famous actors that appear in the film lure you into its clutches? as Christian Slater admits in the special features "making of" he signed the film without reading the script or knowing any details (a folly I am sure he will never repeat). <br /> <br /> Too bad for the unfortunate individual who stumbles into this quagmire of self-indulgence written, directed, produced and financed by a man too famous to admit to himself that not everything he creates is a masterpiece if you don't believe me, please google "Anthony Hopkins" and art).
