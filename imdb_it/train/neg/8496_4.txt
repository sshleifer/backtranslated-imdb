Have you ever seen a movie composed entirely of long shots? No? Me neither. Well, I finally saw one in "Spring in my Hometown", and I have to confess, now I SO WHY people don't. The technique is "arty", of course, but it is certainly NOT ripe for public consumption. The technique is heavily imperfect simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, and perhaps this could be the intention of the director. I don't know, I can't read minds, and I certainly don't know enough about the director to make a judgment. <br /> <br /> But one thing about this movie that is painfully obvious is its ridiculous anti-American feelings. As an American, I am well aware of my country's participation in the Korean War, and I am perfectly aware that we have not always been angels, but I would be damned if I take this guy's version of how things happened. According to this blind fool, the Americans were not only at the root of the war, we were the cause of the war, and we almost destroyed the country. Anyway, Mr. Director. And I suppose you'd still be doing this movie in the KOREA OF THE TOWN if we hadn't interfered, right? Talk about forgetting your story. This is almost like making the Nazis "good boys" while turning the allied forces into "bad guys". This film is so historically naive and so inaccurate as to be almost embarrassing to watch. For a man who comes from a country that owes its very EXISTENCE to American interference, it is certainly up to it, powerful and critical.
