The strange people who live in a city spend their lives. There is a guy who licks everything, a diver who finds a body that he takes home to live with him, a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her, a boy who wants to purify the girls of their bad ways ... unusual in the extreme, this black and white film is better without color. The monochrome takes the edge from the two steps at the top with respect to the feel of the home movie. Like a film Troma, this film is fun, but mostly it's strange for the sake of the weirdoes and it soon becomes a hard nuisance since you see the productions you can guess where a lot of time is going, not always - but enough not to be funny. (Even if I didn't see the cleaning coming). It's worth it if you have nothing else to look at and are waiting for the next Golden Girls series to come to Netflix.
