It is worth watching the movie only if you stop it after half an hour. It starts with fun conversations in a bar and a good, funny story is expected to arrive. Well, I can tell you it won't come. It will deteriorate in a few minutes in a film that puts a strain on your patience and even your feelings of shame for the actors who probably won't be happy to see. <br /> <br /> In an interview I heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that, according to him, most people in this globalizing world experience. I was surprised to hear it. Am I living in the same world that you live in? OK, a lot of people go around with the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and everything, but that doesn't make me feel like I'm losing my identity. What does Khrzhanosvky think, that we are no longer of the clothes we wear and the films we watch? Am I nearsighted or is he? <br /> <br /> Well my vote: the good start of the film saves him from getting 1, a decent 4 is my conclusion.
