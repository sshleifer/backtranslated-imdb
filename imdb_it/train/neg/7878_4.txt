I'm a big fan of the original book and this adaptation is simply bad. First of all, he had difficulty deciding whether it was a kiddie toon or an adult, which caused a strange mix of an adult story and some pretty violent scenes with a little duck that continues to give "funny" moments to 'beginning. br /> <br /> But it is not very important, the film is simply boring, immobile and not faithful to the original story. He simply cannot transfer to the image all the points that Orwell tried to bring to his book. <br /> <br /> {SPOILER} <br /> <br /> Second revolution? !! Didn't they learn anything guys ?? Who will be the next Napoleon then? Benjamin? !!
