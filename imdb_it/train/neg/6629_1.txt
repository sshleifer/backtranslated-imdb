If you've seen the 1975 Sholay, don't watch this movie. If you have NOT seen the Sholay of 1975, go to LOOK IT. But don't watch this movie. This film contains all the ingredients that could have gone wrong in making a Sholay remake. <br /> <br /> Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the role of a psychological villain at best (probably the only 40 minutes of the reel that should not be burned). If you remove the rest of the movie and only watch Amitabh play with his character, it's still worth watching. But as Insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal does not do justice to his talent. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is extremely trivial and the only reason I think, they chose Prashant Raj as Raj is because he has a striking resemblance to Amitabh of his young days. Sushmita Sen behaves well, with grace and makeup. But the award for "WORST interpretation and every role to date" must go to Nisha Kothari. He manages to degrade his acting to such a level that even the high school drama could eclipse his performance. <br /> <br /> If you have a deadly enemy, take him to this movie. :)
