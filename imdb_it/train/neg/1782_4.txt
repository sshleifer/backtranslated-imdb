A charming boy and his mother move to an unknown city, cats and death soon follow them. This sums up. <br /> <br /> I admit that I'm a little scared of cats after watching this movie. But in all seriousness despite the many things that don't go in this film, and believe me there are many around, it's overall a very pleasant visual experience. <br /> <br /> The characters are more like caricatures here with only their basic instincts to rely on. Fear, greed, pride or anger seem to be all that motivates these people. Although it can be argued that this apparent failure actually serves to tell the story. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a script by Stephen King (not that I have anything specific against Mr. King) are quite well supported by some interesting special effects, pretty makeup and music. The absolute gem of this film is undoubtedly Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady, the otherworldly mother. <br /> <br /> King manages to make a simple story of outsiders, or people who are a little different (okay - a lot in this case), trying to adapt and torment him in a camp above the little gem of horror that must be in the collection of any horror fan.
