"Triumph of love" is proof that not all the authors of Comédie-Française who use masked courtship disguised as Shakespeare deserve to be seen. <br /> <br /> Or perhaps something has been lost in the translation of this adaptation by Marivaux, a comedy inspired by Commedia Dell Arte of which Brittannica states: "His vague feeling and his clever pun became known as marivaudage" . <br /> <br /> While Mira Sorvino enjoys swinging three mixed novels, the role of her pants was not even as good as Cherubino in "Matrimonio di Figaro". <br /> <br /> Erotic editing is annoying and only seems to indicate that a lot of takes were needed for each long speech. <br /> <br /> The best was Fiona Shaw as the deceived spinster, as well as the costumes. <br /> <br /> The glimpses of the public we see and the closing curtain call the wink that this is all artifice doesn't really help. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 05/29/2002)
