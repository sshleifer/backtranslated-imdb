I wandered through this movie after seeing "Borat" of 82 minutes tonight, and I was pretty disappointed. I was a big fan of Wallace and Gromit, and used to go to see animated films. That said, I found myself nodding and at some point I almost left, but I was waiting for this movie to improve. <br /> <br /> The images are stunning and the vocal work is top notch, especially in my opinion, that of Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remind myself sometimes that the villain of the bulbous lizard was Gandalf and Magneto). The problem with this movie for me is that it is one of those animated features for the ADD set. Record after the fact as one crazy slapstick after another routine, weighed down by a story full of treacle that pulls out every stop in an attempt to convey an "important message". It looks a bit like Oscar's burnt bait for the animated category, and considering the way he's scoring with the critics, I wouldn't be surprised if the Academy is wrong and offers its hardware. But if you're looking for a fun animated mice movie, follow my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
