I really wanted him to like me, but in the end it's a poorly made film, with a few laughs. <br /> <br /> Politics is apt, will offend the devil of the Republicans but that's what it was designed to do. This alone gives me reason to giggle. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it seems done in a REAL hurry (like about a week). And it contains a stupid subplot on some child singer, who seems to be completely off the subject. <br /> <br /> Turiqistan is obviously Iraq, or Afghanistan, or any other number of countries with which the United States struggled in the 1950s. The humor is a bit gloomy (amputees dancing with prosthetic legs made by the Tamerlane corporation) but it's in the sign, especially with companies that collect the reconstruction ("lite democracy"!) <br /> <br /> However like a lot of satire that criticizes the United States, it looks terribly heavy and fatigued. I imagine that it is going against the trend with the propaganda of so many bs so it must hit the people in the head to make a point. Who knows. I prefer a little bit of nudge, a touch of approach - a bit of subtlety. But it's just me. <br /> <br /> Anyway I could watch it again, maybe I missed something. <br /> <br /> I hope "W" is more in the mark.
