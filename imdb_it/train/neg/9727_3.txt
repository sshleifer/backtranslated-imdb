Another of my insights into the business basket, this film gave me exactly what I expected - a load of trash horror complete with screaming women. <br /> <br /> It all started so well - I liked the little introduction with the "newsreel" on the young couple that was exposed to a nuclear explosion, and was completely absorbed until the first person had caught fire ... <br /> <br /> From then on the film fell to foolishness, and sometimes it became almost embarrassing to watch. When the heroine turned out to have been afflicted with the same conditions as the main character (the ability to turn on her farts without the help of a game) it almost seemed like someone had thrown the idea at the last moment ("that you will be good ! "you can almost hear them say ...) As for the almost psychic bond between the main character and the nuclear power plant, well ... <br /> <br /> The film appeared cheap tat: if you pay more Â£ 1.50 for doing it.
