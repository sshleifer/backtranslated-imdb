Matt Cordell came back from the dead for a third lap, although I'm not sure anyone was interested at this point except for the rabid MANICA COP fans. Cordell, who died in the last film, is resurrected through voodoo, and is now on the trail of many thugs involved in the shootings of an official colleague to whom Cordell is very fond of. I missed a part of this low-budget quickie from the 90s, but it was nice to see Cordell destroying the body bill in various gruesome ways. The problem is that the film is quite static and Cordell is simply not Jason or Freddy. The interest falls quickly, even with that great master of the film B Robert Forster as a doctor who ends up with a scrambled brain. Follow the first movie in the series, which is fun, scary and exciting, all at the same time.
