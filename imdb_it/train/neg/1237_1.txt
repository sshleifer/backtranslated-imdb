I had VERY low expectations for this supposed "re-imagination" of the original - and they weren't even met! What were they thinking? (Answer: they were not). Please don't waste your time at this Hollywood trash party. Stop your nails, balance the checkbook, do something other than watch this. Remember: if you hire things like that, he'll make them do more.
