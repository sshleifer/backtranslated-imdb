I saw the mask in the 80s and is currently on display on Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember thinking that it was a bit cold during the day and he also had a couple of toys, but watching him now bores me to tears. I had never realized before how tedious and bland this comic was. It's just awful! It's not where near in the same league as The Transformers, He-man or Thundercats and was soon forgotten by almost everyone once it stopped being done. I only watch it on Fox Kids because Ulysses 31 comes right after (ie if the mask doesn't let me fall asleep first). One of the cartoons of the 80s that I hope I can completely forget again once I finish shooting on Fox Kids!
