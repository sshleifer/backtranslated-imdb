This film had good intentions and a good story to work with. The director and screenwriter of this film failed miserably and created a boring and boring film that made me feel like I was back at the Hartford social class in the eighth grade, back in 67. <br /> <br / > What a waste, someone will want to take this story and make it a real movie - the story deserves it. <br /> <br /> Whenever a scene has potential, all we had left was a few clich√©s, combined with the black and white that they probably got from The History Channel to show the action. Shameful. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis was the only bright light in this boring party. The other acting was incredibly boring: it suited the film well and anyone who played the Captain set a new low standard for the delivery of the line. <br /> <br /> However, if you are willing to accept all the many flaws in this movie and don't worry about being intimidated or entertained, but want to learn about USS Mason, it's worth watching.
