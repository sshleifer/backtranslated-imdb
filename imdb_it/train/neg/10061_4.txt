'The Curse of Frankenstein' faithfully adheres to the story of Mary Shelley for a word from the title, which would not be so bad if the changes were any good. The tragedy of the creature that destroys Frankenstein's family has been completely erased and replaced by ... nothing. The heart and the moral center of the story have disappeared. It doesn't help that this Frankenstein is a conniving and devious killer; he deserves everything he gets. The plot is basically a little detailed list of Frankenstein's clich√©s. Even taken in his own way, this is rubbish: a bland and rambling film with a shite-looking creature with a bowl haircut. Since it's the first of Hammer's horror films, directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, his place in the horror story is sure. But it's shit.
