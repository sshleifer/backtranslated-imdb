Wow. I've seen some really bad movies in my day, but this really takes the cake. It's the worst movie I've seen in the last ten years - no exaggeration. <br /> <br /> As a veteran of the US military in Afghanistan, I found it almost impossible to even watch this ridiculous film, not because it brought back memories - far from it - but because there was no absolutely no attempt at "authenticity" to be found in any part of the film. Not as much as the smallest shred. It appears to have been written by an 8-year-old boy who got all his notions of war (and soldier behavior) directly from the comics. The film was made in Honduras, which should have been a clue, but even this cannot fully explain the atrocious production values ​​of this piece of cliché junk. <br /> <br /> I could try to list all the endless technical flaws, but it would take almost forever. From the ancient patches on the shoulders that were not seen or worn by the Second World War, and the character plates, such as "ColCollins" (worn by the character "Colonel Collins"), which was actually written using the mirror image "N" of the Russian alphabet (not of the American alphabet) the list goes on forever. The uniforms, the equipment, the plot, and above all the behavior of the characters themselves - every single scene was crammed full of ridiculous flaws, inaccuracies and clichés absolutely senseless. <br /> <br /> Neither the plot itself nor the characters were the least believable or credible. It was all ridiculous, childish, to the extreme. Obviously it was a film destined to appeal strictly to pre-pubescent boys, and I have little doubt that they too would find this film absolutely absurd. <br /> <br /> In short, this film has absolutely no redemption at all. It's a total waste of time. I highly recommend anyone reading this to pass this rubbish of; it's not really worth wasting a single moment of your time.
