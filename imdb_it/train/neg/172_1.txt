The return to the lake hut does not conform to the original in any way. With only one main character (Stanley) returning for the sequel, the film isn't even worth the 2 hours of your time. I'm a big fan of the first film, the plot and the acting were really good, but this is a film I will never watch again. It is basically the same as the sequences of Urban Legends and Blair Witch, but with much worse acting. I've personally seen him perform better in soap operas, it's so painful that you just have to laugh. I, in no way, recommend this film to anyone, observing it, it will merely diminish the former.
