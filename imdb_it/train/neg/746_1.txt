Save $ 8.97 to spend at Walmart to buy this DVD and go see the real Steven Spielberg movie. <br /> <br /> I am a director and, being a huge fan of HG Wells, I had to buy this he hopes to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment. Instead, it took four days to finish watching this because I couldn't bear to watch more than 10 minutes at a time. It's horrible. <br /> <br /> There are reports that Timothy Hines had a budget of $ 20 million for this production. Where the hell did she go? Did you use most to buy a new home? Financing your retirement? Or what? Let me start with what is really good in this film. It remains true to the book and there are some good performances in it. I can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good movie. But the good performances were quickly obscured by horrible ... and I mean horrible special effects. Any freshman film school student could have done a much better job with CGI. For me, most of it looked like "stop action" card clippings that were used rather than sophisticated CGI software that a $ 20 million project should use. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this film. My partner and I sat down and recreated our version of the Ferry scene using software that cost less than $ 1500.00 and in one day had five minutes of the scene that looked better and more realistic than those created by Hines. I have seen films with budgets of less than $ 2 million. Much better. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the special effects used in the original King Kong were more sophisticated and better than Hines special effects in this film. In fact, I have a much better appreciation for Attack of the Killer Tomatoes because of this movie. There is no excuse with today's technology for a film that looks like a B-Movie from the 1950s unless that was the intention, which should not have been with this particular project. <br /> <br /> A problem I had with the DVD transfer is that the film is jerky, another demonstration of amateur filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to say that I produced a $ 45,000 project in 2003 that has better cinematography and special effects than this film. /> <br /> I strongly encourage anyone who appreciates the good movie or who is a WOTW fan to leave this movie on the shelf and watch Attack of the 50 Foot Woman instead. It would be easier on the eyes.
