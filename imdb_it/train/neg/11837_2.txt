Can anyone make good CGI movies besides Pixar? I really mean, the animation looked outdated compared to 2006 standards and even to the 1995 Toy Story standards. Or maybe they spent all their budget on Hugh Jackman. Whatever their reasoning, the story has really sucked. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Hugh Jackman is a mouse - a mouse that is thrown down in a bathroom. Yes, I know, it seems stereotyped. But then the sewer imitated the streets of London - to some extent. Throw a promise of jewels (????) and an evil frog (??) and get a pathetic attempt at entertainment. <br /> <br /> I would like to say something to entertain me. Maybe the link in the movie? Or perhaps the happy relationship of rats. But nothing did. He had talent, but he exploded. D-
