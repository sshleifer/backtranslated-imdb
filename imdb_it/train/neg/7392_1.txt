I look around in the still shocked video store of how Steven Seagal with his track record of bad action movies can still have 3 movies on the shelves in less than a year. The strength of the attack being the 3 not less promised the first entry in the genus Sci Fi for our ever wider Seagal. The visions of the bad cinematographic entertainment flashed before my gullible eyes. Unfortunately this is not the case with entertainment and a film as bad as they are. <br /> <br /> Seagal bounced a bit with the Trashy - but fun Shadow Man the last time we saw it. However, Attack force must be his worst film ever! Don't argue for a Kill, Ticker, or even the Black Dawns. This is the bottom of the septic tank here. <br /> <br /> Whoever says it is the return to form of Steven Seagal should be forced to write a 100-page essay on the word Taste. <br /> <br /> Seagal is another agent / I'm a damn supreme, once again named Lawson wants revenge for killing his team that leads him to a nefarious plot to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting public. Not to mention retailers are not around here. <br /> <br /> The entire production from directing to acting is poor. Was this film shot in the dark? It should be the most poorly lit film by Howling 2. The action is terrible and very badly done. <br /> <br /> The producers have also unwisely decided to do what the fans hate the most: to launch in double acrobatics after a double double and horribly nicknamed Steven Seagal. shows little enthusiasm here. Can you blame him? <br /> <br /> While it was said that the Attack of the Force was not the film that Stevie had signed (originally Harvester) and surely it had to be better than Attack force. tampering with production didn't make it more coherent and made Seagal look worse. I feel bad for Directer Michael Keusch and writer Joe Hal pin as they will be judged forever for the thoughtless production launches. <br /> <br /> So Now This leaves Seagal in an impossible position to find something to atone for this mess. But after seeing how bad Attack Force turned out, did we really want him to make another movie?
