Some funny humor, a bit flat, a decent acting, something that is pretty atrocious. This film is simply fickle, guaranteed to entertain kids 12 years older than any other niche. <br /> <br /> The child actors in the film are simply not funny. When you are doing a family comedy, this tends to be a problem. Beverly D'Angelo rises above the material to give it a strange, and I dare say, human performance in the midst of this mediocrity.
