I hope everyone who trained these losers on their accents has been fired. The only highlights are some of the supporting characters, 3 of my 5 favorites were eliminated by the end of the season (and one of them was a cat, to put it in perspective). <br /> <br /> The whole plot focuses on sex and nothing else. Sex with vampires, gay sex with gay vampires, gay sex with straight vampires, sex to mark vampire blood, sex after drinking vampire blood, sex in front of vampires, vampire sex, non-vampire sex, sex because we're afraid vampires, sex because we're angry with vampires, sex because we've just become a vampire, etc. <br /> <br /> Nothing against sex, it would be nice if it was a little thinner with being seasoned in the plot. Maybe they HAVE a plot and then we get some sex. But they didn't even bother to do it ... and Anna Paquin is a dizzy tooth bitch. Either he sucks or his character sucks, I can't figure out which one. <br /> <br /> Another part of the plot that I find highly implausible is because the 150-year-old vampire Bill who seems to have his stuff together would be interested in someone like Sookie. He's constantly flying away from the handle to him for things he can't control. He leaves for two days and she decides that he "won't come back" and suddenly has feelings for the dog-man? Give me a break. She should be a 25-year-old woman, not a 14-year-old girl. The people next to her are dying all over the place, and she has the brightest smile on her face because she just gave her boyfriend a V-card because he can't read his mind? As the main character in the story, I would have hoped the show would have done a little more to make it understandable and someone to invest your interest in, not someone who continues to secretly hope to be killed or comatose. I can't find anything about her character that I like and even the fact that she is able to read minds is extraordinarily uninteresting and no less interesting. <br /> <br /> I will not be wasting my time watching Season 2 come June.
