"Phantasm" from 1979 was a very suggestive horror film, creepy, scary and very original, and, in a word, cult. The first sequel of 1988 was bloody, witty, full of action and very funny. After the first sequel however, the creator of "Ghost" Don Coscarelly apparently had no new ideas. "Phantasm III - Lord Of The Dead" of 1994 is certainly not a complete failure, it is also quite funny, but there is no more originality, and the desperate attempts to introduce something new are sometimes tiring, which makes it quite disappointing compared to its predecessors. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> At the beginning, we are presented with the secret behind the mysterious sentinel balls (the flying silver balls that suck the brain). From that moment on, a number of unnecessary and annoying new characters (like Tim, a "Home Alone" style guy who seems to be good at shooting, a Rocky, a black girl and a nunchaku with a brush cut) are introduced . The film also has its qualities: Reggie Bannister is again very cool like the ponytailed guitar that plays Reggie. Angus Scrimm is still quite terrifying as the tall man, but the fact that the tall man talks a lot more in this film makes him lose some of his creepy. The character of Mike is played again by Michael Michael Baldwin (he was replaced by James LeGros in the second part), which, in my opinion, does not make much difference. The gore keeps the film interesting enough to watch, but it is still a disappointment, especially since the attempts to make up for the lack of ideas become annoying quickly enough. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Phantasm III" is an acceptable waste of time, but it is certainly disappointing compared to its predecessors. Fans of the first two "Phantasm" movies can try it, but I advise you not to set your expectations too high.
