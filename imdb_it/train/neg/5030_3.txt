What is there in the skies? Is it a plane? Is Superman ?? Errr, no ?? Is it a TURTLE!?! See, this is what becomes of the Cold War! Nothing but bad news and other problems! The Americans shoot down a Russian fighter plane somewhere in the Arctic territory and the subsequent explosion crumbles and literally awakens the gigantic prehistoric turtle creature named Gammera. He / she is not a very friendly critic as he promptly proceeds to destroy everything and everyone in his path. The descending governments eventually decide to kill the ugly bastard with a brand new and super-sophisticated ice bomb, but does Gammera have another surprise in store? The damn turtle can fly! The first time this happens translates into a tremendously grotesque and fun sequence! Gammera lies on his back apparently defeated when suddenly the fire is released from his armpits and he shoots into the air. how can you not love him? Then there is also a devious plot about an annoying child who is able to communicate telepathically with the monster, but it is not interesting enough. Flying turtle, people !! There is very little else to write about this Japanese science-fiction effort (and re-edited in America), apart from that it is an obvious and totally shameless reputation for classics like the original Godzilla and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. The effects and design of the monsters are extremely drunk and, unlike the films mentioned above, it never manages to create an apocalyptic environment. Respectable actors such as Brian Donlevy ("The Quatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") seem unaware of the movie set they are in and even the original scenes of Japanese chaos are not very convincing. Gammera's very personal and personalized music theme is quite interesting, so he gets a little more for it.
