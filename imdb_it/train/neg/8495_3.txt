I'm the kind of person who went to the local library and read about Babbage's engine of difference while my schoolmates played soccer, etc. So if there is something like a target audience for this movie, then I guess I will probably be included in this. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just need to watch it again. A previous reviewer mentioned not watching this movie while he is tired. Maybe it was my mistake. <br /> <br /> I did my best to enjoy this movie, and there are aspects that I like, but overall I found it amateurish and quite tiring. <br /> <br /> Being a bit of a computer nerd who confessed, I can't help but understand the exact time period in which the film was actually made, and how the graphics used reflect that time (ie 1997). Having played games of the era cf. "Mind Grind" to cite an example, this film cannot escape the explosion of low-res 16-bit colors of that era. Now fortunately this has decreased a little in the last few years in the gaming world, at least, in favor of the real game. <br /> <br /> Having to resort to this film via a German FTA satellite channel (as I do not have I think it was ever broadcast on FTA TV in the UK, well, not recently, however, I was slightly amused in the see the end credits Gottdog (the dog of God) had 4 people working on his design.Perhaps it is petty of me to be amused by this, since ten years have passed since the film was made, however the final result makes the graphics of the eighties film look good by comparison. <br /> <br /> But, as in the main story, I agree that the format is not the best idea. , I agree that Ada deserves a film without the science fiction angle, and a more direct biographical approach would perhaps be better suited to cover the life story of this extraordinary lady. <br /> <br /> There are fundamental errors that to undermine my enjoyment of this film, first of all, the idea on the basis that somehow lost real-world information from the past can be accurately reconstructed through a sort of extrapolation through intelligent software-based agents, it seems somewhat ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the theme of the film that a computer device can actually predict the mechanics of all things over time (such as winds) is now known to be not the case. <br /> <br /> OK, so the Victorians could have kept this vision but the 20th century GÃ¶del's works that show that no mathematical system can be complete, Turing's works on the limits of computability, not to mention the chaos theory and quantum mechanics, have completely undermined these ideas, which seem central to the way the modern researcher software should work. <br /> <br /> Finally, even the click of the mouse in the air to mean "programming" is simply wrong, as mentioned above. <br /> <br /> This film might have been OK, but at least some technicians in the scientific consultation would have given the film much needed credit in credibility episodes. <br /> <br /> I will not forget the film however, as "Pi", it is clearly a unique work, but also with many fatal mistakes for me to really enjoy it, 3/10 from me.
