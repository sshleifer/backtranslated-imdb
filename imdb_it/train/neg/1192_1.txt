I completely agree with jamrom4 .. this was the single most horrible film I've ever seen .. sacred disgust was terrible .. I was warned not to see it..and foolishly I looked at it anyway .. about 10 minutes in the painful experience I completely gave up looking at the atrocity .. but I sat down until the end .. just to see if I could .. well I did it and now I wish I didn't have it.It was disgusting .. nothing happened and the final was the whole sermon ... no film that evil has the right to survive .. I implore you all to spare you the fear of fat pushes the bus ... if only you had listened to the same warning ... please, spare you same from this movie .. I have the feeling that those who have rated it highly have been involved in the making of the film .. and everyone should be erased from the face of the planet ..
