I went to the film as a preview preview in Austria. So I had no idea what I saw. The story is very normal. The film is very long, I think it could be reduced to 1/2 without causing plot problems. It's the kind of movie you can see on a boring night that you are most bored! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is OK. The film is about the US coast guards, how they are trained, their lifestyle and the problems they face. As there are not many effects in the film. So if you want to watch it, there's no need to waste money and time going to the movies. It would be more effective to watch it at home when it comes to DVDs.
