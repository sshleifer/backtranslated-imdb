this is a terrible and terrible film !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> first of all TOOO. the longest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> even the stories are damn superb !!!! <br /> <br /> in fact there are too many stories that the story line is in ruins. <br /> <br /> the play was not comedy !!!!! it wasn't funny at all .... <br /> <br /> the story is so repugnant and poorly written that it doesn't matter if the characters live or die ....... <br /> <br /> I have had expectations from this movie ......... but my expectations were completely broken in the first minutes ...... <br /> <br /> the only good thing about this movie is the MUSIC ...... and of course Vidya Balan. she gives the best interpretation and stands out among all the senior actors ...... she is just a newcomer, yet she shines and makes the rest of the cast look so pathetic !!!!! Govinda and the blonde who plays her love interest also help save this disastrous film. Govinda adapts perfectly to the role of the taxi driver. and the blonde also offers a very subtle and consistent performance .... <br /> <br /> another talented actress Ayesha Takiya is completely wasted on this movie !!!! so it is priyanka !!!!!!!!! Akshay plays his role well but seemed too exaggerated !!!!! Even Anil and Juhi are totally wasted ...... <br /> <br /> the only one who is not wasted is Salman Because he has no talent for never wasting it !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> all in all this is a very impossible film with the script Mishmashed and TOOO Masladar that the plot is modeled according to the stupid scenes of the comedy. imagine how stupid this movie is !!!!!! <br /> <br /> 3/10 is 4 hours long !!!! think and RETHINK before going to the cinema !!!!! better to avoid it !!!!!
