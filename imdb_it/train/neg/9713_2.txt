The first time I saw Cold Case was after it was broadcast for about a year on Danish television. By the time he arrived on TV, he almost drowned in 4 or 5 other American crime shows broadcast around the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw it and I got bored to death. Poor actors with self-justified faces and morals were a pain in the back. The whole premise that so much money has been given to a team of investigators to resolve murders dating back to 10-20-30 or even 60 years seems so unlikely. <br /> <br /> Time is also a factor as they only have 50 to 60 minutes to tell the story, which means they can break through just in time to solve the case and bring justice to surviving family members, if they are still alive. This combined with the "personal" problems and investigator reports that must be the time to leave the show a complete slack. <br /> <br /> I give him a 2-star rating because of the music at the end which is really the only reason to watch it .... which of course you won't do because it's TOO MUCH a reason to watch this shit.
