I like Chris Rock, but I feel it's wasted on this movie. The idea of ​​redoing Heaven Can Wait is fine, but the filmmakers closely followed that turkey's plot. When Eddie Murphy redid Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he totally re-made them - so they became Murphy movies / vehicles, not just warm remakes. That's why they were successful. If Chris had done the same, this could have been a much better film. The few laughs that come are when he is doing his stand-up routine, so he could even make a concert movie. It would have been a lot more fun if the white man in the body was a truck driver or a hillbilly. So why does Hollywood continue to make junk like this? Because people go to see it - because they like Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent script and give us better movies! Don't make films that weren't so good in the first place!
