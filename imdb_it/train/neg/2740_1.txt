I still don't know why I forced myself to sit down for the whole thing. This "movie" was not worth the Memorex DVD-R on which it was burned; I thought I saw the final result of a group of high school students stealing their parents' video camera. This is by far the worst movie ever made. Actually, from the bottom of my heart, I want to sue Aaron Yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life. <br /> <br /> So apparently, it should be bad on purpose; However, if you were to go to hell and be forced to watch this 90 minute doo-doo spiral, you will see that Yamasato is really trying to make a fantastic movie. The actors attempt dramatic performances like those of Crimson Tide, but they approach The Marine. <br /> <br /> Crap acting is just the tip of the iceberg. The corners of the camera are horrible. The story is C-movie at its best - the plot isn't even good enough to be considered the caliber of the B-movie. Dialogue tries to be dynamic and witty, but it's shit like everything else. It is said that a copy of the script actually attracts flies. Also, the techno score is annoying ... not because it's techno, but because it's NON-STOP. That's right, the music plays ALL THE TIME in the background, acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is. I don't care what the non-liability statement states, I don't buy it. BOTS was not done so badly on purpose, because it behaves too seriously for what it was: a joke. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was very low budget. But it's not an excuse for his record-setting suction factor. Great films are born of substance, not budget. The BOTs had neither. <br /> <br /> Let me further articulate the overwhelming power of this 90-minute waste of time: if I had a triple with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel in front of a TV and Blood of the Samurai arrived, I'd be out of there faster than Steven Seagal in the executive decision. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, some people will try to defend the film. Two, maybe three. They will say "it's the hard grinder!" or "cheesy in a good way!" or "it's so ugly, it's good!" Those people are idiots. A film is good or bad. There is no good bad movie. But there are things like idiots who like shoddy movies. Do not get me wrong; there are a lot of movies that you don't take seriously, don't miss, that are fun and funny. Slither is one. BOTS is not. <br /> <br /> This suckfest lasts about an hour and a half and, in my humble opinion, is 90 minutes long. The best thing about this "movie" is the DVD cover, so the next time you're near the Wal-Mart DVD box, take a look at ... DON'T TOUCH IT, look ... and go quietly away.
