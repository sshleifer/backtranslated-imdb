All right. So there aren't really that many good films out there. Recent gems like American Dream, The Straight Story and even Toy Story 2 are usually not so close. But boy (!) This film balances quality. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what these people thought they were doing. Are the financiers in this world so easily convinced to finance such a crock of ****? I can only see it now ... <br /> <br /> Producer - "So we have Joe Fiennes, he is cute as a button and he was very good at Shakespeare in Love and we have Rhys Ifans, he is not cute but he is nice in Notting Hill: we will discover a mediocre soundtrack, some forgettable post-Britpop songs, the hemlock root and the lizard brain, and soon we will have the worst movie of the new millennium. "<br /> <br /> The Bank -" I like it! Any sex not necessary? Bad camera movements? on the worst accents on this side of Devil's Own? "<br /> <br /> Manufacturer -" Yes, we have a lot. "<br /> <br /> The Bank -" Sounds great, where do we sign?? "<br /> <br /> Please.
