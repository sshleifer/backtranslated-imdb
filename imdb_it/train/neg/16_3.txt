There are many good-looking people in this movie. This is probably the best thing. Perhaps this is also worth looking at. <br /> <br /> "Loaded" tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a young man who is about to make his mark on the world. He is the son of a wealthy family with a good reputation, and is going to law school. But like many of these settings, things are not as perfect as they appear. Expectations in this family far exceed love. Except for school, Tristan's father rarely lets him leave the house. This appears to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family, which is partially revealed through flashbacks but is not explained to the end. Tristan's claustrophobic environment leads him to go wild in extreme ways at the first possible opportunity, when his friends take him to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The celebration soon follows some strippers at a beach party, and from there, Tristan makes friends with Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), who drags him into a hell of a drug. <br /> <br /> While technically well done, this the film suffers from a lackluster script and a plot that is not very engaging. Moreover, counting on this film there are some constant tricks that generally seemed annoying and out of place, like slow-motion, fast motion, freeze-frames and echos. These are the types of effects that a director could normally use to show the perspective of a character while taking drugs, except that in this case they seem to have been sporadically launched at random, in some economic attempt at style. <br /> <br /> Despite the relative unknown cast, the performances were good all around, in particular compared to the main antagonist (Corey Large). I suspect we will see at least a couple of these people in bigger and better projects in the future. <br /> <br /> Of course, when I mention the actors, I have to mention their appearance. Rating based on hotness, this film marks an 11. The women in this film are incredible and almost distract you from what a boring movie you're looking at. I'm sure the male characters are also very attractive, but you'll have to ask someone else to comment. <br /> <br /> In general, I cannot recommend this film, not to buy, rent, or even see for free. Unfortunately it is not worth the effort needed to sit down.
