Every year I watch hundreds of movies, including many abominable low-budget, straight-to-DVD friends that no one in their right mind would ever want to see. I have seen thousands of films in my time, many excellent, many forgettable. Zombie Nation Will I always remember as one of the most hopelessly ridiculous horror movies I've ever seen? in fact I still haven't recovered from the experience of looking at it. <br /> <br /> The next day, it seems like a strange dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why do the police work outside a warehouse? Did voodoo priestesses really recommend that "zombies" eat cheeseburgers? It's safe? It's safe? It's safe? <br /> <br /> I would not recommend Zombie Nation if you want to see a "good" movie, nor would I recommend it as "so good is good". However, if you are entertained by the prospect of probably looking at the most indefensibly abysmal film of all time ?? This is for you. Now, whenever someone asks me what the worst movie I've ever seen is, I'll say Zombie Nation. <br /> <br /> Really? I think it is a more serious crime to create a boring movie than a bad one, and Ulli Lommel deserves the credit for producing a movie that actually stuns you with its ineptitude. He really is the Ed Wood Jr. of the digital age, and I for one can't wait to see if he makes another film as consistently ridiculous as this.
