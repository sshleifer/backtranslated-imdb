This film was on the Romance channel, and I thought it could be a goofy movie from the 80s that would have been fun at a certain level, so my brother and I watched it. The boy sucked. The boy is cooked for the girl - correction, his * dream * - girl (apparently there is a difference, and I am surprised that he realized that it was his dream girl - he was in love with her from over 30 meters away, it only goes to show the power of the girls of dreams), the boy ends up masquerading as a woman to be close to the girl of the dream (creative in the sense that it is a distant plan, but not creative in the sense that there are probably best solutions you could think of), an embarrassing situation ensues, a correspondence is created (everything seems to take place around late afternoon - or the place was somehow responsible for this strange lighting, or the actors had to wait until they didn't go down their daily jobs to come to the set, I suspect the latter). Very awkwardly done, very pathetic. It's almost never even funny * accidentally *, so there's really nothing to redeem. Unless you're interested in seeing the early days of Chad Lowe, before he finally took the piece of the pie with the role of the HIV-positive gay guy in the "Life Goes On" series, or Gail O'Grady who was on NYPD Blue and I probably have to fix Dennis Franz's buttocks). But those are unlikely reasons - I would say that "systematic disorder of the senses" would be a more justified purpose. I'm surprised to have seen it all. I guess it's the kind of thing where, halfway, you are * still * watching yourself because of a morbid and self-flagellating inner problem, and you think you could finish it in order to tell your friends and your family that in reality Sitting in a movie so horrible, in the remote possibility that this would give you some understanding for the dubious state of your mental health. Can * You * Accept the challenge?
