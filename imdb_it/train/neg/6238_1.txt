Oh man, it's amazing how anyone can claim that global warming is a science, well, I guess this elitist nonsense is now replacing the science of eugenics! Al Gore tries to make this problem complicated, even if he just needs common sense to see that this whole thing is a big deception on the part of a man with his money-making program! <br /> <br /> How have scientists estimated the historic temperatures of this planet? Estimating sunspot activity. Has anyone ever questioned whether this method was accurate? No, not even Gore himself! So how the hell wouldn't it be accurate to predict future temperature with sunspot activity if it was accurate in the past? According to the activity of the solar points the current temperature is totally in line with what it should be. Why did the temperature in the entire universe increase (relatively) equal to that on earth? Do our SUVs raise the temperature on Jupiter? <br /> <br /> Use some common sense! You don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand that this can't be anything but a HOAX. Please search by yourself. What do you gain from Al Gore and his elitist friends like Rothschild (a family of bankers who organized a live earth event)? Well, the new world bank will be founded on carbon credits, which is a tax on everything that gives CO2 omissions, and it's easier to get away with these taxes if people are attracted to thinking about saving the world when it's alone money, centralized control and more power to elite bankers. Al Gore even has a company that sells carbon credits! Isn't it noble to voluntarily pay carbon credits to save the world, especially if you go to the same company as yourself? <br /> <br /> I don't want you to believe me blindly, please do your research and use your common sense and I'm sure it will come to the right conclusion!
