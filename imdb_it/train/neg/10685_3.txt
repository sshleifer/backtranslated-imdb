Predictable, banal and poorly written. I foolishly thought that such an important cast would not have been involved if he hadn't had a merit. I imagine that the competition between actors is so intense these days (and will only get worse) that you can no longer choose. At first we were given a hint that it had been decisive in the assassination and since then we have driven it from our throats. The film lacked intrigue, giving us little insight into the victim and just a possible reason for the murder. Some of the speeches were, frankly, embarrassing! It is hard to believe that someone would consider, to say the least, the expense of tens of millions of dollars to make this tripe.
