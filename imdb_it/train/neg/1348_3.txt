this animated movie by Inspector Gadget is pretty lousy. The story is very weak, and there is little action. Most characters have little or nothing to do. The film is at most amusing, but in reality it does not go where and is pointless.it is watchable but only and is close to the caliber of the animated television program of the 80s. It is not a film that plays the repeated view, at least in my mind. Only about 74 minutes including credits, so I guess this is a good thing. Unlike on the TV show, the characters are not worth rooting for this show.in the show wanted Inspector Gadget to save the day, but there , who really cares? anyway, it's just my opinion. for me Inspector The last case of Gadget is a disappointing 3/10
