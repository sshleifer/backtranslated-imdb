Tobe Hooper is probably the biggest stroke of luck that the horror genre has to offer. Like every other horror fan, I loved Texas Chainsaw, but I think that to put your name on top of a movie title, you should have at least more than one hit movie. I can't think of any other film that Hooper has done (alone, don't count Poltergeist) that really had an impact on the horror genre or the world of cinema. And this movie, Night Terrors, only supports my point. <br /> <br /> Poor Robert Englund, I give him the credit for having done at least a good job with the horrible material he was given. He did what he could. What about the film itself? Pure mastery. Nude scenes useless every five minutes, a story that must have been written in a truly unique and terrible setting, music and cinematography. Nothing in this film is redeemable. Do not waste time. <br /> <br /> Overall, 1 in 10. I feel sorry for Hooper, his career seems to be over before it really started. I hope he can pump at least one more good movie so he can do justice to his cult status. <br /> <br />
