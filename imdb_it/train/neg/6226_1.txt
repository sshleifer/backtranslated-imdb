I made my way through this film. First of all, the idiotic plot has little to do with Parson's story. Hollywood tried to create a kind of car chase movie. Imagine "Englebert Sings Hendrix". <br /> <br /> Don't take anything from this movie to be accurate. The name Parsons in the title and the theft of his body is used as a springboard for a low-budget pursuit movie, a clear attempt to grab some money from Parsons' legacy and his fan base. Gram's father had long since died in 1973, the other global characters are fictitious, none of these have anything to do with the life or death of Grams. <br /> <br /> If you're a Gram fan, I advise you not to watch this movie. I wish I hadn't. It is sad to see something special being treated as a dishonorable fodder. I swear I could hear Gram turning in his grave while the movie was playing. If you are not familiar with Gram's life and legacy, take nothing in this film as a representative of Gram. <br /> <br /> I can't say enough bad things about this movie. If Gram were alive and had seen this movie, he would have killed himself. Then again, maybe he would have been afraid if he knew this movie would turn out.
