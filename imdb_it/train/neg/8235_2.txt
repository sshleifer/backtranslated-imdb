As a fan of horror, we all know that blind rentals are crap. Sometimes we find a real gem, but many times we find that the film on which we have just spent our hard earned money is nothing but a rotten steamer aggravated by the forthcoming enthusiastic reviews and the film awards listed on the package. This is the case of Five Across the Eyes (a title I'm sure is a double meaning that refers to both the film budget and the compulsion that anyone who looks at it may have to use all five fingers to hit with their eyes). <br /> <br /> The story, or at least what writers * ahem * think they are going through, is centered around a group of girls who unwisely decide to go for a late night ride late at night after left a football game and a crazy girl who plays with her cat and mouse as punishment for what she thinks the girls found in her car after a fender in a gas station parking lot. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, it's an interesting idea. Some of the best horrors have very simple plots. It is in the execution of Five Across the Eyes that this idea falls flat. The film tries to be a cross between The Blair Witch Project with its flickering photographic work and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in its approach to bare bones but fails to be neither. What we get are redundant scenes of hunting, torture, release; chasing torture, releasing, in this order for 94 minutes with long interludes of complaints, complaints and inconsistent disconnections like a lot of stuffing between sequences of pursuits. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the film is incredibly grainy and obscure, which, in a better realized film, could have improved tension and realism. Here it is simply annoying. The characters are not developed and the viewer has difficulty finding something to sympathize with them. A character stops to get a first aid kit and tends to scratch his face while gunfire in the background indicates that his friends could be killed. Another girl murmurs hilarious and stupid phrases like "Don't go out there, she'll get you, if she gets you, she'll kill you and if she kills you you're dead." <br /> <br /> was a recognition from Fangoria magazine and Dreadcentral.com listed on the box that prompted me to check this out. Talk about a false orgasm! Perhaps my expectations would have been met if it had been in the comedy section. I'm all for the low-budget Indie horror but this takes shit. Switch to Five Across the eyes (or FATE; get it?) <br /> <br /> RazorFriendly gives FATE 1 bar out of five /
