I just saw The Convent for the second time. I had enjoyed it before and thought it would be a good drunken Friday night movie, some coolness, some style, some humor and something like that. It saddened me to discover that I could no longer appreciate it very much. It seemed that someone had decided to revisit a cheeseball epic like Night of the Demons for a modern audience, but lost the things that made the original worthy of note. For the record, I'm not even a big fan of Night of the Demons, but there were some things that I really dug about it. The convent makes cheese but not so much goodness. Apart from the main girl (the nice performance by Joanna Canton), the goth girl and a sweet cameo by Adrienne Barbeau practically all the characters were incredibly unlikely, under the pretext of the absolute lowest levels of a fake and offensive girl. The film is then seriously hampered by the complete lack of free nudity, which means that, given the horrible dialogue, it is difficult to look at the characters and more difficult to appreciate the good points of the film. The bad nuns are original in design and get many beautiful scenes, even if not scary, certainly they are quite beautiful, and the film also circulates a good dose of clean blood. Towards the end, when Adrienne Barbeau is on the scene, the movie gets pretty funny because all the hateful people have died and it's a bad nun who sucks. Even the stylized direction occasionally produces good results, although sometimes the camera moves too fast. All in all, this was a film in which for me the bright positive points fail to recover the things I hate. The most passionate of this type of film could appreciate it much more, but for me it was not a good time.
