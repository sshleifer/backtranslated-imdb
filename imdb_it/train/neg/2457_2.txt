Some people don't like animation. Personally, I think the animation was pretty remarkable given when this movie was made. There are many old cartoons that I love. My problems with this film are not the animation, but basically the way it was built. The characters are all ... well, stupid. And for this movie, they shouldn't be. Apparently, everyone in LOTR has a limping problem (for beginners). The way they acted in general annoyed me. My two sisters and I were laughing for most of this movie. I think if many people had seen this before seeing the newer ones, they wouldn't have left. I'm glad I rented it and I didn't buy it. There are few films that give me a headache. This was one of them. However, this is not the worst movie I have ever seen, although it is up there. Or over there, depending on the view.
