How Rick Sloane was allowed to make five films is harder to believe than cold fusion. This film is absolutely criminal. Before watching this movie I thought that Manos: Hands of Fate was the worst piece of shit I've ever seen, but at least Manos moves so slowly that you could fall asleep, thus saving your eyes from the pain it will suffer. The biggest tragedy of this film is that the old man who keeps the Hobgoblin "stuck" comes to the final scene. The time I spent watching this film was an absolute waste of my life.
