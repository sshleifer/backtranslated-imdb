The voice is true: girls like COYOTE UGLY rather than boys. And the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given. The Jersey girl goes to New York to become a songwriter. And after the initial frustration of not having luck, he hears some girls celebrating at about $ 300 each made last night. Gets an audition at the bar where they work and surprises! The place is completely full of "two-year-olds" who explode at the sight of the dancing girls. <br /> <br /> The story is not bad and some characters are nice, especially Cammie (the "fashion coordinator" part was nice) and the bouncer, but let's face it, the drama was horrible and completely laughable right from the beginning. Violet and her father seemed too ridiculous while they were in relationship during the film. And check Violet too jammed on that keyboard with the break dancer! <br /> <br /> For the first time I could think, how could the production be so terrible? For a brief moment with this film, Hollywood could stand on its two feet and show a new low without great public protests without saying "You've been warned!" Instead, it seems that COYOTE UGLY has intentional intent in trying to kiss all the most important back areas of the world. Advertise girls in a bar, but show a very thin card "pursue the story of your dreams" has disappointed every male teenager you've chosen! <br /> <br /> And finally the music. There was absolutely no interruption of the music I found in this film, especially when it was needed (the hospital scene). Each scene looks like a short music video that you wanted to interrupt until the bar was opened. But the climax was the height of laughter: a song from the 1980s you expected Cyndi Lauper to take to the stage and intrude on Violet. Heck, I personally thought that Bon Jovi would jump out with long hair and jam too! <br /> <br /> In addition to some really smart cameras that work with coyote girls when they dance (especially the wet scene), and a couple of nice clich√©s, COYOTE UGLY is something purely embarrassing. Whether you looked at it or did it, it just seemed to kill time. Or waste depending on how you look at it.
