I have no intention of countering the obvious peterbogdanovichian defects of TLPS. Instead, I'll take a look at the positive aspects of this film celluloid pygmy overestimation. <br /> <br /> 1. Peter Bogdanovich has succeeded in making a film that can be endured in its entirety. This fact alone puts the film high above and up on top of its lame filmography. <br /> <br /> 2. Bogdanovich demonstrated how incredibly generous some lucky boyfriends can be, sharing the fabulous body and breasts of Cybill Shepherd (his then Galiano) with his male audience - and not just one, but on two occasions. Brava! The indisputable highlights of this film siesta festival. <br /> <br /> 3. TLPS barely has a scene without the stereotype of country music scribbling in the background. (Peter tried to make it clear that the film is set in the depths of the American South (as if it were not concealed) so he beat at that point back and forth and forward ...). How is this an advantage, could you ask? Well, when the film ends and the monotonous country music finally stops massaging your tired eardrums, you start feeling a strange euphoria: "Finally the film is over!" It is pure joy. <br /> <br /> 4. The film gives all the women who look like Cloris Leachman hope. I hope that one day they will be able to snatch a much younger boyfriend and maybe even a handsome one. <br /> <br /> 5. The biography of Cloris Leachman (which I realize is not technically part of TLPS) gives hope to all the women who seem so, who might one day also win a beauty contest at Miss Chicago . (Assuming they have enough money to bribe the jury with.) <br /> <br /> (Do you think I'm joking that Cloris won a beauty contest, eh? Well, take a look at his biography and then we'll see who laughs last ...) <br /> <br /> 6. The film was shot in black and white that spared us the sight of Cloris Leachman's face in his natural, non-glory.
