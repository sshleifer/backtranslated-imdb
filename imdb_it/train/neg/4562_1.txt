I didn't feel like I was raped like I used to do with THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS, but the MAGIC WORLD OF BELLE is still the antithesis of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Like CHRISTMAS, BMW hates its audience, though not at such an extreme level. He is ugly, not canonical, idiot, and the writing is horribly bad. None of the stories work. These are not at all the characters we loved from BATB, they are a group of pod people. I wanted to analyze it, but after a few minutes, I gave up, because no one in their right mind would have taken this crap seriously. What we have here are three stories. "The Perfect Word" is an arrogant and thoughtful study of forgiveness. "Fifi's Folly" only works if you can accept that the name of Babette is actually Fifi and that you are a James Bond ferret and that Lumiere is an idiot for women. "Broken Wing" (or "Broken Wind" as I like to call it) is probably the most heinous of the group. Does the beast hate birds? Since when? Don't look at this shit - every copy of this video deserves to be cremated. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a cinematic classic, a transcendent celebration of love, art, intelligence and a human soul.
