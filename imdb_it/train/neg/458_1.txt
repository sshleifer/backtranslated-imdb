What is this shit? My cousin clearly chose him for the art and title of excessively girly DVDs ... I decided to watch it with her so that she wasn't bored, and I'm sure it was horrible for her horrible quality. <br /> <br /> First, the acting was terrible. They look like amateur actresses who read the ideas cards. The delivery is sub-par and very formulaic. The cuts at the scene were terrible .. it seems that they took it directly from the storyboard, if there was one. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the jokes and stereotypes were not original or well interpreted - again, very formulas. I can't count the times I've been able to predict the next beat. I chuckled a little from the blatantly "subtle" sexual allusions. The Cat, The Beaver Patch, Hung Wong? .. come on! Just ... stay away from this movie. It's not cute, it's not funny, it's not even stupid-funny. He's just stupid-stupid. It's like a children's movie about PG with sexual insinuations, vulgarity and unnecessary violence to get the MPAA score. STAY AWAY. <br /> <br /> "Would you like to go on my yacht?" <br /> <br /> "Is that what they call it now?" <br /> <br /> "You could drive my ding." <br /> <br /> "Oh, I think I have blood on my stool!" <br /> <br /> Badly played, sir.
