The animal farm (1954) was an excellent reading of the dangers of totalitarianism. How good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who are ignorant or govern with an iron fist and an empty head. Unfortunately, this film does not represent any of these. What is shown to us is a piece of propaganda with a lot of waving and pointing fingers. The animation and direction were good considering the budget and the time period, but the very essence of the George Orwell novel is definitely missing. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those who want to see how not to fit a novel or are just interested in seeing an adaptation of this brilliant novel then look at all effects. I just found this to be a bit mediocre. However, the opinion of one man. <br /> <br /> The remake is a notch below but not by much.
