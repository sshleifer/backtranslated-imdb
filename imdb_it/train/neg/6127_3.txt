As I come from Hungary, I've heard many people say better and better things about Üvegtigris so far, but I really don't understand the reason for all this fuss. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed many points in the film, some of the quotes really cheered me, but the stereotyped characters are again present, as in any Hungarian film, and the story is also quite boring. I liked the first half, but then I started to get bored, and then I found the whole movie only BORING. <br /> <br /> Rudolf Péter is as good as ever, even Reviczky is brilliant, but the others are right there ... do nothing. <br /> <br /> How many years still have to go for a good Hungarian movie ???
