It's fun when you stop to think about it: swaggering movie fans tend to have a deep and constant affection for those who scare the lights of day. THE MASSACRE DELLA CHENA DEL Texas can give us nightmares, but those of us (the faithful) have not felt a real pang of love for Gunnar Hansen in BRUTAL MASSACRE - or for Ken Foree, forever and always the resolute hero of original DAWN OF LA DEATH? His cameo in the remake made me want to get up and cheer (as did Tom Savini's cameo); I'm not kidding. And Brian Halloran and ... Well, you have my direction (if not, you're just downwind ...). These are some of the Heroes of Horror. Seeing this many of them gathered in a single movie is almost unheard of (at least in this sense, as far as I know). If only the writer (s) had lived up to such a monumental task. Maybe someone else, somewhere along the line, will try again. As long as it is not another heartless effort (like the BROTHER OF THE BLOOD, for example).
