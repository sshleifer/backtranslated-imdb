The Underground Comedy Movie, it's probably the worst train wreck I've ever seen. Fortunately I didn't pay for this movie, and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again by placing it that it was so terrible but needed to show me how horrible it was. I love color comedy. At least I thought it would be that and I would be entertained. No, instead the acting was so horrible, the "jokes" were extremely cheap, and the plot was not where to find it. Maybe there shouldn't have been a plot, so I can't hold him against this movie. It's pretty sad where the funniest thing about a play is an old woman whose head is hit by a bat ... by Batman ... A man dressed in a baseball uniform wielding a bat. Funny. Simply brilliant. I had the feeling of watching this movie that its creators made and laughed hysterically with their friends about it. Maybe this was full of jokes we didn't understand. Or maybe it's the worst piece of junk ever made and should be locked up in a vault and dumped in the Arctic Ocean. <br /> <br /> P.S. Don't buy this movie!
