I watched about 30 minutes in this movie before I finally got sick of being hit with leopards in the head with this movie. The soundtrack, the so-called "plot" and every single actor. It's as if everyone thought they were the main part of the film and shouted "NOTICE ME!" again and again. The bad guy has his bad boy music that goes on and says sinister things to bad guy, in case you didn't know. The good guy does brave and noble things in case you didn't know he was the good guy. And oh sir, the plane scene. "MY HUSBAND IS MISSING! OH MY GOD! YOU CAN'T MISS IT TO THE BEGINNING OF HIS LEGS OR GO TO THE TOILET OR ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO MISS!" (And yes, I know, his clothes were still there, but honestly, he woke up and started to panic before he had time to look at the damn place he had been.) <br /> <br /> As a religious girl, I want to apologize to the world for having wasted the film on which it was printed. <br /> <br /> And I want to get my 30 minutes back.
