It shouldn't be a shock to you when I say that Alone in the Dark is a lousy movie. To put it bluntly, it is as if a dung monster defecates, ate the result and then vomits. The final product would be even more beautiful than this film. <br /> <br /> Apparently based on an ancient (!) Atari Videogame, the film has something or something else to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth, the unleashing of demons and ancient civilizations. There is something in the fact that there are two worlds, that of darkness and that of light. (Guess which one is ours.) Oh, and 10,000 years ago a truly super-duper advanced civilization opened the portal, the demons approached and blew up, then wiped out civilization. That's why we've never heard of it, quite conveniently. <br /> <br /> Christian Slater, perhaps pining for the days of Heathers and Pump up the Volume, plays Edward Carnby, a paranormal researcher who has had something strange happened when he was 10 years old. It is hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of the said advanced civilization. Carnby was part of a secret institution called 713, which sought to understand what happened to that long-ago civilization. But Carnby believed that he wouldn't be able to find the answers he was looking for, so he left the group. <br /> <br /> But you see, these beasts are out, and they take their prey in various ways, like how to gut them, dividing them in the middle, implanting neurological control devices in them, or simply turning them into killed zombies. Yes, it's another zombie movie. <br /> <br /> It is so distilled that I can make the plot. It is rather twisted and incomprehensible. In similar films, you might see the intrepid researcher / adventurer understand things one step at a time, and when the audience is mentally with the researcher, it's very funny. But when the scenes go from one attack to another without perspective or context ... not so funny. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, except for Slater, who (although he seems almost embarrassed to be in the movie) has shown that he can handle the acting load. Where you go; take this - Tara Reid is chosen as a museum curator! Honest for good, I thought I saw the cast of a lifetime when Denise Richards was chosen as a nuclear physicist in Tomorrow Never Dies. But Reid fits with Richards, lousy crap for crappy emulation. Hightlights include Reid who pronounces "Newfoundland" as "New Fownd Land", Reid delivering most of his jokes in a bizarre and guttural monotone (a bit like having been busy all night for the past week before filming), Reid - as curator of the museum, mind you: spending most of the film in a tight top and pants. Oh yes, it was as credible as Jessica Simpson who gave stock quotes. Oh, why do the nice guys have to be so stupid? (Note: I don't think Tara Reid is so beautiful. She seems to always need food.) Almost all the other cast members are completely forgettable, except perhaps for Steven Dorff, who played Burke, one of 713's leaders. of Dorff was not very well developed, but nothing in the film was, from the sets to the characters, to Tara Reid. But I digress. <br /> <br /> However, the disconcerting and utterly absurd plot is hard enough to follow with the film moving at such a dizzying pace, but director Uwe Boll throws in a pounding soundtrack that drives the mind crazy ; it's so loud you can't hear what the actors are saying in some scenes! It can't be right. Given the level of acting, however, perhaps thanks to Mr. Boll. <br /> <br /> Oh, and a funny note. The film's opening moments include the narration ... of words creeping on the screen at the same time. Remember the first Star Wars? You heard that familiar Star Wars theme as the prologue crawled. There was certainly no need for narration; why do I need some tricks to read what's on the screen for me? Were the producers simply looking for blind people? Perhaps this also explains why the soundtrack was so noisy - they were also looking for deaf people. Also, the narrator inexplicably had a lye for the first few lines of the crawl - so he lost it. Bizarre. <br /> <br /> Alone in the Dark is a noisy and insane jumble of terrible acting, an incoherent script and a bare-handed direction. Hardly a note sounds real. There is so much chaos that the public simply surrenders by taking care of the characters and the roots for their disappearance. Even in the dark, demonic creatures seem colder and much more developed in comparison. <br /> <br /> Ironically, since there were only three other people in the theater, I saw this Alone in the Dark. I wonder if Uwe Boll planned it that way? I can't give this the lowest rating, because I had little hope for it to start - and because it never grabbed me enough to make me understand. It's atrocious, even if Slater redeems himself a little.
