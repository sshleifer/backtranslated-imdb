This documentary is at its best when it simply shows the offices of Ayurvedic healers and treatment preparation. One cannot deny the oppressive poverty in India and the desperation of even their richest clients. However, as an argument for Ayurvedic medicine in general, this film fails miserably. Although Indian customers mention having seen "aleopathic" doctors, those doctors are not interviewed and we have to take vague statements of their patients for their face value - "the doctor said there was no cure," the doctor he said it was a cancer "etc. Well, "no cure" does not mean "no treatment" and what kind of cancer exactly does the patient have? The film is weaker when it shows the Ayurvedic practice in America. There it is reduced, apparently, to the splendid proposal that having a high-powered job on Wall Street can hurt your stomach.
