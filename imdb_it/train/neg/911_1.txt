This must be one of the worst Swedish films ever made. <br /> <br /> It's embarrassing that such a bad screenplay was allowed to become a movie and only shown in cinemas in 2006. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many sponsored products visible in the same movie. It shouldn't be so obvious. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why so many well-known actors even thought the idea was even visible in a movie like this. If I had any respect for some of the actors known in this film before seeing the film, now it's safe. <br /> <br /> I have heard that there will be a follow up film to this and I cannot understand how it is possible.
