After buying the DVD in a Bargain Bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover, I inserted it into the DVD player and everything seemed fine. Nice animated menus and lots of extra features ... but when I played the movie itself, what a disappointment. It's the worst thing I've ever seen and I've seen some bad movies in my time. The comment that praises the film here on IMDB is actually from the people who made the film. So don't believe it unless you like to waste your money!
