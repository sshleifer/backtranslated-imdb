The director Sidney J. Furie has created in Hollow Point an absurd postmodern masterpiece that constantly challenges and surprises the public. <br /> <br /> Sidney J. Furie dares to ask the question of what happens to traditional traditional "plot" and "characterization" paradigms when removing "motivation" and "reason" crutches. <br /> <br /> The result leads me to say that my opinion of him could never be higher. <br /> <br /> One and a half star. <br /> <br /> P.S. Nothing in this film makes any sense, law enforcement officers are unpleasant and organized criminals are full of fools.
