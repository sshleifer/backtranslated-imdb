What can I say? I think I have to write "Spoiler alert" and then "reveal" that they used the F-word a lot in this film, as in every two sentences. I didn't like this movie at all - too many suggestions about sexual perversions, declines and cheating. And that oath was totally out of the window. I gave this movie "3" and two of these points are for Mira Sorvino's sexy moves on the dance floor.
