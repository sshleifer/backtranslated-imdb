I honestly have to say that I couldn't stop watching this movie from the second it started. Simply how bad it was !!! It's like looking at dry paint only a lot more confused. I mean you sit there and just wait for something to happen, anything done, preferably something that makes the whole movie sound! At the end of the film, I actually sat there wondering if there was any possibility of having lost the first hour that explained everything or if I could inadvertently have fainted during the film and lost the parts that played the plot (if there was any effects one) together! The main thing that really confused me about this movie, it's almost the end of the main girl (if there really was a main girl) it was in some sort of alternate reality, I mean what the hell was going on at this point ?! he suddenly woke up and was in a mental institution, chained to a doctor-drugged bed or something, then faster than the one that would have led me to cut my wrists, turned back and she was getting devoured from a random vampire! no sense zeal! I'm tempted to send emails to the producers and ask for my time back, that is I wasted 2 hours of my life looking at this garbage! I'm curious if the filmmakers really knew what it was! it seemed that someone had modified all the pieces that could have made sense, even though I think the film should have lasted 4 hours to make it happen! I completely agree with the other person who wrote the other review, I was rogue deceived with this movie, and only this one. I'm so grateful that I didn't really buy the movie, no matter how many times I saw it in the local bookstore. You would have thought it would have given me a hint that the film was a pile of steaming junk, but to be honest I think 1 pound was too much money to spend on this movie !!!! what a huge waste of time and a good razor blade, I mean I like it, it's less painful than watching this movie !!!!
