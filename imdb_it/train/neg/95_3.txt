You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you don't particularly want it, a man who turns out horror budget after the horror of the budget for less enthusiastic receptions. But it continues to do the same. Even the praising eulogy that surrounds his Camp Blood movies is reluctantly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone else. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a clean idea, an extravagant character, anything, but without the funds to take him beyond the basic level, he relies on the public to give him some flexibility and appreciate what he is and what could be. Joe Haggerty gives a lively and very funny performance like Ebenezer Jackson and it is a merit for Sykes who can sense that this strange turn will work inside the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.
