This is really bad. Lamas shows how a second-level actor does his job. But what is worth looking at is the scene where OJ angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if he wanted to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the text "I have proof about you!". (It makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics - attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren but I couldn't find it on iTunes). Let's talk about seeing in the future ... Too much fun for words. The rest of the film is to be forgotten. The score and the songs are more interesting than the script. Ditto the sequel. Which raises the question of why they would make a sequel altogether. My understanding has been that overseas sales push many of these films. B. It doesn't say much about worldview habits.
