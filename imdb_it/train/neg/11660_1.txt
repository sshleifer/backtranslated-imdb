Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors, I swear he has no real knowledge on how to make films. he made a brilliant film and this is a scary movie. The scary movie 2 was also fine, but all that Keenan has done are real disasters. avoid such titles as not being a threat to the central south while drinking your juice in the cap ..... I know, what a title !!! obviously this film too, everything that has the name of Keenan in the credits. <br /> <br /> it was an hour and a half due to stupid nonsense that never made me laugh. trust this, maybe women might like this movie a bit because of some things that happen, but overall this movie will never be appreciated by anyone with good taste in movies ........ 1/10 ....... jd Seaton
