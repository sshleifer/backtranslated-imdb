I cannot believe that this inclined and chauvinistic material is passed on to the Americans as art material. At first, from such eloquent lines as "we want to be sure they are playing for the right team" and the manipulative framing and lighting, A Love Divided shows its true face. The gross way in which Irish Catholics are shown as hegemonic, the Protestants as peaceful and oppressed, is a poor representation of the history of the first Western Westerners who depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of the story is distorted by the stereotypes and total denigration of Irish Catholics in history; a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves! It is sad that people today still think they can achieve moral domination by making a film so easily recognizable for its obvious intent, so far from the attempt at art. This film has nothing to envy of any legitimate cinema or library.
