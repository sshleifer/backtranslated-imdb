The message of this film is "personality is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo should be the "ugly duckling", but the funny thing is that she is not at all ugly (in reality she is much more attractive than Uma Thurman, the friend who looks like a model). <br /> <br /> Now, would this film work if the "ugly duckling" was really unattractive? When will Hollywood stop with this hypocrisy? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, despite the message he wants to convey, this film is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br />
