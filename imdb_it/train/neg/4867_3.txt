Just what we need! Another remake of vintage Hollywood cinema, with Eddie Murphy mixing again in his second time since THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996)! This shows why we are running out of special ideas to make a quality film, ladies and gentlemen! It has some signs of hope for its nice and delicious images of animals that can act and talk to humans. Things can only get worse, unfortunately. Bath jokes and sexual references instantly kill this piece of "family". Parents and children have also seen the trailer on The Family Channel, followed by total anguish and disgust in the cinema. Sad to say, this is the most progressive pre-millennium era, but enjoy it while it lasts because things can only get worse over time. More went wrong with the new DR. Dolittle. It is absolutely without plot, feeling too flat. I also hate that irritating Chris Rock voice !!! We need more talented voice-overs than a group of overpaid celebrities who don't want to declare bankruptcy. I will have to agree in my local newspaper that he put it among the first five worst films of 1998. Then, once again, the original version was not right. Murphy's next project could be PATTON if he isn't careful!
