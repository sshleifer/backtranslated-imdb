Jenny Neumann (from the sexploitation film MISTRESS OF THE APES, the American slasher HELL NIGHT and others) is Helen Selleck, an American actress who gets a leading role in an Australian theatrical production. She's a virgin because she saw her mother having sex as a child and then accidentally caused the car accident that killed her. Meanwhile, a black-gloved killer wanders through the theater cutting people off with glass shards. <br /> <br /> *** GREATEST HOPE *** <br /> <br /> The killer is obviously Helen (she speaks with the voice of her dead mother, washes the blood from her hands after the murders and you see a molester kid being killed with a broken bottle like a little girl!), but this one has a heavy POV camera that breathes and hides the identity of the killer until the end like a big surprise should be. <br /> <br /> The entire cast seems obsessed with talking, having or trying to have sex and, in one case, even blackmailing their way to get laid. There is a bit of nudity and blood, but there is no sense of continuity, the photograph is murky and the editing (by Colin Eggleston, who also wrote and produced) is terrible. The theatrical setting for a slasher film precedes the Soavi film of the same name by five years and the Silver OPERA (both are better than this), and Neumann is rather hot.
