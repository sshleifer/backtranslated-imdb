Hooper is not funny, not fasted, not romantic and not informative. There is no real drama. You would think that a film about the biggest stuntman in the world would have had some drama, there was an attempt but it didn't seem real. No character study, no lessons learned, it didn't even seem like the actors were having fun, they were just trying to act like they were having fun. There is no reason to look if you don't like watching Burt and you want to have an occasional taste of Sally. The knight Prancer was handsome and did what he had to do. In fact, Prancer was the best actor in this film. Smoky and the Bandit was such a fun film that I was ready to love Hooper. This film turned out to be a real disappointment and a waste of time
