I saw enough of Little Richard in interviews and performances and enough of poor Leon pigeonholed in the 50/60 bio photos to know that Leon was not the right actor for this role. Leon was as righteous as David Ruffin in The Temptations, but he absolutely fails to capture the essence of Little Richard in this film. <br /> <br /> Actor Miguel Núñez who played Little Richard in "Why Do Fools Fall in Love?" it was a much better choice, having brought out the powerful but effeminate character of the musician. <br /> <br /> If the performances are not convincing, then the film will also be. And this is what happened here. The events of LR towards homosexuality and voyeurism are completely ignored or completely lost. What "The Temptations" has done so well in capturing the rise of the group, the warts and everything, this film lacks a broad brand. <br /> <br /> What's going on with director Robert Townsend who started so well with "The Hollywood Shuffle"? He is a talented and funny guy, but he didn't deliver anything close to that first attempt.
