Normally I don't take the time to make comments that few people will read about films that few will see. However, in this case, I feel I should warn everyone who might consider wasting time. I just finished watching it five minutes ago. This is simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The acting is horrible, a non-existent plot and the production values ​​are at the highest poverty level. I know that even a low budget movie can be great, but not this one. There is only one thing that could have saved this film for the purposes of any horror fan - more gore and cuts on the screen! The total three times that this occurs is off-screen. While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens - especially in the final scene - there simply isn't enough. The film is too long because its content is minimal, even heavy dialogue and, consequently, almost impossible to watch. What happens? To summarize in a nutshell, three teenage girls, irresponsibly and consciously, drive through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been kidnapped and killed. Their car obviously breaks down and they are taken to a boring old house inhabited by three crazy people - one of which is the psychotic killer. All three are finally murdered, one after the other, off the screen, after what seems an eternity of boring nonsense and slow rhythm. As I said, the only things worth looking at once are the murders. Please do not buy it or rent it just for that, and do not be fooled by the misleading box art and description of the film. Save your money and your time.
