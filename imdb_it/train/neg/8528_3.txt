What is written on the poster is: "At birth they were given 6 years of life ... At 34 years of age he makes the journey of a lifetime." Ami is an Israeli of American origin who was diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophy disease at the age of one. At the age of 34, after the love for his 22-year-old caregiver did not go well, he decided to come to the United States to face the doctor who said he would have only 6 years of life. He wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive and weighs 39 pounds. Why? Your hypothesis is as good as mine, I saw this film too. <br /> <br /> Obviously it is brave to live when all that can move is his left index, but why is he so angry with the doctor who diagnosed his illness 34 years ago? His doctor just told his mother that based on his medical history, people with his illness will not live long. What is the reason why he shows up at the old doctor's door? Why is tracking this old doctor in the United States a journey of his life? There are so many things that could interest us in Ami's life: how can she do those animations with the movement of a single finger? How can you go through daily lives while totally dependent on others? How did you experience your doctor's prediction? How does he behave emotionally when others look at him as if they are looking at a strange creature? The film has told us nothing of this. Instead, the director took a van and organized a trip to allow Ami to show up at his old doctor's door to show him that he is still alive. I thought it was a joke.
