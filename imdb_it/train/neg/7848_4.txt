this movie was just stupid, I don't think it was scary, I was hoping to be shocked and scared, but mostly I laughed some scenes were just to pretend and throw blood scenes were extremely above the CG and some of the mutants They were ridiculously homosexual and I liked also because the acting was simply horrible and I thought that they could get some good actors and most of the characters I hated only because they were stupid and lame even if they had to be in the military. watch movies for free and see many people coming out on foot guessing why he was so stupid a little happy not to have to pay for it in short DUMB ASS MOVIE not see it ... but then again this is my opinion
