This film features a beautiful brunette named Danielle Petty. He has wonderful green eyes, and it is in the first scenes and in the last scene. She is the only thing in this movie that is not repulsive. She may not have a future as an actress, because this type of film is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers. <br /> <br /> The film itself has absolutely nothing to recommend. It's not a good horror movie, or a good fake journalistic report, or a well done one. There is no apparent skill in its production. It's like a bad student film. The horrible elements of the story don't make you feel bad, it's the fact that it's so badly made that it makes you sick. I would give this movie a ZERO star if I could.
