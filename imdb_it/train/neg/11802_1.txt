Absolutely dreck. I got to the point 16 minutes / 27 seconds and gave up. I would have given a negative numerical review if it were possible (even if "admissible" is a more appropriate word ...). Unlike the sizzle that could be seen and practically felt between MacMurray and Stanwyck in the original, the chemistry between the dumb and hard Dicky Crenna and his side here is simply non-existent. Does the anklet become an ugly unattractive bracelet? Are there no lights on for the fingertips? And I thought I was sick when they look mortified (and rightly believe me) Lee J. Cobb while Keyes practically burps and makes his way through the explanation of his "Little Man" to Mr. Garloupis. No offense for the blind, but it seems that a team of blind people has left behind the design of both houses Dietrichson and Neff. The same goes for those horrible plaid pants that Phyllis wears. And crikey, how much does Neff do, who lives neglecting a huge marina? This, people, again, everything takes place in the first 16 and a half minutes. If you can do more, you have a much stronger constitution than me, or you are a masochist. But please, first take some Alka-Seltzer, or you will develop a "little man" who may never go away. Proceed with caution, of course.
