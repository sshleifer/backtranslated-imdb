When this film was released, it generated one of the greatest movie reviews of all time: Sphinx Stinks. He does it, but in a hypnotic way. The casting is silly, starting from the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptians? Not enough makeup in Cairo for this, at least not during the making of this film. But it's pretty fun to see them try. Executions range from the mummy (sorry, obvious observation) to the superlative, with very few intermediate stops. The character of Lesley-Anne Down seems to have failed to find Egypt on a map, much less to exhibit her archaeological treasures. This is due at least in part to a really bad writing, one of the curses that will be visited on every viewer of this film. It is my opinion that films that involve a curse or draw their basis from a somewhat esoteric subject, like Egyptology, are ripe for a stupid and overwritten dialogue. It doesn't disappoint and the convergence shows a double whammy. The plot has a driving source of dramatic tension: can this become more stupid and less credible? The answer is usually YES. The shots of the place are beautiful, and the set design is generally very good, the only consistent memories that this was not a low-budget production. This is the fact that there are so many familiar faces serving in such an involuntary laugh. Economic, no; cheesy, yes.
