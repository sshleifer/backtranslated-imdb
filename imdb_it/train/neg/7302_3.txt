The first five minutes of this film showed potential. After that, he went directly from something probably decent to some kind of illegitimate comedy. The best part is that I couldn't stop thinking about Supertroopers thanks to Joey Kern. I would recommend watching this movie for the simple fact of learning not to make a film. There are so many scenes in this movie that make one stop and wonder if the whole cast and crew have stopped worrying at some point. The thing that amazes me most about this film is that it has grossed $ 22 million at the box office and costs only $ 1.5 million. Congratulations to Lion's Gate for being able to pull him out.
