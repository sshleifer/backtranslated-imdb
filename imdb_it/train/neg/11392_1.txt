For years I remember reading "Trouble With Tracy" in the TV guide on this show. CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6am! I lived about two hours north of Toronto and we couldn't get CFTO, but you know how it is - we always want what we can't have. <br /> <br /> Well, I knew what I wanted and what I wanted was to see what this "Trouble With Tracy" was. Did you have a beautiful girl in the lead role? Was there nudity? Was there suspense? Was it a comedy? It would have been fine if there had been a promotion of the show. At least I could have known what I was missing. But no! The mystery drove me crazy, until the CTV affiliate CKCO built a re-transmitter in Wiarton, Ontario, and started broadcasting "Trouble With Tracy" simultaneously with the CFTO .... Saturday morning at 6 am morning !! One Saturday morning I got up and turned on the TV at 5:59 am and finally managed to see what "The Trouble With Tracy" was. Yes, the "Trouble With Tracy" was that it was Canadian content and locked in the harmless 6 am spot so no one would ever see how horrible it was. <br /> <br /> The talented Canadian actor Steve Weston died a few years later, but many say he actually "died" the first time he appeared in this show. When I saw him for the first time that cold Saturday morning and I fell discouraged in my bed, even a part of me died.
