How can I start reviewing a film that will soon be recognized as the worst movie of all time by the worst director of all time? A film that could develop a cult following because it is "so bad is it good?" <br /> <br /> An analytical approach that criticizes the film seems to be both useless and part of the caravan syndrome - let us go freely without worrying about the backlash because every other human being on earth is doing it, and the people who like the film likes for those flaws we would mention. <br /> <br /> The film's poor universal quality is obvious ... 'Sixteen years of alcohol' It is not lacking in competition for the worst film title, so it has to sink rather low to acquire the title and keep it under control , but I think this film can go far. IMDb does not admit enough words to mention all the failures of the film, and it is much easier to place the elements "Sixteen years of alcohol" is right. Unfortunately, those moments of glory are so buried in the shadow of the poverty of this film which is a task that is not worth pursuing. <br /> <br /> My impressions? I thought I knew what I was getting myself into, I had been advised to drink several cups of coffee before to sit and watch this (I wish that suggestion had been Vodka cups.) Despite my low expectations, "Sixteen Years of Alcohol" failed to entertain me even at a level "make fun of the bad movie." Not just ugly , but antipat ico as if Jobson had intentionally tried to make this movie a poetic yawn, but he went into overkill and pushed the poem down his throat, making it not deep but fun. .. and presumably Jobson sincerely tried to make a good movie? Even after seeing the promotional literature "Sixteen years of alcohol", I have difficulty believing in Jobson's sincerity. Unnecessary and hateful to the end with several moments of sneer (I'm sure no one wanted it) seasoned the film, and those few elements prevented me from turning off the DVD. So bad is it okay? No. He only had enough 'I can't believe this is a serious movie moment' to keep me from turning it off, and nothing else. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie to watch with a bunch of bad movie connoisseurs. Make your comment go on. This would have greatly improved the experience for me. So bad is Mike Myers commenting on his Scottish accent on it as he runs, to turn this whole piece of mud into a comedy farce "Ok, oh man, turn to me annuder gliss of dat wiskey".
