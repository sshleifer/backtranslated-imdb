A group of us saw this movie were really disgusted. We were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character Jo wasn't on (it's not like the writers / producers could do something about it). The writing was poor, the script was sub-par. What really annoyed us: 1. When the two realized they were both together with Natalie, they didn't leave each other in peace with that stupid (and ultimately degrading) race, but only because they were macho men in competition, not because they really wanted Natalie. 2. Despite not being able to choose between the two boys before the meeting, Natalie suddenly decides to really love one of the boys and is now ready to marry him? (and there was no presage that he really was a better guy, it's like the writers tossed a coin and then spat it at a convenient point in the movie). 3. Blair has the courage to talk about how she doesn't want children and then suddenly when her husband says she wants to have children, she fully agrees with him.
