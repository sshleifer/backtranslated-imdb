When I was a kid and lived with my sister, he bought all the horror movies he could find and this was one of them. The VCR had just become an object for the home and we didn't have about 150 movies and we watched them by everyone. <br /> <br /> I was at a construction site the other day and saw this VHS copy of BLOOD LEGACY and I buy any horror movies I don't have and I knew this movie seemed familiar. I thought for a second and realized it was what my sister had bought. He had sold it years ago in an auction, I guess. Who knows. <br /> <br /> I didn't remember anything and I watched it the night I bought it and it refreshed my memory because of some scenes. I'm not sure how I felt as a child, but I'm sure I liked it because it was new to me and I watched and enjoyed everything at the time. <br /> <br /> I am a horror freak, but there are some requirements for me to consider it "good" and this is very short. It was one of those speeches that told me to death. Those death scenes you see are made using the shadow on the wall followed by splashes of blood and you get so much if you're lucky. <br /> <br /> The story is good and I've seen some with similar storylines so I think this should be buried and forgotten. Don't look at these people unless you are hard.
