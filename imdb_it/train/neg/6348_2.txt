Unpretentious nonsense. The material is boring, boring, boring and most of the cast wouldn't even have made replacements in Allen's previous films. And having to listen to the unfair Will Ferrell doing his imitation of Woody Allen makes me hate even more the second-hand Ferrell (although mysteriously popular). It seems the 70-year-old boyfriend Allen should have stopped work when the clock rang in a new century. I really tried to get involved in the film, but it was simply impossible; my snyaps couldn't shoot slowly. So instead of falling asleep and killing myself in the afternoon sleeping upright, I got up, left my wife and daughter at the theater, and drove out where I had a really good book to read (the great 30-year-old George Bailey ago, "Germans".) The day turned out pretty well, no thanks to Woody.
