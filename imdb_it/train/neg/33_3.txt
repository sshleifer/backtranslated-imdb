This is the worst thing the TMNT series has ever generated. I was a kid when he came out and I still thought he was a two, even though I liked the original cartoon. <br /> <br /> There is this scene that I remember when the mafioso explains to his henchmen what rhetorical questions we are. It's atrocious. Many fans hate the series for including a female turtle, but that didn't bother me. So much so that I didn't even remember it until I recently read the show. All in all, it is miserably forgettable. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing was the acronym. Guilty pleasure, they call it ... ninanana ninanana ...
