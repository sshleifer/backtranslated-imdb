I rented this DVD without any prior knowledge. I was suspicious of seeing Michael Madsen appear in a film I've never heard of, but it was a tribute, so why not take a look. <br /> <br /> Well, my guess is that Mr. Blonde would like so much to forget that he ever took part in a shame of a movie. <br /> <br /> Apparently, if your script and dialogues are terrible, even good actors can't save the situation. Not to mention the amateur actors who flood this film. Too many non-native English speakers are native English speakers, reading the lines of a script that should have been thrown away and not turned into a movie. It's amazing how incredible all the lines are in the film. The music is horrible and totally out of place, and the whole thing looks and feels like a school comedy. <br /> <br /> I advise you to watch it only to appreciate other better films. This is why I gave a 3 instead of the 1 it deserves.
