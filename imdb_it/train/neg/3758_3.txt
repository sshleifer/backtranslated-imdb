When I first saw this film I thought it would be a good sasquatch movie. Usually when you have these types of films there is generally ONE Sasquatch, but is there something similar in this? 7 or 10 of them? The acting was good, the plot went well, I liked the scenes in which the sasquatch is killing the first victims, great job with the camera. I expected it to be a bloody movie, but it was very little. This film was much better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channel really needs to make more sasquatch movies, that is I really liked Sasquatch Mountain, Abominibal wasn't good, what I'm reviewing is fine, but the Sasquatch movie wasn't, but I'm not reviewing it let me back track. This film is good for a rainy Saturday afternoon, but for other occasions, no.
