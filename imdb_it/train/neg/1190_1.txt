The weak Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" Flay and Mario Batali bring him down. <br /> <br /> Flay is the worst. Definitely a pony a trick, I think they could get other American chefs to come to the table on this like the Iron Chefs. The type of dishes with which this duo really approaches ... does not reflect on the creativity of the original Iron Chef series. I don't think Batali even went to chef school, actually. There are many great chefs in America, I just wonder why they don't appear on the food web. <br /> <br /> It would also help to have more regional ingredients and perhaps co-guests able to manage the pressure. I like Alton Brown, but he's a little too cheeky / funny about this role.
