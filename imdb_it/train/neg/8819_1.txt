this is without doubt the worst piece of stupid and horrible shit I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> this film plot is that a boy goes crazy and dresses up as Santa and kills people BECAUSE he saw his mother give his father oral sex while he was dressed as a holy clause. WHY INSANE HAS GOED? Is it just me or is it the worst damn reason why anyone could go crazy like that? and it's not the only thing I'm serious when I say NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS DAMN FILM. nothing until 1 hour and 15 minutes have passed. <br /> <br /> there is a whole horrible scene in which he glues a very cold holy beard on him. IT'S A FRIGGIN LONG MINUTE. WHO WANTS TO SEE SEE THAT? however I have to say that the end of this film made me laugh out loud. so if you see this movie on TV or something like that, come back in 1 hour and 20 minutes just to watch the worst conclusion in the history of cinema without a doubt. and I'm serious about this. <br /> <br /> it's not even that good it's bad, it's boring, it's idiotic, it made me want to break the VCR. not even worth your time, I'm sure every other review mentioned this, but the actress who played the mother in Home Improvement was in this movie for a fraction of a second. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH IS THIS FILM? I HAVE IMPROVED THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE HOUSE FOR SIXTY SIX HOURS, THEREFORE ALSO WATCH THIS FILM FOR MORE AND MORE.
