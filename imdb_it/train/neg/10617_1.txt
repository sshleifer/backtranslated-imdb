Probably encouraged by admirers of his very best "Orlando", here Potter offers a vehicle for himself in the worst way: he writes, directs, interprets, and actually co-writes music, including a sweetmeat love song. The film is very similar to a school or university project by a teenager who believes that his intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating for us as for her. But the character of Potter is so indifferent as the object of his romantic obsession is unlikely, and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism disguised as a celebration of tango. Maybe if she didn't launch she could work. He can't act, whether he plays or not. Pretentious, too ambitious, boring and foolish.
