Drew Barrymore plays the young Holly Gooding, who moves with the aspiring hacker screenwriter Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) and completely interrupts his life claiming that his "doppelganger", or evil twin, wants to kill her and her family. <br /> <br /> This silly horror film is a bit difficult to take seriously, even if the filmmakers and the actors themselves seem to be really serious. "Doppelganger" is confused, with an unpleasantly stupid dialogue. <br /> <br /> Some viewers will notice that the name of Drew's character is taken from the role of Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's", and that the name of the character of Newbern is a play on the name of the famous author Patricia Highsmith (actually trying to rewrite "Breakfast" as a horror movie, believe it or not!). I suppose you deserve some credit for not being your typical horror movie enough - I mean, writer / director Avi Nesher seems genuinely interested in his characters, and gives his film more plot than regular slasher. <br /> <br /> After a stupid rascal-explains-all-for-the clash with the public, the film continues to present a horrible, exaggerated climax that must be seen to be believed. This film certainly doesn't skimp on blood. <br /> <br /> But hey! Drew kills his mother in this. No, I'm not kidding. Jaid Barrymore shows up close to the start to be slaughtered violently. <br /> <br /> Drew is always very watchable and very sexy in this. Newbern looks like a pretty nice and "cute" guy. But the climax of the film must be the scene of Sally Kellerman, an attractive professional veteran in her only ex-nun scene who started a sex relationship (!!!!!!). <br /> <br /> The film is basically junk but rather amusing on a small, squalid and sordid level. <br /> <br /> 4/10
