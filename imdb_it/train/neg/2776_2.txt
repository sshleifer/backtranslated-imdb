The King Maker is a film about a series of real events (necessary for the quote) that occurred during the Portuguese occupation of Indochina. <br /> <br /> Although the costumes and art direction are commendable, the film still fails to impress the viewer. The acting in particular was extremely poor. Some actors are trying to make tears fall and accents, both true and false, are extremely irritating. Even the plot was too stupid and too stupid to be true and seemed more like a history lesson. The film could not even capture that kind of royal and secular air and it seemed more like a failed attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> Final say? The costumes and the art direction give the film a breath of fresh air, but the execution was extremely poor and the actors could not even give bursts of natural emotion. In short, the film seemed more hullabaloo than a script.
