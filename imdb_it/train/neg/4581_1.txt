Attempted attempt to use science to justify new age religion / philosophy. The two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about Quantum Physics in this mess is simply wrong. <br /> <br /> Examples? Quantum theory supports the ideas in Eastern religions that reality is an illusion. Such as? Well, in the subatomic world, the localization of particles in a specific moment can never be predicted in a definitive way. You can only give the possibility that it is exactly at one point at a time. Furthermore, the act of observation seems to influence the event. Solid particles can pass through barriers. This is accurate so far. But then they assert that this means that if you sincerely believed you could cross a wall, you could really do it. This is complete poppycock. Instead, the theory states that at our level, it is possible for you to walk through a wall, but it is simply by chance and has nothing to do with belief. Also you should keep walking in the wall for eternity to have even the remotest chance of going through the wall, the odds are so astronomically against it. <br /> <br /> This is just an example of how to misrepresent science. But much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer, played by Marlee Maitlan. At about half of the image, it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible. Something that has to do with negative thoughts that lead to addiction and self-hatred. There may be something true, but quantum physics has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, string theory is the newest and hottest thing in physics today. Instead of wasting time with this dreck, I suggest you rent The Elegant Universe, an extraordinary series for NOVA on PBS that gives you a Newton and gravity physics story for Ed Witten and M Theory in just 3 hours of episodes. Quantum mechanics is explained quite well if you want to know without the fog of metaphysical appropriation.
