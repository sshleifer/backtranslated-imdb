When you put your hands on a British film you expect a certain quality. And when it comes to acting, working with the camera, lighting etc; this film is business. It is made by highly qualified craftsmen. Only this can bring you a pleasant hour and a half. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you really don't find anything. In addition to making you feel good and defend a liberal view of drugs, there's really nothing there. The script is mediocre, the plot is predictable and the ending must be one of the worst east of Hollywood. In all it is English intimacy, it is just a shameful and cynical attempt to do another "Full Monty". Why did they make this movie? I have no idea, apart from making money, of course.
