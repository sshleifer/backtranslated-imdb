Lynne Ramsey creates arrest images and Samantha Morton can evoke feelings with a gesture. So that he struggles to discover their talents wasted in that musty and pretentious smell. <br /> <br /> Ramsey cannot bring Callar to life. His attempts are too artistic and oblique. His camera lingers repeatedly on long, silent blows of the distressing actress, as if Morton's darkened look alone could provide character. We are in an empty Hellholian hell of self-indulgence: for a film that has a few minutes to spend on insects crawling across the floor, one might think that it could go so far as to give body to its protagonist. But how will he do it if he rarely talks? Without the interior monologue of the novel, the celluloid Morvern Callar is nobody. Ramsey's little marvel often robs Morton. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the first ten minutes were recited in such an impressive manner, turned and mounted that my hopes were rising dramatically. Give a lot to the film: it knows how to make promises, if not how to keep them.
