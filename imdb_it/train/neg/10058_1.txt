I was fascinated by how bad this film was. Should the viewer learn something or think about something here? What was going on with the pumpkins? Should I have been hit by motel shots? Does it matter that there are garbage bags on a roof across the street from a hotel? Because the narrator makes fun of the people he interviewed without success (it's so obvious that he changed the really informative parts of his interviews to get a joke). The best part of the film was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this film is even before it's finished. <br /> <br /> I'm really amazed. I believe the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or trying to impress the intellectual community.
