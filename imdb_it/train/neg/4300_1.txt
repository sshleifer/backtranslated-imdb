Buford's Beach Bunnies gives the B-grade T & A movies a bad name. As a fan of the genre, I was appalled to find a small attempt to exploit the young talent actresses. I refer specifically to the clear lack of nude scenes and simulated sex scenes. What are the future generations of sad adolescents who watch this on TV late at night?
