As "First Blood", this attempt to make a point about the treatment of veterinarians in Vietnam, but there is not much time between this monotonous gunshot, burns, stabs, torture and explosions while an impossibly indestructible Rambo takes half of the Asia, a ton of Vietnamese soldiers, most of the Russian army, various vehicles and anything else that could point a rocket launcher. The only woman in the middle of all these children's toys is immediately hit, allowing testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the script degenerate into a series of loud noises. Providing some banal musical cues with help is Jerry Goldsmith, who carefully monitors all the clich√© themes from the Russian rat-a-tat to the Chinese ching-chang-chong in case we don't understand who we are looking at. Stallone has a brain in his head; this empty absurdity is beneath him.
