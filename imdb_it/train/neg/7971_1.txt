I'm not sure who is writing these <br /> positive reviews for this movie, but trust me STKINKS. I've seen hundreds of horror movies and slasher movies and this is LAME, it's only about 80 minutes long and believe me it's all I could do. The plot is terrible, acting is even worse. And there is no development at all. <br /> <br /> Even David Cocteau's films are better than this. Run from Jigsaw. I expected to hate acting, which can be forgiven live on video if the plot is good. <br /> <br /> This one wasn't afraid, very little Gore, <br /> <br /> and a really attractive cast. <br /> <br /> I saw this with three other friends <br /> <br /> which I hope I'm still talking about! <br /> <br /> They wanted me to run out of the window. I can't believe someone could have <br /> <br /> given this tripe a good review.
