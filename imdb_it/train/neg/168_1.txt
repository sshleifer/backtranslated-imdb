Despite a decent first season, this series has never been close to realizing its potential. Set as a prequel to the original "Star Trek" series, it was condemned almost from the start by an executive producer, Rick Berman, who felt compelled to artificially limit and narrow the definition of what a "Star Trek" series could be ( which has made this futuristic show more and more anachronistic from a dramatic point of view). The current show-runner, Brannon Braga, has not helped things out of his uninspired and tired remake of Trek's previous episodes and the neglected disregard of the franchise's internal mythology (it was painfully obvious at the beginning that he was only present for salary ). I've never seen a series that has been so wrong with a cast of talented actors (except Jolene Blaylock) that last so long. It is as if this whole series was produced in a bubble existing outside the contemporary television scene in which the public (even a Trekker audience) is more demanding and sophisticated in its desires and dramatic desires. Unfortunately it seems that Berman and Braga managed to convince Paramount superiors that "Enterprise" suffered from "franchise fatigue" and that its main audience did not go away but was rejected. Produce a quality offer that respects the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they (the public) will come. <br /> <br /> Simply put, in a TeeVee universe where shows like "Battlestar: Galactica" and "The Shield" are shown, power-ups must give viewers a "Star Trek" that is all 'height and extremely competitive. It's just so simple and straightforward.
