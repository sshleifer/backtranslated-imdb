They are never much for classic films. Movies like Patton, Going My Way, How Green was My Valley, The Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Citizen Kane bore me. However, I'd rather see one of those movies 3,469 times while I'm tied up in a chair than watching An American in Paris once in the most luxurious suite ever. If I had done the latter, I probably would have slept all the time. <br /> <br /> The art direction of color and music didn't interest me, Gershwin or not Gershwin. Dancing and singing could help a sleepless person sleep. The dialogue does not correspond to Singin 'in the Rain. Basically, this film is boring. The only other movie I fell asleep while watching was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. But you can't blame me. I slept only 5 minutes the night before. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (Too bad we can't give zero).
