The biggest one that bothers me is that they say that Zues accepts DUTCH commands. But she speaks German to him. The 2 languish are completely different, it's like saying "well take the French commands" and start speaking Spanish. James Belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedian, not a minimally detective. The role doesn't suit him, even if it's his play. <br /> <br /> Many stereotypes / predictable things. Typical comment or comeback. <br /> <br /> If you don't look at those things I think it could be a good movie to watch if it's ever on TV. But I would not suggest renting it.
