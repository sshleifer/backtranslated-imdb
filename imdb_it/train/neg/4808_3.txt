Ok, I've seen a lot of movies dealing with witches and the occult, but this was just weird. This film begins like this witch cult led by a hideous Orson Wells who plays the lead role (they couldn't have gotten someone who looked and behaved more like a satanist) who didn't belong in this movie. But anyway, the coven takes a new member and stabs a doll that looks like someone and makes her have a mistake. The lady who had the mistake and her husband leave for a place called Lillith out of love and the lady in the meantime is seeing a picture of her sister or whoever is calling her and advises her to stay away from there and never use his powers there or she will die. The couple after they settled in the strange city discover that all the inhabitants are all witches and she becomes nosy and is afraid of all her neighbors and friends. Then strange things start to happen as the lady discovers a funeral that takes place on a hill that suddenly disappears (which was disturbing) as well as seeing Orson Wells's little boy at the playgroud who later asks the lady to help him bring him back to life. The lady soon tries to escape from the city, but only to find herself overwhelmed by her inhabitants and powers and finds herself ignoring all that the spirit tries to warn her about. This movie is ok, it has moments of suspense but it could have really done a lot better than having Orson in there.
