I just did an episode ("Crouch End"). The dialogue was written and a bit down in the mood was worthy. The acting was tragic. Eion Bailey, despite his best attempts to be dramatic, remains mostly expressionless. His eyebrows hint at a recent botox treatment. Claire Forlani could have just as easily played the damsel in distress in a silent film. The characters were cartoons, each of which played its stereotype in the plot for the most casual and tortuous plot. Kitsch special effects can be justified given the budget of the TV miniseries. But attempts to create suspense and surprises through distracting cinematography have added to the lack of consistency. I have a feeling that the ending should have been witty and surprising, but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story. If I had to compare his general quality with something else, I would put this episode of "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" on a par with the NBC Hercules.
