The Angry Red Planet (Quickie Review) <br /> <br /> Like "The Man From Planet X", this is a bizarre science fiction story from a time when fantasy and science fiction were still damn close to the same thing. It means we have some extremely laughable special effects and a wild pseudo-science masquerade as science fiction. And yes, it's another "classic" published in a high quality transfer with a sharp image and clear sound - by Midnite Movies. <br /> <br /> So, the main reason for watching this movie? Oh, it's definitely all the time our space crew is on Mars. (What, did you think "Angry Red Planet" referred to Neptune?) First of all, this is a poor quality space crew that embarks on a spaceship, where they smoke and hurl themselves around a male chauvinist and chauvinist directed to the member of the "frail female" of the crew. It would be a little offensive by today's standards if it wasn't so damn funny. But Mars is the real reason why we're looking at this thing. The film is generally in black and white, but Mars, well Mars is screaming bloody red. It is shot in this bizarre red sheen that gives the angry red planet a rather interesting appearance of an overexposed red. It really is a beautiful sight, as are the spectators (ha ha) aliens to see. The best is the "ratbatspidercrab". Do you think it's a joke? This is what they call in the movie! It is a gigantic chimera (small marionette) of something that unites traits of rats, bats, spiders and crabs. It binds to all the puppets and scares our "heroic team". There are other strange and ill-imagined aliens to see, but that takes the cake. Eventually, after their harrowing experience on Mars, the sexist crew will board their "ship" and return to any planet from which it came. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone. Science fiction films and curiosity enthusiasts, and some fans of general cinema. Fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 will have a field day with this (if they never got it on the show). <br /> <br /> 2/10 Modern score, 6/10 Nostalgia score, 4/10 overall. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
