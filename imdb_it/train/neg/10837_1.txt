I can't tell you how angry I am after watching this movie. The characters are not the least interesting, and the plot is non-existent. So, after waiting to see how the lives of these characters influenced each other, hoping that the last 2 and a half hours would lead to a significant ending, what do we get ??? A storm of frogs. Now yes, I understand the references to the Bible (Exodus) and the underlying theme, but first of all, it was presented with absolutely no resolution, and secondly it would be lost to anyone who has not read the Bible (a significant portion of the population) or Charles Fort (an even larger portion). As a rather well-read person, I thought this film was an indulgent imitation of an episode of Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. It would be better to spend reading ... <br /> <br /> ... well, whatever is honest
