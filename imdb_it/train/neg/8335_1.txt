The pakage implies that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn are pulling out a huge bank robbery, but that's not what I got! I have not received anything! In the first half there is a new character (without introduction) in every other scene. The first half hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is just a long chase, boring and poorly lit. There's always an irritating sound in the background, whether it's a noisy ticking, a siren blaring, a train whistling, or even the horrible soundtrack of Quincy Jones. There are many parts that are also ridiculous. Like, the bad guys chasing Beatty on thin ice with a car! Or the police arrive at the scene about fifteen times. I really hated this movie!
