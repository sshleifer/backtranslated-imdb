Not since Caligula I thought of turning the film off halfway ... but then with this, I only had 15 minutes when I considered it. Unfortunately, I did it all the way. Make sure you don't. <br /> <br /> It is not that Cradle of Fear is shocking or bloody or scary or frightening or sexual. It is that it is none of those things, yet he desperately wants to be all of them. Instead, it's boring, trivial, ordinary, predictable, and not performed in an exceptionally poor way (shot on video, special effects from high school, no sense of basic visual storytelling, barely audible dialogue ... not worth listening , However). /> <br /> This film is proof that even straight-to-video distributors must draw a line in the sand somewhere.
