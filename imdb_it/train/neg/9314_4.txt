Well ... overall, this movie was pretty much useless, and it's basically a horror movie that ended up being more than a comedy. I just rented this movie last night when my friends and I went to the sample movie looking for a scary movie. This was definitely not what we were looking for, but it satisfied us with humor. The actors in this movie (especially Brandon) are so fake that it's fun. And especially that girl from Tracy every time she's in the room with the boards closed telling the clown to leave. They show almost no emotion and it is so obvious that they act. And even when the clown looks through that piece of black paper and grabs Mark, he doesn't even seem scared even though the clown grabbed him and started attacking him. And seriously, could you just do JOGGING if you were chased? I would be running for my life! (Even if someone could run faster than that clown because it's like 300 pounds.) Not to mention that the effects aren't great, like every time the clown cuts Susan's head in the forest, then every time he throws his head in room with Denise and Tracy whenever Denise returns the head. Even as in the comment of the previous boy, the beginning makes absolutely no sense and I don't even see why it was included in the film. So this film was made in 2003? The music made it look like it was made like in the 80s, and the camcorder (?) Isn't even very professional. Half the time, it seems like the camera can't even stand still when it's supposed to be. In general, I should say that I liked the film. I wouldn't recommend it if you try to find something that scares you, but if you're looking for something to tease or make you laugh, I'd recommend it for sure.
