My husband rented it from a video store thinking it was suspense. (He never reads the synopsis). <br /> <br /> Well, it would be fun if it were watchable. It simply isn't. The same thing over and over again, no intrigue and WHERE did the protagonist find? The leading man, Michael Des Barres, is not even good-looking, especially for this role he was assigned. Furthermore, sexual harassment in the workplace is something that, if you want to see, lease "Disclosure" by Michael Crichton. At least Michael Douglas looked good in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul, who is usually watchable, plays an embarrassing scene here. There are also cheaper lighting effects than your web cam. Don't waste your time renting it. 0/10.
