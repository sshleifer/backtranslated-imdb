I have to say, I usually like horror movies that I've never seen ... however, this was simply pathetic to my bloody taste. I'm used to bloody and harrowing types ... but this particular film was lame. The acting was horrible (yet the fucking jokes (no pun intended) were nice). And the sequel to Scarecrow Slayer was even worse! Yes, probably, when it first came out, there was a big rave about it and people liked it. But when movies like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose come out, films like these look like childish movies like the Scarecrow. If you want a movie just to pass the time, choose this one! The special effects are as cheap as heck. But since it was a low budget movie, I can see where it would have arrived. This will remind you of the movie "Children Of The Corn". Independent rock movies ... most of the time. So if you want to see a scarecrow kill people with corn on the cob, or in the sequel, 2 scarecrows that go there, then these movies would be for you.
