This film is a portrait of the half-spastic boy Benjamin who has to visit a boarding school because of his bad marks in mathematics. He didn't have the best experiences in his life before and he had serious problems with self-esteem. After a difficult start in his new school, he starts making friends, falls in love with a girl and does some American Pieish teenager stuff. <br /> <br /> In addition to some comedy elements, the film is told in a very serious way, focusing on Benjamin and his problems. <br /> <br /> If you don't like this plot already, save your time and look at something else. If you do, keep the following in mind: <br /> <br /> 1) Benjamin is a total loser. Whatever it does, it does it terribly wrong and then continues to charge it all the time. For me it was not the kind of "charming loser" with whom you can feel sympathy and laughter. Instead he and his behavior really annoyed me and with my teenage years not so far away I could barely stand by and watch. <br /> <br /> 2) The film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be but from my experience the characters are not (except perhaps for Janosch). And yes, I know that this film is based on a self-biography written by a seventeen-year-old - but having some experiences with German schools and young Germans, I don't believe them. <br /> <br /> 3) Showing sexual arousal is really important for a film with this topic. But I doubt teenagers make a "Ejaculate on the biscuit", ie where everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during mass masturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the wet sperm cookie later. Although he enjoyed me in a despicable way, it is not funny nor I stress the serious attempts of this film. <br /> <br /> 4) There is a subplot on Benjamin's family and his father betraying his wife - again, I don't know why he is there and where to put it. He really bored me. <br /> <br /> Well, I personally hated this movie for having Benjamin's character, without a message, a concept, a scheme, anything and it's failed attempts to be dramatic and serious. However, I can imagine that some people may find it sensible and moving. If you liked "The Other Sister" you will probably like it too. I hated both. <br /> <br /> 17-year-olds shouldn't write an autobiography and, if they do, it doesn't seem to be the best idea to make a movie out of it. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
