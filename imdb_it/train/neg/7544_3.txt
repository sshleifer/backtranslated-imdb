Before this film was not so bad. It was fun ... at least for me probably for all the wrong reasons. I've never seen the original so I can't compare the two. <br /> <br /> This film reminded me of that strange Christopher Reeve Village of the Damned movie. The two films have different plots, but in both there is that disturbing and disgusting feeling and unwanted comedy. <br /> <br /> The wicker man should be a mystery / thriller / men please don't anger the women's movie. I don't know the whole pagan thing and the sacrifice was a little off. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage, his glorious villain, goes to an isolated island called Summerisle when he receives a calligraphy letter from his lost girlfriend who claims his daughter was taken and hidden by other islanders. <br /> <br /> Cage is a police officer and being the tired cop he is, he goes to a semi-unexplored island without leaving a word about his fate to anyone in the real world. Stupid. <br /> <br /> Things get weirder when the great Amish-esquire women who populate the island growl at him and lie on the spot where the missing girl is. His girlfriend does not help anyone who seems to be elusive and tired all the time. Cage remains on the island when he discovers that the missing girl is his daughter and that he is the lucky man deceived to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the island harvest festival. <br /> <br /> In this film males do not do so well A twisted sick display of feminism? <br /> <br /> I found the film ridiculous at times especially when the cage hits some women and runs in a bear dress. I think there are too many holes in this film. I find that the whole concept of angry women is hiding on an island without any care for males, but the way it was portrayed in this film was strange. While most women have had some wounds and anger, this is clearly a form of sexism. I would have turned the film off in disgust if the roles had been reversed. This movie is something to watch maybe just once or twice. It is NOT a thriller, it should be classified as weird.
