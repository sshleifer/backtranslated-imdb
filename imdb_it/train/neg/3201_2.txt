Joe Don Baker is good at a good actor in small roles here and there ... he was good at Goldeneye and made a good Bond villain in The Living Daylights and appeared in various other films. One thing he can't do is bring a movie as a protagonist, which is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed, so he kills the murderer's brother and accompanies the murderer to Italy, but some guys land the plane in Malta and the killer leaves. The rest of the film sees Joe Don chasing the murderer here and there, Joe Don is taken into custody several times, Joe Don tortures a bartendar and is interrupted and so on. The film is pretty ugly and you won't find yourself exactly attracting the character of Joe Don. You will be surprised by how many times Joe Don the hero gets punched and how incompetent he proves to be. The final part of the film comes when Joe Don chases the murderer from all over Malta with the murderer in a priest's suit and then they get on the boat and chases them around Malta. This film also features one of the worst closing lines to close a film of all time.
