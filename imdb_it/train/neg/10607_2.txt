Jean Claude Van Damme tries to save his career by making the sequel to Universal Soldier. But, did that movie save him? I think he goes to hell, after he dies. <br /> <br /> In the first minute, we see the inside of a structure, where you can see the bad guy from the movie. Scary, eh? But not as scary as acting (the details are following). <br /> <br /> Then, we see Van Damme with a black girl (I don't remember the name .... well it doesn't matter anyway), trying to escape from some muscular men. Obviously they are the new Universal-Soldiers. More muscle, less brain (just like the movie). After a while, Van Damme fights Goldberg but then the "mission" is interrupted. It was just a test (is this film a test for our nerves?). It turns out that Van Damme works for the government in the new Universal Soldier project (Whoever saw the first film might think this is the most unusual thing that the Van Dammes character could do). But it's a sequel. And a "story" must come out. Ah, I forgot. He has a daughter. Very important for the "history". <br /> <br /> Well, after about 20 minutes, a super computer hears a conversation about closing it and leaving the project. Obviously the cube gets angry and activates all the soldiers to kill everyone. Van Damme escapes from the facility, but the computer sends some soldiers to hunt him down (he wants Van Damme as a soldier - because he is the best (really?)). And guess what, Goldberg is one of the hunters, which has always been a stupid phrase for the public before it buggers. Funny? Yes, just like the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> After a "story", Van Damme tries to save his daughter (his wife's - journalist from the first movie). Get to a final show where Van Damme fights the bad guy and you can see the most expensive scene in the whole movie (see for yourself. It's too funny to say). <br /> <br /> We will see that this film is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> So don't watch it. But if you do, keep a six pack with you!
