A group of kids has set up a theater for an all-night marathon of horror movies. However, as the night continues, there is someone among them who kills them one at a time. Who is ... and why? I saw him in a theater back in 1991. I couldn't wait - but boy! It didn't work at all. The premise is good, they have a young and very attractive cast and some professionals like Dee Wallace Stone on board ... but it doesn't work. The story stops making sense in half (it could be due to a huge montage before the film was released), the killings are relatively bloodless (like this got an R score is beyond me) and the unmasking of the killer in the end it was boring and stupid. <br /> <br /> It's really too bad - this film had potential. With a better script this could have become a great horror movie. As it is, it's mostly forgotten and the cast itself looks embarrassed (I've heard that Stone won't talk about this). I give him a 3 and this is only for the cast.
