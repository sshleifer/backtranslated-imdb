I saw "Shiner" on DVD. While I was watching, I thought, "This is a really bad porn movie without porn". I also thought, "Anyone who wrote this has real problems." Then I saw the director / writer Carlson explain his process as a special feature. Yes, it was really special. <br /> <br /> The film's emphasis is on two alcoholic losers who beat each other down. They are marginally attractive. There is a complete frontal nudity. These factors probably explain that the film was seen at all. <br /> <br /> The most shocking element of the film is the gay assassination and the consequent further gay murder of the same victim who tries inept to take revenge on his assailants, the two drunk losers. Not only is the subject managed absurdly and negatively from a technical point of view, but the acting is terribly ugly. <br /> <br /> Then there's the boxer-stalker theme. This is really crazy, not just absurd. This hunky boxer is somehow traumatized by the persistent attentions of a meaty mom boy who works in the parking lot of his gym. This is in Los Angeles, attention. The boxer is so traumatized that he shows up at the stalker's house, strips in front of him and gets excited in the process. <br /> <br /> Well, all I can say is, why is a boxer in the heart of an exhibitionist so traumatized by the attention of a stalker? It just doesn't make sense. And, I'm afraid, some psychodynamics actually make sense, if you take the time to read them. However, bad screenplays rarely make sense. <br /> <br /> The director / writer seems to have thought that this film represents a considerable minority within the gay community. Well, it could be correct, I suppose. Perhaps we will never know, since that minority would be so dysfunctional that they would hardly be able to get organized enough to arrive at an obscure gay film festival or DVD store, the only two places to find this turkey. Thank God for that.
