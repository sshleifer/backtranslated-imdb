I enjoyed watching it and having fun with the total malice of a movie. I saw this film through the useful sarcasm of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I have the DVD. If you flip the other side of the DVD, they show the movie itself, so I gave it a chance. Seriously, people are grilled cheese. <br /> <br /> The acting, the special effects and the plot in general are very approximate and unrealistic. "He doesn't need his lungs," said Crow, noticing how his head could still talk while he had no body, and Tom Servo commented only nostalgically "No, he has neck juice!" The ending is simply classic and nobody can touch this soundtrack with K-Porn! I loved the "cat fight" between the two strippers. That "Meow" after the fight or the scene, whatever, was classic. So in some ways this was a fun movie. I think for horror fans, you'll probably like it. For a good time, look at the MSTK3 version, you'll have a great time. <br /> <br /> MST3K Version: 10/10 The brain that would die: 1/10
