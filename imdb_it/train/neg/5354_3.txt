Absence of a GOOD PLOT, absence of decent ACTING, absence of good CINEMATOGRAPHY, absence of decent special effects ... should I go on? The review may contain SPOILERS. The actors seem to READ their lines, and not very well. Most "actors" acted as if they were in a SECOND DEG game. The story seemed to have been written by one of the two second-grade students ... it is not all that is twisted ... it is simply so simple and ridiculous, that a person thinks he should miss something so they think he is twisted. No it is not, it is EXACTLY SIMPLE as you think it is. I PUT THE "film", that's how I know STUNK! Most of the film only had people standing around talking (reading their lines), TRYING to look sinister. The narrator was INCREDIBLE. The "special effects" were LOVED. I love cheap movies. I also like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry and Michael Berrymore ... not only in THIS movie ... you can say they weren't paid or they weren't paid much, because neither their NOR hearts had any talents. I LOVE Tony Todd ... however, it was just adequate in this film. In fact, Tony Todd's performance is the ONLY reason I gave 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony was just for an entire TWO MINUTES (seriously)! I would suggest that the two-minute Tony Todd segment quickly advance the DVD. If I went to the theater, and paid more than a DOLLAR to watch this "movie", I would have been at the P.O.D and would have asked for my money back. We hope that the people who did it will do better next time.
