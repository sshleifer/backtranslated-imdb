Doppelganger has its moments, but they are few and far between. Essentially, this is a B-grade blend of pop-psych thrillers, ghost and horror stories. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman obsessed with the demons of her past (most of her family was killed and she, in at least one case, is the main suspect), or does she only have a bad case of multiple personality disorder? George Newbern is his new roommate, and most of the action centers on him. <br /> <br /> The character of Newbern is quite understanding, and both he and Barrymore do a decent job (though not really good). The mediocre (sometimes) totally hideous script and the insignificant direction seem to have come together to sink the rest of the performances into oblivion. The character of Leslie Hope is memorable, but so irritating that you will want to forget it. <br /> <br /> The plot eventually disintegrates into a bifurcate (a narrative arc is psychological realism, the other is supernatural horror) extravagant climax that is so poorly conceived, recited and photographed that effectively contrasts most of the value that the film had previously achieved. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film has the feeling of what could be expected to be the result of the first of M. Knight Shamalyan university film course. The acting and the script for the two protagonists are good enough to make you worry a little about them - at least until the film derails completely and completely. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - send your doppelganger, but avoid a first-personal meeting.
