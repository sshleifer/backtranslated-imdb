Dynasty revisited in Hawaii ... Full of clich√©s, highly predictable, unrealistic and sometimes even stupid. However, if you have nothing better to do, it offers 40 minutes of simple and unpretentious entertainment, endless looks on large male and female muscles and a great picture of the spectacular Hawaiian scenery. On the other hand, if you're looking for something more, stay away ... <br /> <br /> Oh, and anyway, if you've ever worked in a hotel or know something about managing one, you have two options: 1. You will feel sick every two minutes because of the stupidity and stupidity of how the show presents Hotel Business or, 2. Look at it like a science fiction comedy like I did, lie down, relax and laugh about it!
