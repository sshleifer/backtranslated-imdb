I have just returned from "El Otro" playing here in Buenos Aires and I must say I was very disappointed. The film is very slow (don't get me wrong, I like slow moving movies!), Slow to the point of driving you crazy. All you hear is the breath of Julio Chavez throughout the film. This is a badly made film, but more importantly, it's a film without a lick of inspiration, I haven't heard anything about the story or its characters. <br /> <br /> "El Otro" was made just for the sake of making a film ... make it forgetful. I would advise you to pass it on, if you want to see good Argentine films, look for Sorin's films.
