My wife and I watch a movie every night without distractions, and mostly artistic films that require thought. I have a lot of patience for films that are slowly blooming. My wife has twice as much attention as I do. That being said, this film is simply empty and BORING! He didn't go anywhere. Never blossomed It started strong enough with a promising texture ... then it cooks the biscuits ... it goes to Spain .... she sulks, she stares ... the credits come out. Irregular, full of holes, false starts and dead ends. We leafed through several extended sequences of her simply staring at the space. The artificial depth was implicit when she played with mud and cried. Zzzz ...... It's like a shot of a well shot chicken pretending to be deep or artistic. You never knew or understood Morvern. Halfway through you it doesn't matter anymore. We just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop. Don't waste time with this. I am shocked that he points so high.
