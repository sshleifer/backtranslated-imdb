The film starts slowly when we arrived at the cinema, we thought it was good enough, but after about 5 minutes we were all bored by our mind and wondered what kind of film we came to see, I don't like this movie and I wouldn't recommend it to no one, the best part of the evening was when the alarm and the lights came back on because the project collapsed because we thought we could all go home. this must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, we were all bored or minded and most people in the cinema actually felt out of doors in the end because it was so lousy. I'm surprised no one came out before that. if you go to see it, make sure you have something to keep busy, better yet, don't go and see it at all.
