This must go down as almost one of the worst films of all time. Terrible attitude, horrible script ... and they were the positive points! One to definitely miss! The jokes, if I could call them that, were so predictable as to be pathetic. Pamela Anderson is still relying on her body to downplay the fact that her acting is just as plastic! I sat willing to give him a chance, hoping he would improve the result, alas no! If it were a choice between this and a book, I suggest you settle in for a good read! I like Denise Richards, which is why I started this movie, but because she got involved in this movie, it's beyond me!
