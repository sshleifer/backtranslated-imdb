This film is about a very young girl, Cassie, (Melissa Sagemiller) who leaves her family and heads for a college freshman. One night Cassie and her friends decide to go to a wild party with a lot of drinking and dancing and Cassie is riding with her boyfriend but she never told him she loved him. While driving Cassie, a car was stopped in the middle of the road and was unable to avoid an accident and consequently there was a bloody loss of life with her boyfriend. Cassie becomes emotionally upset and has nightmares that make her hallucinate that her boyfriend comes back to life and encounters men trying to kill her and is struggling to find out who her true friends are, who wants her dead and the whole horror experience will survive this. Cassie dreams of being made love by her boyfriend after his death and finds another boy in her bed and is told she was asking him to make love. This is an output film, and not a very good one.
