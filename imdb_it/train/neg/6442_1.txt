Not only the author of the film, Steven Greenstreet, obviously idolatrous Michael Moore, but he follows in his footsteps using several Propaganda of Moore film production tactics. But Moore has experience in diverting the viewer from this focus, while Greenstreet is obviously less experienced here. <br /> <br /> Having been aware of all the issues surrounding Moore's speech at UVSC, I was disappointed to see that the community's biggest complaint - that Moore received $ 40,000 in Utah state educational funds for to substantially promote John Kerry's campaign and to publicize his liberal film - they were put aside by Greenstreet, while minor issues were sensationalized. br /> <br /> The marketing methods for this video were equally biased and questionable ... promoting the film by stating that "Mormon tried to kill Moore". Not only is it absurd, but it defames an important religion to which Greenstreet obviously has some personal problems. I followed Moore's visit very closely, and all the major news agencies noticed that Moore's visit came and went without security problems or credible incidents in Utah. <br /> <br /> Greenstreet has focused on this film to get his film career off to a point where he even dropped out of film school to help speed this up. This seems to have been a serious miscalculation, since Moore's visits to some 60 other colleges and universities across the country in 2004 have diluted the interest in this rather common event. Greenstreet's hypothesis that the American public would be interested in this film because of the promoted religious and conservative aspects does not seem to be well founded. <br /> <br /> Even the name of the film, This Divided State, is a bit of a misnomer since Utah overwhelmingly voted for Bush's re-election and therefore appears to be politically more unified than any other state. The division in the film's title seems more indicative of the gap that exists in Greenstreet's ideological differences with his religion and state. If anything, I find a humorous correlation between the religious corner of this alleged documentary and the hilarious quarrel of Woody Allen in Sleeper (1973) that, "I was beaten by the Quakers".
