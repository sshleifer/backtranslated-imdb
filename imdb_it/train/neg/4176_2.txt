Maybe I missed the meeting when the meaning of "B-movie" was explained, but what I saw was ridiculous. Want a good synopsis of this movie? Take Aliens, replace the xenomorphs with vampires, then remove everything that's good, and that's pretty much it. <br /> <br /> 5 minutes into the movie, the "V-SAN team" (it is the stupidest acronym I have ever heard) checks a "base" that has been slaughtered by vampires and then they go down (down? What? ) A staircase obviously attached to a billboard with a clear train of today in the background. When should it happen? 2210. Ok ... (wait, I'll go back to that) <br /> <br /> Yes. The characters. Wow, well, there's the Asian lesbian token chick, the aspiring redneck cowboy, the weather-altered captain, the goth vampire / Hot Topic part-time cashier, and the lousy World War II monk. All of them are played by the respective actors with the same lack of ambition. It almost hurt to see Michael Ironside in this film. Not earning enough money being the voice of Sam Fisher in Splinter Cell? Practically the only original thing about Vampire Wars is how bad it is. <br /> <br /> Watching this postbirth of a movie, the only fun I had was from weak set-making attempts. Since when, when recording PCI computer cards on a wall, do you count as a room ready on a starship? The money required to make this film could have been exploited much better.
