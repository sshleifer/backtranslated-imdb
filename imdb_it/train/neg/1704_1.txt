You wouldn't expect a movie like this to be good, and it's not. It's a zombie movie without budget, ultra violent, shot with a bad hand camera ... and it's hilarious. The actors obviously never acted before and show themselves in their hilarious and terrible readings. There is no plot to be seen. The little plot I found seemed to be an escaped government experiment and a group of zombies seems to terrorize a couple of families. The effects of blood are indeed among the most disgusting I've ever seen. It seems that the effects of violence broke into a butcher shop for all parts of the body, and many scenes involve zombies that dismember people and eat their organs. It's a funny and disgusting film, and it's almost the worst film you can get. <br /> <br /> My assessment: BOMB / ****. 90 minutes
