Private practice should be a medical drama. So I guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in medical history lines. Just looking at House, I "solved" two (out of nine) medical mysteries before the doctors did. Boooring. Seriously, if you're a lazy writer, why not copy some cases from old ER episodes or some obscure Brazilian medical soap? House is recent and popular - recycling ideas is hard to come by ... <br /> <br /> Second biggest complaint: these people should be in their forties, right? So why should they behave with the emotional maturity of fifteen-year-olds? Three weeks (that is three whole damned episodes) of intense thought really necessary to understand that if your best friend doesn't want to be your "friend with benefits", maybe it's not because he wants to hurt you, but because he doesn't do it you want to risk your friendship? The character who does all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way - the whole plot is so unrealistic that you can't really buy into the supposed "drama". <br /> <br /> And I'm not going to even start complaining about what the show did to everyone's favorite Addison as we got to know it on Grey's Anatomy ... In a sidenote, you don't think the way in is fun where Addison ends up wishing the loser Pete (sorry, but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with Mozart's Requiem is a loser, a doctorate or not) and Derek ends up getting stuck in a relationship with Meredith, distant and irritating , miles of rain in rainy Seattle? Apart from that little adventure with Mark, they seemed to be perfect for each other. Sometimes I think Shonda Rhimes' subconscious is trying to tell us that in relationships, our first choice is often the right one ...
