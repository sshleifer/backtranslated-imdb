Although the songs of Frank Loesser are among the best that Broadway has to offer, they are kissed by the lethargic presentation of Joseph L. Mankiewicz and an uninspired presentation - when it is over it almost seems to have seen a musical. Mankiewicz does not seem to know how to present the challenging but melodic melodies of Loesser to get the maximum effect: for example, one of Adelaide's best numbers, "Lament", ends with the release of Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) in the final while sitting a chaise longue; and Stubby Kaye's witty "Sit Down, You're Rockin 'The Boat" has his support choir sitting on folding chairs while he simply stops there. Mankiewicz exploits all the fun by letting the static scenes go on too long and his dialogue (adapted from the stage of Abe Burrows) does not have the wit that his films have like "All About Eve". Part of the blame must go to the protagonists, almost all of them are baffled: Marlon Brando seems baffled about why he's in a musical, Frank Sinatra is too cute a guy and doesn't have the advantage that makes him so essential (the songs aren't adapted to his style ) and Jean Simmons barely records the way a Shirley Jones could. Only Blaine, like the tender Amazon Adelaide, commands our attention as a Broadway professional should. The colorful art direction is by Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol created the flashy sets.
