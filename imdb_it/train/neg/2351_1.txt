I have no idea how anyone managed to stay awake during this show. The acting was amazon and amateur, the story was old news, and the development of the plot (or lack thereof) invariably had my eyelids droop less than half of each episode. This is all there is to say about it, because in reality it had no substance of any kind. <br /> <br /> How do you like people like shit like this? It's really stupid, it's an insult to your intelligence. I don't even know how to explain it further ... It is as if some of you looked at it without thinking in this way just because you like the way some actors look, or because, for whatever crazy reason, you have not seen the same formulas in dozens of shows a million times. <br /> <br /> I just ... forgot. This show sucked, and fortunately it went on forever. I wish they worked to demolish The O.C. once and for all.
