Well, I like the blood in this movie - it's really scary. Anyone who has been to the dentist will know why. The story is not so bad, the motivations of the character of Corbin Bersen make much more sense than in most horror movies. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse acting, directing, screenplay, etc. But at the end of the day this is still a bad horror movie. So it comes down to whether you like that kind of thing or not. I tried watching the sequel, but it was exactly, exactly the same as this movie. Keep in mind only if you like people who are tortured by the dentist, then this is the movie for you!
