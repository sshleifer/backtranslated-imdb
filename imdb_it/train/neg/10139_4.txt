You must deliver it to Steven Seagal: whatever its defects, it tastes good in women. If you choose a Seagal movie, it is likely that there will be one or more very beautiful women. And usually, they don't work like simple candy for the eyes; they get involved in the action and fight, shoot guns, kill with knives, etc. "Flight of Fury" offers the duo of Ciera Payton (who has a very sexy face, with full lips to match Angelina Jolie) and Katie Jones, and finds time to involve them in both a catfight and a small lesbian caressing! And if it seems like a little too much time talking about it, it's because the rest of the film, even if passable, is so unexciting that it's hard to find anything else to talk about. Ironically, the weakest aspect is probably the same Seagal, who does not seem to even bother trying to pretend to worry. Being a military agent, there is not much fighting, and it does not fit his role (a stealth fighter pilot, "the best in the world", of course) very well, which could explain his almost offensive sleepwalking.
