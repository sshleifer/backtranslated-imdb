The upcoming attractions of "The Order" make it look like a decent horror / thriller, but what we get is a plot that has the potential to be excellent, all thrown together to make a pile of junk. <br /> <br /> First of all the whole movie is made up of terrible dialogues and terrible special effects. Even acting was not a source of pride, but Keath Ledger (I think I wrote it well) saved the film in this category. <br /> <br /> For heaven's sake: DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!
