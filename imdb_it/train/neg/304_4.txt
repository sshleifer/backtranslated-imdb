This film portrays Ruth as a sleepy sports figure, drinking, gambling and having fun with a small baseball. Babe Ruth's early childhood was quite interesting and this was in effect omitted in this film. Furthermore, Lou Gehrig was barely covered and this was a well known, good or indifferent relationship, should have been covered better than it was. His life was more than anything bad. He was an American hero, an icon that a lot of baseball greats shaped their lives after. I feel honest with the memory of a great baseball player that this film has completely ignored. Shame on the creators of this film to capitalize on its flaws and not its greatness.
