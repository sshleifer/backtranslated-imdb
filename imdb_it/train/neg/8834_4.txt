there was truth in this film. I remember a story reported 15 to 20 years ago by 4 fishermen who found a body in the water and decided not to report it until the end of the journey. I also remember that they were accused of interfering with a corpse (or some such accusation). I'm not sure if it was in Australia. Viewers outside Australia must think that we live in a country full of rapists and serial killings. Wolf Creek and this film would encourage this perception. The film itself reminded me of A Simple Plan. But to be one of the best Australian films ever, as someone claimed, I can't be so generous. Put it this way, I wouldn't worry about looking at it again.
