This film is incredibly ridiculous. I love horror movies, but this is the worst I've ever seen. I'm a big fan of blood, but most of the deaths in this film aren't shown. It only shows us the bodies that are already dead and the only scenes of death they show in this film are terrible. The graphics seem so obviously fake. Even the actors are horrible. There is no real emotion from any of them. Not only did I waste my time watching this piece of sh * t movie, but I had to subject myself to the actual footage of the animals being beaten during the beginning. If I could evaluate this at -10, I would do it. F * ck this movie. It is rubbish. <br /> <br /> Don't watch it.
