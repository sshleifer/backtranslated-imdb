The explosion of television channels must be eternally grateful to the production line of Randolph Scott Western, because every moment there must be one of those that look like a hundred Randolph Scott films that play on at least one station without a budget. <br /> <br /> "Man Behind The Gun" is a typical early fifties melodrama with pre-Second World War production values ​​based on a mysterious historical plot of murders punctuated by action scenes to mask the complete absence of character development and therefore lack of suspense. In the coming years the role of these films would be taken up by television programs such as "Gunsmoke", "Bonanza", etc. - and actually they did their job better. Randolph Scott, who seems particularly grizzled in this, is the good guy, who fights against the villains against whom he will ultimately prevail. There is no more interest in what passes emotionally than what his horse feels, unless he wonders if he will be able to solve the initial misunderstanding with the female lead in the end. Music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the "characters" than of acting. But it's okay if this floats your boat; and I don't even want to reproach you for having enjoyed "Diagnosis, murder". <br /> <br /> Workmanlike, pedestrian and aging quickly. 3 stars for being competently put together; 0 for the artistic effort.
