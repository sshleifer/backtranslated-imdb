The only reason I watched this film was because I had recently read Robert Hough's short story, not perfect, but interesting, fictionalized about the life of Big Cat's trainer, Mabel Stark. Beaty appears as a character in the book, in a light that is anything but flattering. <br /> <br /> I didn't realize until I saw the movie later on IMDb that it was originally a serial. Anyone who changed the original run time by 233 minutes to the 68 reduced version available on DVD did a great job. The shortened version is suitable for any B movie of the period, despite the many "duh-what?" moments. For example, did we really expect our hero to dig that deep twenty-foot trap in a morning without even getting his jodhpurs dirty? Looking at the titles of the chapters, I see that the number five is titled "Gorilla Warfare" and the number eleven is called "The Gorilla". There were no gorillas in the film at all. I believe it is here that some cuts have been made. <br /> <br /> Historically interesting.
