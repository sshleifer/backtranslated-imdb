This was my first, and probably Angelopoulos' last film. I couldn't wait to get in, as he played Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors and a Theo movie I heard a lot about. The opening was promising, a long shot on a jeep of soldiers across the Greek-Albanian border. OK! but that was all. Nothing left. The film had big holes and I don't know which one to mention before. The main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman. during a long walk. It's like a 15-minute monologue, which kills the action and the patience of the spectators, nothing happens on the screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, apart from this old lady who tells a story. Everything presumed to be shown through action was simply told to the camera by the old lady. In a moment, the TV team was heading for the bar. They turn the corner and the winter begins immediately! Probably, shot on different days, the continuity was leaked. A lot of problems with storytelling went from the absurd to the irrational without ever sticking to a style, making the viewer ask questions that never got answers. Poor Mastroianni, given a role that lacked integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many Greeks or Albanians or Balcan people would agree, the films showed a lot of historicity, ethnicity or politically incorrect, just to make a film about humanity as a red in another review. There is much more to say, but there is no time to lose in a poor movie, which is not a movie at all, but the folly of a person imprinted on the film and paid for with state money.
