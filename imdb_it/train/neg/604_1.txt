I was so disgusted with this film, I felt obliged to warn others. This film has no history, plot or purpose. The film begins after the introduction of the film "leave it to scare", which now all the cinema spectators have become accustomed to. So we can completely ignore the beginning. We are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to everyone that you have just wasted your hard earned money and would be better off looking static. (Unless you have seen the white noise - EEK) acting is a DISMEGRATION and everyone should return to the traveling pantomime from where they came from. That said, even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this movie look remote. Their poor performance does nothing but contribute to the disaster. The meaningless violence and what I can only suppose is the written word of another "eccentric" writer, who probably considers himself an artist, has produced a film that will test your patience. It wasn't until my fellow observer turned to me and said, "We watched this for 45 minutes" I realized that this film is as thin and bland as a cup of tea without a tea bag. Clearly something was missing and unfortunately it was not the public. Rather than suggesting what the film lacks, let me tell you what it has: Dumb Blonde (surprise surprise), Victims, bad-monster-guy-thing, about 2 minutes into a plot that goes on for hours, days, weeks, months ... and credits. <br /> <br /> Do you want a silver lining? Well, the blonde girl is a little impertinent watching in some scenes, but she expects to see her face torn for the rest of the movie!
