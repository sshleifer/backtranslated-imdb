While flipping through the channels on Saturday night, my friends and I came across this movie. First of all the Irish actor Pierce Brosnan in the role of a native American? Seriously?! His accent was breaking through so much, although his character was apparently Scottish. Later, I was stunned to find that this film was made after playing James Bond / Agent 007 at least twice. This film reproduces the stereotypes, with the figure of the inspiring professor. The girl who played Pony should be paid to keep her mouth shut. And this film won an award? I can not believe. Brosnan is an attractive man, but we seriously wanted to evaluate our eyes after watching this for only 10 seconds. We went from "Kicking and Screaming" to this, and we wanted to go back. We watched the 1995 children's classic "The Indian in the Cupboard" early in the night, which also discussed the Iroquois. The following line represents our desire to escape: "Take me out, grasper earth". From "Gray Owl": "If you don't like it, you don't have to look".
