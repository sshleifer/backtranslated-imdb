Such great actors are so disappointing. Marlon Brando sounds and a horrible character, the film is not funny at all, you can see an unconscious message "IT'S A DAMN CRAP !!!" . It's simply disgusting and annoying. Besides the crazy plot, the sense of humor, there is something else. The way the rooms are decorated, the colors. It makes me sick, everything is so colorful that it could cause epilepsy. I don't usually care about the decoration in the film, but this from "Free Money" made me angry. Avoid at all costs! "Free Money" - probably for Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but a spectator gets nothing! One looks at it at the cost of sanity.
