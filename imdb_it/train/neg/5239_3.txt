I watched this movie based on the very favorable reviews I read about it here from others. <br /> <br /> They definitely saw something in this movie that I didn't see, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> The film starts at a good pace, and the first 15 or 20 minutes are interesting, so it starts to get disconnected and draggy, not to say absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> Eventually you find yourself saying, "What?!? Will he do it himself? How far will he go with this thing?" <br /> <br /> The plot begins with the character of Jeff Goldblum, John, going to a delicatessen to buy a bottle of wine. There is a robbery and a new salesman, Auggie Rose, is killed during the robbery. <br /> <br /> John enters the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the boy. It seems a bit too much, but wait, there's more. <br /> <br /> John becomes totally obsessed with Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> For reasons that never make any logical sense, John, who has a very nice life, a beautiful and loving girl, a safe and well-paid job, a nice house, a nice car, expensive clothes - Decides that he wants to be a loser like Auggie Rose, and experience life in a low-income job, living in a landfill with a lively girlfriend and possible connections with dangerous people. <br /> <br /> Because this dim- and half-baked film has received favorable reviews that I will never know. Of course, Goldblum does a great job of acting - it always does - and its appearance has improved with age - but unless you have a big infatuation with Jeff Goldblum and have to see every movie in which it is inserted, I wouldn't recommend this turkey. It is about two hours of your life that you do not go back and, believe me, you will have nothing to be grateful for when those two hours are over, besides being grateful that you are not yet sitting there watching this movie! <br /> <br />
