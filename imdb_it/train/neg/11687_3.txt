A stunning and indescribable disappointment, Inside Man tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington) who is under investigation due to his possible involvement in a missing money case. When a bank is robbed and the hostages are held against their will by a clever thief (Clive Owen) and his team, is the detective in charge of forcing the thief to surrender? his only attempt to prove that he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with her secrets and intent, sent to retrieve an item from the bank owner's safe that is kept inside the bank, and you have enough dilemma. Unfortunately, everything you get in the movie, and in the end nothing makes sense. Denzel Washington is at its most disinterested in an ineffective and disgustingly self-centered performance. The only thing that saves for the film is his co-star Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who are much better than the film itself. In fact, Jodie Foster offers the most amazing and high caliber performances against the ruthless and ruthless type of criminal. A Clive Owen is not given much to do if not to hatch and pose, but the depth of his presence and his acting ability achieved compensate for his underdeveloped role. It is strange that so many talents are wasted in this film of little impact or interest. You have to ask yourself what director Spike Lee thought while creating this film. The most perplexing aspect of Inside Man, however, is the amount of unjustified praise he has received. For a film that seemed to have all the features of a pre-summer blockbuster, it falls horribly flat.
