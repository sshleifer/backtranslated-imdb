I saw a lot of crap in my time, but good, Hot Rod takes the cake. I saw a free screening in New York the other night. I can only hope that they will show the funny version to paying customers. The big laughs were scarce, the plot was not interesting and the characters were at most one dimension. One of the highlights is an exhilarating dancing scene with Adam Samberg. It was priceless and it was the only scene I really had a good laugh at. Besides this, I can only remember the randomness and the dead air. SNL and Samberg fans could be disappointed. I know I expected more from this. But in short, I certainly wouldn't recommend attending a free screening or paying to watch this movie.
