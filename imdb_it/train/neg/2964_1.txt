Laugh a lot - because it's so incredibly bad - sorry people, but definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... I know it's a low budget, but anyway: the actors behave as if they were playing in a soap, the dialogues are absolutely lousy and the last time I saw such strange images was in a local trash in some youth video games ten years ago. I really appreciate the fact that people get together and make cheap films, but at least a certain amount of quality should be achieved. But at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the film were interesting and quiet, and the score was really worth listening to. The DVD cover has promised a lot, but this is by far the best that this film has to offer ...
