Just like the first horror movie, The Boogens, the sneaky invisible killer is rather disappointed when it is finally seen. Although Stephen Furst of Animal House obviously enjoyed himself as an incest product, his performance is more comedy than horror. <br /> <br /> The extremely tired plot has three sexy women (Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) can't find a hotel for the evening, so they gladly accept to stay with a seemingly kind museum curator played by the late Sydney Lassick. If you've ever seen a horror movie, you know that adorable 'Sydney is a deranged psychopath, so you know what will happen to the adorable ladies. <br /> <br /> The three women are all very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young (a clone of Helen Hunt) is the only one to be naked, while Sydney watches her take a bath.
