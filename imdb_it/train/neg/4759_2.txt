At the name of Pinter, each knee will bow, especially after his acceptance speech of the Nobel Prize for Literature, which has done little more than regurgitate boxed anti-Americanism, of numbers, of sixth form. But this is even worse; not only is it a talent-free tour-de-force, a superb example of how to get away with the ten-year reputation, but it also represents the slaughter of a superb piece. The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind. Yes, it was a theatrical package, and it is easy to see how the central weft device would work better on stage than the screen, but it still worked excellently. This is a piece of Michael Caine's vanity, but let's face it, Caine is not Olivier. Not only can't he fill Larry's shoes, he can't even fill the bathroom slippers. After all, Caine is a decidedly average actor, whose only real recommendation, like so many British actors, is their longevity in business. He was a good Harry Palmer, excellent in Get Carter, but that's a lot, man! Give this a very wide anchor and stick to the superb original. This is more than a half-pinter.
