I love the munburg bhai MBBS but "Lagge raho ..." SUX really SUX. I've never seen a film so boring in my whole life. And have these high grades really surprised me that wat happened to the taste of the viewers of Indian cinema ?? <br /> <br /> ** BE BE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> An educated girl needs advice from a Bhai, the people who discuss their personal problem. on phones comes the man from which part of the world are you ??? I agree that movies should be fictitious, but these things are really indigestible. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10. (2 stars are valid for 15 minutes)
