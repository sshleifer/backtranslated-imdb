Recently he took part in GEORGE 2 on TV, but I couldn't watch him until the end. Just awful! I can't even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula weren't George and Ursula from the first movie, which was pretty bad. There is a lot of disruption, but the direction and editing were so poor and wavy, it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes. Having back the original voice of Ape the Ape was not enough to make me warm up to this. GEORGE 2 is probably the only worst sequel I've ever seen, and that's saying something. Geek, due to IMDb's 10-line rule, I have to keep writing when I have nothing more to say about this TV tailored sequel. Disney, hang your head in shame.
