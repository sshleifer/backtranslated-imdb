It is hard to imagine that anyone can find this short their favorite if they have seen most of their short films, but I know that humor is VERY subjective. I saw all their short films (by far the best of their IMO stuff) and I found this one of their weakest efforts. <br /> <br /> In the year it was built (1930) Stan and Babe made 15 shorts and a function. They were extremely popular and their boss Hal Roach took full advantage of the advantage by continuing to work constantly. Furthermore, this was a period of experimentation for writers and Stan. I would say that this was an experiment that actually didn't work. As someone else said, it doesn't play to their strengths. Too much dialogue and plot. <br /> <br /> The best part of this for me is the largely improvised sequence with Stan as Agnes the maid and the great Thelma Todd who talks about "girl" things. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see kids in their most creative and fun looks, look at Blotto, or Brats in the same year. <br /> <br /> They made so many short films in so little time that I think they can be forgiven for making some less money than usual. They made something like 108 films in total. Very few (except those made at FOX) have been real failures, but there are some. The county hospital, Me And My Pal, The Live Ghost, The Fixer Uppers come to mind as essentially weak. But others then those that I find something wonderful in almost all their short films. A nice record in my book. <br /> <br /> If you have seen and enjoyed all their other short films, then take a look at this, but I would bet that this was less memorable for Stan and small.
