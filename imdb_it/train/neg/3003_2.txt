We all know that countless smears have graced the slasher genre of the 1980s and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust. Maybe it's a bit annoying, but damn if "Slaughter High" wasn't terribly unoriginal, even for a slasher movie. Practically, the plot involves a child who has suffered a humiliation similar to a Carrie in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek revenge on a group of ex-bullies who all show up to remember. As one would expect, they are constantly killed by a mad masked April 1 by electrocution, burning, hanging and chemically altered beer. I have a series of problems with the details of the plot and the settings of this film, but considering the ending, I feel the need to discard my complaints and I just say it's a complete waste of time. Ignore any thought of seeing this movie ...
