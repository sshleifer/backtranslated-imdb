"How She Moves" comes to life only when high-energy and talented cast members are getting their heels up and trying to put things in the camera. Otherwise, this story of suffering, success and success has little energy, scarce originality and low in everything that could make the film stand out compared to the dozens of other films that got the better. <br /> Rutina Wesley has a modest charm like the boy from a university town with academic talent who finds that the best way to increase his private lessons money is to enter dance competitions, but both she and her colleagues they are little served by uninspired screen writing and indistinct direction. As noted above, the film gets a spark when the artists are on stage, but such moments are too few and unfortunately elusive.
