Today, Bea Arthur died, so I was walking around the IMDb website and somehow I found myself in a show called "Gloria". "All In The Family" was a brilliant show for his first four or five years and I bet I watched every episode more than once. However, I swear I did NOT know there was a show called "Gloria". Perhaps, this is a good thing. Perhaps, it means that I had a life as a young adult rather than watching television. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is pathetic that the "All In The Family" franchise has deteriorated so much that it has generated a show I have never heard of - and which is rated very badly by the previous reviewers. <br /> <br /> I evaluated show 1 for two reasons: the system didn't allow me to record a no and writers and TV executives should be sentenced for starting a show that had no business on the air and it ignites the memory of one of the greatest shows in the history of TV. <br /> <br /> Shalom, ZWrite
