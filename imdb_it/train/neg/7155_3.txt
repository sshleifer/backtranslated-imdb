I'm sorry but I didn't like this document very much. I can think of a million ways it could have been better. The people who did it obviously don't have much imagination. The interviews are not very interesting and no real intuition is offered. Even the movie is not assembled in a very informative way. Too bad because this is a film that really deserves special features. One thing I will say is that Isabella Rosselini becomes more beautiful as she gets older. All things considered, this only gets a '4.'
