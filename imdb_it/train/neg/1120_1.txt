I saw this film in my international cinema class and I was disgusted. This film is nothing but a scene of obvious shock value after the next. <br /> <br /> The 4th Man is about an alcoholic writer named Reve, who has visions of his outstanding danger. Meet a woman named Christine while giving a lecture at a local book club, and just decide to stay with her when she finds out how attractive her boyfriend is. Simply put, Reve likes Dutch sausage. So Reve creates a plan to seduce Christine's boyfriend so he can finally have sex with him. But later he found out that Christine had 3 previous husbands, that she killed everyone. Now Reve and Christine's boyfriend could be "THE 4th MAN". The plot makes sense without holes in the plot. The assembly and all that is technical on this film is perfect. The film is lousy and I felt the need to vomit in some parts. Basically, this is not my cup of tea. <br /> <br /> The film opens with Reve lifting a T-shirt from the bed in JUST. So, right at the beginning, you can see Reve's adorable bird floating as he walks into his cramped hangover apartment. Later he has a dream in which his bird is cut by a pair of scissors, and they show it together with the resulting fountain of blood. Reve caresses a statue of Jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum. Furthermore there is a lot of blood. More blood than all of Freddy Krueger's films put together. <br /> <br /> Not that I have anything against "shocking" scenes, but this film is so brazen when it comes to shocking. The entire film focuses on the shock value. <br /> <br /> So, if this is your cup of tea, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay far away from this. My mind is still marked.
