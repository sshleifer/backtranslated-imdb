Guy de Maupassant was a novelist who wrote a novel about a man, a poor man with no moral qualities. He just wanted success in a society where all the people, politicians, businessmen, journalists, women are corrupt. The only king is MONEY. The hero of the Maupassants, Charles Forestier is going higher and higher on the social scale thanks to his seduction. He is in love with all the women who could help him in his action to climb the bracket of the company. At the end of the novel, he married the daughter of the largest daily paper owner, in the largest church in Paris: "La Madeleine". "Le Tout Paris" is there. He has a fortune and more, he will become a member of Parliament and later a minister. Women "useless" are out of his point of view, but he is always in touch with beautiful and useful women. The image "THE PRIVATE AFFAIRS OF BEL AMI" is a story of MORALITY. That's all, but not a story in the Maupassant idea. Why had they put "BEL AMI" in the title?
