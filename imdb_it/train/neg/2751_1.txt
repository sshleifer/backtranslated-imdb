I hate even wasting the time it takes to write 10 lines about this atrocity. Hyung-Rae Shim is fortunate that the bad film production is not a capital crime or would be sentenced to death twice for writing and directing this disaster. I am amazed that this film has a budget of 75 million dollars, but in reality he is happy in the sense that it was a tremendous flop, which Shim hopes, he will never be able to make another film for the rest of his life and, therefore, not will waste any more time than cinema. I thought the actors would come together and lynch him now. <br /> <br /> With the resources at their disposal, it would have been possible to make a great film with this budget. As usual, the failure should have been identified right at the beginning with the terrible script and story. "Transformers" was another visual feast with a weak script, but this makes it seem "Citizen Kane".
