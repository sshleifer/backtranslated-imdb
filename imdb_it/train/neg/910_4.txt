The plot was very simple and easy to follow and contained a lot of unbridled comedy to the point where it became boring. Some of the audience seemed to find it fun, but I like smarter humor. <br /> <br /> There were many well-known Swedish actors in the film and their performance was decent considering the script. Lena Endre was as good-looking as ever. <br /> <br /> I don't remember the original film so I can't say if it's better or worse. <br /> <br /> If you like movies like SÃ¤llskapsresan this movie might be worth a look.
