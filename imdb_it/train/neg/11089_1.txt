Pretty good movie, but not a true story. <br /> <br /> Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a notorious liar, a murder and was never found not guilty. The State of New Jersey did not leave for the third time at 20 years. Carter received an offer in 1976: "Pass a lie test and go for free". He didn't take it. This film should never have been made, but monetary talks. A lot of people have unjustly spent their lives in prison and undoubtedly more blacks than whites. Why choose a false story? <br /> <br /> Jens
