Interesting the story of a soldier in a war who loses the opportunity to save the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event, even if he has saved many other captive children. The film flashes at the head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is run mainly by policemen who patrol the corridors, bathrooms and even classrooms. In other words, high school is a prison and most children pay little attention to their teachers or principal. Dolph Lundgren, (Sam Decker) plays the school soldier / teacher and decides he is about to leave teaching and go to another camp. However, the principal asks him to have a detention class as his last duty as a teacher. It is at this point in the film when all Hell is unleashed and the story becomes a complete BOMB. Try to have fun if you've decided to see IT!
