This is a hybrid creature born in the mind of Carl Macek. With Robotech the second generation (Robotech Masters) and Megazone 23 in a miserable film, which have no logic! The plot is very, very bad, and you can't forgive the action of Megazone when they have nothing to do with Robotech. If this film has such a high score it is for the TV series and not for itself !! I said it, the name can't save this!
