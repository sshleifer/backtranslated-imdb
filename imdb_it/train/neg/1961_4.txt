... child actors were annoying. It also seems that the producers of this film were struggling to fill 90 minutes. Decent death scenes, though. If it weren't for the scenes of death, this movie would look very Disney. <br /> <br /> The main child's main character didn't seem as scared as he should have been. If you were in the middle of the woods with a ghost-like ghost-like individual, you can bet your ass that I wouldn't be out wandering and riding a bike. <br /> <br /> In general, I've seen worse (ie wait) but it's nothing that I would like to watch again, or recommend to someone to disturb it, unless you are an avid collector of horror.
