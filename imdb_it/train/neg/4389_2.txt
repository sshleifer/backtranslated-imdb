If you like occasional nudity with the slap comedy of middle school, then look no further. <br /> <br /> Starting from about half way, Arielle Dombasle, beautiful and erotic, begins to undress in every occasion. This is the only thing that has made this film worthy of attention. <br /> <br /> History is both boring and absurd, humor is trivial and character development is fundamentally non-existent.
