Prequel rather disappointing for the first two films, does not have the suspense of the first nor the interest of the second. Focusing on the guys who "manage" the cube, in practice it eliminates the sense of tension inside the cube, since we simply don't care about the characters inside. Much of the film is simply boring, and it becomes really terrible only with the introduction of the glass-eyed superior and the green-eyed sea crazy. After that, however, it simply descends into an exaggerated, involuntary hilarity. The finish is suitable, indirectly tying it back to the first one. The script is terrible, mediocre acting at best, and the direction is insignificant. A much lesser following.
