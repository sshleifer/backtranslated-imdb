I will give a 3 only because it showed the story we need to know, to prevent it from happening again. I agree with the comments of the gentleman from the United Kingdom. The film was pretty awful. All clich√©s, no real plot. The historical and technical inaccuracies abound. Search for technical specifications on DE 529, or any Everts class Destroyer Escort, and you'll see what I mean. Now I am the month of black history in the United States, and I will be called a racist only for saying so, but the history of this ship is not exceptional. They did a spare job, chased a "submarine" which turned out to be a prison they rammed. Sorry, but blacks did much more in World War II, so this stupid movie gives them credit. This film makes them look like whiners. Let the name begin, I can handle it.
