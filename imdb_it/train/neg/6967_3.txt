Oh God, what a fool! Incredibly cheap with fake special effects (the creature is played by a lame in a lame costume) and a stupid plot. All the dialogues are incredibly bad and these actors (HA! HA! HA!) ... they are simply ridiculous. For example, I've never seen characters as annoying as this garbage (these stupid children or a pregnant woman with her husband and many others). All in all, this is great fun if you're drunk. like the plague. I'm drunk? I don't think so ...
