There are really two sections to this film. First there is the laughable prologue of the film that is so hysterical and police-like that it would be almost appropriate for the movie "The Simpsons" Troy McClure to do the narration. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the film begins (starting with a song that does not match the rest of the film) which, while technically OK, is killed by a vague, incoherent and unconvincing storyline and not just by characters uninteresting, but from characters that make no sense. This is especially true with Spiventa by Mickey Rooney, who was presumably on the plot and part of the organization for all that time and what would have happened if Hackman had made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take it with him when to burst? In that case he would have been a superfluous and superfluous character, which in the end is still. <br /> <br /> The general problem with the film is that it is totally reluctant to provide details about who or what is behind this conspiracy. It is as if the directors did not have the courage to suggest that a particular part of society would have been able to create such an organization and instead it was based on the hope that a lack of explanation would be sufficient and the public would form its own conclusions. br /> <br /> Simply put, the film fails at all levels.
