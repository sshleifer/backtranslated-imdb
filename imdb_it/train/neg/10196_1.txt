As a poker enthusiast I couldn't wait to see this movie - especially because it contained Scotty Nyugen. <br /> <br /> Basically, Scotty Nyugens' shots in this film are all you need. <Br /> <br /> The characters are unlikely and annoying, the soundtrack is horrible and the plot, well, there isn't one. <br /> <br /> I honestly had a headache and found myself reading the barcode number on the DVD box after twenty minutes I was so bored. His reality is that Nyugen was in this movie otherwise I wouldn't have wasted $ 16 buying it on Ebay. <br /> <br /> Take it away from me - AVOID like 7 2 suit !!! To say. :(
