I have to agree with the first comment: this film sucks very, very hard. Despite having a very large B-list cast, the cover of this film (for those who don't watch it on Comedy Central on a weekday that is probably the only exposure this film will ever have) tries to blame Dangerfield but in reality it is only a pay slip for every comedian of the 80s. Randy Quaid? Check. Ed Begley, Jr? Check. Lisa Simpson's voice? Now he can say that the Maximum Overdrive was not his only horrible film: double check. And so many, many others. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this film is that it was written so lazily with already told jokes. Nothing about this film outside of its existence is fun. You're better off looking at the dried paint. This is definitely the video-scrap-to-video stuff that still believes in the old video adage: throw an old-time star on the cover and get some money back from the rental. Considering that the days of video rental are changing, consider this one of the last examples of waste disposal. <br /> <br /> The only use of this film is if you have trouble falling asleep. It will take you there.
