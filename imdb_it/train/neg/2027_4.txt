Unlike the other two games being played by Endemol USA (Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100), the pace of this show is too slow for what happens on the screen. <br /> <br /> DOND and 1 vs. 100 can go off with slow stimulation because the games can change pace - or finish - at any time. There is risk in every action the player takes, the rewards are very variable, and it is difficult for players to start with a significant amount of money. The suspense is usually put to good use. <br /> <br /> Show Me The Money, on the other hand, is simply too slow. When a question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer, you can be sure that absolutely nothing exciting will happen in the next few minutes. The rhythm of this show would be a great help to reveal the correct answer BEFORE, and then let the player select a dancer instead of wasting time talking about what will happen if the player gets a wrong answer when we all know they are right . Random dance is a filler that actually looks like filler. Too much time is wasted while not enough ... and the fact that players can't choose to leave the game early guarantees that there will be a lot of time wasted. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I have NO interest in watching Shat shake his groove thang, especially right after eating dinner. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of games from all my life, but I also had a lot of trouble spending an hour of this. Or he needs big changes or early retirement.
