By far the worst movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey. I heard that the film originally had to be titled "The Treasure", but was changed to "Sharks' Treasure" in order to take advantage of the excitement created by "Jaws". I think sharks were in a scene from this movie; the fact that they were included in this "thriller" should have sold tickets. It didn't work. Every time something "good" happens in the film, the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been presented at the time of making the film. Damn, do you think beer could have been a sponsor? Could they have made it more obvious? The only time someone should break the beer is if they can get over this. This is reason enough for the celebration.
