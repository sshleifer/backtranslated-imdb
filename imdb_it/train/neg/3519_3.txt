There are some Stallone films that I like, but this film did not meet my expectations. I found this film hard to believe. For example, a group of terrorists who crash into the wild are ready to survive for at least two days. Furthermore, in all this wilderness, Stallone and the company continue to run across bridges and staircases that provide convenient plot devices or shortcuts. Furthermore, the Treasury officers do not seem to coordinate anything with local rescuers. Furthermore, the villains who could not hit the side of a barn with very technological looking automatic weapons. <br /> <br /> I initially liked John Lithgow's villain, but the character is such a complete psychopath that he does not care. None of his villains, or all of them are killed. In the end I could no longer believe the character. <br /> <br /> Not worth the price of a rental, not even worth taking the time to look.
