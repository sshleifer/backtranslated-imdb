My God is a bad movie. I was totally misled by my review of the local movie because it is certifiable garbage. Yes, yes, the good guys wear white, the bad guys wear black ... and the good guys always win. Now go home and embrace your children, and feel how good Hollywood made you feel. Blech! I can't believe this brain death movie was made by Wes Craven. I imagine he needed some money to pay off the mortgage, so did this piece of dung. It's the kind of production that makes anyone watch the movie regularly believing they can do the best or the best of such an experienced director. <br /> <br /> Ya see, a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves her dad do a little bad thing or hurt her dad. But being the All-American girl next door, we know that she will save the day and beat the bad guys ... in the end. Power girls ROCKS. <br /> <br /> Let's go now, only an idiot would find it funny ... "a roller coaster ride", not to mention something fresh or new. All those "super-duper" reviews you see on this site are from industry hackers who are making money with this movie, returning a favor or selling their souls to the devil. <br /> <br /> Rachael McAdams is beautiful ... yes, that's right. It's not a good performance, it's not horrible ... it's simply pretty. He should have shown a lot of skin to save this movie. It is not strong enough to be a good female guide. <br /> <br /> Cillian Murphy was at least passable in 28 days. But here he plays a bad fool who pretends to be smart. She gets her ass kicked by McAdams 5'5 ", because after all she was a cheerleader ... and a field hockey player ... and I'm sure she owns all of Tae Bo's tapes ... so she should being able to kick the crap of a hired international terrorist. I wouldn't trust him to steal a pack of gum from 7-11. <br /> <br /> See, this movie was made before, except before they did it well. Go and rent one of the Die Hard movies. You have loved ones in danger, international terrorists, except that the characters are nicer and more credible and the villains are MORE competent and interesting. I just don't understand how Hollywood can continue to do that bullshit as if you were unaware of the suitable models that they can easily copy in. No wonder the movie entries have gone down. <br /> <br /> Throw your $ 6 in the toilet and save yourself 2 hours of your life that you will never return . <br /> <br /> hello, FreddyShoop
