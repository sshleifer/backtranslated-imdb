This first vehicle Pia Zadora followed a familiar formula of Harold Robbins: the ambitious main character wallows in decadence while chasing the path to the top of a randomly chosen but fascinating world, in this case the film industry. But despite being so formidable as to be completely predictable, this film manages to be completely unbelievable at the same time. Zadora (to call her inexperienced as an actress is to be charitable) never convinces as a screenwriter. You would expect a film about creating films to have some insights into your industry and creative process. But the script does not give her any of the qualities that make writers interesting characters in the film: observance, the ability with words, a love-hate relationship with one's creative abilities. His character is as empty as a donut hole. And this is just a taste of the incompetence exposed here. Cinematography is so murky that sometimes it's hard to see what's going on. And the scenes are never hung, so everything seems like a series of random moments in bad Hollywood parties. To avoid.
