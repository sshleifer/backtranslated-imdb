Years ago I saw The Godfather and made me a lasting impression, the atmosphere of the film was first class, the acting memorable and the plot a classic. Recently I bought the trilogy and after looking again at part 1 I looked with interest to see the second part ...... I was very pleased to soon realize in Part 2 that this was a proper continuation of the great film of Godfather, still everything was almost perfect and I could not wait to see the Godfather III ........ WRONG !, I wish I had stopped at II. The plot was not good, it seemed to me a story invented only to have a story, the characters were weak especially the daughter. Pacino's protégé was a weak character who would have been eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2. Then scenes like, Corleone invested with all the traps of the Catholic Church with a full chorus, the horse murderer riding in the sunset, the invisible machine gun helicopter of the encounter (where the 'goodies' run away and all the others are killed), daughter and 1st cousin who roll pieces of dough on a table, the pathetic shot on the steps ..... Corleone filling his sweet with orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and cunning is not ready for an emergency?) ... NO no good and with the best will in the world I would not be able to look at him again. But I will watch 1 & 2 many times over the years.
