All the fun things that happen on this sitcom are based on the main character that Jim is either a bad father, a bad husband or generally just hugely selfish. How can it be fun? Obviously a sitcom character must be imperfect, but Jim's character is imperfect in an extremely nasty way. <br /> <br /> And why? My hypothesis is that it is because "it should be better now". Jim is not a stupid guy, he can take care of things and have the opportunity to do it. But he chooses not to do it. It is a conscious choice that makes, when he chooses not to play with his children, he does not go shopping because he does not want to buy "products for women" and it is a choice he makes when he lowers his relatives. <br /> <br /> The other characters seem to be only in the series, so Jim can have someone to be an idiot. If Cheryl's character was a real person, she would have left him years ago, and not be with the deadbeat for 8 years. But alas, it's just a catalyst for Jim's eccentric middle-class selfishness.
