I would not like to bring a child under 8 to see this. With the puppies dangling from the buildings that twist through dangerous machines and listening to the appalling laugh of Cruella to mention some of the events, there is too much suspense for a small child. <br /> <br /> The live action gives a more disturbing feeling than the cartoon version and there are some disturbing moments including a guy who appears to be a transvestite, a lot of tense moments that will worry and could scare the small children. <br /> <br /> I don't know what the people at Disney thought, but neither the plot nor the acting were at their usual level. Puppies are cute But this film is questionable at best.
