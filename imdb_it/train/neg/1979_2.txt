Hmm, Hip Hop music in a western period. Modern phrases like "cool" and too many others to keep an eye on. "I am at home"! French manicured nails on firm girls. Perfectly visible microphones on the back of Li'l Kim. I can't get on with the litany of errors made by the director and the editors. <br /> <br /> Acting is not as bad as I've never seen it before. Women did quite well with a poor script. <br /> <br /> It was strange to hear Louis Mandylor speaking with his native accent. <br /> <br /> The girls are beautiful. The costumes are fabulous even if completely incorrect. I can't believe they would have surprised what could have been a great story. I would feel offended at believing that this film was loaded with such trappings that it would play well in the city center. <br /> <br />
