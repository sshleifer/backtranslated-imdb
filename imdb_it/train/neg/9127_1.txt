Ok, here's the basic plot. It's 1933, Peter Sellers is Dr. Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese man who lived for a long time. The film opens with his birthday celebrating by drinking a special elixir that (the film never mentions) prolongs his life. Well on this occasion the elixir is clumsily thrown by an assistant (Kato if you remember the Pink Panther movies) and orders his followers to go and look for 6 rare objects to create the elixir. This creates a global manhunt in which his henchmen end up stealing diamond museums and venturing into London to meet the nemisi of Dr Fu, a retired Scotland Yard Nayland Smith investigator, also played by Sellers trying to stop him in what is supposed to be a lovely comic adventure. <br /> <br /> It was apparently the sellers of the last feature film he made before he died. The terrible tragedy is that he was in it. The sellers who are so talented comedians and have had memorable "funny" roles in the Panther films and in particular in the movie "The Party", are all BUT in this movie. This film was an absolute torture to sit on and I couldn't even finish it. He completely dies and I kept looking at myself as I watched the sales performance. After doing the great work of 'Being There' a year earlier as, I mean HOW can he do this and HOW did he even do this thing ??? As a person mentioned, the first 10.15 minutes are ok but then ALL DOWNHILLS ... <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> Evaluation 1 out of 10.
