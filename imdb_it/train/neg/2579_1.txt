I must say that I was a big fan of the series. The first 3 were fantastic and the others had their moments, but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a shame because this was a great series and it continues to get worse. I know they are made for DVD movies, but some effort would be nice. <br /> <br /> There are no laughs, just a couple of good single jokes that will bring a smile if that. There is enough nudity and very hot chicks. But neither sexy things nor jokes really work. <br /> <br /> Add to all that this is a RACIST movie or a racist in a movie that can be done without asking to be called racist. I am NOT one of those people who think that everything should be politically correct. But the portrait of minorities is very offensive. <br /> <br /> I will not waste time in this garbage. Look at previous versions, they will make you laugh not bad.
