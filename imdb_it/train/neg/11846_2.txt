After watching this film I complained to my local cinema about the quality of the soundtrack or if the cinema sound system could be faulty. For at least the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what someone is saying because of the '20s background music and the roughness of the soundtrack. I was ready to blame the cinema equipment but not so - it was the director. <br /> <br /> I was told that the subject of my complaint was an essential part of making the film. The music and the sound had to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film. These days, the directors will do everything to make their film unique. Unfortunately, no matter where or how you see that movie, the sound score will be the same. <br /> <br /> So, apart from the historical inaccuracies of this film (which you can find out for yourself elsewhere) the soundtrack distortions are in themselves a good reason to miss this movie. You will only hear the distorted scratch of the soundtrack and certainly not a cat's meow.
