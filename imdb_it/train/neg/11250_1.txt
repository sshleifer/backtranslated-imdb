I like the time, I like the attempt, but watching a movie that seems to look at it through a bottle of coke gives me a headache. If I played such blurry and blurred computer games, I'd update my computer. It could be that this was what the director was looking for, but it doesn't hurt the eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes. If I hadn't brought someone with me in this movie, I was out of there. Even though it was a series and not a movie to say, Band of Brothers realized this. They made the footage of the Second World War look a little gritty, but it was still a pleasure to watch it. Films need real people, with real sets and real places; Use CGI when appropriate, not for an entire movie.
