AKA: Monday in the sun <br /> <br /> I have no idea what I just saw. Three men wander aimlessly and drink, grumbling about everything and everyone on their way. This should be a drama, but what it is, is a total waste of films, without a single quality of redemption. <br /> <br /> I read reviews advertising the performances here as "wonderful", "beautiful," and "heroic". I'm afraid I can't agree, unless these men come out like the most stupid ignorant proto-humans that ever walked. <br /> <br /> All in all? This was not a movie. He wanders everywhere and loses everyone except the public. I've looked at it three times and can't see for the life of me what anyone sees in this garbage. There is nothing profound here, under any circumstances. It's crap. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a ZERO / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
