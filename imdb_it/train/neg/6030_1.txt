Ok, now I know that there are millions of Americans who believe in The Rapture: that moment when all people reborn in Christ will be kidnapped to meet God and all the rest of humanity will be left on earth to perish in pestilence and fire and the heartbreak of psoriasis while the Antichrist is fighting with Jesus (in an unusually warrior style). And I know that books were the best sellers. . .also believers, however. And I don't mean to disrespect all this. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that they filled this film in a bag and beat it with the Suck Stick. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the books are much better. Really. <br /> <br /> The plot does not need to be resumed. If you watched this movie, you probably read the book. I could be one of the few people in the world who really looked at this just because of the pure experience of moving, and I wasn't disappointed. Especially not from Kirk Cameron, the creepy little gremlin "Growing Pains", who has come of age on that show, found Christ and decided that the SHOW should reflect his Christian values. Well, Kirk, your career has gone to dogs, but now you can be happy that you're spreading the word of God in such bad films, that they can't even get out in the hall. Well, this is absolutely not true: I imagine this was the only film ever made that went on DVD FIRST, with a voucher for a free viewing of the film when it was released briefly in theaters! I still have the good! How many people do you think came up? I don't know about you, but it never arrived in my city. Of course, I live in New York, where Godless liberals sit around tearing pages from the Bible and using them to roll up joints. So here you are. In fact, I'll bet on three million people in Manhattan, one would not be kidnapped. <br /> <br /> Check out the additional materials on the DVD, where you will learn the gruesome details behind the scenes of these films. . . THE CAST and the CREW must all be of the same religious mentality. They don't come out and say this, but listen carefully to what the directors say. It's like a bunch of Pods. People gathered to make a movie on Pod. How is creepazoid? Honestly, this stuff just preaches to the convert, doesn't it? Can you imagine someone who does NOT enroll in the whole apocalypse business looking at him, giving him a slap on the forehead and saying: "HOLY HOOVER DAM! It is better to be saved READY!" Anyway, I'm passionate. I have to see the rest of these Christian fiasco films, especially the one with Gary Busey, which I think is TRIBULATION. At least Busey has an excuse to take the part ... he cracked his head on a sidewalk when he crashed into his bike. <br /> <br /> Oy. <br /> <br /> Oh, and another thing. What has it got to do with all the blows of poor and innocent dogs that whine, their leashes dragging uselessly along the ground, because their owners have been called to heaven? What happens with that? We should feel bad for dogs, and if we do, what should we do with God? Don't you think about IRK that there is no space in paradise for man's best friend? Foo. <br /> <br /> This is another reason I am agnostic. Good night and good luck.
