A novel by Remarque. A cast that looks great on paper. A leftist refugee struggling to remain in Paris between the two wars. An undercover Gestapo officer. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that there is no synergy here. The pieces never merge. <br /> <br /> Stories about left-wing refugees in France need not be so boring. Read Arthur Koestler's memoir "The scum of the earth" (if you can find it). Or his chilling "Dialogue With Death" (idem). For me, the only interest in this film lies in some incidental details. <br /> <br /> Leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados, the Norman apple brandy. I welcome any suggestions to have a pinch of calvados myself. Of course this movie seems to go faster. But, according to the film, it is sold only in low-cost, low-salons. Vive le tabac parisien! This is what I say. References to intoxicating liquors abound here; it would seem to be a concern of the writers. <br /> <br /> I like films set in France, because it can be fun to wait for the inevitable full-scale alcohol ad to appear on a wall in the background. I was not disappointed. This time it was for Byrrh, a very unusual choice. This film will evaluate a 10 if only we will judge it on the refinement of its murals. <br /> <br /> The indifferent soundtrack of the film is by Louis Gruenberg. Gruenberg is best known - if one can call it that - for his work "The Emperor Jones", based on the comedy O'Neill. He made his debut around the same time as the film version starring Paul Robeson. The work survives today in a recording or two by Lawrence Tibbett. It should return to surface soon though; potentially salable works are being exhausted to revive. <br /> <br /> Opera seems like an appropriate topic to mention here since the character of Charles Boyer operates under his "Czech" aliases. Two of them are "Wozzeck" and "Gunther", both important roles in German opera. Is it just a coincidence? <br /> <br /> Name-drop seems to be part of this movie. Note that they call "Himmelstoss" on the phone. Himmelstoss appears to be one of the main characters of Remarque's previous "All Quiet on the Western Front". <br /> <br /> Well, the jokes are all right; I imagine there is no time to develop any drama.
