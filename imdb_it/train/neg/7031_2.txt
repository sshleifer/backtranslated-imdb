What made me trace this film was the vision of Vampyres, I thought of having to get the other films that this guy (Larroz) made, I was sorry I tracked it down, it's a weak attempt at a occult / satanic film load with sex and sex only (with ugly actors and actresses, this is an excuse for the scam. The only saving factor was the setting and the atmosphere, avoid this, too much publicity surrounds it, it's not worth it to find it, this refers to the welcome to the grind house edition, I hope you have some other films that are up to Vampyres, Oh and the goat scene was very boring, I understand that this is what brings the hype .
