This documentary film is based on incomplete evidence considerations, in which Brian Flemming, perhaps on purpose, does not mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the oldest: his statements concerning the invalidity of Paul's testimony about Jesus Christ ignore the key facts, such as: ** The existence of some creeds formulated in Paul's letters. These beliefs suggest that most of the central claims about Jesus were already formulated in declarations of faith possibly within a few years of the death and resurrection of Christ. ** The testimonies of the early Christians cannot simply be busted as pure fantasy. There were indeed many people who claimed to be the Messiah during that time, but only ONE of them remained: Jesus. Why? Because it would have been absurd for anyone to have actually believed that Christ was the Messiah, and continue to die for those beliefs, if they knew he had not risen. ** Although the Gospels are more liberal dated, we are still talking about Jesus' accounts written during the life of other eyewitnesses who would have pointed out inaccuracies in these Gospels. And there is evidence that the Gospels were written much earlier. <br /> <br /> What I'm saying is that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and selfish piece of work that avoids the various arguments and evidence to serve his anti-Christian vision. Don't be fooled by a poor investigation.
