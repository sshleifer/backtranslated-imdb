At first glance, this film has everything a psycho wants: a vampire story with a "no less than 18" restriction, full of hyper-violence, drugs, blood, sex (including lesbian sex), some zealots fanatics and even a gay necrofilo policeman! But then, this film is a succession of bad stories (so subtle), bad acting - with a ridiculous English accent that makes you believe you're watching a bad Monty Python -, bad music (80s hard rock), video recording is horrible, the ending is a real shame ... Besides the sex scenes are ridiculous, the blood is not very impressive. And those vampires reflect in a mirror and don't even fear the light of day! You will be very disappointed, unless you see it as "Space Mutiny" or "Troll 2". I hope that Bloodlust one day reach the bottom 100, because it's his real place. <br /> <br /> I would say that it can still be fun to watch, if you have friends and enough beer. <br /> 3/10
