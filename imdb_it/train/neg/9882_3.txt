There are exactly 2 positive things to say about "Fantasies" (both mentioned by a previous reviewer): <br /> <br /> a) The extraordinary beauty of Bo Derek, inspirer of poetry. He has footage in this film where he also gives Catherine Zeta-Jones a run for her money, and that's a great compliment. His nakedness is short and discreet, but just look at her face. <br /> <br /> b) The setting of the Greek island, with its sun and crystal blue waters. <br /> <br /> Other than this, there is no story, the dialogue is abysmal and sometimes unintentionally funny ("It touched you where you are a woman!"), and the character of Peter Hooten is a slimy idiot . Bo upset the naivety of his character, but then again when you have to work with dialogue so badly it's unfair to blame the actors (the fact that he kept repeating the name "Damir" in almost every sentence is a great irritation ). Oh, and although the film is set on a Greek island, there is hardly a Greek word to listen to - apparently everyone there, from children to the elderly, speak English all the time. (*)
