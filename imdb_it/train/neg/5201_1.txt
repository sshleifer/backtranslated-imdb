The story has already been seen, but it doesn't matter if you can figure out how to make an appropriate storyboard. It is clear that the director did not spend his work on the storyboard. Alongside this, the cameraman spent too much time bending the corners that did not match the message of the film. The funniest is, however, if you take a look at the film's website, you can read that the director has chosen to make the film with bad camera angles. Because it reminds us of hunting. But I've never heard of hunting with few camera angles ;-) It will have 1 star because the story is OK. Too bad that Ti West has not spent more time reviewing his story. It is as if the film were more important than planning. Because you have a camera doesn't mean you should make a movie right away ... come on. Everyone can make a movie, but not everything will be as good. So a word of advice to Ti West is: stop labeling what you want. Use your time to start planning and not filming until everything is down on a storyboard. You certainly have the ability and the desire - so don't abuse your talent.
