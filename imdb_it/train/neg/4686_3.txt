There have been good performances by Robin Williams and others, but the film was boring on the whole and very disappointing compared to the positive reviews. I thought Sy could become a serial killer who bores people to death: a boy abandoned in ugly clothes drags his victims around the food fields, quoting Oprah and reciting his medical history until they beg him to shoot him. <br /> <br /> I think the film appeals mainly to self-centered people who think strangers are interested in their photos. I expect most retail workers to want a break from customers.
