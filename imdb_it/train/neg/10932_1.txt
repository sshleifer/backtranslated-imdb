The really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget with which "Halestorm Entertainment" had to work. All those involved should be fined for littering because all the celluloid they have wasted is good for nothing more than filling the garbage. Not only the writing is atrocious and the jokes are horrible, but the work of the camera and the quality of the film are at best amateur. The soundtrack sounds like it was created on a laptop of some guys. The worst part of all is that I actually sat through the whole thing. I just think because I couldn't believe that I actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater where I was looking at it had actually agreed to show the "movie".
