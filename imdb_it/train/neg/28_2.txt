This movie is terrible. You don't really need to read this review again. If you're going to watch it, suffice it to say - don't do it (unless you're studying how not to make a good movie). <br /> <br /> Acting is horrendous ... a serious amateur hour. During the film, I thought it was interesting that they found someone who talks and looks like Michael Madsen, only to find out that he really is! A new minimum for him too !! <br /> <br /> The plot is terrible. People who claim it to be original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before. Even for the standard of Hollywood action movies, this is a terrible film. <br /> <br /> Don't watch it !!! Go jogging instead - at least you won't feel like killing yourself anymore.
