It is incredible to see how Nikhil Advani manages to attract people to the theater until the very day of the release. I mean ..... watch the cast here, the promotion is superb, pretty good songs and trailers are okay. This makes it a full house on the first day, but it is only when people go to see the film that they realize that there is no way to repay their money. Full house the first day, the film came out the following week. <br /> <br /> This movie, inspired by "Love Actually" is what they say, failed to handle the entire cast well. They tried to put in big stars, but in the end they couldn't even get an average performance from anyone. The stories are empty and cheap, so the public can't connect with any of them. It is a great disappointment for all those who love big stars or, for this, Nikhil Advani after his great success of "Kal Ho Na Ho".
