This is a really miserable little movie. The original (non) holy trinity was governed by the law of diminishing returns with the third, "The Definitive Conflict" degenerating into a ridiculous half-plot of the film apparently only to provide the necessary unnecessarily twisted deaths that had now become the entire raison d'etre of the "Omen" series. But then to stack this TV movie jumped up (beware of the buyers of the Omen boxed set on DVD - don't be fooled by the widescreen transfer ratio, this was and is strictly small screen material) on the back of a series of generally fine demonic chillers was inexcusable, in particular, approved by the executive producer of the first three films Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard. I would give away the plot if there were any, in addition to the usual scenes of death (irremediably attenuated for the television sensibility) and some of the worst recitations I've seen. All those involved in this project up to the catering people should be ashamed that this disguise has never arrived on screen, let alone disguise themselves under the name of Omen. If a person is convinced by my review to avoid this mess, I will feel better.
