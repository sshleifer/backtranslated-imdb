Susan Swift is an attractive young woman, a flower child transplanted in the 1980s (as a young Susan Dey), but she does not have the vocal range for a dramatic dramatic drive and tends to whine; however, it is rather sweet and has bright eyes and a beautiful smile. In "The Coming" (as he was called when he was briefly released to the theaters), Swift could be the reincarnation of a Salem witch. The film is very low budget and borrows from so many other images that I gave up this with about 15 minutes to go. Start strong and have a field charm. Obviously, there are more serious films that deal with the Salem witch trials that deserve to be seen on this; however, while junk movies go, it's not too terrible. The Boston clubs are a decisive plus, and the supporting cast is as fun as the hammam. * 1/2 from ****
