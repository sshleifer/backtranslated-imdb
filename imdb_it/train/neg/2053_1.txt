Why do they insist on re-creating great films like "High Noon" "From Here to Eternity" and this? <br /> <br /> Why do they think that color is more compelling for an observer than for intense black and white? <br /> <br /> Why did Robert insist on wearing that very generous baseball cap ?, made him look like Jim Varney. <br /> <br /> Why would anyone spend? four hours of suffering through this? <br /> <br /> Look at the original. Then you won't have to ask yourself why.
