The first (and only) time I saw "Shades" was during a Sneakpreview. He hadn't even been previewed. I remember that there was someone from the staff of the directors there, I don't even remember who. It was a Belgian film, we had never heard of it, so we were quite neutral, not knowing what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and always stands at the top of the others. He plays an actor whose star has long since stopped getting up. He is helping to make a film in Belgium called "Shades". <br /> <br /> As soon as the film started, we noticed how bad it is. Nothing against the occasional bad words. However this was way beyond the annoying. Whenever Rourke uses the word F *** to express something, it comes naturally. However, when someone in the cast, a non-English speaker uses the word F **** or S ***, he becomes arrogant and aggressive. <br /> <br /> We quickly lost count of how many times the words F and S were used. Everyone was happy to be out of the theater. And we had to give a vote, but it was difficult for us because it was only 0 to 10, and we were looking for -10.
