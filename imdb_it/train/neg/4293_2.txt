"The Rainmaker" published in 1956 - has some of the best actors of his time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges and Burt Lancaster are the main actors. They too cannot save this completely played melodrama. First of all, Hepburn is horribly miscible like a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress, she can't do it either. He is too strong to be credible as a very simple person, and he was simply too old for the part. Lancaster behaves to the extreme, and Earl Holliman is too bitter and comes out more like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and the ever-reliable Wendell Corey seem to overtake the cast a little, but they too can do so much. It seems that the 50s were a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to widen her wings a bit as an actress, and that's fine. He just made a bad choice here. Fortunately for his fans (I am among them) he didn't make too many. Despite the cast of A-list and the good production values, it doesn't work.
