I make a point of view of watching bad movies frequently, and the original sci-fi movies tend to be one of the best sources for these films you can find. As such, I'm sure you can imagine my disappointment when I saw Sands of Oblivion. The acting was unusually comparable, as opposed to the sadly dishonorable display that science fiction usually has for us. There are some cameos made by people you will probably recognize, even though you may not know their name by heart. The special effects of CGI are minimal and, as such, one of the greatest sources of comedy in a science fiction film is missing. Of course, there are some funny moments like when a boy is beheaded by a bulldozer, or when the main character leaves his friend to die to save a girl he has known for a couple of days, but overall, he ends up not having laugh on the ground, and I consider it a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> If I would rate it on a 10-star scale created specifically for judging TV movies, I'd probably give it a 4, maybe even a 5. A real shame that I should wait "until the next movie of science fiction to make a good laugh, and I really hope that this film is not part of an increase in the overall quality of the ski - the original films.
