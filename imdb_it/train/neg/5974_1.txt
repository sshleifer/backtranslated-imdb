Let me start by saying that this doesn't look or sound like a movie. It just looks like another TV show about popular girls and boys without a real film language. Go back up. <br /> <br /> The camera angles are so direct that the story is told in the simplest way possible, without ever making the public connect with it. This film takes us where no film I have ever seen before: in a realm where cinema becomes a hot medium that gives the public every element of interpretation. Too obvious. The large movie screen is only used as a TV enlarged where we can see every attribute of these women in a greater way of life. <br /> <br /> Lately it seems that the young directors are compromising the art of making films for sales. This is very scary. The industry is ruining the art in the movies. We must educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language really are. Not just sales and entertainment, but a way to communicate feelings, passions and even culture. Not as a launching pad for young divas and athletes.
