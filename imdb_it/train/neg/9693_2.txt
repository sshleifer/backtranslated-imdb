The overheated plot of "Bonjour tristesse" is taken from a first juvenile novel by Francoise Sagan, which became a best-seller, even if God knows why. For teenagers who want to get rid of a potential parent can have a certain charm. Don't be fooled by the fact that David Niven plays the father of the playboys and Deborah Kerr the future mother-daughter. Unfortunately, he rests too much on the fragile shoulders of Jean Seberg. She is beautiful and easily satisfies the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that she can hit poses but can't act. Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in Otto Preminger's first film, St. Joan - Seberg, knows he is unable to bring a film at age 19. This film, again by Preminger, satisfies the "promise" of the first. It was his second film; she was now 20. What was Preminger thinking? That Niven and Kerr could compensate for Seberg's lack of acting ability? Not a possibility? The character of Seberg is at the center of the story and, as pretty as she is, convincing even though she may be physically like a seventeen year old, she can't meet the emotional needs of the role. I don't know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she didn't have an impact on my conscience in her subsequent images. But anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste. Despite Niven and Kerr, this remains a youthful story performed in a youthful way by a beautiful girl who needed acting lessons.
