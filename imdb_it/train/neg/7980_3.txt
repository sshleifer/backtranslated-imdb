This comedy of services, for which Peter Marshall (the brother of Joanne Dru and then the perennial guest of The Hollywood Squares) and Tommy Noonan were exalted as "the new Lewis and Martin" is just a little shy: some gags are inserted at random, everyone talks fast and nothing works well - there's a scene where Noonan throws grenades at officers and politicians out of anger; I'm about a meter and a half away, Noonan is throwing them in the middle, and the total reaction is that they all start. <br /> <br /> In the midst of an anguish raised only by the seductive Julie Newmar, there are some moments of brightness: Marshall and Noonan occasionally engage in talk and talk, and their timing is almost perfect - clearly they were a tight-knit comedy couple. <br /> <br /> It is not enough to save this turkey, alas.
