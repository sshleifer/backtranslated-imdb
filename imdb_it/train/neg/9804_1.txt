Power Rangers, the children's show of mercantile television in the 1990s, has become the most useless and ridiculous television program ever created. <br /> <br /> What exactly is the point of this show anyway, if not to sell seconds evaluate the plastic nonsense for children? There is nothing remotely saving or interesting in this show anyway. <br /> <br /> Look at the costumes, which seem to have gone bad. <br /> <br /> Mullet-style hair, earrings and hair the fashions of the early 90s appear completely ridiculous these days. <br /> <br /> Avoid this show at all costs!
