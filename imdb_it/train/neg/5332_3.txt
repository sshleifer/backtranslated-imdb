OK, the portrait of stereotyped "Indians" in this story is simply wrong. I agree that Elvis is pretty good here, but yes, his skin color seems to change during the movie. I was thinking, OK, ... he's never been so tanned in real life. It's one of the most obvious Indian brown makeup I've ever seen. It's as ugly as the "Indians" of "F-Troop" and the old Hollywood westerns played by Jewish and Italian-American actors and not by real Native Americans! <br /> <br /> This movie is ok, but generally lame story and mediocre songs, like in all of Elvis's later films. He just made them because Colonel Parker had tied him to long-term film contacts to squeeze as much money out of Elvis as possible! I keep thinking 'thank God' that Elvis stopped making films forever not long after this movie came out. It's nice to see the actors Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this film, though. <br /> <br /> Burgess Meredith's "Indian" make-up is absolutely WONDERFUL. It is certainly the worst in the group. What were the directors thinking? Was Mr. Meredith doing this just for the money or what? I love certain Elvis movies, though. For example: "Love Me Tender", "Jailhouse Rock", "Viva Las Vegas". I can even watch his film with future TV co-stars Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, "Change Of Habit" in which Elvis plays a doctor in a city center. <br /> <br /> Oh well, at least Elvis made some good movies, but the mediocre and the bad ones overwhelm the decent and good ones. <br /> <br /> I always love ELVIS! Thank you, thank you very much!
