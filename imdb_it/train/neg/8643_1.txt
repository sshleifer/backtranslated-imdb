A Blair Witch-War movie that is as disappointing as Bwitch was! The title says it all, save your money and your time and spend it on a good movie like "Once Upon a Time in America", "The Shawshank Redemption" or "Enemy at the Gates" (if you want to see a GREAT movie of "war") etc. <br /> <br /> This movie, if it was a baseball team and the Major Leagues were the pinnacle and Single A was the novice, so this movie was the high school dance. It was filmed as if it were a high school theater club that ran on their dad's old camera. Of course, they entered a hostile area (to make a film) but I don't call it courageous, in these parts we call it simply stupid! This is a passage to the end! Now go watch it and then tell me what you think.
