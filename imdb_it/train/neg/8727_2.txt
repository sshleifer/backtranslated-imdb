Allow me to start by saying that I can enjoy practically any ugly Italian horror film or jungle exploitation of the 1970s. Seriously. This was really horrible. <br /> <br /> There are too many elements that Martino tries to inject and none of them works (except for the wild coconut thing) very well. There are some ignorant westerners, of course, who have created a jungle resort somewhere. I don't even remember where it happens ... how sad ... Basically, people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its "ceremonies", but in the end they upset the "God Alligator" of the river which then proceeds to go on a rampage, killing vacationers and some members of the tribe. Sounds good, yes? Well, don't fool yourself. There is minimal violence to the end, the special effects are so bad that it is as if a kindergarten class executed them and the romance thrown into it was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There really is some scene where they seem to have put on a camera underwater in a pool and thrown a toy alligator, like a dart, into the water and that should be the alligator that attacks. I'm not kidding. In another wonderfully crafted special effect, a Matchbox van is targeted by the incredible plastic sinking gator, which is suddenly five times bigger than a van. (A few minutes ago, it was big enough to eat a human, but now it makes it look like a full-size cargo van ...) It's really pathetic. The only film in which I can think of where the effects were so bad I was pulled out of history was Bruno Mattei's masterpiece, "Ratti", what with the plastic mice on the conveyor belt and all those that CANNOT be terrified. /> <br /> Normally I would say that Sergio Martino was a must to see, but this is a must-pass. Waste of time and definitely not worth buying for the price of $ 15 + sticker from No Shame. This is a SHAME. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, children.
