My wife and I have just finished this film and have come to IMDb to commiserate with the critics who found this film less satisfying. However, of the 10 pages of reviews, only a handful are negative. I feel that this film is a great concept that went terribly wrong and I want to warn those who are watching the film in the future. <br /> <br /> I admit, I'm more inspired to write reviews when I don't like a movie than when I do it, so my handful of reviews are all negative. However, this does not mean that I am biased towards not enjoying a movie, but I often find more eloquent reviews than films I like. <br /> <br /> Paris je t'aime is the most pretentious film I have seen in years. Using an "intelligent" concept and associating great talent with a couple of WAYs to many short stories, the film ends at the worst of worlds. It is art for art, but something that a 2-year-old could dream and achieve. Giving the director a free reign of 5 minutes of screen time shows why there is a division of labor in entertainment too. Directors can't write, writers can't direct. (I'd also like to add that Clint Eastwood is overrated, but it is because he is a turn director actor who works rarely, be it}}. <br /> <br /> What ends up on the screen is a confusing mess of stories that don't they make no sense, they are not completed in 5 minutes and in total, they ruin me Paris. Why call it Paris je t'aime when a more apropos title is cluster f * ck? There are only a couple of stories that are watchable, especially the piece by Alfonso Cuar√≥n, but everything else will go into the darkness. The Coen brothers' short is passable, but can you name one of their films that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar? It is as if all the directors decided to do whatever they wanted do and have chosen Paris as a place to do it. As we all love Paris, the present company included, we are blinded by the fact that this film JUICE, in fact, I think they put the names of the directors on each of the short films because the directors saw or how scarce this film is and decided to make sure they were blamed for their 5 minutes only. Seriously. SERIOUSLY. <br /> <br /> People, Natalie Portman is NOT a good actress. She's not a dream girl waiting to be yours. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, why?!? Are you acting or simply regurgitating the plays of other films? I'm watching you Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), Elijah Wood (Sin City) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Mary full of grace). <br /> <br /> One last comment on acting: I give double congratulations to Nick Nolte for acting and looking more human than you have for centuries or maybe ever. Find his short film on youtube as his 5 minutes are pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have done well. I think of Ernst Hemingway, Raymond Carver, F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Cheever, just to name a few. It is much more difficult than writing a complete novel and only true talent can do it. The same can be said of short films. It seems that only a director will live in the annals of history. <br /> <br /> If you support Paris as a gem to discover and reflect through your lenses with your story, then don't expect to enjoy this movie The directors either didn't care or were lazy. In both scenarios, when you are reading this means that you have rented it. The praise is that you did not pay $ 10 each in rooms for this.
