This, the death-to-video rattle of the Tremors series, features sixty inspired seconds (sawblade: you'll know when you see it) and more boredom and filler than you can shake a stick. Tremors 4 was obviously shot with an incredibly low budget. This means that they only had enough special effects for three or four minutes of precious worm-like violence on humans, top. The contemptuous, lousy and lousy cast ensures that the remaining hour and a half of the Tremors 4 experience lasts at least fifteen thousand years. Only the most ardent fans of Tremors will be able to sit down and much less appreciate this film. If you are not among them, don't worry.
