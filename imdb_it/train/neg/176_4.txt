<br /> <br /> I saw it on the Sci-Fi channel. He arrived immediately after the first. For some reason this film kept me interested. I don't know why, stop asking. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- Okay ... It was a mess how this guy was involved in making the movie. In the first movie, he had a "reason" for killing people, but in this sequel, half of the murders / attempted murders were basically no reason. Stanley killed the director due to creative differences, he caught the co-writer because of creative differences, but what was the deal with trying to kill the cast? No cast, no movie. Did you want them to "look real when they died"? If this was to be a high-budget film, use special effects, MAN. Obviously like the first, the captured girl walks away, and Stanley ends up being messed up, and disappears. Woooooow (sarcasm). This HAD potential of the film. And the saddest thing of all ... the really sad part ... I would like to see a "cabin on the lake 3". Just because I like Judd Nelson, and he's the only positive part of this sequel.
