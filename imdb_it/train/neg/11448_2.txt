In no way is this movie as bad as "Perfect Stranger", but it wasn't fun. He could not stick to a type of comedy: he jumped from SNL, to Adam Sandler-esquire, to romantic, to boy, to a great, to a slapstick, to "Loser" (the film), types of comedies. Although there were some rather amusing slapstick moments (the fall down the hill), none was particularly funny or exceptional in any way. 'Schindler's List' was more fun (and felt shorter). you never knew if Andy Samberg should have been in high school, a college dropout, or just a loser living at home with his mother - Sissy Spacek, in his worst choice of roles. And poor Ian McShane, the serious actor, if only I had to name one, he is given a shit to read in the camera. The plot draws and is completely predictable until the end (including the possibility of spoilers in the event that Adam Samberg's mother wants to see her). Don't spend ANY money going to see this movie, and maybe Lorne Michaels will have the suggestion and will start producing quality movies (Yes, Wayne's World and Tommy Boy).
