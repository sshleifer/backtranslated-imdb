If I hadn't read Pat Barker's "Union Street" before seeing this movie, I would have liked it. Unfortunately this is not the case. In reality it is my kind of film, it is well done, and in no way I mean the opposite, but as an adaptation, it fails from every angle. <br /> <br /> The harrowing novel about the reality of Vivendo in a working class in the north of England, I grabbed my heart strings and refused to let go for weeks after I had finished. During the reading of the women on Union Street, they brought tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy and sadness to me. Excellent. A novel that I sometimes felt I couldn't read anymore, but I novel that I simply couldn't suppress. Depressing yes, but absolutely compelling. <br /> <br /> The movie. Oh dear. Hollywood took the truth and reality of Barker and slid a layer of sweet icing sugar onto it. A beautiful film, an inspirational soundtrack, excellent performances, a story of hope and romance ... yes. An adaptation of 'Union Street' ... no. <br /> <br /> The women of Union Street and their stories are condensed into the character of Fonda, their stories are touched, but many are discarded. I accept that some of Barker's stories are delicate and are too horrible for mass viewing, and that a film with about 7 protagonists is not practical, but the content is not my main problem. The essence and the real gut of the novel are lost - darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard, and the smell of poverty described graphically is replaced by the sun, beautiful houses and a sparkling William soundtrack. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of "reality", I suggest you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like "Schindler's List" ... but without the happy ending.
