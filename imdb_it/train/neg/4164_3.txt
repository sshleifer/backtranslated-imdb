<br /> <br /> What remains of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and hungry survivors. They must eat insects and insects, or anything else, after a poisoned war, or something like that, almost wiped out all human civilization. In these dark times, one of the few people on Earth still able to live in comfort, we will call it All Knowing Big Boss, has a great research to prevent some secret spore seeds from being released into the air. It seems that the All Knowing Big Boss is the last person on Earth who knows that these spores even exist. Spores are found far from any living soul and are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. <br /> <br /> The Big Knowing All Boss wants secret spores to remain in their protected secret containers. Then, make a plan to send a macho action group to remove the spore containers from all the protection systems and the secret location. Sending people to the secret spores position does not make them more secret. Sending people to disable all protection systems makes it possible for spores to be easily released into the air. How about letting the sleeping dogs sleep? <br /> <br /> The only pleasant feature of ENCRYPT is the bright and elegant Vivian Wu. While the insignificant members of the macho action team abandon predictable times by the mechanical rhythm, the captivating charm of Vivian Wu makes the idea of ​​the plot of her old employer who wants her so acceptable. It is an object of love, an object of desire - a very credible concept! <br /> <br /> Vivian Wu fans might want to take a look at a great B-series movie a couple of years ago called DINNER RUSH. DINNER RUSH is highly recommended. ENCRIPTA is not.
