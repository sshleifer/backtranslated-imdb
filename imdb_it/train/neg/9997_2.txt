Capt. Gallagher (Lemmon) and flight attendant Eve Clayton (Vaccaro) are a seemingly hot object on this journey of death; a luxurious 747 airliner decked out to look like a nightclub-hotel-slash ?? there is also a blind pianist who falls in love. Karen Wallace (Grant) is the hysterical b! $ 3 and who will do everything to attract the attention of the tormented husband Martin (Christopher Lee) and, later, of the rest of the people on board. <br /> <br /> Memorable moments: Boeing 747 avalanche in the Atlantic Ocean, Karen gets ribs when it goes too far, and furniture (and people screaming) that become "ball bearings" in a "sinking" pinball machine. <br /> <br /> The action and rescue sequences here are relatively phenomenal, but there's not much to do. Hitchcock was supposed to direct this sequel, but I forgot why not? It would have done wonders for the original 1970, on which this sequel is partly inspired ('77 also took inspiration from "The Flight of the Phoenix"). <br /> <br /> The actors Cotten and de Havilland rejoin their days in "Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte" (it seems that they don't play here, they just rejoined the lovers of Autumn Years). And the actress who plays Emily's partner is the same one who played the hammered waitress on "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" <br /> <br /> Television actors include "Mayberry RFD's" girlfriend (she the character's daughter wins a drawing contest, or something lame like that), Gil Gerard of Buck Rogers and Pamela Bellwood of "Dynasty ". <br /> <br />
