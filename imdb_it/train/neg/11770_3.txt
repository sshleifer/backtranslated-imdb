'P' (or Club-P) should be called 'L' for the lame. Every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that fails to live up to its much-acclaimed fray: "Thai lesbians fighting monsters". Rather, this is the story of a Khmer country girl who her grandmother taught her a little witchcraft along with some strange (but specific) rule: "don't walk under a clothesline", "don't eat raw meat", and "Don't accept money for your powers." Well, guess what, the girl moves to Bangkok to earn some "bar-girl" money and manages to break all the rules her grandmother taught her and then release an evil spirit that conveniently kills the "foreign johns" who pay for her services. <br /> <br /> Although this film cannot even be released in Thailand due to the controversial topic, most American audiences will find this horror hum-hum image a cross between "Showgirls" and "Interview with the Vampire "" as directed by Walt Disney. <br /> <br /> If it weren't for some scenes with a significant amount of blood, the MPAA could probably only evaluate it for pre-teens. , even if you would expect at least one sex scene considering that the film is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a Thai real life porn star. <br /> <br /> As for the "lesbian" corner, c "it's a short smooch and a couple of" I love you's "to show that the two main stars are really a couple (on brother). And the P-bar must be the only exotic nightclub on the planet where the girls are holding their sarong and do carnival stunts (there is a swordsman cutting cucumbers from a girl's mouth ... ooh, phallic images). <br /> <br /> NO nudity, NO real monster (unless you contain a five foot tall Thai spirit with yellow eyes), and no other ADULT should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on DVD. You have been warned!
