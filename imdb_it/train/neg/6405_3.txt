No real plot for this, just a series of short skits reciting some VERY old jokes. I giggled once or twice at the beginning, to my great regret. But even at just 73 minutes this film wears out before it's too long and becomes stale and boring (with some nudity sprayed here and there to keep you awake). Still as ugly as this film (and this is quite rotten), it is a comic gem compared to Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg's ANYthing (Date movie, Epic movie, Meet the Spartans) The song is also sadly a bit catchy in a sadness. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: 11 pairs of boobs, 3 bushes, 3 donkeys <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> Code Red DVD Extras: Original trailer for this movie; and trailers for "Beyond the Door", "Dead Pit", "The Farmer", "obsessed", "Power Play", "Sole Survivor" and "Wacky Taxi"
