Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic hating woman, Chuck Traynor. I don't understand how having sex with a dog (which is also animal abuse) can be fun or funny. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner forced to make these films. I know some people will criticize this comment, but I strongly feel that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects compared to human beings. We call ourselves "civilized", yet I feel that we still have a long way to go before we can scratch the surface of being civilized.
