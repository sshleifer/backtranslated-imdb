There is no history! The plot is hopeless! A car-based movie with a locked accelerator, no brakes and a locked automatic shift lever can't be good! I would have stopped that car within a minute, whether I was in it, or in the police car constantly following it. I'm sorry for the actors who had to endure such a poor script. The few scenes that some similarities with the action have been heavily dramatized, and as far as possible from reality. Furthermore, there have been a lot of mistakes, for example the hood of the fleeing car, which has been ticked by doing 100 miles per hour. At first he simply folded over the windshield, as in reality, but then, later, he jumped. The car was later in the film watched with the hood .... <br /> <br /> This film was nothing but annoying, to stay away from it!
