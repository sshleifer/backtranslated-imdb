Like last year, I couldn't sit down for the whole thing. Ok, so Chris Rock as a guest was a good choice because he was vaguely addictive. Or rather, of all the total boredom crammed into the theater, at least it wasn't among the top 10 most boring. Many presenters, on the other hand, were in this Top 10 coveted. I didn't know that everything had been done by autocue (even though I knew it was a script) but it was really terrible to see these presumed good actors unable to insert expressions, look away from the cue and stumble over simple words (Natalie Portman ?? if not 'is a director, she's gone). The Night of Fancy Dresses and Boring Speeches was long and boring, Beyonce Knowles slaughtered some good songs and there were few decent speeches and acceptance clips. Adam Sandler wins the Worst Presenter award. <br /> <br /> For helping me write this review, I would like to thank my mother, my father, my lawyers and my pedicist for believing in me, and would like to emphasize that I have a high metabolism and of course I'm not starving for a month. I'm not going to cry ... thanks.
