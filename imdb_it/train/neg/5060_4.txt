This film is a perfect adaptation of the English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Emran the one of Olivier and Malikka, the perfect traitorous wife of Lane. They changed the second part of the film to fit the Indian masses. <br /> <br /> Even then the film has complete Unfaithful tracks, even if it failed to reach the original. It was cheap soft porn for Bollywood lovers, where Mallika showed much more skin than anyone dared to show. Emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer. In the future, if Indian filmmakers plan to redo an English film, they will have to examine the feasibility of the plot with the Indian Censors. Even if the film bombed at the box office, the actors got the improper recognition. In the future, filmmakers should be a little more careful in making an Oscar nominated film. <br /> <br /> That being said, this is not a family movie, so take extra care while watching it at home with the family.
