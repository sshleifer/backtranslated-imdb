I thought this movie would be so much better then. It looked like a parody of the spy generator, and the beginning reminded me of Pleasantvil, but this movie came out short. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous. The KGB and the Soviet Union in Russia have set up an espionage school to teach spies how to behave like Americans, but the city they set up to train for is a bit dated, so they grab two sharks from the United States to nibble things up. I don't know, but this just seems out there. It gets really weird when next to nobody in this all-Russian city he speaks in a Russian accent. Someone ruined the casting. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, for a play this is painfully dry. There's one, two funny tops, and there's nothing to sing and dance. In the end, the film will probably put you to sleep. <br /> <br /> And like a punch in the face, this film is so professional in the United States that it makes me sick. The film continues to repeat itself, the United States is God and Russia is the devil. This is the kind of smear campaign that was done against the Japanese in World War II. They are films like these that make everyone think that the United States is full of itself. <br /> <br /> They get 4 out of 10, and I'm kind. She really should have one, but the dance scene was fun, but then she dragged herself back a long time to be really funny.
