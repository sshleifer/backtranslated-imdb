I would give a negative assessment if I could. I went to this film, I didn't expect much, but I had an open mind. The whole thing is stupid! Snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a busty and a couple of guys. Oh how original; if I were a 12 year old boy I could laugh at that. I have no idea how this movie has become so popular. Seriously, the worst thing I've ever seen. I wasn't entertained, it wasn't fun, I wasn't even bored! I was nothing. It wasn't even that bad that it was good, it's just bad. Really ridiculous. Please don't waste your money on this movie. Don't even rent this movie. No clue as to how he is getting such a high score.
