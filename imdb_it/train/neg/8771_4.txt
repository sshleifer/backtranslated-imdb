Ok, I was bored and decided to watch this movie. But I think the main thing that brought this film was that there would be an hour of shooting, so practically the same now repeated 4 times. Consists of 1. Collecting troops and discussing the attack plan, 2. Flashbacks to men's wives 3. Moving troops into a long line approaching 4. Men running up the hill and shooting, usually the first who is hit in the head then another 3 men saved him. 5. Defeat of the enemy and call to the base to tell the success 6. Men who return to their wives and sing songs from 10 minutes. That was the basic film, and that same order of events happened about 4 or 5 times. and every time he flashed his wives, he showed the man, then his wife and him. There were about 10 men or more who would have had a flashback so this took a lot of time. In addition to this, men could not kill their enemies except with bayonets or grenades. I liked music and there was a lot of action, even if the action was repetitive. Overall, I probably wouldn't have seen it again, but it wasn't too horrible.
