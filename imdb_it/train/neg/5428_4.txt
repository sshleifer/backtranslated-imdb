Another Priyadarshan / Vohra shows another film that was seen for TP rather than for real desire, the only reason I saw this film was the fact that the regulars were not present in this film (Akshay Paresh and many others ), but needless to say, I had low expectations from this film. <br /> <br /> I was happy with the casting in general, except for Rajpal Yadav who once again annoys without limits, but does some laughter, but those were the standard original jokes, in fact this film is like playing the dhol, I mean, it takes almost no talent to make noise, or even play the bizarre bang on the dhol for a while, does it ?? They are only those that can bring different rhythms in a pleasant and sequential way, for a prolonged period that are considered fantastic. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the other instrument, the Dumroo requires just a talent, it has no variations and it could be nice for a while the monkey dances (hmm sounds like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy), but it is not a tool that will entertain you for a long time or make you dance like the Dhol does. <br /> <br /> This film was like the dhol and the dumroo, sometimes the Dhol was sometimes played dumroo, sometimes both together, but above all the Dumroo played alone and the monkey danced. And like every 24 year old I got bored. <br /> <br /> The film has some good Dhol moments (good) but after a while all I heard was the annoying Dumroo (initially funny, so tolerable and then irritating), the big ordinary parts really ensure that this film is useful especially for some funny clips on "MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA" (if you haven't seen it watch it on Filmy, the evening arrives and it's really quite funny). <br /> <br /> This movie has had its moments, the actors have done a great job, except for Rajpal Yadav (who can act even though, I saw him in Main Meri Patni ??) who annoys more to entertain, I've said it many times and I'll say it again. I really think that Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a good career ahead of them in multi-star comedies in particular. <br /> <br /> Some scenes were really fun like the abortive attempts to impress the girls' father, the bizarre attempts to woo the girl and take her away from each other. <br /> <br /> But after this was over there was an attempt to make this movie much more with an added mystery, this means that once the girl was in, the next 45-60 minutes were more and more torturous, the climax was "HOW MUCH WAS THE CATEGORY ALMOST GOOD", I mean what they were thinking if I had a tense ending at least make an attempt to make it palatable. <br /> <br /> The film is also extremely predictable, there is hardly a scene you cannot foresee and you will not want to break into a spontaneous laugh of laughter here, it is more like seeing it coming and almost starting to laugh before the gag. <br /> <br /> The film follows a gradual decline in all films except for the bizarre, down or up, and then quickly plummets downhill once they have made friends with the girl. <br /> <br /> Most of the really bad scenes were near the end, one that the film tries to be more than a run of the mill comedy, even many of the jokes were very stale and smelly of repetition, the LAST 10-15 IT WAS PARTICULARLY SEPARATED AND COMPLETELY SPOIL FILM. <br /> <br /> I did not find Tanushree Datta as the siren who played, and his acting talent is in serious doubt, especially in view of his unattractive looks, if you can't be HOT and I can't recite how long you can to survive. <br /> <br /> Even technically this film was weak, with a constant female gaze and poor lighting and camera work. <br /> <br /> The songs except the even the title track was not going well, when the songs played in the 2nd time I could hear the collapse of the audience. <br /> <br /> In all a movie that is simply ordinary just for the cast, and very low expectations. <br /> <br /> Avoiding it would not be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> And if you have to watch it on TV for free or a cheap matinee or something is a must, if you pay the multiple multiplex rates you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> - yes many stale lines, RAJPAL YADAV, LAST 45 MINUTES AND LAST 15 MINUTES ESPECIALLY, technically bad, bad songs. <br /> <br /> +/- s try to be more than what it was, not the regular cast (I'm happier for it), Tanushree Datta. <br /> <br /> + s some good scenes towards the beginning, title, good acting and cast except RY. <br /> <br /> total 4.5 / 10 (I'm trying to be objective here, I don't like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie has met my very low expectations, so I'm giving the benefit of all doubts, on absolute terms this film was not more than a 4)
