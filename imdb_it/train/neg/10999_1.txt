Imagine the worst skits of Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in a 90-minute movie. Now imagine that all the humor in those bad scenes is removed and replaced with stupidity. Now imagine something 50 times worse. <br /> <br /> get it? <br /> <br /> Ok, now go see The Underground Comedy Movie. That vision you just made will seem like the funniest thing ever. UCM is the single worst movie I've ever seen. There were some cheap laughs ... very few. But he was lame. Although the intent of the film was to be lame, it was too boring to be funny. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm not angry about wasting my time watching this was someone else I bought. He wasted his money. Vince Offer has not written or directed anything else and it is not surprising why.
