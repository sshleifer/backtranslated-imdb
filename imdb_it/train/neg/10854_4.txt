Cradle of Fear <br /> <br /> This is not a film in which the delicate little narrative nuances occupy our attention. This is not a movie where special effects should leave us speechless by pronouncing that sense of whoa. What it is however is a slice of lo-fi goth horror that leaves little to the imagination, created in the eyes of the director, Alex Chandon, as "a return to the dingy 70s and 80s". <br /> <This is a very visceral experience for 2 hours, in which four plot lines are connected by a lot of watery blood, reams of dismembered body parts and innards, bound by a thread of intestinal revenge. <br /> <br /> The supplier of this horrible violence is Dani Filth, lead singer of the metal band Cradle of Filth, who played a role he was destined to play. <br /> <br /> As others have said, there is nothing new in wanting to achieve occult revenge. In this particular context a convicted predator and sexual murderer, Kemper, the father of our diabolical avenging angel, forces his son to demand punishment on those who are somehow connected to condemn him to purgatory in an asylum. <br /> <br /> What this provides for the Chandon, which should also be congratulated for writing and editing this piece, is the opportunity to free your sick mind. He seems happy with the idea of ​​splashing blood in the orifices of those on the screen and in every corner that can be reached. We are also treated to close-ups of skull skeletons, demonic rapes and other assorted images to involve those who appreciate the approach and the staff to their horror. And for some of those who follow this type of film closely, there is the strange sequence that could make you think: "I only saw what I thought I was doing", because of course Pretty Woman isn't like that. It reminds me of some of the gore-fests created by the Italian horror between 20 and 30 years ago, and a series of other works in which disgusting images left their mark but not the context in which they were viewed. <br /> <The story 4 of the set is particularly intriguing where the idea of ​​obsession can eventually lead to death in the search for violence on the Internet through the "sick room", where the user has control over how a life can be turned off. Further recognition should also go to a pounding soundtrack that allows Filth to exert his daytime talent and effective use of drums and bass, often overlooked in film production as a viable form of supporting images. The use of the city of London as a background with real people and not film substitutes also adds support to the sense of commando of the film. OK, classic can't be, but blood, guts, intestines, occult and demons in a slightly perverse, slightly perverse way.
