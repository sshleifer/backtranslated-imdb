I can't believe I wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this terrible movie, continuing to hope that it would improve by the end, but the boy was wrong. The plot was abysmal, the acting was extremely poor and the special effects were horrible. Not even the 2 beautiful girls could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess. However I can't lie, some of the jokes in this film were quite memorable as when the Asian guy says "I lost my virginity with the babysitter so f **** stereotypes" <br /> <br /> please don't waste time with this incident unless you are prepared or want to have a good laugh ... maybe this way you can watch it to rip this movie off with some friends
