Based on one of Gabriel Marquez's books and could be brilliant literature, this film adaptation really sucks because it's more like fighting against sleep than enjoying some cinematic delights. The story is about an old couple whose son died and lives a life that is heavily dominated by poverty, and in which the main character is a cock that one day hopefully can bring some money for an imminent fight of roosters. I'm not in the mood to spill more words on this pointless pretentious piece, just maybe you can see Salma Hayek here, but sitting 90 minutes in front of your screen just for that? No thanks.....
