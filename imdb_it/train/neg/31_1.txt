This is the biggest insult to TMNT ever. Fortunately, Venus officially does not exist in the canonical TMNT. There will never be a female turtle, this has taken away the tragic tale of 4 unique male mutants who will never have a family of their own, once they haven't left any more. The biggest mistake was to cross Power Rangers with TMNT with a horrible episode; the turtle's voices were WRONG and they all acted out of the character. They could have done a better job, better designs and animatronics and NO VENUS. <br /> <br /> don't worry about these people ... it's a worthwhile material. the lip of the lips was slow and unnatural in appearance. they are totally devoid of the document shredder. the main villain, a kind of lord of dragons was mushy. the turtles looked silly from things hanging from their bodies, what was the thing around the thigh of raph? the sculpted plastrons that seem to be carved! <br /> <br /> If they looked normal, played the character and got rid of Venus, they got rid of the stupid kiddie cartoons ... and better writing could have been good.
