This film showed more racial hatred of David Mamet's Jews than I have ever met in an American film. Stereotypes are so exaggerated that my ability to keep watching is dead. I was so disappointed with Joe <br /> Mantegna that he called a group of men, sitting in a Jewish center in New York that cleaned weapons, heroes that common sense prevailed and I stopped. I am deeply disturbed by the concept that Jews are not American and "different". I suggest that Mr. Mamet is one of the causes of hatred, not a healer of it.
