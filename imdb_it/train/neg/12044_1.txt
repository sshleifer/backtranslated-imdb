I went to see the movie "Troy" this afternoon. Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> Contrary to public opinion and history in general, Greek men were not gay. NEVER. This was clearly established immediately at the beginning of the film and reinforced about every five minutes thereafter. So he's sure the American guys see this movie. <br /> <br /> Helen of Troy has always had impeccable hair and makeup. She looked beautiful in all her short cameo scenes which, although numerous, were probably all shot on the same day, one after the other, with the director saying "Okay, now it looks beautiful ... good ... OK, now he looks scared ... well ... now he looks depressed ... well ... now he seems interested ... well ... now it seems nice again ... good ... "<br /> <br / > Most Greek and Trojan men had British accents. Those with American accents could not act. <br /> <br /> Trojans looked just like the Greeks, but tended to stay on the right side of the screen. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt does not blink his room. <br /> <br /> The biggest line of Helen of Troy was: "They're coming for me". <br /> <br /> Trojan music sounded remarkably like modern Bulgarian music. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt's thighs reach the bottom. <br /> <br /> Achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close, but that's fine. They were cousins. No matter what the story says. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole can tell an entire story with just one expression. <br /> <br /> The Trojan gods apparently all had Greek names, but their statues seemed to be Egyptian or like Peter O'Toole dragged. <br /> <br /> Greek men never touched each other unless they were fighting, just like American men. <br /> <br /> All the thousands of extras in the film had exactly the same color as the skin ... Light Egyptian, by Max Factor. <br /> <br /> Troy only had three women. <br /> <br /> There were many blond Greeks, which is good news for Brad Pitt, who otherwise would have really stood out. <br /> <br /> Despite their coastal desert setting, the Greeks had the extraordinary ability to find unlimited quantities of timber to build fires, funeral pyres, Trojan horses and the like. <br /> <br /> British actors seem silly with Greek hairstyles. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt changes expression only when the sun shines directly into his eyes. <br /> <br /> The Greek soldiers fought constantly, but their clothes always seemed impeccable. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts. <br /> <br /> Apparently the Greek temples were always in ruins, even when they were all new.
