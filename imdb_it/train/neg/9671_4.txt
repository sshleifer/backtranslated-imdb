Perhaps I would give 6 or 7 to this propaganda film because it shows when and how a propaganda film succeeds. If there are people who watch this piece and think that "well, then the Jews must have done something to be treated in the way they were treated in World War II", then the film is made intelligently to hide "why" and "how to mix properly" and false observations about how a people lives. What else can aspire to a propaganda film? The part that includes an American film on the Rothschild family is here reused very cleverly, for example. The question of why the Jew keeps his wealth away from the officer is never asked. No one mentions the taxation system within that particular social stratum. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the level of excitement (or, the level of disgust) in the film slowly increases and the end similar to the solution of the film fits the purpose and the must to do propaganda. The audience would leave with joy and gratitude the coming times ... well done. <br /> <br /> In the film, there is a kind of simplicity that addresses the simplest emotional perception of the audience. The film is kind of a story today, so there's no need to really get excited about it in reality. However, in this simplicity of words of ethnic degradation, a careful observer can find relevance for cultural hatred, violence, decivilization and integration problems. Overall, fine garbage.
