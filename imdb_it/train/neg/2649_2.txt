My wife and I started watching this movie with anticipation. It seemed warm and moving. It started well; but, after a while, he soon became boring and frankly idiotic. It was so bad that we turned it off. The film was misinterpreted and honestly, we couldn't understand or want to understand exactly why or why the hell this woman could stand! You lost sympathy for her after being rude and playing wackos singing and cleaning. I would have made her busy. And of course, like most Hollywood movies and T.V series, we have to cast it as a "gay" character! This film was boring. I expected more from Diane Keaton!
