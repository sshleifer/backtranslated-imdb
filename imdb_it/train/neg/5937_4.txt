Of course, if you ask any mother who is the most beautiful girl in the world, she would tell you that her son is the most incredible boy in the world. He's right, at least in his world. <br /> <br /> The film's producers were Biggie's mother and her good friend Puffy. Oh well, do I have to say anything else? Break it down for those who don't want to make a simple deduction. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was fake. You can simply put together some MTG videos of Biggie and call it a movie. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Angela Bassett played the mother of Biggie. The real one in life looks like a dog. <br /> <br /> I just wonder why he called himself a biggie small. Big body Small cock? Big mouth Small sound? Big and small eyes?
