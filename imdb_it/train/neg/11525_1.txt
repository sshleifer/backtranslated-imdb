Simply terrible! Why shouldn't you use real actors? Look, this must end! Stop using non-actors! If you want credibility or any message sent through these low-budget films ... please, for God's sake, use real actors! Most will work for free ... take advantage of it! Now going back to my comment ... however, the humor was less than that of the bath variety and was not fun at any level. As for the quality ... in a scene shot on a public transport bus you could see the reflection of the crew ... guess what? He was a guy with what looked like a Sony camcorder and probably not even his. Well, I assume the only audience for this movie are people with a gregorio fetish ... and it wasn't even good blood.
