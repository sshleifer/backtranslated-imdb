I'm a big Stephen King fan. I loved The Running Man. So obviously I was very excited that someone had made a film of it. And when a local network showed the film, I was in heaven. I was ready for a night of fun! <br /> <br /> The first indicator that something was wrong was when I noticed that someone had chosen Arnold Schwarzenegger. I simply could not believe that a man who became famous for films full of runnin 'an' shootin 'could play a smarter part, as was described in the book. I was still convinced that this would be a good movie, however. Who knows, maybe Arnold had hidden talents? <br /> <br /> Well, he didn't. I soon discovered that the only reason he was chosen was that someone had rewritten the whole story to get him to fight a 'shootout'. Yes, it was a standard Arnold movie: the hero is hurt, the hero solves the problems by flexing his mighty muscles and scaring everyone and the hero gets the girl. <br /> <br /> I was stunned. This is NOT what the book said. I know that books cannot be put on the screen literally, but this does not even bind to the book. Stephen King should have openly denounced any affiliation with the film and should have banned the use of the title The Running Man for this shameless waste of films. I don't say this often, but this film was BAD. If I weren't home watching, I would have thrown rotten tomatoes on the screen. Once again: ugly. <br /> <br /> (Note that I used "someone" a lot. I did it because I'm sure many people are ashamed to have worked on this and I don't want to embarrass them further by naming them here)
