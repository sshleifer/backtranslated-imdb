This film was scheduled to be a hit movie, and it really is. This is the kind of movie that is made to eat popcorn and watch flashy graphics. With this in mind, the film offers, perhaps not as good as the flashy Iron Man, but quite well. Outside of the popcorn that chews action and special effects, the film falls faster than Wile E. Coyote. <br /> <br /> Many viewers, myself included, will complain about how most of the characters have been severely altered, but this makes the film only a poor fit, not a poor movie. This film is unsatisfactory for other reasons. Producers have focused more on making it appealing to the eye than on the mind. The characters that have long been expected and promoted are reduced to four scenes cameo. The main characters of Wolverine, Victor Creed (never called Sabertooth in the film) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by Liev Schriber's performance. The rest of the characters are thrown on the side of the road to make room for all the most important candy for the eyes. The character of Wolverine is fully developed after 30 minutes, as is Sabertooth, although Victor makes some late surprises in the film. <br /> <br /> The film's "final boss" is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the film. original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is. The filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad character who could do whatever they wanted and slap the name of a popular character. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ...
