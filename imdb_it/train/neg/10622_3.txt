Actually I have a passion for Christopher Lee, but this was not up to his other performances ... and he was one of the best actors. <br /> <br /> The film is not up to its premise. It's not so scary, it's overly melodramatic, and draaaaaags. Whenever I thought, "Oh, here comes the good part" the good part never arrived. <br /> <br /> Evil Ones are not at all convincing. Most of the other characters also lacked depth. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if I had been in an appropriate state of mind, I could have enjoyed some episodes of MSTie at the expense of this film, but ... Naaahhh ... It doesn't really seem worth it . It wasn't really very good, it wasn't really bad, it was just mediocre.
