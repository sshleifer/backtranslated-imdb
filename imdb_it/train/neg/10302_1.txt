Since the "Rugrats" "fall from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and even horrible rate for two-year-olds in the last three or four years, obviously Klasky-Csupo's tyrants should be out of ideas After minimizing all the characters, adding even the most stupid ones, replacing some voices (even if I like Nancy Cartwright, she is NOT Chucky Finster!), And having no sense of continuity (eg: in an episode of Kimi I seen the other day, Tommy and Chucky both have a new puppy, but in a later episode, the aforementioned dogs never appear), you would think the creators could kill the show out of pity. But noooo. <br /> <br / > All I will say about this special is that it sucks! Although they are not as horrible as the Kimi episodes, they are all even more stupid than them, including the grandfather (my God! He was the best character on the show, but not nowhas a real purpose). The ending is unnecessarily soft, and the only thing different between this and other new nasty episodes ('98 -'01) is that children can interact with adults. Whoa, what fun! <br /> <br /> No star for "The Rugrats All Growed Up". Klasky-Csupo, please DESTROY this show before it gets worse.
