I saw this movie in my movie class. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it. I entered it with an open mind and was also a little excited. I really like Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the cast was interesting. I never connected to this movie. The acting was great, the cinematography was interesting, but the plot, or rather the lack of it, was a problem. There was no central theme connecting to the film. Was it a love story between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Was it a western? Kind of, but no. I'm all for twists in the movies, I recently saw "Brick" and I loved it, but the place where this movie went was too much out there. It was so weird, and if I hadn't had the obligation to pass the entire movie, I would have left. The writing was not terrible, but it was everywhere. When he finished this film, I was left terribly confused and wishing he had finished before. There was just something in this film that didn't resonate, I understand more unusual films like "Fight Club", but I didn't care about the characters at all.
