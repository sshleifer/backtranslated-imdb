Unless you are an evangelical Christian, make yourself similar to an Egyptian and avoid the biblical plague. <br /> <br /> Horrible - because oh, because IMDb lists the most favorable reviews at the top of the list - it was due to one of these that I just missed the end of what started as a good evening on this movie. <br /> <br /> The premise of the plot started pretty strong - I got involved in the film and got interested to the point where the sermons in the Bible took over. What a waste. <br /> <br /> This movie made me so excited that for the first time I registered with IMDb just to complain - at least I hope so by saving someone else's evening. /> <br /> Hay - what a Christian act on my part ;-)
