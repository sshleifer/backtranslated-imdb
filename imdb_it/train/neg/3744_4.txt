This film is an attempt to present the theory of Jared Diamonds of "Guns, Germs and Steel", explaining how Europeans dominated much of the globe. <br /> <br /> The version I saw of this documentary came on 2 discs covering 3 hours. I think the information could have been presented in 20 minutes. There are completely useless scenes of: Professor Jared Diamond looking at birds with binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond who did not properly use a bow and arrow, Professor Jared Diamond badly shot a muzzle loader. This documentary was supposed to make a hero "Professor Jared diamond?" This part of the documentary was so ugly, it could have been a parody. The worst was when Diamond was shot down and crying when he visited the malaria ward in an African hospital. None of this helps me understand his "Guns, Germs and Steel" theory. BTW, "Guns, Germs and Steel" is said about 100 times. "Can European cannons, germs and steel take them out of this terrible situation? Stay tuned and find out!" When he finally gets to work, his theory is equally interesting and absolutely boring. Europeans conquered the indigenous peoples of other lands, because they had cannons and thin blades against stone and wood weapons. Do I really need a professor to convince me of this? The parts of his theory that explain how the Europeans had the advantages that allow the conquest are interesting, but the coverage is very thin. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think the documentary was just trying to convince me that non-Europeans are as capable as Europeans. If I'm not a racist, I already know. If I'm a racist, Jared Diamond won't convince me with his awkward use of native instruments. <br /> <br /> I don't think adults are the intended audience for this documentary. The children might appreciate this more than me, though. I read that the book from which this documentary is much better than the documentary.
