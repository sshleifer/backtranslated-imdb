I voted this movie at 1 since the plot is so incredible. Unbelievable. Judge for yourself. Be careful, the following will not only give away the plot, it will also ruin your appetite for watching the movie. <br /> <br /> A computer virus, designed by a frustrated nerd, sends a code through television screens and computer monitors. When the code - in the form of light - enters the eye, it can access the "electrical system" of your body. What it does is force the body's cells into calcium excretion. In a few seconds after the infection the patient reaches the neck, develops tunnel vision, his skin becomes white with calcium, after which he falls and his hand and his head break in a cloud of chalk. <br /> <br /> This virus is very intelligent. When he discovers that a blind IT expert is attempting to disassemble the code with a Braille output device - operated by hand - the device is set to a very high voltage, which causes severe burn injury on the skin of the expert's head. The virus also detects aggression against remote controls and an ATM keyboard. Fortunately it could be stopped by throwing the old desktop PC in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and with his feet in spilled water. <br /> <br /> Oh dear ...
