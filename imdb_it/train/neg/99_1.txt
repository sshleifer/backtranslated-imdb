Some films that you take for a pound turn out to be pretty good - the films of the 23rd century published dozens of obscure Italian and American films that were great, but although Hardgore released some Fulci films among others, most of their production a shit like The Zombie Chronicles. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it is not nearly as annoying as the stench of Flesh. In addition to this, it is a very clumsy anthological film with the technical competence of a Lego house built from a whelk. <br /> <br /> It has been noticed elsewhere, but you really have to worry about a movie that inserts action previews in its credit sequence, so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks, you've already seen it all. <br /> <br /> Bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18,000 continuity errors and the evil acting of the cast (especially the hitchhiker, who was so bad that made me laugh a bit), and congratulations to Hardgore for getting into the spirit of things by releasing a print so ugly as to look like I was looking a little beaten at home on a camping trip. <br /> <br /> Horrible and terrible things. We've all done things like that when we took a camera, but common sense prevails and these films languish in our lockers somewhere. To avoid.
