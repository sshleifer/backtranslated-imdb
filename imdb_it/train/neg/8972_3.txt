<br /> <br /> The main question I ask about this film is: how to film a musical colter and use only 3 of its 15 songs! merman and lahr have played the main roles on Broadway, here they are replaced by the weaker red skelton and ball of lucille. plot changes abound and fun is lost. <br /> <br /> SKIP IT.
