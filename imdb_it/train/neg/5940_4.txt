Look, I am reading and reading these comments and there are many that I want to say but I will try to make it short but clean ... <br /> <br /> First of all, let's forget everything how bad this movie was .. As it didn't show anything about Notorious and I agree with most of the people here saying it was "Hollywood", I mean, what did you expect from a real life story? When people wake up and see that they will never find the real truth about 2pac and Biggie ... It's all covered up and buried deep. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm not against either 2pac or Biggie, I love them both, but 2pac and Lil Kim felt embarrassed in this movie for sure ... <br /> <br /> So , for all of you are saying that the film is fantastic and I don't see the truth, whether you are too blind to see it because you think you know something about BIG or you don't know anything about it and you love this movie for Hollywood teenagers. Use your mind and see if the clouds ... There is a lot you could say when it comes to this topic, I didn't say 60% of what I have to say because it's a very broad topic but for the film I can only say that it could have been a little, I mean a lot better. But anyway I'm just a person who gives his opinion .... No resentment ... <br /> <br /> Look, I love hip hop and live for it but after seeing this movie every person with a little 'intelligence could see that this is not how someone should live. With all due respect to 2pac and BIG, like all the other artists who make their living like this should turn the other page because you're ruining your youth .... Bring the wrong message to the children and that is: do not go to school, but living on the streets, pushing and grabbing the newspaper .... <br /> <br /> The real hip hop is supposed to be about love and intelligence, be smart and everything. <br /> OK I know many of you will think I'm crazy, but that's just my point of view. Look, maybe I'm not mistaken about something and I'm not saying that this is a completely ugly film because even though I'm in hip hop for 17, 18 I still don't know anything about 2pac or Biggie, no matter how many articles I've read or how much I support them I listen to their music ... like most of you all out there. Only the people who were really close to them and the killers know the truth behind all this. <br /> <br /> And for the end I just want to say for all of you Biggie and Tupac fans and family, these two men were and will be the greatest of all time, no matter how they lived their lives, but PLEASE, PLEASE, TRY TO BE BETTER, LEARN AND LOVE EVERYTHING, THINK ALSO FOR THOSE THAT YOU DON'T LIKE, BECAUSE AT THE END .. IT DOESN'T CONCERN HOW MUCH MONEY OR FAMOUS YOU CAN ACHIEVE AND HOW MUCH FASTER YOU CAN REACH THE PART SUPERIOR, ON ITS REALIZATION OF YOUR SELF, TO THE HIGHEST AND FEED YOUR SOUL, YOUR BODY AND MIND ... BECAUSE IF YOU WERE DONE, YOU WANT TO LIVE A LIFE EVEN AFTER DEATH !!!! PEACE AND LOVE TO ALL !!!! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, LEFT EYE, JAM MASTER JAY AND THE OTHER THAT MAKE A CHANGE IN THIS WORLD !!!!
