The film was a huge disappointment. Especially since it was directed by Priyadarshan, it was sad to see such gloomy standards. Little screenplay (almost non-existent) and sequences of songs with bad songs every minute and in the strangest moments killed any humor the film could offer. some scenes were fun, but they probably amounted to only 5 minutes of the entire duration. The assembly was pathetic. Dismal! overall the film is disappointed that the lack of stories has been all too obvious. In fact only a few people remained to watch the second half of the film after the break. <br /> <br /> Nothing would be lost if you don't watch the movie. It is not worth spending precious money on this film. wait until it appears on TV ...
