It is possible that A Man Called Sledge has suffered irreparable damage on the floor of the assembly room. Maybe someone will ask for a directorial cut one day, but I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> James Garner decided to cash in on the western spaghetti market and by doing so he brought a lot of Americans to fill the cast up. People like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And of course we have Vic Morrow who wrote and directed this film. <br /> <br /> Garner is always chosen as nice thieves because he is so good at playing them. But he played seriously and did well in films like Children's Hour and Gun Time. He can and has successfully broken his usual stereotypical part. But A Man Called Sledge cannot be considered one of his successes. <br /> <br /> He got the famous outlaw role of Luther Sledge with a big price on his head. After his partner Tony Young is killed in a sedan and Garner takes the appropriate Eastwood-style measures, he is followed by John Marley's sedan. <br /> <br /> Marley spent time in the nearby territorial prison and it seems that the gold shipments are locked up and shut down on a stop for people carrying the stuff in a regular run. Garner puts his band together for a robbery. <br /> <br /> Here is where the film completely goes off the wall. Action films usually show that the protagonists are facing a lot of methodical planning. Certainly it was the case of The War Wagon, which some other reviewers have mentioned. But in this, Garner decides to go to jail as a prisoner of the fake American marshal Dennis Weaver and cause a jailbreak in which the gold will be robbed. <br /> <br /> It was really too much to swallow. If taking gold was so easy, it should have been done a long time ago. But I will say for those who like the blood and courage of Italian westerns, during that prison break there is enough for three films. <br /> <br /> That's not all, obviously the outlaws fall and we have another gore festival before the film ends. But at that time the whole movie lost a lot of coherence. <br /> <br /> The great thirties singer Allan Jones is listed in the credits. But for the life of me I can't find it in the movie. Perhaps a choir from the Donkey Serenade could have improved it. <br /> <br /> I couldn't hurt anyone.
