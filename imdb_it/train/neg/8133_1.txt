The film is as fun as watching the sun. Sherif Pataki is a total retard who does not like doing anything better than sitting on his back fat making a smoke ring from his inflated cigars and drinking alcohol while the doctor behaves like a zombie version of Nicholas Cage sucks everything he calls "Blood", which actually looked like Fruit Punch. <br /> <br /> Most of these compliments seemed very horrible to even call this piece of shit a movie. The rest of the characters in this film are wasting time, the ending was terrible, the contours were poor, and the scenes were terrible. What else should I say to the spectators out there? My advice is to let your rabbi shoot if you've already seen the movie. This film can give you the foam in your mouth if you haven't got your most recent shots.
