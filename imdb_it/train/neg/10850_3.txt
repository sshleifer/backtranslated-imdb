This film has some things that go great immediately. Having Dani Filth as main actor will automatically make some people like this movie. I have to admit that I love Cradle of Filth and listened to the soundtrack of this film long before I watched it. Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and makes him a great protagonist. The film's independent shooting style is great for the disturbing factor. There are some GORGEOUS actresses in this movie. To be low on budget, even the special effects weren't bad. The ways people died were very creative and nightmarish. <br /> <br /> Now to the cons. There is a bit 'VERY chatting in this film, making it very little regarding the development of the character. It is difficult to fear for the life of inert and static characters. When there was a little talk, the F bomb was plentiful, popping up in random places. Yes, I understand that people swear, but it seems that a preteen boy wrote this and felt good about including the whole language. The plot, the one I could draw from it, was pretty good, although many parts are left dangling and the lack of conversation often leaves the question of what's happening. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cradle of Fear is like porn for people who love sex and violence, but like a porn that tries to pull out a plot, it just doesn't work too well. However, rent it if you are a morbid person who tries to satisfy your blood and meat appetite.
