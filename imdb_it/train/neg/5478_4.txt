With nothing better to do, I decided to take a look at "Aztec Rex" (how it was charged) for the fun of it. <br /> <br /> The stupid story could have sounded better if the effects of the dinosaurs had been convincing. In fact they looked like animatics (those rough drawings that artists later use to complete CGI effects, adding more details, smoother movements, etc.) Terrible-looking dinosaurs, which is the only reason you'll probably still want to go through this . <br /> <br /> The only saving factor was the adorable Dichen Lachman as Ayacoatl. He kept my interest; if only the budget had been increased and some convincing dinosaurs could have been used. <br /> <br /> Disappointing. At least the cast and crew had a free trip to Hawaii, where the film was shot.
