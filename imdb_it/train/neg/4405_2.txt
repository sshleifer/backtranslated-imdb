All I can say is that, before watching the film, I didn't have an indication of who Annemarie Schwarzenbach was or what her life story was ... and I must confess that the film was not very helpful in reaching these data ... and even failed to convince me to do some research by typing a few words on the google website; however, all I can say is that actress Jeanette Hain was very good at her dumb facial expression that she really played well and showed a mental state of deep depression, as in reality. <br /> <br /> After all, based the script of the film happened in Turkey, Tehran and Afghanistan .. but believe me to be familiar with the area, it was an Arab desert in Morocco .. The Turks and the Persian people are completely different in face and culture as well as in a language that is not Arabic .. <br /> <br /> I suppose to make a film like this - kind of documentary - a thorough research on all these minor elements is mandatory ..
