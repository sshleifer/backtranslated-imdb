The golden age of Disney cartoons was dying in the late 90s. This Quack Pack show shouldn't even be considered a DuckTales spin-off because the show barely had anything to do with DuckTales. It's about a teenager Huey, Dewey and Louie who create problems for Uncle Donald and talk in hip-hop parlance and are completely dressed differently than DuckTales. I prefer the adventurous little grandchildren of DuckTales. There are humans in Duckburg and the ducks are the only animals that live in Duckburg. There are no Scrooge McDuck references. Stories are repetitive, the plot is boring, but the animation is good. If you want a lot of slapstick humor, I recommend this. If you want a better Disney show, look at "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".
