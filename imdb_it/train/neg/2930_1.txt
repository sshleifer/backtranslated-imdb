I like British humor, I think it's one of the best in the world. I like almost all English sitcoms (okay ... maybe not Monthy Python, some of the lines were great, but some of them I don't understand.) But this League of Gentlemen is just something good to make you sick. This show was somehow good; it helped me lose weight because watching this piece of garbage makes me feel I'm not hungry anymore. This is just a disgusting, sick and even funny TV show, and I wonder who is laughing at these things. I watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off. It was so disgusting to watch men dressed in yellow teeth and urinate on the car ... I mean ... what's so funny about this ??? It makes me want to vomit. No humor, just scary pictures and shoddy toilet laughter ... I don't know ... if you like this stuff ... go ahead ... look at it ... but to be honest, people look and have fun this must have some emotional problems. Garbage.
