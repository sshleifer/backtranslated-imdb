I received this DVD from a friend, who took it from someone else (and who probably continues ...) The DVD cover also seems cheap, as does the entire movie. Gunshots and punches fight with delayed sound effects, some of the worst actors I've seen in my life, a very simple storyline, made me laugh until my stomach hurt! With very little financial resources, I have to admit that he seemed quite professional. Seen as a movie, he was one of 13 in a dozen gangster movies that no one is waiting for. So: if you're tired and want a cheap laugh, watch this movie. If not, throw it out the window.
