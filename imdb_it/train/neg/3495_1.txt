I saw an episode. Yes, I experienced all the miserable experience, and I must say that this comedy brand is one of the worst that can be achieved. Imagine Peter Griffin, famous for the Griffins. Now imagine Peter Griffin as a woman (certainly thin and without glasses), except that he now lacks something that makes him hilarious. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he doesn't know he's an idiot. Sarah does not have the true character, none of the acting skills to snatch her character. Perhaps it is banality, the formidable jokes that pull his play even lower than his character can take alone. Perhaps it is the lack of credible sheets. His insensitive, bigoted person can appeal to insensitive and bigoted people unlike the mass attraction that Stephen Colbert's insensitive and bigoted character has. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates a boring and annoying character. Something is missing that is necessary for the genre of satire, not to mention the whole world of comedy. What is missing from Sarah Silverman is obvious. And when you don't believe in it and don't identify with it, it's no longer fun.
