What a disappointment ... I admit that the best of the prequels, but the story is weak, the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of set pieces, badly made and put together Amazonally. There are numerous errors of continuity that clash gloriously with the original films, and the emergence of Darth Vader has been handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now a disgusting scum which will be ridiculed for many years. I am not complaining about the abyssal dialogue, since this is Star Wars ... the three original films had style, cult atmosphere and broken stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. The prequels were superficial attempts to earn more, and this lack of love shows itself in spades. Absolutely disappointing.
