When a film is independent and not evaluated, like the Hamiltons, I expected out of the norm, cut the violence to the heart. I know that good movies don't always contain blood and violence, but I read the reviews, visited the website and even convinced some of my friends to pay $ 9.50 to watch this terrible movie with me. When there's a festival called Horrorfest, I expect horror, not Dawsons Creek with incestuous nuances. My expectations were extremely low for this film, but the little expectations of the film were turned to hell once I saw that an hour had passed before we could see the first drop of blood coming out of the finger someone's. There were too many holes in the plot and left too much to the imagination. I'm sorry I didn't see Happy Feet. I think there could have been more violence and blood in that movie than in the Hamilton!
