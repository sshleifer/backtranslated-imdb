"Well, Chuck Jones is dead, let his characters add cheap explosions, an American style of" knock off "style and give them superpowers." "but sir? we are not all ready to have different shows in the works that are already so? let alone not throw everything on their creators' original dreams". "Yes! And those shows make us a lot of money and we need more!" "But will not all the women and children of every man, grown up with these characters in less time, get bored?" "you are right, do it in the future, make them all descendants of the original characters, and change all the names slightly ... but not too much though, we still have to be able to milk the success of the classics". <br /> <br /> Well, that's the only reason I can think about why this even exists. If you look beyond the horrific profanation of our beloved Looney Toons, then it looks like an OK show. But then there's already the teen titan, which is the same bloody thing. All the characters are dressed like batman, they drive in a sort of ship that fights super criminals, they have superpowers, the only difference is that they talk like Looney pieces and have similar names and character traits. <br /> <br /> This kind of thing falls into the kind of category "it's so ridiculous it's good". Think of the movie of Super Mario's brother and Batman and Robin. If you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons, check this out. If you are of the younger generation (what this thing really is meant for), and you can look beyond the shameless shameless managers, then run with it and have fun. <br /> <br /> If you like this comic I don't have a problem with you, it's the people who calculated this thing together that I'm angry about. You know how they say piracy is like stealing a car; this show is like stealing the grave. They could also have unearthed all the people involved in the original carton, pushed them onto a display, worn them in incorrect pirate costumes and paid money. If this show didn't use characters (the ones that didn't resemble those of Looney Toons in any way) that have already made millions in the studios, then it would be fine. But no! For the shame of the Warner brothers, for shame. <br /> <br /> If you saw this as a 30 second gag on an episode of Simpson or Family Guy, I'd love to. As it is, I can't believe this was ever done. I'd bet 80% of the people working on this show hate it. But whatever it does not matter, in 10 years this show will have been forgotten, while the originals will live forever or at least until the end of the world. <br /> <br /> "Coming 2008, Snoopy and the peanut gang is back, and now they have tremendous lasers and can become invisible! Can Charley Brown defeat the evil alien warlord Zapar? Tune and see."
