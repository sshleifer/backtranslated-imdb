A lot of running. A badly conceived adversary with very little complexity. A scientist who works in communication by sending signals into space and receiving them is captured by aliens. Together with his beautiful wife, he invades their territory and receives secrets about them. Become quite traitorous in the process. Of course, he is still given little choice. There is a scene where he gives them everything they want. This is a boring movie with a lot of long stretches in which little happens. The plot is not technically bad. It's just that we usually follow a car, a journey through a forest, investigating a building. This is what the assembly is about. I suppose the story does not technically support much more. Not much here.
