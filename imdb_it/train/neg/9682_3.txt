To overcome his wife's death, an old man does what anybody in his position would naturally do (at least in a Peter Greenaway movie): he and his son populate their home with eight and a half women (one without legs) and undertake a sexual odyssey. Being a Greenaway movie, there are a lot of pretentious and uninteresting blazons and, of course, there are unnecessary male nudity. In fact, the father and son share a bed sleeping naked. Lousy. Also, who wants to see an old frontal outfit? For those who are not in the homo-erotic scene, one of the women likes to play bad with horses. There is no story - just a random collection of boring scenes.
