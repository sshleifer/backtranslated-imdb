It is often said that films can never match the original book. Well, in this case, not only is the film not "good" like the book, but it is an insult to the book. I'd rather see Milan Kundera's novel set on fire this "something", which the director probably calls "adaptation". <br /> <br /> All the beautiful philosophy that asks "is it better to carry a heavy load? on your shoulders, or to face the unbearable lightness of being?" is put aside, and instead, the whole film deals of Daniel Day Lewis' sexual adventures (I can't say Tomas) with his silent wife, his lover and his other lovers. Fran√ßois Truffaut has already said: bad directors make bad movies. Don't waste time and money. Read the book instead, it's really worth it.
