I think it's time for Seagal to go quietly in the night. What I've just seen makes all his videos appear in recent years as his first 90s successes. <br /> <br /> A secret biological laboratory is creating a new type of drug that attacks a human adrenaline system to the point of becoming psychopathic killers or something. Somehow Seagal should stop the infection or it's the end of the world ... or something like that. Seagal has also participated in successful teams like jellybeans, every time I watched a new face was in command so it was difficult to follow the development of the character and I know that Steven's atsma prevents him from screaming out loud but even so because he is constantly coming nicknamed by people who don't play anything like him? Usually the film's plot and action sequences can save it from being a total waste of time, but this wasn't even close. Like I said, it was more like a horror movie with a lot of blood and stabbed shin rather than fighting straight. The problem was that it wasn't really scary and Seagal seemed completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have light-moving speeds, while Seagal 40-year-old 280 pounds killed them all by himself? I guess the highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes when the new recruits asked Seagal to come to the strip club with them. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
