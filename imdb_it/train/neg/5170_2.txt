Wow, it could have been such a beautiful film, Starts of with Brittany Daniels has tied up, I'm thinking we'll be back to flashback, but nothing, the movie starts all over again with the filming of the kids. Probably this film would have been better if it hadn't been for acting. I mean, the acting was mostly horrible .. Although with the jokes that the poor actors had to face I think they did the best they could ... It still really ruins the movie for me .. The twins were the only ones which seems to have some acting skills .. The film drags the allegedly shocking conclusion for a long time .. All in all I have seen worse films at low budget but considering that this was the uproar with the 8 films to die for I was very disappointed .. By the way , were some reviewers said there were gore and stuff like that. I saw the same movie .. Well, this is 4 out of eight, and so far only one has been good ..
