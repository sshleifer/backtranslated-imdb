I admit that, having come of age in the hippie age, I suck at this kind of film. I can enjoy a bit more of the hippie genus schlock than most "normal" people. However, this film is simply horrible in every way imaginable. <br /> <br /> Every trite perception of hippie nonsense is presented as a gospel, the cops kill long hair when they land a plane peacefully. This movie is so horrible that it's not even fun to watch the excesses of the hippie drone. It's like a left-hand version of Dragnet, except without professional actors. The only reason I gave two stars is because there are some obscurities of interest to the soundtrack, and I couldn't find a selection for negative stars. <br /> <br /> No actors, almost no plot, hello, barely a script ... you understand, an "artistic" film ... All this done to the root canal, which slowed the slowness, dragging out every scene meaningless just to fill time. <br /> <br /> bizarre twist to the art, the film's "nonactor" star joined a common in real life and robbed a bank in Boston, one of her co-thieves was killed and was sent to prison where he was killed in a suspicious "accident" weightlifting ... and just think, he got to leave him as an inheritance. Oy vey.
