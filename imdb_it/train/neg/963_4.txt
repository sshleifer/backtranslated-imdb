'Chances are a big mistake to see. You could meet the director Emile Ardolino of "Dirty Dancing" and "Sister Act" and you should expect something funny from him. But I guess I have to disillusion you. He made a really, really bad movie. <br /> <br /> According to the story, Christopher McDonald dies to revive as a child. The child grows Robert Downey Jr, and Jr returns to his old hometown where he meets his ex-daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson (complicated, eh?). They fall in love with each other. Then Jr's ex-wife Cybill Shepherd appears, and Jr. also falls in love with her. I guess I don't even have to mention that she loves Ryan O'Neil. <br /> <br /> In one of his first roles Robert Downey Jr is at his worst. He copies Michael J Fox. <br /> <br /> After the "Moonlighting" Shepherd shows that it is not suitable for acting in films. <br /> <br /> In any case, there is one thing that this non-entertaining comedy can be used: as an antidote to insomnia.
