Really a terrible movie. It is to be expected, however. Clearly a low budget: none of that is innovative, an actress (if you can call the one who plays "acting") who always has roles with nakedness in a shower scene, a man in a reptile suit almost modeled on a predator , a cabin in the woods, etc. But there are some points that save. Although the story is not new, for the most part, there are some parts that are not regurgitated. For example, black does not die when it is attacked (the first time) and is not even one of the first to die. But this is minor. More importantly, there is a very interesting twist with regards to Kat and Wes & Steve's experiments that I have not seen coming. When Steve told Kat to know what he did, I believed what he said and what Kat replied. But when the creature revealed who it really was, I was pleasantly surprised by the novelty of the revelation. It could be because of my lack of experience with the genre, or it's a really smart breakthrough. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is pretty ugly and I don't look at it if there's anything better on ... Unless you feel like a cheap scifi movie.
