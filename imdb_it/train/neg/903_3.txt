The 1937 "Dallas Star" with Barbara Stanwyck didn't exactly age well - as some thought a semi-updated version of the story would work now is a real headache. Perhaps they thought that jokingly, Bette Midler could do something with it, but this short story defeated her. Tracing a female bartender who has a child out of wedlock, and years later giving the girl to the rich father of the child so as to have a chance for a better life, cannot escape to annoying and antiquated feelings and traps. Midler works best with a director who can control his excesses, but this doesn't happen here; Stephen Collins is as impassive as the man who changes his life, but Trini Alvarado is well interpreted as Midler's daughter. This is what was called "a woman's painting", a basking, but it does not go unnoticed because it remains too faithful to its origins in the 1930s. * 1/2 from ****
