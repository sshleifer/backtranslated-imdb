Tony Scott destroys everything that may have been interesting in Richard Kelly's sickly, unpredictable script. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model who retired and became a bounty hunter. This is his story ... "sort of". <br /> <br /> The problem with this garbage is that there is not much of a story and Scott's extreme stylization of each shot acts as a distancing mechanism which makes us indifferent to anything in the chaotic life of Harvey. <br /> <br /> Just don't worry about Harvey. Knightley portrays her as a hateful and cynical brat who did nothing to guarantee our respect. He punches people he doesn't like and strips himself of his clothes and inhibitions when the situation calls for it, but it's not the least real and Knightly isn't even the least convincing. <br /> <br /> The film is boring. He's also strong and chained with one of the most annoying pieces of source music I've heard in a long time. The last twenty minutes are a terrible repetition of Scott's "True Romance" climax with the Domino band that will meet two series of fighting criminals who are - surprise! surprise! - Intended to shoot between them on top of a Las Vegas casino. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this potentially exciting conflagration is totally destroyed by Scott and becomes a confusing, pretentious, useless exercise in celluloid masturbation. This is not an artistically brave or experimental piece; it is a failure at all levels because it gives us no point of entry to the lives and dilemmas of its characters. <br /> <br /> Mickey Roarke looks as good as a grizzled bounty hunter, but disappears in the background as "narrative" progresses. Chris Walken turns into another embarrassing cameo and Dabney Coleman, always solid, is underutilized. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the multi-layered and dreamy surface of this film. He's still an asshole, no matter how hard it is to polish it.
