The entire movie Biker Movie must consist of the worst movies ever made. This offers lots of fighting, copious amounts of blood, motorcyclists fighting against Indians and a slum that is blown up and knocked down one cabin at a time. Acting is beyond terrible. What happened to Robert Walker, Jr.? At one point it was in some major studio productions, and then it simply faded away. This movie really blows, but if you haven't seen a Biker movie in a long time, it's a good thing to watch. At the end of the film, you should feel a little scruffy for having seen it!
