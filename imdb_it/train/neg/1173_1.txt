If I had only one machine accidentally glued to the floor, enough film for a single shot of each shot, and then I lost all that movie and had to make up some money to buy some digital videos, and was forced to make a film of over 2 hours on the French Revolution, and furthermore had no set and had to have my 4-year-old autistic son who painted the backgrounds, and also the only actors I found were the people who didn't. I did the audition of that soap opera. year, and I was also forced to not use any music in the whole film, and even the zoom function on the camera did not work except once when it started to zoom in inadvertently and could not stop, oh and if I hated the my audience, then I could do something like this terrible, but wrongly hilarious, wasted degenerate time. The almost grandiose but completely fake backgrounds reminded me of some of the latest George Lucas creations, which made it much more disappointing because throughout the film there was that little glimmer of hope in my mind that the film would have climax in a battle duel / space laser laser with lightsaber. I do not intend to spoil the film for those who have not seen it, but that is not how it ends. The only thing that comes to mind that has lost more time than watching this film was the writing of this review. Peace.
