Well. this was not a surprise. many people will tell you that this is bloody. but they are all talking about "shiztz", this film is very slow. <br /> <br /> Start with a boy who makes a mixture to not feel pain, he calls him "my son", there are some gory scenes, but I found them a little weak. you could even skip 40 minutes of the movie and get to the eyeball scene which was surprisingly impressive and disgusting. there are some really stupid scenes in this. and they quote the shots and slap with a stupid fake slap sound that makes me laugh! I would not recommend it. keep looking for fierce followers. <br /> <br /> look at this if you want the final scene of 20-10 minutes which is not so amazing and has a random scene like trying to rape his mother .. yes it's weird.
