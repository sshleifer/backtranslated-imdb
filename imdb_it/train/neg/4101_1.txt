this could be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. don't I see how it could ever be described as a horror movie, or even a thriller? it's more like a heavy drama. the scary music is EXCELLENT but since there were no scary situations the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities like making a dump or going down stairs. the film had so much potential. they had good cinematography (sp?) and interesting characters, but the writers seemed to think you already knew them. they would undertake special activities without explanation or even a clue as to what they meant. this is simply one of those films that says something and something completely different.
