This science fiction adventure is not the best and it is not the worst. I agree with the statement that bad science fiction is comic. The bizarre pink color and unusual special effects make it a favorite for late, late or late show spectators. Space explorers on the planet Mars fight against strange giant monsters like amoeba and other strange creatures. Very beautiful. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Make yourself comfortable and have fun. Don't feel bad if you nod for a moment. I agree with the addition of this to the list of cult classics not to be missed.
