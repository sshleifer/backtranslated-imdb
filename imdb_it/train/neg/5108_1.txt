I can't help but laugh at the people who praise this show as moving and tearful. For one, it's completely unrealistic that these people will have a perfect life after their new homes. <br /> <br /> How can these families afford to keep these new mega-homes? And their poor neighbors? Property taxes must surely increase after this happens. Also, the noise would annoy me. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how much can a reality TV show become excessive? It's practically the same repetitive garbage week after week. We are introduced to a suffering family, they renovate the house, then they surprise the family and all the boxes of Kleenex burst. <br /> <br /> Not to mention how boring the renovation part is. The only interesting part of the show is to see how the house looks, but even that segment is destroyed by false confessionals and continuous sobs. <br /> <br /> "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is a show that pretends to be sincere but falls flat. Skip this. If you like reality television, "Survivor" is far superior and moving.
