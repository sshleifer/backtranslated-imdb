These may be historical inaccuracies, but this film was too much. Virtually nothing was even close to the truth, and even for the era, it was considered foolish. <br /> <br /> In defense of the ford, it was revealed in an old talk show, which was working on the story as told by the real Wyatt Earp, who was obviously old, senile, and repeated the scene in his own way. Earp told the director about the diligence and how it was scheduled for the arrival of the stagecoaches, so, despite what historians claim, Wyat himself states that it was premeditated. <br /> <br /> This film portrays Earp as an honest man, as well as his brothers. History does not say exactly who they were or were not. Most people love to put a bit of deception and illegality in their characters, but that's not news. The truth is probably closer to them being the law-abiding type of GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL. Men who saw it as a career, and believe me, in the old West, you didn't have time to think about too much else. <br /> <br /> Characters that do not exist, characters depicted who die at the Corral who did not, all this makes this film a weaker film. It is further weakened by Mature, who actually did not make a convincing Doc. It could be the worst choice of cast ever for Doc, but at the same time we must remember that the older films were closer to the time and closer to a feeling for the truth. After all, Ford had first-hand information from Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> It is also weakened by all the predictable events involving the Mexican girl. Hollywood was very pro Nazi in those days, and ready to kill brown women in a very predictable way to show their support for Hitler's idealism. This occurs in most films up until the 1980s. It is not an excuse, and in any case makes art less interesting. <br /> <br /> The actors who play the Earp do well, and Brennan is always a thrill. In fact, Maturo could be the only negative aspect of this film. Still, it's the weakest of the old OK Corral movies.
