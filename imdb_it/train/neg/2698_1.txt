This film shows how racist John Singleton is. It portrays whites and other races that are not as black as the evil that exists in our education system. How quickly he forgets that it is the same educational system that made him what he is and failed. The character of Ice Cube is the epitome of a color instigator who was responsible for most of the violence in this film. Singleton hardly touched the relationships between the white and black characters who were trying to reach each other. When Omar Epps says "I need to be with my people", that racist remark deliberately spoke. And John, don't think for a moment that the image of Thomas Jefferson in the tower trumpet hasn't caught my attention. Nice touch!
