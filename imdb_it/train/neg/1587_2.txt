Maybe television will be a brutal day. Perhaps "Big Brother" was just the first step in the direction in which Stephen ?? Richard Bachmann` King described the end point of. Stop it. If I spend too many words talking about the serious subject of this film, I do exactly what the producers hoped for by choosing this material. Is it the same with ?? the sixth day. No matter how primitive the film is, it provokes a discussion on its topic, which serves the producers as advertisements. DON'T let us get caught by that. The social criticism suggested by that summary of the plot is just an alibi to make possible the production of a speculative and violent film, more for the sale of videos than for the cinema. <br /> <br /> I did not read the book. I don't dare to criticize Stephen King without having read it, but when I saw the film I thought they couldn't make such a terrible film from a good book: in a typical 80s set with 80s music and some minor actors Arnold Schwarzenegger finds himself as a policeman who escapes from murderers in a cruel TV show. The public is rooting. <br /> <br /> Together with Predator, this is definitely Schwarzenegger's most stupid film. 2 stars out of 10.
