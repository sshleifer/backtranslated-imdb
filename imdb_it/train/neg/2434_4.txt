Realistic film, of course, except that the characters don't seem to be afraid. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, he feels sick ... but it doesn't look like it. That's why I don't like his performance in this movie. Tom Berenger is playing a soldier again. No good thrills, realistic sequences. Not always shooting, this is a great thing. Well shot. I hate the helicopter sequence, because only a terrorist kills almost the entire sea pack ... I give him ** and a half to *****
