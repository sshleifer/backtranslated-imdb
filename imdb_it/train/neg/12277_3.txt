I found "The Arab Conspiracy" in a business basket and thought I had discovered a lost treasure. Folks, there's a reason why you don't hear much about this movie. The plot is muddy, the pace is slow, Cornelia Sharpe is as lively as the cold and simple tofu, and the finish leaves you flat. Not even Sean Connery can save this.
