Vulpine Massacre should have been the current title of this film. And the tag-line should have read "Guaranteed to make your children cry!" This is a natural drama that tells the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote region. Starting from the meeting and the coupling of two young foxes and the possible birth of a large family and the trials to raise them. The only talk is done in narration from a tree that is above the den, giving a view of the animals loves and lives ... Enchanting landscapes and splendid shots of the animals. Looks good huh? Well from there things go straight to the devil and then they start to pierce towards the core ... <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers Below - Or they could be a warning! *** <br /> <br /> Almost at first we learn that one of the foxes was born blind. But he seems to get along quite well and there is a beautifully cheerful soundtrack to accompany him ... And then he dies ... Then we have one of the adventures among brothers. And then he dies ... One of the sisters gets his time on the screen ... and then he dies ... And so it goes like a horrendous film while one fox after another is killed by nature, in traps, only up and fades away , and also from a group of snowmobiles! At the end of the film almost all the foxes were massacred. Fortunately, no deaths are shown on the screen. (At least not in the version we have seen.) Unlike "Tarka the Otter" the deaths in this film are almost all useless and border on sadism in the way hopes accumulate and then go out. One or two losses would have been acceptable. After all it is a natural film. But not nearly the whole family. <br /> <br /> Don't go and watch this tricked-out movie thinking it's safe for kids. Observe it with a certain awareness that things * are * going to go well and that you or your children might be very ill depending on how sensitive you or they are. You could have fun. Or you can't ...
