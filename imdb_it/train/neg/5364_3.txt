The complaints are valid, for me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed at women. I'm fine with these nightly soaps, like Grey's Anatomy, or Ugly Betty, or West Wing, because there are stories that are interesting even with the fact that they will never end. However, when the idea is parallel to daytime soaps that aim to put hunky men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Chris Lowell) in sexual tension and break, and in many ridiculous and difficult situations in a so-called small hospital, it looks like General Hospital ... or a female counterpart of Baywatch. This was what men wanted and they had, so if this is what women want it to be so, but the idea that this is a high-level show (or something that men will watch) is unrealistic.
