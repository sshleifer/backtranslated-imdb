Budget, decent actors ... who knew these things were important. Don't waste time with this piece of junk. The effects are disgusting. Acting is crap. The only thing that could have made it even tolerable was a cheap T&A that was squandered in the first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming quality, even remotely, of this film is the very embarrassing profanity. It was as if they found the only 7 people on the planet that they had never cursed before. Hats off! <br /> <br /> If you want to see a guy in a bad suit, go back and look at the pictures of the old dance. The only way for a Bigfoot shot is to have a big budget and some actors who didn't come from Frogballs Community Theater.
