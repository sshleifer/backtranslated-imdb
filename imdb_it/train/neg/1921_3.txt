For some strange reason the world of cinema is driven by fashion. Someone makes a film about a killer shark and suddenly the oceans of the movie world are flooded with giant squid, octopus killers and sea monsters of all kinds. A man is chased by a former lover of hell, so every character in the film is chased by a cop from hell or a roommate in hell or a babysitter from hell. Then, when a major Hollywood company produces a blockbuster full of tornado prizes and budgets, other film producers jump on the bandwagon, the fact that they don't have the budget to make it does not stop them. NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS is a case in point. What struck me about this film for television is the fact that it tries to hide the lack of budget by cutting off advertising breaks. Whenever a tornado appears, the camara gets stuck on the actors' horrified expression as they shout things like "Oh my God is heading this way" and "Run for your lives" then the screen fades to black to save the producers need the budget for special effects. Unfortunately the NOTTE DEI DUE VOLTI budget should have been increased to include better actors. The cast is not bad at all, but they are not impressive and lack the ability to bring a character-driven film. Where are Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them? <br /> <br /> And the last word on this is a TWISTER clone ..... Yes NOTT was released a couple of months before TWISTER but TWISTER had been for several months was the 1996 summer blockbuster and NOTT has a hurried feeling that makes me believe that it was created and published to link up with the clamor that surrounds TWISTER
