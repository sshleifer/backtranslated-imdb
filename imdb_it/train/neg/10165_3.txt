San Francisco is a big city with big acting credits. In this, the directors made no attempt to use the city. They didn't even handle the most basic details of realistic ones. So I wouldn't recommend it to anyone based on being a San Francisco film. You won't think "oh, I've been there", you'll be thinking "how did a trap for two floors / smelly armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby?" Some of the leads used speech styles and slicing on the east coast. Decreases, but acting has always been competent. <br /> <br /> The stories seemed to be filmed in three distinct styles, at least in the beginning. The history of Chinatown was the most effective and interesting. The plot is weak, a scene torn by Hong Kong-class action film. The originals had much more tension and emotional resonance, they were framed and stimulated better. But acting is fun and we see James Hong and other luminaries. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the white boy was useless. I think the filmmakers didn't know what to do with it, so they left it roughly structured and cut. The father is a strange attempt by a Berkeley liberal - really, folks, everyone knows it's not "groovy" to live in the ghetto - but his segments are the most fun. They have thrown away some good opportunities. Educated and embittered on the West Coast, a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they do in New York. They are equally intolerable but always distinguishable. It would have been interesting; it wasn't. <br /> <br /> The Hunter's Point intro was the most disappointing. He was the most derivative of the three, and stylistically the most distant from San Francisco. You already saw it and saw it do better. Even the video game was better! <br /> <br /> Despite the generic non-locality and the aimless script, these characters have potential, the actors have talent, and something interesting starts to make its way around the awkward direction ... about ten minutes before the final. Good idea put in the wrong hands. <br /> <br /> PS, there is a missing minority here, see if you can guess which one.
