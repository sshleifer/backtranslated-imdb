Why did I waste my money on this last day of Sundance? I want a refund ... Can I get my $ 16 back? While I was watching this movie I kept waiting for something to happen, nothing happened. The only way I knew what he should talk about was reading the plot, which wasn't quite like the movie. why did the director enlarge with their comfortable video camera and then zoomed in? It wasn't very artistic. Why did the director show Lulu that she filed her nails for fifteen minutes? Why does the actors seem to be reading when the actors tried to talk? Or was this the point? It seemed to me that Phantom Love had no story, and to be honest I felt like my friends' holiday videos had much higher entertainment value than this movie.
