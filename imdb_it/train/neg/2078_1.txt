I went to see this movie yesterday and although I didn't have high hopes for this film, I was still bitterly disappointed! Actually I can't believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this movie ... it was so bad !!! The plot was shameful and the acting was terrible (although it had big names like Uma Thurman). This film has relied heavily on its special effects ... but personally they have had no effect on me. I sincerely wished that the id had never looked at it and strongly warned everyone that they had not seen this movie. It's a total waste of money and in the end you'll be disappointed. My advice is to save money, go shopping, indulge, just don't go see this movie ... You'll live to regret it!
