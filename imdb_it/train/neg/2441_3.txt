I thought "Intensive Care" was pretty ugly and very unintentionally funny. But at least not as bad as I thought it could be. Sometimes it's a bit of suspense, but never a good shock. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD <br /> <br /> Fun is in ridiculous moments. But the classic moment of all time is this: Peter (Koen Wauters) is stabbed and beaten by the murderer. He's lying moaning in the corner of the corridor. Amy (Nada van Nie) kneels next to him and asks "Poor Peter, can I get you a plaster?" <br /> <br /> This film was shot in Dutch and English. To save money, all the license plates are USA, and the background to the study of the news is a Manhattan skyline. Very funny if you are Dutch and you are looking at the original Dutch version.
