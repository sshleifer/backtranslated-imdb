When I saw the cover of this film, the first thing I thought of was created for the video. The second thing that came to my mind was his resemblance to another terrible movie "Darkness Falls", the story of this stupid witch who killed people in the dark. Unfortunately, Darkness Falls was a true masterpiece compared to this pile of garbage, and this film should not have been made. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a little story for the witch, or, more like a useless presentation of two kids who are going to meet the tooth fairy in the hope that she will give him a new shiny bike for their teeth. The opening is badly filmed and, like the rest of the film, it's certainly not scary. In the present time, the film is about Peter (Lochlyn Munroe). Peter is renting his house and his ex-girlfriend Darcy (Chandra West) and her daughter Cole come to stay there. Cole meets a child from the neighborhood, and they talk about the tooth fairy, and how you shouldn't lose your teeth, or it will come for you. Unfortunately a few seconds later, it seems that the Tooth Fairy steals his bike and grinds out (how ironic). Will Cole will survive the wrath of the tooth fairy, and his mother and Peter will be able to save her and rekindle their romance ... this is a bad movie, you'll probably find out. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with this idiotic film is how indefinite the tooth fairy is. They say it kills you if you lose your teeth, but no. It's more like a serial killer who randomly kills, and if you lose your teeth, you're sure to leave. She steals a bicycle, so apparently she's also a thief. I said earlier that the idea for this film was based on Darkness Falls, but where did they get the inspiration for the appearance of Tooth Fairy? Let's see. She looks like a burn victim and previously went around the neighborhood to slaughter children. Hmmm ... it's almost like it's an exact rip-off of Freddy Krueger from the "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies. And this is not the worst part of this terrible mess, the climax is. This film could have the most ridiculous climax (it's not literally ridiculous because I found it more disgusting than funny) I've ever seen. Don't see this. <br /> <br /> Just a little curiosity. Lochlyn Munroe was in Scary Movie, and Jianna Ballard was in Scary Movie 3, and they were both in this, so apparently the movie Scary stars are forced to end their career with bad scary movies. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 on ****. 80 minutes R for violence.
