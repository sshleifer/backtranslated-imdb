I looked at it with my mother and we were like ... <br /> <br /> What the hell? We didn't understand it at all. I could be wrong, but a chair had something to do with the death of this woman's father. That movie was terrible! This is not a movie for those who love a good suspense movie. Bad suspense movie! * shakes the stick to the film * I will never see it again. And I'm also a big fan of life movies! They need to stop trying to make films out of books. He's making me crazy !!! <br /> <br /> And Whit was ugly yet, she loves him more than Hugh, who was a little prettier. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/10
