I usually like Loretta Young's first films: her acting was light and airy, and she certainly knew how to wear clothes. But this is just a loser, except for a fun turn of support from Glenda Farrell. Young is a hatcheck girl who talks to her husband-writer (Paul Lukas) and becomes a league bridge player. It is not the most cinematic of games, and the long and frantic central part where their marriage falls apart almost kills the film. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting bit though. While Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk start their game, a series of quick shots show planes, trains, football matches, even a diver in the air, frozen waiting for the event. It is the first use of a still image that I saw in an American film. I wish the rest was so inventive and fun.
