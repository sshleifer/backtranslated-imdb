When I saw the show for the first time, the first episodes seemed promising. Bill Compton introduced himself as the "mysterious" stereotypical vampire and Sookie introduced herself as an independent woman. However, the show went downhill from here and the once interesting characters are fun like a cardboard box. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, the main characters lose their original personalities, along with their acting skills. In episode 5, Bill's wrinkled eyebrows are so low that his face is just a forehead. Sookie, or rather the actress, is even more dead than her vampire lover. All these tragic events surround her and she reacts only to how pleasant it is to lose her virginity. Personally, I think they made the main characters sleep with each other too early on the show. The way they teased each other was something that had me hooked up and that could easily be played with a little more. As soon as Sookie loses, he struts like a total ditz, thinking only of Bill's libido and the size of his appendix. Bill also loses his debonair attitude and, well, he simply becomes silly. His actions are never really explained, except he does it for Sookie. Why? Their mutual love is never deepened, if there is love. So far it seems that sex is the heart of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, vampires are usually the same, but come on. Every five seconds I see some sort of humping going on. It wasn't a surprise, since HBO is always trying to pass a soft core porn like a decent TV show. Bill jumped out of the dust and he's only doing it with Sookie for no reason, what's the matter? I laughed so much that I almost peed. <br /> <br /> The plot is just a stream of consciousness. The characters never go into details of anything. All the events that happen are usually left unexplained. The only thing that is constant is sex. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say that I like are the minor characters. Tara and her drunk mother are much more interesting than the main characters. The only reason I keep watching the show is for the development of minor characters. <br /> <br /> Less the sex and the main characters of the show would be much more useful.
