This film, which was published directly on video, should contain a warning label that is dangerous to human health and can subject the viewer to terminal boredom. It is yet another religious film of "rapture", veiled veiled and evanescent, with the good boys (the believers) who suddenly vanish and that the bad (the unbelievers) have left behind. It is an interesting concept, above all because we see it happening on a flight headed by a non-believer who is having a sinful relationship with a hostess on board (needless to say that not even the sinner disappears!). Unfortunately, with all non-believing pilots, the plane did not fall or the film would be mercifully finished. Although this could be interesting without the heavy religious itch, on the whole the film that moves makes a gag, the acting is horrible and the simulations, obviously computer generated, are very fake. It is also another film shot in Canada that claims to be New York City. Save me ... I'll just read the Bible.
