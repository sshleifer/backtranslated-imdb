Considering John Doe apparently inspired by the creator of Kyle XY, I expected his pilot to be quite interesting. However I probably had too high expectations because I was quite disappointed. First they turned the protagonist into a monster who had the crazy idea to show his incredible knowledge in front of an audience, in a public area. So after that scene I started to fear that it was just entertainment. But the problem is that it got worse because none of the other characters was presented correctly. They focused too much on John Doe who made the story much less intriguing. I was also a little disappointed with Dominic Purcell's performance because I found out he wasn't a credible John Doe. Another problem was the police story. It really looked like a déjà vu and it was not a pleasant sensation. It leads us to the worst problem in the deck, the episodic format. I could already see the fillers one after the other. <br /> <br /> So overall I was very disappointed and would not recommend it to anyone. Considering how bad it was, I now understand better why the show has been canceled. Somehow I have the impression that he missed the target, developing characters to help the protagonist find his identity. It's sad because there was potential, like the people he met at the club. The quality of production was also quite good and the fusion was correct. But I'll never know if it's improved, probably not, because I'm not going to watch the next episode.
