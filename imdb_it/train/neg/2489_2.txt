STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> McBain (played by Gary Busey, before the name became synonymous with character in The Simpsons) is a (typically) unorthodox cop who gets results but angers his superiors about something rotten. Avoiding the clich√© of his partner killed at the beginning of the film, the plot takes a different turn and sees him assigned to travel to Mexico where a secret American super tank has been secretly introduced with incredible firepower and imaging capabilities. only to be taken hostage, along with the crew, by a gang of terrorists. <br /> <br /> This bizarre action movie (even by 80s standards) was a bizarre career move for Gary Busey after making an impression like the wicked-haired Mr. Joshua in Lethal Weapon. He has just made the movements with his cardboard character here, angular and crazy as always (with "Butthorn" which is his trademark for the bad guys), but without the material to support it. Henry Silva has his presence as a villain of the screen, but he is totally skeptical here as an Arab leader (with a red cap!) And the terrible script gives him very awkward lines of boring dialogue that make his performance a bit ridiculous as a stone. He is just one of the many actors in the action film, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who appear but add nothing to the mix. After a boring first semester without a very exciting action, things get up a bit at the end, but it's too little and none of them can be fun. *
