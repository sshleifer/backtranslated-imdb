I have seen many, many films from China - and Hong Kong. This is the worst. No, the worst was "Unknown pleasures". I saw "Platform" last night and thought that the other two Jia Zhang Ke films had to be better. I was disappointed again tonight. Tomorrow night I will not watch 'Xiao Wu' because I have just placed all three films in the trash! "Anyone who gave this film, the" platform "ten out of ten, needs to watch more cinemas! Photography was very poor: it was very difficult to distinguish between some characters due to the lack of close-up work. The plot was so bumpy that I quickly advanced it towards the end out of pure frustration. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Give me Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage every day.
