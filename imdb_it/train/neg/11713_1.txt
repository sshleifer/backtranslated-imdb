Just a warning ... This is the worst movie I've seen in years ... I couldn't see it until the end ... It's a pure waste of time ... I'm really sorry for Snipes who ended up in a movie like that . There's really not much to say about it. Horrible acting, incredibly bad lines, history, everything. The only reason I would recommend watching this movie is if you really want to see how a movie shouldn't be. Just to tell you a scene: the police are looking for Snipes, and they are surrounding the building with helicopters and cars, they are shooting inside the building, but they continue to whisper so that Snipes suspects nothing.
