It is rather impossible to imagine the producers of this appalling adaptation. <br /> <br /> A group of high quality actors, in the main cast (with a couple of noteworthy exceptions), who give enough performances. Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and equally good is Joanna Lumley in the role of Diana. Everyone does well with the scripts they received. <br /> <br /> So much for the good. The average would include the sets. Nancherrow does not look like the house described in the book, although the house they use for the Dower House seems extraordinarily similar. It is therefore clear that the Dower House is too large. In the later parts, the writers decided to bring the whole story back to the UK, presumably to save money, although with a little imagination I have no doubt that they could have recreated Ceylon. <br /> <br /> Now for the bad guy. The script It's such a terribly bad adaptation that it's hard to find words to condemn it. Edward does not die in the battle of Britain but survives, blinded. He makes a brief appearance so he commits suicide - why ?? Loveday has moved from the young woman totally in love with Gus to a sensible peasant wife who can abandon the love of her life barely a tear (less emotional than Brief Encounter). Gus, a man in love and passionate, is ready to give up his love without complaining. Walter (Mudge in the book) moves from an unfaithful unfaithful husband to a devoted family man. Jess is transformed into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won't talk. Aunt Biddy still has a problem with drinks, but now without any justification. The Dower House is occupied by the army for no apparent reason but a very brief scene with Jess being afraid of armed soldiers. While Miss Mortimer's breasts are absolutely delicious, I could not see how their performance on several occasions brought the plot forward. The delightful Nettlebed becomes the banal Dobson. The word limit prevents me from continuing the list. <br /> <br /> There is a sequel (which I lost all interest in looking after this nonsense) and I wonder if the changes were made to create the next story. It is hard to imagine that Rosamunde Pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of his book; presumably he lost control when the rights were acquired.
