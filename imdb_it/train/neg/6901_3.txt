The most positive thing I can say for this dull "comic" production is that it is harmless. In fact it is so amazingly insipid that one wonders how many dozens of rewrites the committee has had to get such a complete removal of the personality. It's not funny, it's not funny, it's not insightful and it's not fascinating. It is only a progressive, without laughing, the progression of four losers who have to change their ways - and their attitude towards women - in order to participate in their best friend's wedding. <br /> <br /> With acting that would be a local amateur theatrical company, a plot so tired as to make a fourth season of "Allo" Allo look fresh, and humorous jokes like looking at rotting vegetables, Sione's Wedding still got ten nominations (yes 10) in the New Zealand film awards recently. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, someone made sense and won none.
