Boring fantasy of children that gives Joan Plowright the stars of the stars but little to do. The children of Sappy pursue their dreams. Frankie wants to be a dancer and a baseball player (yuk) while her best friend runs for mayor --- she's 13 years old! Totally pedestrian in every way, in addition to the added disadvantage of the syrupy performances of girls and baseball boys. Certainly a minor effort for Showtime --- no limit?
