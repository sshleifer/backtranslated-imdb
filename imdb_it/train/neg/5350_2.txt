Yes, we're talking about bad sequels. Rick Moranis is the star of this horrible third sequel to "Honey I Shrunk the Kids", a fun and entertaining time. The concept basically plays the same way as the first film, but with adults instead of children being restricted and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to be explored. If you think this may sound interesting, think again. The film is at best boring, at worst. <br /> <br /> First of all, the continuity of the series was completely discharged into the toilet. The only remaining actor of the first film is apparently Rick Moranis. The actress who plays his wife has changed, the actors who play the children have changed, the ones who play the neighbors have changed ... you call it. They try to make us believe that this is the same family, but the results are nothing short of disconcerting. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the story is a rehash of the first, with not a minimum of originality. All the jokes (and almost all of them) and the dangerous situations presented in the film are copied directly from "Honey I Shrunk the Kids". <br /> <br /> Third problem, the special effects. I'm sure this was done with a lower budget, but they are pathetic, much worse than those that appear in the rest of the series. You should be in awe of these little figures exploring the huge domestic area, but you'll probably end up creating yourself most of the time. <br /> <br /> Fourth problem, identifying the action inside the house is just boring. Only a few things happen and when they happen they are not at all electrifying. The first film was fun because children deal with nature, grass and insects that live in it. In this case, adults (who appear rather boring compared to children) deal with dust, a cockroach and a trap for cockroaches. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> I don't know why the idea of ​​releasing such a trivial sequel to the already moribund series attracted Disney executives, except perhaps because they needed to cash in without spending five minutes thinking about something new. I warn you: leave this meaningless garbage where it should remain: dust on the store shelves.
