Well, you know the rest! This must be the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had some bills to pay when she assumed this role. <br /> <br /> The main role is played by (for me) a complete stranger and I imagine to disappear into oblivion right after this turkey. <br /> <br /> Bruce Lee led the martial arts charge in the early 1970s and since then the fighting scenes must be based on martial arts or at least brutal if street fighting techniques are used. This film uses fast cuts to show martial arts, however, even this cannot hide the fact that the woman does not know how to punch. An 8 year old child would have taken her aside in this projection. <br /> <br /> We are sorry, the only mystery on display is how this one did not win the golden raspberry for the year it was sold.
