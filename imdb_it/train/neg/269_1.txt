After seeing the first ten episodes, I have to say that this show sucks. <br /> <br /> What bothers me most is that the show was shot in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but they should have shot it in California, so we could have done scenes in the desert. He would have been more faithful to the film. The first scene in which I am out in another world is in the mountains, with many pines where it seems cold. This does not feel very Egyptian. What worked so well in the film is that it seemed to be in ancient Egypt. Here it seems they are running to fight the aliens in a Canadian forest. And it is so disgusting that, in all likelihood, the fall comes on other planets. You can see the leaves on the ground in the forrest that look like forrest outside of Vancouver. It makes the show even more incredible and stupid. <br /> <br /> And then there's Richard Dean Anderson. He is not Kurt Russel. Of course he does a decent job and tries to copy Russels' performance a bit, but he's not as cool as Russell. And he's not as good an actor as Russell. And the way Russels played O Neill, well he was much more cynical. Andersons O Neil, it's too soft. I liked the fact that Russels' version didn't suck and had no trouble blowing up the bomb until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks really does a good job as Jackson though taking over from James Spader. <br /> <br /> Teal'c is a really annoying character. He is Jaffa. Not a Jaffa. Only Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! A former bodyguard of a pathetic character of Ra, seen only in the pilot and in another episode so far. Teal'c speaks and behaves like a robot. I saw Jean Claude Van Damme perform better. <br /> <br /> And the fact that Teal'c and the character of Ra and the people they saved in the film, can suddenly speak English is also incredibly silent. What made the aliens so scary in the film was that they spoke an ancient language and that they were real monsters. <br /> <br /> As for the special effects, I'm really good at the pilot. But the very rare effects in the real show are badly made and seem cheap. Especially a planet they visit with crystals. It is so obvious that they walk on a stage with a poorly painted painting in the background. It is an insult to us viewers who have made it so cheap. Especially when they could have done it in front of a blue screen with CGI backgrounds. <br /> <br /> The X-files had the best effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993. It had been 4 years before the SG-1 started. And they didn't have the apparent budget of two million dollars per episode, which supposedly the SG-1 had. They must have spent all the money on catering. Because I don't see it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Incredibly boring and useless show, which could have been fantastic if they had made the show in Hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and characters.
