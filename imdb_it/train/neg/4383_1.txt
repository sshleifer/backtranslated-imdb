Bob Hope's worst comedy (and this includes strong competition). I hope, on an island with sailors, dreams of being in a bathtub with a geisha girl "driving her ship". Someone has certainly guided this braggart of hope over the cliff, as it presents Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida and still fails to make people laugh or excite. Where is Bing Crosby when you really need him?
