I mean, I thought I heard this dialogue in the movie, but it was so ugly and out of place that I can't really believe it. I was laughing so hard for what was supposed to be the worst writing and acting in human history, I was seriously worried that I might have a heart attack and die right there in the theater. <br /> <br /> So this is the scene I'm talking about, the "hero" just watched his brother crash and his brothers car exploded just a few meters from him (the hero). The "hero" was launching the expected "adaptation" of seeing something so tragic and people were trying to keep him from running into the burning car. <br /> <br /> In the midst of his crisis and his uncontrollable emotional rage / depression he says "I'm so sad" - he said right? I'm crazy?
