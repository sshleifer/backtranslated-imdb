STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal past, had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that makes him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife Valerie (Kathy Burke) who tries to keep the family together but ends up going out as a doormat. Meanwhile, his mother Janet (Laila Morse) is aware of Ray's son Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his growing drug habit that is sending him off the rails. The film follows these desperate characters as they cling to their lives. <br /> <br /> It is said that the English seem to enjoy being unhappy and that they include watching movies that entertain them in this way. Movies like Nil by Mouth highlight this. It's the story of a family destroyed, torn by crime, poverty, alcohol and drugs, the kind that Jeremy Kyle would have torn up as a three-course meal. It is also essentially a story of self-destructive men, three generations apart and each one copying the other, breaking up a family and women trying to keep it together, despite not being strong enough. If you collect a little of what is outside the set, you can see that it does not promise to be cheerful from the beginning and certainly does not disappoint in this. <br /> <br /> It's true what everyone said about the performances, and the protagonists, Winstone and Burke, did a great acting. We see Winstone losing him with his wife, beating her senselessly after some cocaine-induced paranoia, knocking her down during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of fateful words when she refuses to show him her son. Likewise, in a private moment, we see Burke skillfully losing his composure on a scale, the full impact of the night before starting. <br /> <br /> This is another one of those films in which there is not a "plot" to follow as such, just a feeling of real life of these hopeless lives that continue from day to day . He was hailed by many (including the Baftas!) But it was really too sad and dark for me. I have no right to criticize him for this, knowing what I knew from the set off, but unfortunately that's how I found it. **
