A decent animation and a functional character development keep this animated DreamWorks horse fable at least watchable ... however it remains a bit slow and the plot is a bit stupid. It is interesting to see an inversion of the typical cowboys and Indian roles, but here it seems only a nod to political correctness rather than a fair decision on the plot. GRADE: C
