What did I just see? I spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. The concept of a clown serial killer is actually pretty scary since there are a lot of people who are afraid of clowns ... but having a 300-pound nursery rhyme that says the clown killer makes a mockery like that. I'm still wondering how the character Mark failed to escape from the Clown ... he has 300 pounds, he must eventually get tired. The whole ending made me stand up and literally say "What did I just see?" Apparently Brandon is Denise's cousin ... and they made it close to the middle of the film, which means he had sex with his cousin ..... yes, it's something that people want to see so * chills *. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found incredibly stupid was the opening scene in which the clown stabbed a woman and she said "What did you do?" Well, what do you think I just did? The last thing that was stupidly funny was a second in which the main character was slapping the hitchhiker and calling her ac * nt and then 5 minutes later saying that violence does not help anything ... the writer of the script gave the joke to the wrong guy? However, nothing about this film makes sense. <br /> <br /> The film was more or less a silly low-budget movie that I was sucked into buying (all 3.99) and had no entertainment outside of the sex scenes. I'm surprised the fat clown didn't join the orgy, he would adapt well. I was hoping the movie had some entertainment value like the other B movies could have, but I was wrong. This is a piece of junk that doesn't even deserve a visit. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10
