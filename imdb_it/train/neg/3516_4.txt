There is no doubt who is in charge of cadet training in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in creating a new type of soldier from his cadets - the bomber. But it is not so rigid as to be unfair or hostile. In fact, he also changes his opinion about the value of women working in the army. It's tough when it needs to be, but other times it's a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he has perfected in other films. Its character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves. O'Brien seems natural in the role, and sounds fashionable. Two things help this film: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular special effects that end.
