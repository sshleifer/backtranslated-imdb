Peeew this stinks! As everyone knows, it is based on some Geico insurance commercials; what nobody knows is WHY?! Those advertisements were fun at first sight at best; just forage for a series. (The talking Geico gecko - this is another story. Now it would be an intriguing series!) And why the ABC - as reported by the press - actually agrees to purchase the rights of caveman from Geico for this? After all, the idea of ​​cavemen struggling in the modern world is not exactly unique to TV; Phil Hartman had a recurring role on Saturday Night Live as The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer over a decade ago. And that's how a concept like this works better - like an occasional bet. But a regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (A 1960s series called "It's About Time" also used cavemen in the modern world concept, lasted a season.) <br /> <br /> One of the directors of the show, who was also in charge of the commercials by Geico, it was Recently I said: "We were so excited when we were shooting our ads because we thought we had something that was really unique and we had bigger stories to tell." Mistaken. <br /> <br /> In the annals of bad TV, this is set to take place next to the "Me and the Chimp" of 1972 as one of the worst of all time. The main actor in the misunderstood Chimp fiasco went into hiding out of shame after association, after he was abruptly canceled. No doubt our caveman friends will follow suit.
