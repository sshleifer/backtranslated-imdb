Oh Lord. This movie ... It was horrible. I'm a big fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies that other people say are bad, I like it. The actor who played "Scarecrow" was fantastic, I'll say it. But this plot was terrible. It didn't make sense! At the beginning it was a scene of sex too gore and useless (and revolting). I think the director was trying to be "shocking" or whatever, but he just came out of his mind. To add to the pile of crap they called a plot, the actors (in addition to the "scarecrow") are horrible, and I worried so little about them that I soon forgot who it was. In conclusion, this film made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie anyway, please do it.
