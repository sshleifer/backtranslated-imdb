LOC could have been a very well done film about how the Kargil war was fought; it had the locations, the budget and the ability to have been the "Saving Private Ryan" or "Black Hawk Down" of India. Instead he runs into a boring, 4-hour boredom trying to merge the war move with the Masala movie. Even the war scenes were terribly executed, using the same hill in all their battle scenes, and spending unnecessary time in random speeches. Instead of trying to appeal to the Indian public, a better film would have been a report on the book of what happened in Kargil (like "Black Hawk Down") or even spending time on the militant point of view (like "Tora Tora, Tora "). Even better, he could have used a competent director like Ram Gopal Verma to write, direct and edit the film. Until then, I'd like to see someone re-edit this movie, with only the relevant parts included; would make the film more watchable.
