It is clear why the producers of Scary Movie have found it so easy to spoof these "teen slasher" films. They are so incredibly formidable. And if Valentine had been released about a year earlier, I'm sure they would have spoofed this movie - it's that if they found original material to distinguish it from Screams, I know what the poor summers did, and Urban Legends. <br /> <br /> Valentine offers nothing new to this genre, except for a better than usual ending that obviously leaves a lot of room for the avoidable sequel. As always, a masked psychotic killer chases a group of beautiful young women, killing the main character's friends, one by one, generally over the best style. A lot of T & A on display, no character development, bad acting and excessively elaborate bloodshed. <br /> <br /> The thing I can't stand for this kind of film is that they call themselves "who made her?". The fact is that they are not because the reason is revealed only after the "The killer has unmasked and tells the protagonist that all his friends have been killed. Usually something that was never made clear during the film (for example the fishing buddy of the uncle of the main character's mother kicked the dog of his friend's father.) All are still alive throughout the film and are "suspect", but they are more "Red Herrings" than suspects. As we all know at this point, the main character runs an implausible escape and kills the killer psychopath not masked after the reason has been revealed. <br /> <br /> Valentine followed this formula almost to the letter. *************** SPOILER !!!!!! ( mini spoilers in any case) *************** On Valentine's Day the reason was not revealed, but more, left to you to think given that the film did not end in the typical adolescent way. The problem is only a resolved part and the goal of the main killer may or may not have been achieved, surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everyone. Will the killer want more, or have the demons really been defeated? <br /> <br /> This has not yet made Valentino a good movie, instead it has simply saved him from being as bad as usual, which still does not count for much. For anyone thinking of making another movie along these lines, please don't do it. Originality is so important, and it is difficult to see the originality that comes out of this genre.
