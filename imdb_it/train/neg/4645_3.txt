Belmondo is a tough cop. He deals with a big drug dealer (played by Henry Silva, normally a great criminal - see "Sharky's Machine", but here he is clearly nicknamed, and for this reason he lacks his usual charisma). He goes to the darkest places in Paris and Marseille, asks for some names, beats someone, takes names, goes to more scuzzy places, asks for more names, beats up more people, etc. The whole movie is punch after punch after punch. It seems that the people who did it had no other ambition than to create the French equivalent of "Dirty Harry". Belmondo, who was 50, does good tricks at the beginning; apart from those, "Le Marginal" is a violent, episodic, banal, superficial and forgettable detective film. (* 1/2)
