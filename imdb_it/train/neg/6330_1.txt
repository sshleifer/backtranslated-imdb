If you like the original SNL cast and shows, avoid this movie at all costs. When it came out for the first time, my friends and I waited in line for over an hour to enter a sold out cinema. in the middle of the film the theater was empty 3/4. We refused to leave thinking that it would improve. At the end of the film we were the only ones left in the theater. The film lasted only one day in all theaters, so it disappeared from view. In interviews with "Mr. Mike" he refused to comment on this film. The film was a joke about SNL episodes that came out immediately after the release and closing of the films in one day. We all tried to contact "Mr. Mike" by phone and email to get a refund but they were totally ignored.
