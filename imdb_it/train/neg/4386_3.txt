with a title like this, you know you don't expect a great horror movie. But this was really bad, even with low expectations. The plot is really offensive and stupid: an escaped criminal wears a Halloween mask, so everyone around him thinks he is someone else. this joke could actually work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not during the whole movie! the actors are not so bad, but their characters are rather stupid and the story is boring and absolutely stupid. No suspense, no excitement and little blood (very cheap). Satan's little helper tries to combine horror (...) with comedy and fails dramatically in this. It became so boring towards the end that I actually stopped watching 10 minutes before the end. I couldn't worry about what happened. Amanda Plummer was very good at Pulp Fiction, but come on ... it was 13 years ago, and after that she did nothing decent. So it's no wonder that you had to sink as low as this piece of shit .. Avoid or be warned ..
