Adrian has just emerged from the asylum, he is rich and without parents, his life seems empty. One day he meets Gonzalo, a poor boy whose mother is a prostitute. Desperate for earnings, Gonzalo helps Adrian look for her life and who her parents are. This is a film by a new director, and it is perfectly clear in most of the film: incorrectly directed scenes, somewhat forced dialogues, some inconsistencies in the script ... However, the ending is unexpectedly well done (well, just a bit) and this saves the movie a bit. The actors are known and of great quality, however, they are not inspired enough to make the film interesting; everyone has made better cards in other films. The film is boring and you will probably spend most of the time thinking about how much time will pass until the end. Obviously there are many worse films, but, of course, there are many better ones.
