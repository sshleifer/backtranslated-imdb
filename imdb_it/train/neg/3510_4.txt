I saw this movie recently on DVD and I have to say that I was not impressed. I know that it is taboo to beat independent films, but this was lacking in entertainment. <br /> <br /> The premise was interesting, but the execution of it was insufficient. I found myself thinking "okay, they are only inside, the story will soon resume". Before I knew it, the film was finished and the story never recovered. I can't say I found the acting equally impressive. It was pretty bad. It's not the Star Wars trilogy, but it's still bad. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what the execution time is, I assume two hours (because it's a safe estimate). However, when the film was finished, I felt like I deserved some kind of recognition for the willpower I exercised in not stopping the movie and leaving halfway through. <br /> <br /> Once again, I was completely indifferent, and eventually bored by my wits. I'm not one of those guys that requires frantic action and explosions in a movie, so don't start with me as it's a reason I don't like it.
