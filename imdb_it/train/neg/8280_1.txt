Watching this, I mainly noticed ad placements. DHL, Aquawhite Strips, Rockstar and more. It is a placement of products after another. It is quite obvious how this film got its funding. Jessica Simpson's "acting" is ridiculous. Any Dick should never work because he plays the same lame character. The "story" is just a background for this very long spot. I can't believe this film was considered for theatrical distribution. The longer you watch this movie, the more embarrassed you are for everyone involved. The only small thing that saves is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, who has almost no screen time as Jessica's cousin. I'm embarrassed that I looked at it all. I would recommend avoiding this.
