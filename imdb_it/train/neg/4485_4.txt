It seems that in Sci-Fi you have this periodic return to the past to perform a strange phenomenon that appears in long serial novels. It is here that the first novel (Dune, Ender's Game) takes you away with a revolutionary story full of action. The sequels, however, take that universe and guide you along the path of the garden to any new small social or political comment that the author wants to make. Matrix is ​​finally the cinematic equivalent. Matrix is ​​tall, alone, like an interesting film with a strange twist in the middle. Seeing this cash cow sitting there, and eager to explore other aspects of society, writers and directors guide you through SciFi's monologues and non-painful sequences. While the images remain astonishing since the first films, the new character explorations fall terribly flat in the sequel. Look at the candy with your eyes open, not for a deep thought. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, as recorded by this beautiful website.
