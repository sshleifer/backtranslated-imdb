STUDIO 666 (aka THE POSSESSED in the UK) is another sub-par slasher that looks like a straight-to-DVD movie. <br /> <br /> While many of the straight-to-DVD movies are fast-paced or unintentionally exhilarating in the ugly sense, STUDIO 666 is a regrettable failure. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing, any comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review. Each of these people hit the nail in the head. <br /> <br /> The two people (at the time of writing) who wrote comments with a score of 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously. Obviously they have seen some slasher movies and have an even more limited understanding of horror. <br /> <br /> The only really positive point I can make about this film is that it is better than THE CHOKE and ONE OF THEM, two extremely mediocre slasher movies that I wouldn't want on my worst enemy! <br /> <br /> The plot of this film must have been made hundreds, if not thousands of times. The film has only a slight turn (and a badly managed one) to the usual expectations. A depressed singer commits suicide. Shortly thereafter, his spirit returns to owning one of his surviving friends. The aforementioned friend makes a homicidal revelry. The rest of the plot is really too bizarre to summarize. You just have to see it by yourself, as long as your interest has not yet dropped to the point of extinction, of course. <br /> <br /> Acting in the film is very poor for the most part. The actress who played Dora was an exception to this. His character was always interesting and seductive when he was on screen. It helps to elevate the film above similar contemporary efforts. Unfortunately, some of the phrases that she was given to say were poorly written to put it blandly and thus prevent her from saving the film. <br /> <br /> The direction was equally poor. The bad guys didn't seem the least bit threatening, every kill was totally devoid of suspense or tension, the atmosphere was non-existent and the work with the camera was incredibly simple. Some of the special effects (if you can call them that) reminded me of the TV series, GHOST STORIES. Unfortunately for the producers of this film, GHOST STORIES intelligently wrote scripts, credible performances and made superb use of camera angles. Perhaps if the producers had followed the TV series closely, they would have collected other techniques that could have saved this excuse for a movie! <br /> <br /> The music is completely unsuited to the tone of the film. It's just rock music and not the best examples of this type either. Don't let me start on that horrible song played in the beginning! <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film, particularly dialogue, are unintentionally funny. Unfortunately they are not funny enough to move the film (or should be down) to the level so good. <br /> <br /> Overall, STUDIO 666 is a trivial and mediocre slogan with little noteworthy aspects. I recommend it only to those who are fans of straight-to-DVD movies and want to see every single slasher ever made.
