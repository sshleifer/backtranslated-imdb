I saw this movie last night (about 102 minutes) and I don't know what kept me in my place. I guess I expected a movie with Gere to have had some value, but nothing of value on screen has ever occurred to me. History is a stupid excuse to accumulate on strike after slavery and torture. There is no character in the film who does anything like real life. The cutting "style" is based on jumps, mini flashbacks and overprinting to give weight to this disastrous installation of a band of sadists apparently fleeing for years and SURPRISE the leader is the "victim" of a executed killer. I don't see how Gere, a Buddhist, was involved in this violent and sexist transgression.
