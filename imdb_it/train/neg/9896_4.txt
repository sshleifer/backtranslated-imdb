The DVD version consists of 2 episodes, Caesar's patricide is the conjuncture. Moreover, the language was Spanish without subtitles. So, it's hard for me to go into this film because I don't understand what was said. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra is a historical icon, the part is very difficult and I found it for a newcomer, Leonor Varela sounds good. It is strong-willed, but also a very tender and supportive soul mate. Thimothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect and their love story is the main thing of the first episode. Therefore, it is not really a documentary, nor a peplum but a great love story. <br /> <br /> After the parricide, a new lover arrives (Marc-Antoine) but the taste is finished: we always remember our first love. Thus, I found the second episode boring and their tragic fate was not told forcefully. <br /> <br /> However, the production is luxurious: the sets are large, tastefully decorated; the exotic live Moroccan location and gorgeous closets. Manufacturers certainly have a lot of money, but they don't spend anything for special effects. They are so poor (blue screens, ships, Sphinx) that it's fun. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would very much like to hear it in French or English to give a final judgment on these two films.
