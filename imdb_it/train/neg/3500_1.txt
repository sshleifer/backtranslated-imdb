Can we say delayed? This girl has no talent like never, nothing but complete trash. People are marking only 10 stars because you know that most people hate this pathetic woman, if it's such a "big" show then why was it canceled after 6 morbid episodes? Exactly. The people who support it, please seek help to NOT know what's fun. His comedy standing is so stupid, seriously, how do you find this funny garbage? The show tries to make fun of stereo types and other things that aren't funny at all. Carlos Mencia is fun and because of that stupid poster, he actually has fans and his show is on the air, so I'm sorry you're a redneck who doesn't understand his lines. Please give me back my 20 minutes of my life.
