From time to time, someone out of the blue looks at me a little to the side and asks "What is it with SNITCH'D"? I immediately know that they have a case of fun + barely concealed horror. See, I was the director of photography for the film. <br /> <br /> Let me clarify some points regarding this "interesting life experience". <br /> <br /> Originally, SNITCH'D was called UN HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July 1999, one day after setting up TRIANGLE SQUARE, a great 35mm feature that like so many indie features of the time was never released despite the festival awards ... it fell eternal victim of the fine print of the notorious SAG contract of Experimental Feature. But I digress ... <br /> <br /> Even though I was on a roll, and when James asked me to shoot his little 16mm gangster movie with a shooting budget of around $ 25,000, not wanting to slow down , I took it. After all, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI ... I too believed in the myth of that time. <br /> <br /> Let's face it as a "film school" for many involved, including myself. SNITCH'D was shot for two weeks in August 1999, in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, California. Cahill taught Drama in a high school in the latter city (yes, he is an acting and English teacher ... he thinks that while watching the film, or even observing the use of the apostrophe in the title), hence the places and the cast. <Br /> <br /> Of note in his cast the only dramatic appearance of Los Angeles weather girl Morning 2, Vera Jimenez, and of greater impact, the debut of Eva Longoria, who had just arrived in Hollywood and he was eager to have a movie under his belt. I must say that his professional dedication, his concentration and his "Let's do it" attitude inspired me and was a forerunner of his celebrity-yet-to-come. <br /> <br /> SNITCH'D suffered from poor optics, few lights or electricity, several boom du jour operators and delivery of an incorrect offline duplication. None of this obscures the real content, which speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> However, in 2003, the film was sold to distributors (at a net loss, I understand) that inexplicably had no photo of Eva on the box (at that point it was a rising name, working) but who managed to get a clear picture of what appears to be a genuine Latin gangster to lend credibility to SNITCH'D. Given that Cahill's other passion is the antiquarian book trade, he seems to confirm that he believes he can, in fact, judge a book by its cover ... as many have collected this DVD based on its cover. ----------------- A year later, Eva, now with a soap, and I met James for a day to shoot a simple short film he had invented, SPLIT SECOND, which I think that I've never seen any game despite the intent of the festival. <br /> <br /> 6 years later, I was hired to shoot another Cahill movie called JUAREZ, in Mexico. I thought he had worked out the process; my participation was subordinate to the casting, the script and the control of the crew, and the resulting film seemed really promising in the newspapers, for what it was ... an economic detective that surrounds the mass murders of girls in Juarez; despite the claims here and elsewhere, the film has NEVER appeared in any festival or venue, although Cahill has repeatedly stated that the film is distributed and was simply awaiting release concurrently with the release of two studio photos on DVD same subject, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and CITY OF BORDER.
