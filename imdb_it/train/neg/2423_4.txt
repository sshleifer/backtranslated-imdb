I took this film from a private collector and I was very curious about it. He had a 7.8 in IMDb (only 9 votes) and some external comments were nice. But I must say that it is a very common and uninteresting yellow. Yes, excellent photography, the film is well directed, but it never scared me. It starts well, but even if it doesn't bore me at all, the story is so ordinary and the things that happen like this normally, that I didn't like very much. <br /> <br /> You can have a few laughs. And you can see small breasts. But if you like the kind of yellow that I like (weird, surreal, senseless, bloody, atmospheric, brutal murders ...) you won't really like this movie. <br /> <br /> I give him a 4 for good direction and editing and final turns that make the movie fun. But it could be much better.
