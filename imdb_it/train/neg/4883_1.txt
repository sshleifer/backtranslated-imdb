During the cheap video clip of Crazy Fat Ethel II, I wondered if it was the same movie that was on the cover. Unfortunately it was. The story itself is incredibly simple. Ethel, a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder, is released in a halfway house due to hospital overcrowding. She is by far the healthiest resident watching as one man puts dead flies in another's soup. Ethel is then teased by one of the employees of the halfway with a chocolate bar after it has hit the cost reduction measure for feeding the residents' dog food. Ethel retaliates by strangling him with an iron noose on the stairs and then ... well, you understand. If all this sounds fun, it's not. This film was poorly made with economic effects and even worse acting. The characters are so wooden when they deliver their lines that they should be in front of a cigar shop. To make matters worse, half of the film consists of flashbacks of the first movie Ethel, Criminally Insane, which is a little better. A VERY poor effort.
