Renowned writer Mark Redfield (as Edgar Allen Poe) tries to conquer old addictions and start a new life for himself, as a magazine editor in Baltimore, Maryland. However, blackouts, delirium and rejection threaten to hinder his efforts. He would also like to rekindle romance with an old love, a significantly imperfect perspective, as it turns out. Mr. Redfield has also directed this dramatization of the last mysterious days of Edgar Allen Poe. Redfield employs many black and white photographs, in color and a trick to set the mood. Kevin G. Shinnick (as Dr. John Moran) behaves well, relatively speaking. Is not enough.
