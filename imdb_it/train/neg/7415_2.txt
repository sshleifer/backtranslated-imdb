What is the name of a horror story without horror and history? <br /> <br /> This is the most annoying thing about the movie: I have the feeling that the writers have never really decided what's going on in the movie! It is a different thing to know him, give cues to the public and not reveal him completely, but here, one has the feeling that the writers do not know it, the characters in the film do not know it and the public sees that nobody knows! (Remember "Cube"? That film also knew more about itself.) I have consumed many horror / gore movies from the 1980s and this film definitely has deep roots in those films. But many important things are missing. We really don't know anything about the characters. They keep repeating blank lines over and over again. History is not really developing, it never goes anywhere. B-acting is OK in this type of horror film, but there's not much to play in the script. We don't care about the characters. There is nothing to remember about them. There is not even humor or unnecessary sex. And above all - no thrills, no thrills. <br /> <br /> You only have a few commonly used elements of the horror genre. They show the Lord monsters one by one, but their characters don't really contribute to the story. <br /> <br /> I honestly believe that this amount of history, character development and atmosphere can be achieved with a minimum amount of crew members and equipment. Oh yes, filmmakers did it - and more - about 20 years ago! I felt the shared embarrassment of the public at the end of the film. Too bad indeed.
