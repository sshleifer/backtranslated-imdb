"Whipped" is one of the most terrible movies of all time. It's a piece of petty and hateful junk that forced me to stay in the theater more than any other film of 2000, apart from maybe "The Grinch". It is not, as people have called it, a perceptive portrait of modern relationships. That would be a little movie called "High Fidelity". While that film was honest and understanding, "Whipped" is hostile, cynical, misanthropic cinematic poison. Avoid this like so many plagues, unless you want to see how much a really bad "comedy" can have.
