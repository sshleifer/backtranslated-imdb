This film is a long list after another. First of all, even if they did their part, there's an unjustified drug scene in which John sniffs the grass like an idiot. Wigs and accents are terrible. They look worse than the old Beatles cartoons. John is the wicked, envious, homosexual wardrobe, Yoko's slave who is portrayed in the discredited book of Albert Goldman. They even continue to spit song titles into a normal conversation "it was always just the Two of us"! Not even John would have been bad with his fans. As his death showed us that he was too cute if nothing else. The only funny scene is one in which a stupid Beatles fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul's Yesterday. An insulted John says something like, "Of course, and while I sing because you don't get on your knees, put your wife's wig and lick my liggin." This made me laugh for days. Really this movie is fun in the way it tries to be serious as it comes out ridiculous. Even John and Paul did not sit down to pontificate all day, they were witty and tender-hearted boys who broke up even during the Beatles, where he was played much nicer. Forget about it.
