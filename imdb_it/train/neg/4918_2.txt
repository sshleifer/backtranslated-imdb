A wealthy Harvard boy falls in love with a poor Radcliffe girl to the great consternation of his stern father (Ray Milland). <br /> <br /> Syrupy, sugary and above all, the sweetened story of a "class" battle when the rich child, Ryan O'Neal, brings home a librarian's servant for his snobby parents to ridicule. Ali MacGraw is the social derelict with a dirty mouth while John Marley plays the devout-Catholic father, but nobody in the film is more annoying than O'Neal himself with his whining portrait like the Harvard yuppie champion. <br /> <br /> Followed 8 (!) Years later by 'Oliver's Story'.
