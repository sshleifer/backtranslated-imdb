What begins as a pretty clever farce about a slightly shady security monitoring company turns, almost instantly, into a mystery of uninteresting and completely inane murder. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci try powerfully to make this train wreck visible, but some things are not humanly possible. <br /> <br /> What, for example, makes Gale suddenly turn from a sweet mother figure into a drunk screamed at Tommy's parents' house? Why did Heinrich, even if he admitted a lot of things, want to destroy the business to which he dedicates his life, stealing and perhaps killing his customers? Because Tommy, apparently reasonable, believes that Heinrich could be a murderer (based almost entirely on a dream), and even if that were credible, why shouldn't he go to the police? And why didn't Gale activate the alarm when she returned home, especially after scolding Howie for leaving? Of course, all these events are necessary for the plot (and I use the term very, very vaguely) to explain. And it could be forgivable if it brought even a minimum of comedy. But everything, from Howie's description of his date rape, to the wrong identification of Gale's coroner, to the last "joke" on Gale and Howie who are still dead, is more bland and pathetic than anything else. <br /> <br /> I ticked the box indicating that my comments contained "spoilers", but there is nothing else that I or anyone else can do to ruin this thing that already smells in the sky.
