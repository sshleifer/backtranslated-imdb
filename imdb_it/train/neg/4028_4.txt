This had all the prerequisites for a great film - good actors (Robert Loggia, Ellen Parker), a good storyline (the mysterious missile from space threatens to burn the planet) and a lot of archive material (if the Air Force had a rocket launch movie was used). Unfortunately, it is ruined by too many melodramas and an impossible timeline. <br /> <br /> The film is about a space missile attacked by the Soviets and unintentionally diverted into a low atmospheric orbit. At less than five miles and at a speed of over 4,000 miles, it emits a discharge of one million degrees, burning everything on the ground, including glaciers, the bases of the Distant Early Warning (DEW) lines and the Eskimos. <br /> <br /> Any attempt to destroy the missile fails. <br /> <br /> The first defects of this film appear soon. While we don't expect much from low-budget films, some things can't be forgotten - like a little research. For example, both the Soviets and the United States launch anti-ballistic missiles that are on the missile with infallible precision. However, the first successful ABM tests were not carried out until March 1961 by the Russians. <br /> <br /> There is too much melodrama. Dr. Loring (Lodge) and his assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) interpret their love with as much wood as a log cabin. Parker's character cries and bla-hoos at Loggia's sacrifice as if it were at an audition. Loggia is as heroic as a bored businessman. A scientist (Phillip Pine) sums it up so much that William Shatner looks like an actor. A bus driver continuously spits out end of the world poop in one scene after another. The only good actor is the narrator of the film, played by veteran lead actor Lawrence Dobkins ("Naked City"). <br /> <br /> All this could be overlooked if it were not for the chronology. After the missile information was sent to Washington, the Pentagon brings together a group of scientists. A general (Larry Kerr) announces that the missile will hit New York City in 63 minutes. After this, there are discussions between scientists and there is a deadly pause when ambassadors are asked to try to understand if the missile is an attack by the Russians and if a response is needed. <br /> <br /> The film shows the army is completely scrambled. The people of Civil Protection leave work and go to their posts. Eight million people rush to take refuge in shelters while school buses gather millions of children (and we see the whitest New York I've ever seen, even though watching 1950s science fiction movies made it seem like this was the standard). The print is kept in the dark for tens of minutes. Then, incredibly, a man in the Pentagon announces that the missile will hit Ottawa, Canada, in 51 minutes! All the above action took 12 minutes! Then, to add fuel to the fire, Loggia somehow thinks of a way to stop the alien missile. It slowly produces a load of plutonium, loads it into a jeep and takes it from DC to a distant missile base to put it on top of a missile. Along the way, he is thrown off the road by a wild driver, breaks and is then kidnapped. Eventually he retrieves the plutonium and guides it to the base to arm the missile. Again, all in the same 63 minute time frame. <br /> <br /> The film also annoys the viewer by making it seem as if Ottawa could be saved, just to show men, women and children roasted. The missile is said to have five minutes to reach New York. Loggia is still driving to the base (4 miles more). He reaches the base and arms the missile, then a two-minute countdown is announced. All in five minutes. The districts of New York should have been burned at least. <br /> <br /> By the way, the missile is destroyed if you have not guessed. The ABM warhead destroys it with a massive plutonium-based nuclear explosion. Five seconds later, the explosion dissipates and everything is clear. Yes, they caused a 100 Hiroshimas nuclear explosion on the outskirts of New York City and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The film had all the elements necessary to be a good B movie, but it wasted them. Loggia played his character so little that you didn't care that he sacrificed himself in the end. You didn't care about the other characters, not even the ghostly scientist played by Pine. The tension that should have shifted the film only long was not physically possible in the time line allowed (it would not be even today, not even with Jack Bauer). <br /> <br /> This movie is very difficult to find. As far as I know, it has not been republished on any media and for good reason. I don't know if the film had to be or if it was a standard practice, but there is a scene in which the government sends all the best scientists, soldiers and businessmen to deep shelters, saying they are too precious to lose. There is not a single woman or minority in the group. Hari Rhodes is the only black man in the film and plays a little soft playing a piano. It was worse than "27 days" in which a stranger gives five Earthmen the chance to save or destroy the planet and he does not include blacks or Hispanics. <br /> <br /> I saw this on a special night on Turner Classic Movies and I don't expect it to show up again. If you find a copy somewhere, you could put it on Amazon.com.
