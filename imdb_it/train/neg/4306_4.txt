There's a good thing about this movie: Lola Glaudini's ass! I'm sorry to be so blunt but it's the truth. Too bad he didn't make a nude. At least it would have made this mess tolerable. We see another girl's tits, but she's not close to Lola. And friend, Armand Assante is old or what? Man looks like crap! "Consequence" is the usual B movie you would expect. History had potential. It's like they have good ideas but they didn't know how to do them. Cinematography is simply horrible. Ugly! The direction is not inspired and the end result is a bland thriller with twists and washed actors. Lola Gaudini is as big as the fox in an economic and slutty way, but not even she saves "Consequence" from being junk and not from garbage, simply old and smelly garbage.
