What a terrible movie, TERRIBLE! One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I usually love movies like this, everything "A guy meets an eccentric woman he likes, but happens to be already involved with someone, which is not suited to him ....". I was expecting something predictable and I didn't mind. Movies are always fun, mixing the right dose of romance with comedy, but not this one! Every single line falls flat and "romanticism" makes me want to vomit. The title character is one of the most "please kill me" characters I've ever seen on my television, the "eccentric woman" is not very eccentric, more bizarre and annoying. The "other person" is the most reasonable and mature person in this film, but it's just as annoying. This movie sucks, there is no way around it, don't waste time.
