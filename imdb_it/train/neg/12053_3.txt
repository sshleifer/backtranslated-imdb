as always this is an inexact image of the homeless. The TV told many lies about beggars in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad, and claimed that we all made over $ 100 a day when $ 20-40 a day was much closer to reality. when someone drove from where I held a sign that offered work and offered me work, I actually went to get the job if I were physically able. And if they'd offered me the damn $ 100,000 id invested in prepaid for at least 2 years, and kept most in the bank and still left me $ 10-20000 for NL $ 1-2 and $ 2-5 cash games at casinos. Usually he always wins and I could win decent if I had a bankroll. instead, I win about $ 1000 a month, everything is playing in the minimal purchases, for not wanting to risk losing everything. I was just homeless because I didn't want to risk spending all my money and going broke, sometimes I had over $ 1000-2000 in my sock while I was sleeping outside. anyone who wants to talk to sevencard2003 contact yahoo messenger.i admit that I was different from most homeless people, also because I never drank smoke or drugged. I am no longer homeless, I am now in Govt Housing for $ 177 a month and I get SSI and spend most of my time winning at online poker. Diversified mother and sunflower worked hard to get me SSI. I'm glad my days spent hiding under the stage of the casino convention center, sleeping at night, worried about being caught by security are finally over. if this TV crew had chosen me, it would have been much earlier. it is a pity that they do not choose better who they choose.
