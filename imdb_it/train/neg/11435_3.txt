I wish I knew more about this movie when I rented it. I'd line it up based on Heather Graham and her strong credibility as an actress (IMHO). While some parts of the film were fascinating, much of the film felt artificial, undeveloped, or at least simply boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people who think that the brothers were a couple ... I don't care how big a part of the plot is, it still felt a little um ... gross. And Charlie, for a zoologist, certainly doesn't seem very sympathetic to the signals of other Homo sapiens. What was it about her (besides her warmth and some common interests) that made Gray fall in love with her? The story could have been much more interesting with a little more depth. Highlights - Molly Shannon (although I agree with the review that found her annoying on some occasions), the drag driver and the dance sequences (if Sam & Gray were such great dancers, I wish I had seen more , as the pieces they showed us were really better than most of the rest of the film). It could have been better
