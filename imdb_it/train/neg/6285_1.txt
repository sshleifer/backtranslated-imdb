Horror movie ?? really ???? I can't believe how bad this movie was, what's the point of this movie ??? the movie almost 1 hour and 30 minutes and the first 70 minutes of it, it's just the pace that walks around with this stupid look on his face after he had an accident ... he didn't talk at all at all, not even many actions. I must say that in the last 20 minuetti he had little action ... and he was still stupid ....... and in the end oh my god, I don't know where to start, he also ends up with this stupid look on lena face lol .. do not get me wrong I love Lena Headey, I think she is a great actress, but I don't know what it took her to make this movie .. don't waste time and watch why this movie doesn't have a story, it has no acting ... and it doesn't have meaning ... not to mention how slow this film is and you seem to be watching it forever.
