(This is a review of Disney's next English edition, with Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart and co.). I really wanted this movie to be good. Really really. I'm a big fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the brilliant reviews on this previous Miyazaki movie, I was eager to see it. But I was shocked, shocked, at the quality of this film. Those subsequent films boast well-made plots, three-dimensional characters and the best film music to ... well ... never. This movie simply doesn't come close. <br /> <br /> It could also start with the positive aspects, though. Like all Miyazaki films, this is still very imaginative, with a bizarre fantasy / science fiction setting, in a post-apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species. Nausicaa can also boast an animation far superior to other films of her time. (although not as nice and fluid as the subsequent films of Miyazaki) And the English vocal acting is quite well done. <br /> <br /> But this movie ... just ... it's not ... good ... The characters are all cardboard - from the sweet little Nausicaa, to the ruthlessly evil Tolmekians, to everyone else. Once you've seen them for 30 seconds, you've seen everything there is. And the fact that the plot continues to run doesn't help. <br /> <br /> Then there's the music ... Now, Hisaichi is undoubtedly my favorite film composer, but Nausicaa doesn't do it justice. Half of the music is the keyboard of the 80s in overdrive, and usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the graphic rather than helping it. I suspect that Hisaichi was told to compose a lot of music before he even saw the photo. <br /> <br /> But wait! There's a nice message with this movie, isn't it! We all save the environment! Too bad this movie hits you in the head like a mallet. There is a scene in which Nausicaa embraces a tree. No, really. I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> It makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this movie is. But for some reason all the other reviews on IMDb seem to love it. And when the characters have to talk at length with extended sentences to tell you what's going on, it's a bit boring. <br /> <br /> If you're the kind of person who loves souls, enjoys the music of the 80s and plant a tree every day Arbor, you'll probably like this movie. Otherwise, save your money for your next films, because they sound great.
