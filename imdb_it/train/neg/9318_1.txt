This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Once again I made the mistake of buying the film because the synapse on the back looked very interesting and the cover was also very nice (after buying this and the "Malevolence" movie I reviewed here, I learned my lesson). I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm. This presumably takes place in the Texas woods, but it was probably shot in the director's yard. Production was probably the worst I've ever seen. The actors were absolutely WORST. The story had nothing to do with what the back cover said. I even tried selling it to F.Y.E and another "mom and dad" store that buys used DVDs and neither would take it. Here's how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was. I've seen some bad movies before (Troll 2 for example) but this one definitely takes the cake. I didn't think there was a worse movie than "Troll 2". Boy was I wrong! Don't buy this movie unless someone gives it to you for free but even if you haven't blocked it unless you throw it out which is what I'm about to do !!!!
