The story is a little slow and a little stupid. Greta Garbo doesn't look very good and I couldn't understand half of the things she said because of her accent, which was exaggerated for this role. Melvyn Douglas, meanwhile, plays his normal and far-fetched role and Constance Bennett is so-so except for a couple of her screams, which were funny. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Roland Young had the best role in the film. I wish it had more lines, as it disappeared in the second part of the story. Furthermore, it was interesting to see Ruth Gordon looking so young. I had only seen her in those crazy roles she played from the late 60s to the 80s and a crazy old woman. As for the story, the best part could have been in the last few minutes when we see a stuntman doing amazing things on skis, pretending to be Douglas falling down the slopes. It was a fantastic and fun movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can see where this film - the last of Garbo - was not a box office success. Drag too much, keep talking about deceptions. It's a boring story. Garbo also knew it and interrupted it.
