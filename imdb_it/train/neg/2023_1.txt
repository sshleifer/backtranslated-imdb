As the summary says he just made the most ignorant comment I've ever heard about a role-playing game. Did you seriously think they were gay? Are you retarded? If you went to save your best friend and someone decided by the goodness of his heart to help you, then you are indebted to that man. Lavitz was a good person and every time they helped each other they made them closer as friends. They were not gay lovers like your complaints. And to let you know that the game is set in a period of medieval time. At that time, women simply prepared meals while the men fought. Do you know your story? Do you know how long it took for women to be accepted into the army on this day? This game contains a lot of realism even if your too damn slow obviously to take it, and you really need to spit out some solid proof instead of ignorant hypotheses based on your misguided act to interpret the story.
