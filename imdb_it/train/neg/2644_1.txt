The Sentinel represents everything about the absence of Hollywood soul and the sad lack of imagination present in so many movies these days. I can't think of a positive thing, it's all so generic, so manufactured in the factory and so lazy, that in reality it only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting and unsuspecting public. <br /> <br /> A plot about a secret service agent planning to assassinate the Prez could be fun. Whether run by a good director or an attentive cast that is. Douglas is the one who is framed. Basinger is the First Lady, with whom she is having an affair (an unresolved underdevelopment). Sutherland is the best friend who believes his culprit because there would have been no film if he hadn't. And Longoria is nothing. A woman with a Maybelline fortune and ... that's it. I imagine there are fewer requirements for women when entering the secret service. As usual in a film like this the role of the Prez himself is nothing but a tool, a token and is written very badly. <br /> <br /> Clark Johnson, the one who gave us the equally pathetic SWAT In 2003, the mechanical management lacks any kind of signature and has all the visual refinement of a cheap TV movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland seem incredibly bored and engaged by telephone in their performances from afar. Eva Longoria, the most overexposed woman of the 21st century, is basically just this way to attract the audience of Desperate Housewives. His role is 100% useless and does absolutely nothing to encourage the plot or add to the character's development. He barely has 2 lines to rub together. A truly shameless marketing ploy. <br /> <br /> If you are a glutton for punishment, then don't let me stop you. But it's time and money that you won't come back.
