This show had pretty good stories, but a bad dialogue. The main character was particularly annoying. It's pretty obvious why this show was canceled, even though, like most UPN shows, I never knew it had ever existed until it was re-released in syndication. <br /> <br /> Most of the plots seem to have been copied from other shows and films, leading me to think that the producers didn't have an original idea in their heads. <br /> <br /> I haven't commented enough. You must have at least ten lines of text. The special effect was not bad for a 2001 show. <br /> <br /> The gnome was a nice character.
