I should have imagined that any film with the Poltergeist diva wouldn't be good. In reality, everything starts ok, but during the scene of the first murder, you find out that the movie you're watching is a movie inside a movie. There are people sitting in a cinema watching that movie. A girl in the audience is so annoying that I would have turned and strangled her. A bit strange, but far from good.
