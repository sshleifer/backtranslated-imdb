Except for the recognition of some beautiful photography, I can't say anything positive about this film. The only real problem is the protagonist's dilemma whether to stay with his childhood friends in the world of poverty or leave them and resume their lives. Abundant "emotionally powerful" scenes do not go with this plot and, due to bad acting, fail to create the desired atmosphere. The director only manages to introduce Anthony's dilemma and ultimately brings an easy solution. The characters don't seem to evolve, although it's difficult to talk about characters ... maybe except Sonny. Beside him, the actors fail to play much and when some of them have to do it, they come out as self-inducing amateurs. I wonder what the film has ruined the most: the superficial script, throwing away all the potential of the plot, or bad acting, disturbing any appeal that could be left.
