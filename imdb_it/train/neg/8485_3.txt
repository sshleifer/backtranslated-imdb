From the horrible scenes of death to the guns that shoot without emitting sounds to a character called the Demon. It's all tiring, slow moving, without imagination. It was OK to see the boy with the cape and the hunchback lurking around. Visually it was disturbing and probably occupied the viewer of the time, but even in 1936 one would have thought that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude even for a film like this. I just kept waiting for something to happen of any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting like they were posing at an office picnic. And then there are those bullets as mentioned by a previous commentator. Perhaps the best clue would be to look for a point of water on someone's trouser pocket.
