I found the glacial rhythm and the original story was gradually out of proportion to the content. My wife slept for the most part and I didn't try to wake her because I felt she didn't miss anything. <br /> <br /> When Holmes and Watson enter the house and are therefore potentially caught, it is not clear how it could hide all their access and burglary tools so quickly. It is not clear how the study door is blocked, preventing the servants from entering. <br /> <br /> The thing that baffled me was just at the end when there was a gleam in the eyes of the broken statute. I have no idea what he should have represented.
