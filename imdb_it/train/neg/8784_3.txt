The idea was fantastic, the actors were incredible, the story could be very scary, but the writing was scarce and there was no depth. I couldn't really get into this movie. I could not perceive the characters, there were many cliffhangers and the film ends strangely. Was it a happy ending? I do not know. Was it a sad ending? Again, I don't know. The theater is left unfulfilled. The film had so much to give, but could not. Just because you can edit, doesn't mean you should, right? I really wouldn't recommend this movie because you can't say that you left the movie as if it had been completed. You will only be confused. Trust me, you'll probably thank me if you don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
