**** ATTENTION: here there will be spoilers **** Why waste my hurry to escape years looking at the garbage in this way? This film is an impressive collection of clich√©s, bad writing, worst direction, and so we have not yet arrived at acting. <br /> <br /> And of course, you can predict the whole story from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Hero expert, he fights against stupid, corrupt and incompetent henchmen. An avalanche explodes, burying all the heroes who somehow manage to get out alive despite all the dangers of the cliffhanger. Corrupt partner who caused the whole thing to fry alive along with his money. Second avalanche heroically deviated from the adventurous expert of the renegade expert. The evil henchmen eventually turn out to also have a heart. A troubled teenager falls into the arms of her stepmother after being rescued by her. Etc., etc., etc., etc., up and away it goes. <br /> <br /> Indeed, there are few reasons to notice spoilers. You could probably work on the whole plot if I gave you the basic ingredients. At least, I wasn't too large from the brand most of the time, anticipating what would happen next. <br /> <br /> And then we didn't discuss factual errors. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous commentator that although there are usually some redemption features even of a bad movie. it would be difficult for you to find someone in this. I suppose I gave it 2 out of 10 for some nice scenery shots, but that's all. <br /> <br /> It's been a while since a movie made me moan, but that certainly did.
