Once again I took the opportunity and rented this shit bag. Presented as a horror film, there was not a scene, not even one that was even remotely frightening. NOT ONE !! Of course, there was a bit of nudity, but all the lesbian actions became a little old. I guess maybe that would be the saving grace of this movie? And Dan, what a nuisance! From the beginning I knew I was in it when good old Dan spoke for the first time. And he had to be intimidating? What a laugh !! All in all, this film is terribly terrible! How the hell are movies like this? If you want a movie with some thrills, don't rent it. This film is as exciting as the Teletubbies.
