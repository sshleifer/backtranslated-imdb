In an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by parody as Scary Movie and Shriek if you know what I did last Friday 13, Valentine fails. Why did people like Halloween? Because it was original, new and went beyond anything ever made. Why did he like Scream? Because at least it made sense. Valentine is just a stupid slash-flick who has almost nothing of what ever. The plot is so similar to Halloween and Urban Legend is not fun. And the moment the killer appears on the screen, you know who it is, it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooooo predictable. The teen slasher genre is DEAD Get over it! <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10
