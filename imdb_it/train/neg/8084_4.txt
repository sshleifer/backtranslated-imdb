I chose this title from a friend who had included it in his comprehensive DVD / Video / Laserdisc collection, so fortunately I didn't have to pay for it in person. I had the impression that it would be a bad movie, but I KNOW what a bad movie is after seeing the grown-ups as children should not play with dead things and incredibly strange creatures that have stopped living and become mixed zombies , and now there's really nothing to write to me unless it's terribly ugly. <br /> <br /> Solar Crisis is bad, but it doesn't reach that sore point of absolute pain that some films are. <br /> <br /> However, the general plot is that the sun is going to unleash a huge solar glow towards the earth that will essentially destroy it. To counter this imminent threat, humanity has gathered a spaceship and a crew whose job is to fire an antimatter bomb (which the opening describes as "the greatest explosive ever") towards the sun, which through some shocking ghosts logic will make the glow explode at a different angle, leaving the Earth unharmed. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter that what I just described to you sounds like a bad episode of the original Star Trek. Even with an ensemble cast (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle and Jack Palance), Solar Crisis can barely manage that level of mediocrity, thanks to a storyline that starts out simple, but becomes increasingly absurd with the passage of time. <br /> <br /> The crowning glory of this film debacle is the addition of a bad character (played by Boyle) who insists on sabotaging the mission. Through means that are never explained, he sends an evil servant with an embarrassing ugly haircut to exercise a sort of vague electronic mind control over the genetically engineered space staff scientist, played by the female lead Annabel Schofield. Why is he sabotaging the mission? Because from his moralistic point of view, he believes that the flare will not happen and that when he does not, he will become fabulously rich because he has dug his evil claws into the stock market. In fact, you have a villain with the most absurdly stupid imaginable motivation. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film becomes incredibly complicated and develops very slowly, over time taking advantage of the use of characters that have only vague or unnecessarily short roles in The plot. I could sit here and explain in detail what happens to prove the absolute inability of the writer to make a plot that actually clicks or draws your attention, but I'm sitting here writing this review on Microsoft Word and I know for sure that this would take three pages and I could only lose your interest. But again, you would probably get the same effect from watching the movie. <br /> <br /> However, the film is miserably mired in an extremely poor dialogue. Imagine if all that happened on the Star Trek Enterprise was that the characters spewed sci-fi jargon back and forth with each other. Yes, I know, they do it already, but imagine if that's all they did, and that they used that jargon to create vague and almost meaningless scenes that don't produce excitement, tension or interest in the viewer. <Br /> <br /> This is best exemplified when a character in a Zero-G environment screws a bolt on a metal box before proceeding to cry in agony for a couple of minutes before suddenly exploding. The script previously alludes to the character who risks an explosion, but does not bother to give a solid answer as to why or how this happens, or why it cannot escape. In general, you have a sad cross between the bizarre and the ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Then we have several scenes in which the dramatic accumulation leads to nothing. Jack Palance's performance is wasted on a character who serves only to guide the hero boy (not to ask) in the desert, before being mistreated and killed by a pile of seeds. On his deathbed, Palance finally tells our boy his surname (while wearing a horrible livid trick job that makes it look like someone put a balloon under his eyeball), which he was previously silent about. Colonel Travis J. Richards. The boy repeats it silently after its expiration, giving viewers the impression that the name has a meaning later in the film. Perhaps the character of the grizzled admiral of Charlton Heston knows him and the plot will then advance once his name is repeated. Something. Everything. <br /> <br /> No. Sorry. The hopes you will have will be dashed when this moment turns out to be just another of the many pathetic and failed attempts to create a drama for a character so flat and hackneyed that it will forever be a stain on Palance's career, just like those of the rest of the cast is equally ruined. <br /> <br /> Completing the film is a painfully sudden ending with Schofield piloting the bomb in the middle of the sun in an attempt to redeem his actions while he was under the spell of the villain, a climax that presents another of the sequences of visual effects considerably well-made in the film which, even for the visibly elaborated attention, nevertheless manage to make the film look just as attractive as it really is. The saddest part of this film is the obviously big budget, tragically wasted in a smelly script and in a supporting cast of Boyle, Heston and Palance who manage to nail the coffin with pure over-action. <br /> <br /> Grade: D-
