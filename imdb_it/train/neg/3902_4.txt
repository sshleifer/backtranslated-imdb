This is really an adaptation of the Jane Austen novel. Compared to the American version of Guinneth Paltrow, the script was written to resemble the book as much as possible. But the acting was terrible. Besides Kate Beckinsale, who I believe was a true resemblance to Emma in the book, all the other actors were trying too hard. Mark Strong was not the "gentleman" who should have been. He was often rude and offensive, he had no feeling, and throughout the film he didn't see his love "grow" for Emma. This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale, who seemed to be trying to "resque" her starring role as well as that of her partner. Also, there was no chemistry among the entire cast. Hariett Smith, played by Samantha Morton, seemed to have no real attachment to Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. Therefore, it did not seem as distraught as it was described in the book. Even the movie settings are too scarce. The costumes are even more. I would have imagined that Emma Woodhouse dressed in a more elegant and fashionable way than she does here. Even the finish is too long. It's nice that it looks like the end of the book, but it's a killer ending for a movie. And yet, I can't see any feeling of happiness in front of Mr.Knightley. To conclude, I believed that this adaptation was faithful to the book, but with poor actors. It seemed as if the film had been made without any budget. I'd rather see the "lighter" version with Paltrow and Northam, although it's clear that it was made to be a "blockbuster" rather than watch these actors (except the good Olivia Williams and the best Kate Beckinsale) ruin the whole script
