There are two reasons why I didn't give a 1 to this film. One reason is some of the actors (like Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) who tried to play at their usual level of acting. However in many scenes they were somehow blocked by the ugly script. <br /> <br /> The other reason is the good idea and appearance of the Cyborg, which is very different from most of the other roles I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Everything else in this film is the worst it can be. Boring scenes, useless and boring dialogues, poor script work. And it seemed that it was the first film ever for many actors. It may have been an interesting story though, but they failed completely.
