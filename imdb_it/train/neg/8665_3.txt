This is a low-cost horror / creature movie Roger Corman. A DinoCroc is created when the manipulation of prehistoric genes is exploited. An engineered crocodile first kills one of his own, then takes on the taste of the human and becomes a rapidly growing terror after escaping. None of the characters has depth, but it is not the focal point. We only have a few glimpses of the huge two-legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best "killing" scenes in a small, inexpensive film. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is of an idiotic character who tries to use a three-legged dog for bait and becomes crocodile food himself. Nothing left on the dock but feet of the ankle. Without prominent roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. The most pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and a hateful professional croc hunter Costas Mandylor. I was very impressed by the seductive Joanna Pacula while the respectful dreaded Dr. P. DINOCROC is redeeming himself as a shard of pickles.
