A poorly written script without nice characters. As for the comedy, I forgot to laugh. They are 2 presumptuous friends who cheat to take women too much in bed with them (without sex scenes) and another friend (who is semi-bizarre enough) who sometimes even cheats, but above all is considered the boy who takes care of master. The 3 friends meet separately and fall in love with the same woman (Amanda Peet). Somehow this is done without really any romance. The 3 boys stop being friends while they attend it separately. He cheated them with their friendship because they defrauded women. - A bad movie
