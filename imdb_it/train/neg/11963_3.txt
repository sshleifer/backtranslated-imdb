I like Billy Crystal, and I thought it would be fun to watch this movie, since I know he admired Alan King and would be fun together. I thought I saw all of Billy's movies but I couldn't remember this, and now I know why. It is so full of clich√©s and fake emotions; you can smell every scene that comes (and that goes!). Billy can't even be funny very often. He is too busy trying to cry fake tears or showing his anguish at how badly his father disappointed him. Alan King himself is quite likeable, as is the subplot of being an extra in the movies. But what a coincidence, to Billy, he happens to visit his father just as there is a serious health crisis, etc. Or that two busy doctors can simply close their files to go around Los Angeles. And when the end comes, boy, come quickly! Almost as if the writers realized they had painted themselves in a corner and the only way out was to do a scene of death. Mostly disappointing with some glimmers of good humor.
