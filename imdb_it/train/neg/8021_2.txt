Visually disjointed and full of himself, the director apparently chose to seek maximum depth to expand a 5-minute plot into an 81-minute night festival. <br /> <br /> The moments that work in this movie are VERY limited and the characters don't even feel real. How could you feel invested in a main protagonist made so surreal? <br /> <br /> Substantially And stylistically, everything looks like an extravagant sequence of dreams. The irregular work of the cameras, the uncomfortable silences and the empty spaces in action, and what happens to the little spider image that crawls on the screen? Whoever thought of this must return to the film school. It didn't add any meaning, just the cheese, and it didn't even work stylistically with the rest of the film (assuming the film had a style, which is a close call). What a flop.
