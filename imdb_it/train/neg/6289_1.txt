This is the most clandestine and worst romantic comedy I've ever seen. Every scene is worthy and the two main actors - Corey and Danny are so annoying. Corey is very stupid and naive and should never have listened to Danny's false promises. <br /> <br /> Neve Campbell and the Urban Legend killer are the only salvific qualities in this poor film attempt. Danny (Dean Paras) looks towards the end of the thirties and the girl who is trying to sleep - Corey looks like she's still in college. <br /> <br /> Here in Australia, this film is called Too Smooth; there is nothing smooth about this film. 1/10 Avoid
