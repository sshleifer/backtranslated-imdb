As a Danish, I am proud of the handful of good Danish films that have been produced in recent years. It is a terrible shame, however, that this wave of quality has led the majority of Danish film critics to lose the sense of criticism. In fact, it has become so serious that I no longer trust the reviews of Danish films, and as a result I stopped seeing them in the cinema. I know it is wrong to keep this unfortunate development against any film, so I would like to point out that "Villa Paranoia" would be a terrible film under any circumstances. The fact that he was criticized by critics has just fueled my bonfire of disillusionment with the Danish film. Furthermore, waiting until it was released on DVD was very little help against the immovable feeling of having wasted time and money. <br /> <br /> Erik Clausen is an established director with a talent for social realism in Copenhagen. I particularly appreciated "De Frigjorte" (1993). As an actor, he is usually funny, although he generally plays the same role in all his films, namely that of a tramp of the working class who is unlucky, partly because he is a drunk but above all because of society, and that redeems itself by doing something good for its community. <br /> <br /> This is the number one problem in "Villa Paranoia"; Clausen launches as a chicken farmer, which is such a break from the norm that he can never make it credible. <br /> <br /> It is much worse, however, that the film should make twists and break all the rules on how to tell a story to make the audience understand what is going on. For example, the film opens with a very sad attempt to visualize the main character's pre-death experience with the use of low-budget effects and bad camera action. After that, the character tells his best friend that he suddenly felt the urge to jump off a bridge. This is symptomatic of the whole film; there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters, and Clausen uses the lower form of communicating whatever motivation there is: saying instead of showing. So, at some point, you have a character who speaks loudly to an overtly catatonic person about the way he feels, because the script doesn't allow him to recite his feelings; and further on, the off-screen voice is suddenly introduced, most likely as an afterthought, to convey sensations that would otherwise remain unknown to the public due to the director's ineptitude. Fortunately, at this point you are about an hour of caring for some of the characters, not to mention the so-called story. <br /> <br /> Acting, which has often been a problem in Clausen's films, can be summed up in a sad statement: SÃ¸ren Westerberg Bentsen, whose only other claim to fame was as a competitor on Big Brother, not it's worse than many of the actors announced in the cast. <br /> <br /> Classification 2-out-of-10.
