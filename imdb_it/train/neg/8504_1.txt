Semana Santa is incredibly bad. It's so wrong in so many ways that I don't know where to start. So let's see ... Mira Sorvino, whose judge was killed while he was protecting her, goes from Madrid to Seville for his job as a policeman. During Holy Week (Semana santa, see? ... everyone starts to sleep ... let's say he was sick in so many points, even from the beginning), a murderer executes his victims as bulls in a bullfighting arena . It allies with the male chauvinist and chauvinist Olivier Martinez and the likeable Feodor Atkine. He soon discovers that he will be the next target of the killer (who wears a red robe). Why, oh but why? <br /> <br /> Because .., this is the question that has been in my head for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> D: Because he went to see that A: Because I adore Mira Sorvino (I even apologized for the shit FIRST one) D: Because we were only 8 people in the theater this Saturday the first release weekend? A: ha-ha-ha. The spider man was relegated the same day. But also the fact that the film was blown up with scathing reviews. <br /> <br /> Q: Why was this film made? A: Money, I think. But the boy wanted Mira to have the money. <br /> <br /> then ... why ???????????? first of all, there is always something wrong with European co-productions. here you have a French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish production. yi-ha. <br /> <br /> So he wants to play in the same thriller / slashers / whodunit / mystery / any game. Even VALENTINE, although not necessary and poorly screened and filmed, was much better in suspense and fun. <br /> <br /> So, to give the story some credit, the writer wanted to add some political insight to the story. Wrong: done in flashback in a photo similar to Traffic, it is certainly the most interesting thing in the film. He could stick to it, he wouldn't have to go through the whole movie. Better to go straight to THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE for intelligent fun. <br /> <br /> So homophobia. Bullseye! The first victims are the S & M doped homosexual twins who were stabbed to death. The annoying olivier Martinez goes to an appointment agency with a shaved overweight transvestite in a platinum blonde wig. Call Mira Sorvino's character a large dam all the time. Do we need this kind of thing? Nah. Just useless offensive remarks, just like old times. <br /> <br /> So the suspense. Yipee. No apparent reason. The first murders are mere illusions as a representation of a famous painting. But no. And the revelation of the killer (a horrible fascist, of course) could have been from the beginning as it appears at the end of the film as, I imagine, it was time for the director to say "weel, time to finish that Bloody movie, we reveal just now who is the murderer and why he kills ". <br /> <br /> So the director thinks he's a director. Wrong: no sense of suspense, no sense of directing the actors, no knowledge of rhythm change. A giant, mega-boredom. The scenes of Holy Week are useless (perhaps a coproduction rule that says: ok, shoot in Seville but show some credits of this beautiful and historic city with Easter celebrations. Here we are: a mysterious film for tourists!) <Br / > <br /> So the actors. All the wrongs Mira Sorvino is bored to death: it does practically nothing but get stabbed in the right hand. Everything he did best (the Killers substitutes, Mighty Aphrodite ...) were like they never existed. Olivier Martinez ... hi, someone here? When will the producers learn that he is not an actor but a mannequin without speech or feeling? Feodor Atkine, bland and transparent. We only make a great respect for Alida Valli, one of the greatest actresses of this century (and I hope to have other roles in this current one). It is the main attraction here because it is the only one that gives life to its poor lines. I will not mention the other actors because they are only unilateral, uninteresting and shallow characters. <br /> <br /> Incoherent direction, inconsistent actors, plausible plot. Idiocy incarnate. <br /> <br /> Superwonderscope says: 1 <br /> <br />
