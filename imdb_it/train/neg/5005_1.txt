A finicky quality film C, horrible compelling (and NOT in a funny way). Everything screams "amateur", from the crumby script (bizarre locales, limited coherence and predictable endings, turgid lighting, sound and angular angles of hand-held shooting, the innoundo and passive and passive sexual references, irregular and unpredictable dialogue at the Z Rate acting, I saw it on DVD and was hoping that Edward Wood would pop out. Everything is forgiven: your Worst Films are works of art and more consistent than this twilight. <br /> <br /> But anyway , preferable to warbling 'Every night in my dreams I hear you' - are you sure the Titanic crew was not involved in this from the side?
