I was watching this with one of my friends, who is a vampire maniac, and I was extremely disgusted that this movie exists. This film should be shown to prisoners of war, yes it is so bad. Even John McCain would not be able to sit down. So why the 3/10 rating? Because he had a vampire dwarf. Come on, what's more fun than a vampire dwarf?
