I'm a big fan of Mr. Ram Gopal Varma but I couldn't believe he made this film. I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag does not come close to the real Sholay. It does not leave a lasting impression on an observer. Ram Gopal Varma fails to create a chemistry between the characters. There is no camaraderie between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant raj). There are very few scenes with more than two people in the frame together. The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal is an extraordinary sight. Amitabh Bachchan should not have made this film. Ajay and Sushmita sen were doing their best but to no avail. The vocal modulation of Rajpal Yadav - ineffective and rather useless. Mohanlal did full justice and showed again that acting is about facial expression and body language. The rest of the cast was below expectations. The comic situation adapted from the original sholay fall of this film. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma could have worked on the script, but due to the controversies surrounding the film he messed up and only for the sake of doing he did this Aag. But there is no fire.
