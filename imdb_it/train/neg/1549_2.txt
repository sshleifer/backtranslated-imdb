While Leon is nice on SNL, he's only active for a minute. Like most SNL skit-to-movies, this can't fill 90 minutes. It has some nice moments (the ones you saw in the trailer) but the actors are mostly wasted. Tim Meadows does his best but the plot doesn't have many highlights. Will Farrell has a part. Farrell could be the funniest man alive ... but not in this movie. What a pity.
