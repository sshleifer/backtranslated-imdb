Terrible, terrible, horrible. <br /> <br /> A condescending remark at the beginning and some bad autopsy photos do not make a good film. Once again I am stunned by the determination and skill that some people have in making a film production and yet they are not proud to realize that what they have done is a pile of shit. <br /> <br /> I sat down and tried to think of a saving function in order to at least balance my criticisms, but the only one I could think of was that Pink's opening track was pretty good ... I wonder if you've seen this? <br /> <br /> Watch this at your own risk, boredom could kill you.
