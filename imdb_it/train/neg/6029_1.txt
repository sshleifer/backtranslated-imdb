If you are wondering where many of the conspiracy and paranoid theories about the UN, Israel and international affairs come from, look no further. <br /> <br /> This is not a supernatural Hollywood movie freely based on a biblical passage. Instead, this film was made by a company (Cloud Ten Pictures) with a political and religious program. Like a movie, the end result sometimes seems more like a movie than a televangelism program (complete with family prayers and light that runs through the windows of the church while the harps are playing). <br /> <br /> For traditional viewers, it may be hard to believe, but many people believe in these things literally, as presented in the film. And this, perhaps, makes the film important. You will probably not find a more concise display of the bizarre visions of a significant number of your fellow citizens. So if you view it, display it as a social / cultural document. If you are aware of all the media, it is not necessary to be warned of attempts at propaganda and manipulation in the film.
