This scared the hell out of me when I was a teenager. Now I find it more amusing than scary, but with some rather disturbing moments and with a sort of squalid quality that I like. And to think of it, the plot is actually quite disgusting ... but managed with some kind of taste. If there is a problem with this film, it is that there are huge gaps in which nothing exciting or interesting happens. Furthermore, the ending goes on indefinitely, making a potentially tense climax seem silly after a while with Barbara Bach screaming and screaming. Unfortunately, the "monster" after being exposed is not very scary. Even the slightly sad look of the film goes against it, making it look like a TV movie more than something that was made for theaters. But it is an example of films that are rarely made today so I invite horror fans to watch it and I feel a little nostalgic ...
