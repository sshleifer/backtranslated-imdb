The little sister and I are self-proclaimed fans of horror movies. We saw practically EVERYTHING, especially the zombie movies. Now, we have seen many good zombie movies and many bad ones. This BY FAR is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Not only was the acting horrible, but the special "zombie" effects, graphics and makeup were the worst I've seen. If you can even call it makeup (black eyeshadow around the eyes) This is proof that you must never judge a book by its cover. Because the film's cover is the only sweet thing. do yourself a favor and DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so adamant about this movie that I came to put a sticky note inside the film before returning it to the film saying "This movie sucks, don't waste time, come back NOW" hahahhaa I don't want anyone else wasting a good movie night on this POS movie! I don't even know how he got the ratings he made, t should be negative
