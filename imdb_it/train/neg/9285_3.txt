Considering that I seemed to be picking up a new Jet Li movie to see some but melee and brainless fights, I grabbed this title. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film contains more weapons battles (wing Chow Yun Fat but not at all good), compared to Jet Li and the company's aerobatic fights. So it was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Combat with the taps was interesting and even fun, considering that for me it was something totally unexpected in a Jet Li movie, more on the line of saying Jackie Chan. <Br /> <br /> But alas, I would recommend Fist of Legend, Tai Chi Master or even the Enforcer for this disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating 4 for martial arts Rating 3 for the overall score of the film
