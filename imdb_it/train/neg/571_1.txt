I rented it just because I liked the first movie. However, calling him John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a scam to let you rent. He is in fact an executive producer and clearly has nothing to do with the making of this film (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?) A tragic plot, terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the Vampire Hunter less convincing than ever. It's not even comically bad. <br /> <br /> What we end up with is a boring and uninvolving film with a terrible script and an insensitive and bad acting. He has only a low budget. <br /> <br /> Avoid bubonic plague.
