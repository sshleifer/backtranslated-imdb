We bought this movie from a store called Poundland. We were looking for more inspiration since we previously bought the movie No Big Deal and we did it again. <br /> <br /> We expected this film to be of great inspiration so that we could do it again and put it on the tube. HOWEVER, this was shocking. BORING is the main word that comes to mind. The negative effects and the script are not enough to make you look. The main woman's body seems to be whipped at appropriate times in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested. However, it just makes you wonder, did they blow up the budget by having them take off their clothes? If so, I would have asked for a refund! It looks like a home-made movie, the shots don't even match each other and the camera work is so delightful that it makes our remakes of bad movies look professional. I CANNOT believe that this is sold as a marketable product. <br /> <br /> IT'S ALWAYS RIGHT AND UGLY to look at. The actors are bad and there is no degree of professionalism about it. There are no words to describe how terrible it is.
