This film has many promises. I was very excited about this movie. In the end, it was ridiculous at best, painful at worst. Acting styles extended from truly, truly, flat (angels, wife and daughter) to over-animation (Casper's character). I felt that dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the public instead of real people trying to talk to each other. Pay particular attention to the scene concerning the "insect". It's practically an insult to the public's ability to understand things. In defense of that scene, however, he got the biggest laugh of the whole movie. I read that they spent a lot of money traveling to various locations abroad. Too bad they didn't use it. I didn't feel like I was being transported to exotic places. Someone could insert repertoire material from the Colosseum in Rome. However, to end on a positive note, I thought the sets were pretty good. I really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers. It is my opinion (and that is all) that if the SCHMALTZ factor would have been much lower and the ACTION factor would have been considerably increased, this film would have been good.
