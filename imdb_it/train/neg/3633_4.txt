Of the ten actors who played Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Lowe seemed the nicest, but in this script the audience is far ahead of the famous detective. After all, when the jockey, Douglas Walton, stares into space, apparently hypnotized, and says something like "I have to ride and get myself killed", I felt it was stupid that no one took him after he was killed. The police thought it was a suicide because he said he would do it! After the hated horse owner, Gene Lockhart is killed and killed, Frieda Inescort does the same thing, saying he is going to be killed, and then he inevitably jumps off a bus. I laughed when Lowe finally shouted "I understand", as if it were a revelation. The guilty party, however, was cleverly hidden and there was considerable suspense when that part began to hypnotize Lowe to make him jump from a roof.
