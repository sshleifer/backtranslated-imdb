Serum is about a crazy doctor who finds a serum that should cure all diseases through the power of the mind. Instead it creates a kind of monster that needs to eat meat and human brains. The crazy doc creates some zombies with corpses and has some problems. There is a very long advantage in all the actions with many scenes that let you know the characters. The crazy doctor's nephew enters a car accident and the crazy doc tries to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not good. This is a class C movie with OK acting but some directing problems and some continuity errors. There is not much zombie action in this and the effects, if adequate, are nothing special. You can fast forward through the slow parts and enjoy the action scenes. Pay attention to nudity and bad language.
