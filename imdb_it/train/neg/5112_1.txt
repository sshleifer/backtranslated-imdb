Awwww .... yes, it is moving and all that some unfortunate family is adopted by ABC / Sears and has their house "renewed". Here is where the humanistic appeal ends. I liked it at the beginning of his run, but now this show has become disgustingly excessive. <br /> <br /> Ten needy families could receive relatively luxurious homes with many goodies for each family that every episode of this show goes out. The people of Habitat for Humanity have to shake their heads in disbelief. For example, is it necessary for a healthy boy of sixteen to have a whirlpool in his bedroom, or for his bed to have been deceived with the "Low Rider" hydraulics? Does Mom really need her old rundown pickup truck, rusty and broken, restored and "exploited" by some of the best personalizers in California? A new one would do the job quite well, and probably for a third of the price. Do people really need a sixty-five-inch plasma screen in every room in the house? And then there's the problem of who pays the increase in property taxes and bills. Even after the "Makeover" troops left, someone makes a living. I doubt the friendly people of Social Services will see humor in all this generosity. <br /> <br /> This show is nothing more than a hoarding of votes for the ABC and a tacit advertisement for its sponsors.
