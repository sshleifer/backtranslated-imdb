Imagine that you are asked by your appointment which movie you wanted to see, and you remember seeing a rather intriguing trailer on "The Grudge". So, in good faith, he recommends seeing that movie. It's the Halloween season, after all. And he made the boffo box office last weekend, so it must be pretty good ... so go. <br /> <br /> And you're really in a state of shock when the film ends as it does, and you feel audibly saying, "that can't be the end of the movie ...". But alas, it is. <br /> <br /> And imagine leaving the cinema in a state of embarrassment and ashamed to recommend a dog like a movie. You think your date thinks you're a leader for suggesting such atrocities, and your suggestion will surely end with a promising relationship. In fact, it was so bad that we both burst out laughing at how bad it was. I see no future for Miss Gellar in the movies and suggest that she stick to television in the future. In reality, it won't be long before it is delivered to the flea market conventions by selling Buffy memorabilia, and it can't happen soon enough if you ask me. Horrible, horrible, horrible. The plot made no sense; the continuity was terrible. It is clear that the entire finale was designed to have a "Grudge II - The Return of 'Cat-Boy". "
