This is superficial hedonism and / or social commentary wrapped in a tragic tale about a jealous young woman's scheme to separate her father and girlfriend. Is incest or just a vision through the eyes of a daughter with an Electra complex? Who cares? All the characters, except Anne (Deborah Kerr), are vacant and cowardly. Seberg is poor (I agree with the comment of the "boys with the breast" of a previous review). The plot struggled. This predictable material was enough for about 30 minutes of film that unfortunately has been extended for an hour and a half! If you want to see great clothes and jewels on the Riviera, I recommend "To Catch a Thief" - where you'll get the added bonuses of a funny story and nice characters. <br /> <br /> I like movies to entertain me. Personally, I don't really care where a film is set. Whatever the time or place, I want a good story - comedy or drama. I also want to see some funny characters. It doesn't hurt if I can relate to them. Poor Deborah Kerr offers a typically good performance, as does David Niven in a despicable role. <br /> <br /> The score "2" is only for Kerr and Niven, and for the cinematography - the rich color scenes and the dark scenes in black and white. Unfortunately, all the great cinematography of the world cannot save a poor story with unpleasant characters. The ear of a sow is still in the ear of a sow. As a result, watching this casino was a serious waste of my time.
