I remember when a lot of kids came out they were crazy about it. I guess I'm a little too old to be enthusiastic and I was a fan of real martial arts movies and I always found it a bit rough. <br /> <br /> In the early 1990s we were overwhelmed by programs like this making children feel like they could fight and become a power ranger or these 3 Ninja kids. I think in the end it was the parents and the filmmakers who got sick because all we really had was a bunch of kids who were pummeling and hitting everyone. <br /> <br /> Many films for children have an important point that they are trying to make and it is nice that your children watch and receive the message, this one has no message ... it uses only one million fewer differences of 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The film has no great visual qualities, but would you expect it to happen? The acting is pretty ugly. Victor Wong is a cool actor, but it was embarrassing to see him here ... The fat old fat-eyed parrot like a powerful ninja that was simply hilarious. The kids played too much and the younger ninja Tum Tum was perhaps the worst child actor I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film has a storyline that anyone knows before reading the review. 3 ninja ... you know they will fight a lot of bad guys and they will win obviously ... I have to say more. Sorry if I ruined it for anyone. <br /> <br /> With all that has said that children will love it. This film is for children and only children could have fun. If you don't mind your son seeing movies about fighting children, this is a good movie to show him. If you don't mind allowing your children to see the complete garbage that has nothing to do with real martial arts, acting or the time of reality, then you have found a movie for your children ... I say children because I think that girls will do it too I like ... I remember all the girls who have a crush on Rocky. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 stars because I think you can make a film for children and make it fun for adults again. This film was not a big success at that point. It is beyond the fact that it is not original or unique and I would not allow a child of mine to watch it ... Kung Fu is on DVD and there are lots of Shaw Brothers movies out there. .. Why not show your children things that will really entertain them and not make them stupid along the way, maybe they will also teach them some moves and not just how to kick a man between the legs like his grandfather did on 3 Ninja ... no no no ... never kick a man between your legs ... ever .. it's as strange as that.
