A group of friends come face to face with a family of horrible cannibals while camping in the beautiful German countryside. <br /> <br /> The concept of "mutant cannibal family" is almost as old as the hills that freaks in love often call home, so every director who tries to give a new life to the genre needs to find something really damn special to impress. With Barricade, Timo Rose tries to give the usual routine a Teutonic touch, transplanting the action in the Black Forest and giving it the treatment of low-cost German sketches. The result is a very bloody but totally unoriginal effort that is rendered almost impossible to look at thanks to some terrible directorial decisions, in particular the continuous use of fantasy filters and irritating editing techniques. <br /> <br /> Had Timo Rose did not opt ​​for the use of all the tricks that his editing software offered him, so Barricade may have been a reasonably fun gore festival: his inexperienced cast does enough well; bleeding effects are suitable for the stomach; and there are one or two scares and also some well-conceived gruesome moments. All this, however, is completely ruined by the horrible shooting work, the uncertain editing and the overwhelming burst of visual expedients used to give the film the distressed look that is so inexplicably popular among today's directors. <br /> <br /> I will give Barricade 3 out of 10 only for the extravagant gore, which includes an elegant scene in which a boy is forced to drink acid, a lot of bad wounds caused by a variety of sharp tools and some damage from pretty decent rifle.
