His spelled S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character showed her tits. It was pretty tight. Before and after the film, many shots. Acting is like an E-list and is shown well in the film. Not to mention the budget so low that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are interpreted by the same person. The whole film seems to have been shot with a video camera instead of halfway decent film. The only other reason why I liked the movie was because Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny. They said many stupid things that made me laugh. On top of that, if you see this movie on Blockbuster, do everyone a favor hide it behind Lawnmowerman 2. Anyone who thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated.
