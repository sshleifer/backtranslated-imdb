This is not only my verdict considered on this film, but also on most of what has been written about it. Now don't get me wrong either, I'm not a total Philistine, I don't hate the movie because it wasn't quite like '9 police academy' or whatever, I enjoy more than my good dose of high eyebrows or artistic stuff, I swear. <br /> <br /> The "Magnolia" is poor, and I am honestly disoriented about why it is apparently so acclaimed. Long nonsense, self-indulgent, nonsense nonsense from beginning to end, there is only so little that it could be credibly what people love so much about the film. There are some fairly good high-level actors, and no one turns into an average or worse performance. Also, my wife (a person who confessed to Tom Cruise) tells me that is by far her best career performance. But the plot is so completely untied, that it winds through the stories of many characters vaguely connected at such a rate that even when important life-changing events are shown they seem so useless and uninteresting you find yourself asking someone to blow themselves up or something like that . <br /> <br /> It doesn't help that any of the characters is very easy to identify or empathize (well, I don't think so, but I don't like most people). They all long interpret their rather intractable life stories, demonstrating their flaws and emotions of character in ever-intricate details and interpreting their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with a disconcerting soliloquy along the way. Yadda yadda yadda. Even the soundtrack is bad, with that quality of marrow and irritant that until then I had thought only for the music of Alanis Morisette. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a pleasant three hours forced to watch an episode of "Friends" repeatedly while being stuck intermittently in the ribs by an unhappy goat. The bite with frogs is still good.
