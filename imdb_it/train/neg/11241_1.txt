If you are looking for eye candy, you could enjoy Sky Captain. Sky Captain is just a video game with live artist injections. The visials are beautiful and interesting to watch during the entire movie. Now, saying that images are the only good thing in Sky Captain. <br /> <br /> After ten minutes, I knew I was watching one of the worst movies of all time. I was hoping that this movie would improve, but it never reached any level of interest. After thirty minutes, the desire to go out continued to grow and grow. I now have over 2000 movies and I've probably seen that number five times. And yet, this is just the second film that seemed to come out of my whole life. <br /> <br /> Acting --- there is none. The three main actors are pitiful. Jude Law (also in the other film I wanted to go out) is simply horrible in the title role. I prefer to sit with Ben Affleck in Gigli than to look at Law again. <br /> <br /> Paltrow tries so hard to be camped, that he turns against her. The last article I read said that Paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting. After this performance, I would applaud this decision. <br /> <br /> History --- The soap works are written better. The story behind Sky Captain starts badly and gets worse and worse as it progresses. <br /> <br /> Direct --- none. Everything has been put into special effects that history, acting and directing suffer a lot. Even "the Phantom Menace" has played better and this is NOT saying much. <br /> <br /> I should give this movie a "0" on "10". Avoid paying theater prices and wait until the video is released.
