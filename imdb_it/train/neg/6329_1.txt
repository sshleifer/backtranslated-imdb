I saw this cinematic misfortune in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (when the tickets were sold for $ 1). This is the only film I've ever walked (with my friend, while the idiocy that is the "Laser Bra 2000" sketch was on the screen). Evidently, the reaction of my and my friend to the film was common. It's not that I found the film offensive (or eighteen years old or now), but rather that it's incredibly stupid and obviously not funny, lacking even the involuntary humor that makes an Ed Wood movie watchable. This is the real reason why NBC refused to broadcast it, rather than not understanding Mr. Mike's "vision" (unless, of course, his vision was to derail the film's supporters). <br /> <br /> I was surprised until today that this film does not seem to have published any list of "10 worst films of all time". Certainly it's mine. You have been warned.
