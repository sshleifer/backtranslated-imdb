The philanthropic gesture of actress Ruth Roman to help entertain troops arriving and departing for the Korean War at an air base near San Francisco, kicked off this all-star Warner Bros. salutes patriotism and I sing. Many celebrities make guest appearances while a love-hate love affair develops between a star in the grass and a masterly aeronautical painfully green and thin (Ron Hagerthy, who seems to be delivering newspapers from his bicycle). It seems that the corporal has deceived the actress making him think of going to fight when in reality he is part of an aircraft carrier crew, flying to and from Honolulu (you would think he would be happy to stay out of danger, but instead acts just like most childish females in films of the 50s). Doris Day is around for the first thirty minutes or so, and her distinct laughter and brave song numbers are more enjoyable. Roman is here too, he looks charming, while James Cagney teases his character on screen and Gordon MacRae sings in his handsome baritone. Even Jane Wyman sings again in a hospital bed following the guidance of Doris Day, making someone wonder, "Have they finished the sets?" For discerning viewers, an interesting flashback to another time and place. However, low-cost production and newly adapted technical aspects make "Starlift" strictly a second issuer. * 1/2 from ****
