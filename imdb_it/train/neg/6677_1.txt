After reading the first 5 reviews on IMDb, I was very excited about this movie. But it's really a horrible movie, the total time you see the alien is about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is inexpensive), the acting is exaggerated in the story, oh boy, what story? <br /> <br /> The story does not seem to go in one direction, first they capture the alien (after 7 years! finally they succeed), then they don't know what to do with it (after 7 years?) and they even want to release it (because the hell did they catch him? Then the girl, who is the most exaggerated, wants to get away from this madness, then suddenly she doesn't, then again, she does it and then she doesn't. Then they come to the conclusion that killing the alien will kill the entire human race (and remember, in all those years no other human has seen these permanently established aliens) and what do they do? They torture him and blow up a group of aliens. <br /> <br /> This is my first review on IMDb, I'm a very lazy person who doesn't write very early, so listen to my warning: this move isn't worth it, don't watch this movie.
