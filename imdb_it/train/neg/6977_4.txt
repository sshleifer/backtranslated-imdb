I read all the rave reviews here and I am impressed by the imagination of those who loved this movie. I can't say I found a lot to recommend. Leonard Cohen's soundtrack is not only excessively heavy but shabby beyond measure. The film seems quite authentic, but something must happen because it works, and it doesn't do much: a superficial plot (it's not a real problem for me), not a lot of character development, nothing thematic. It only makes effort. Malformed as it is, "Heaven's Gate" by Cimino has some moments of true wonder and it is a film that I would watch before. For a brilliant conversion of the West, HBO's "Deadwood" is far superior to "McCabe".
