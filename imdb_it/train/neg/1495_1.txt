I've been watching horror movies since I was 5, starting with Childs Play. Since then, I've seen good and bad horror movies, but this is without a doubt the DUMBEST movie I've ever seen! The actors did everything they could with the material. The plot was simply idiotic. Moreover, it was all gore. I can bear a lot of blood, but it was ridiculous! In one of the scenes, a character is stabbed in the back and suffocated with his intestines! Simple stupid! Another problem with this film is its boring and probably the slowest movie ever made. The end is simply stupid. But then again, go with the rest! Finally, when the girl leaves the cannibal / ancestor, she receives the help of an old lady. The old lady is making tea, but when she turns to talk to the girl, the girl attacks her! It turned into a cannibal! Delayed movie.
