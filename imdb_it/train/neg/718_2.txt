The main reason why people still worry about "Carlton-Browne Of The F.O." is that it presents Peter Sellers in a secondary role. But watching this movie to see Peter Sellers is a mistake. <br /> <br /> Sellers plays Anfibulos, a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the poor nation of the island of Gaillardia, formerly a British colony, which now houses a lot of Russian diggers during the height of the Cold War. Amphibulos wants to play both U.K and Soviet interests against each other to make easy money, "all very friendly and all our cards under the table". Terry-Thomas is the title character, a lazy British diplomat anxious to show Gaillardia that Britain has not forgotten them, all appearances to the contrary. <br /> <br /> A positive review says: "The reason this film is considered average because the play is undervalued." I would say that the reason why "Carlton-Browne" is considered below average is because the play is non-existent. <br /> <br /> After a decent opening that establishes the only two strengths of the film, a nicely sweet Terry-Thomas and the soundtrack full of praise of John Addison, things quickly slow down in a series of complaints burned and incomprehensible jokes. The low opinion of Carlton-Browne by his boss and the darkness of Gaillardia (which nobody can find on a map) is killed to death. The moment we actually reach the island (after a tiring series of exaggerated jokes), the expectations are quite low. <br /> <br /> They are still too high. The island itself, which seems to exist in both Latin America and the Mediterranean, is so pathetic that its honor guard faints at the airport, and the review booth falls apart in the middle of a parade. The army is apparently still drawn by horses, allowing another hobbled hunchback from an announcer with a thick accent: "In war, the army uses many horses." <br /> <br /> Sellers are never the center of attention even when we on the Island of their character. The plot is instead taken by Ian Bannen as King Loris, who inherits the throne of Gaillardia after the murder of his father. Bannen is boring and plays his part straight as it is written. Normally this would make him the likely target to steal the scenes from the sellers, but trapped behind a strong accent and a fat mustache, the sellers are only a threat to those of us who remember him more happily in two other films made in the same year "The Mouse That Roared" and "I'm All Right, Jack." Strange that this film, like "Jack", was a Boulting Brothers production, with Roy Boulting working here as co-director alongside Jeffrey Dell. Usually, Boulting films combine a dark social satire with any comedy, but here there are only madnesses in both directions. Amphibol works for his tormented English atmosphere for all its value ("This man is like, as they say, the bull in the Chinese ship") while Carlton-Browne is generally jagged by his superior far more than he seems to deserve. <br /> <br /> The weakest and longest element of the film is the love story of the young Loris with Ilyena. Get a point for his role played by the raptor Luciana Paluzzi, one of them for the fact that apparently cousins ​​are never dealt with. <br /> <br /> The film ends with an undesirable revolution whose surprise will not surprise anyone and a last piece of action by Carlton-Browne that would seem to literally nail the lid of his coffin. Apparently he lives to see another day, but the film of the same name is strictly DOA.
