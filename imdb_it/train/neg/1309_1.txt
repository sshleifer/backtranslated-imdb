This film was extremely boring. It should not be less than 15 minutes. The images of children and animals killed were a bit scary. <br /> <br /> I don't usually write comments, but this was so bad that it had so many good and excellent comments. I think that in this case we are one step ahead in the honest evaluation of this title. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? I fall asleep during this movie 3 times. It was about 4 hours after I woke up from an 8 hour sleep period. I think it's the point in itself. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue between characters except maybe 2 sentences at the end. <br /> <br /> When you fall asleep once watching him do not try to rewind and recover because you fall asleep again.
