The saddest part of this is the fact that these are 87 minutes that I never come back. I knew this was terrible from the beginning, with the boy dressed as a lunatic Indian chief on top of the roof. (See if they could get away with it in 2008). My 10 year old boyfriend is really interested in baseball right now, so we decided to rent it on a rainy day. Even though it seemed to enjoy some parts of it, I had to shudder when I heard all the useless vulgar language. Bad, bad movie. This was a bad repugnance to Bad News Bears. Completely shameless and completely predictable. I don't mind a predictable movie if it's done right, but this one absolutely wasn't.
