The first Cruel Intentions, the original, is my favorite movie of all time. It was an absolute masterpiece. So how the hell could they do such an ugly following? Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first film. In this, Amy Adams sucks. She is terrible. And couldn't they have found a girl who really looked like Sarah Michelle Gellar? At least the same hair color !!! I mean come on. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but it's absolutely terrible compared to Ryan Phillipe. Sebastian in the first film is sneaky, deceitful and much more evil than Sebastian in the prequel. And what happens with the plot. It's basically like this ... <br /> <br /> 1- Sebastian has a bad reputation in his first school, so the movie says, even if he doesn't mention anything about him and his life of dating, and how it is He was with him girls 2 - Sebastian moved to New York, and suddenly decided to turn around. He "falls in love" with Danielle (I could remind you that in the original, Sarah Michelle's serial killer says "you broke with the FIRST PERSON you ever loved because I told you ... so how could he have been in love in the prequel?" ??) And he is all beautiful and charming, and all "good person", while he refuses sex from the girl his father was doing. <br /> <br /> 3- He completes the 180 and ends up in a trio at the end of the film, and then seduce Cherry. <br /> <br/> I mean, it's terrible and I loved the first so much, I haven't seen the third yet. I hope it's better than this prequel.
