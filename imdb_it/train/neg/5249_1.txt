I am 13 years old and I hated this film is the worst movie on earth, I totally lost my time watching it and was disappointed by the cause on the cover and on the back the film looks pretty good, but I'm wrong it's bad. but when I saw Delta she was totally different and a bad actress and I didn't really know how old the two girls were trying to be so confused. the film was partly confused and I didn't like it at all, but I watched the whole movie just to see if it would improve but it wasn't, it was boring, boring and I said BORING.and I don't think many other people liked it as much as I . What a boring boring
