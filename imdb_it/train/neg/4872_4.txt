The production line of fart beats pretending "Babe" has never been made; the writers clearly hoped that the trick of seeing animals speak would be enough to keep the film going. It is not. Eddie Murphy still takes revenge as a doctor who rediscovers his forgotten childhood gift to understand the incessant and witty chatter of guinea pigs, tigers, mice, dogs and pigeons. The vocal cast is impressive (Albert Brooks, Julie Kavner, Reni Santoni, John Leguizamo, Garry Shandling, Ellen DeGeneres, Paul Reubens, Brian Doyle-Murray), but the script is so unimaginative, without charm and depressingly shocking that it all rattles off the slide very quickly.
