you should see my comments on many Evren Buyruk films .. I am free to make another comment on a film that is not even worth a minute of conversation ... This film is basically two hours of the drinking character Dafoe - almost literally - to death. The only surprise in this film is that you didn't have enough clues or knowledge about the characters to be surprised. It was just a sad, sad waste of time. <br /> <br /> Willem Dafoe is an excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But this movie has just sucked. Slow doesn't make the movie ugly, it was just ugly. The sketched plot, mixed with artistic digressions of anamorphic details, is not drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot, except to highlight a bit of blood that is illustrated from different perspectives, eventually to the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as entertainment it made me fall asleep. (Seriously, I fell asleep and had to review the movie - which was even more disappointing.) Generally I don't like making comments or negative reviews about the work of others, even when they suck, but this movie has guaranteed one. It is simply a pity that these great actors have been ashamed of this final result.
