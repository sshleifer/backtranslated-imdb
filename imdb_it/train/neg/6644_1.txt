Yes it is! ... No, not because of Pintilie likes to strip his actors and publicly show their privees. Pintilie IS THE "emperor" naked - so to speak ... <br /> <br /> It is an important moment for someone to tell the truth. This impostor is a voyeur, a brat stuck in the body of an old man. Its abundance of nude scenes has no artistic legitimacy. It's a 100% visual perversion: he gets his kicks by stripping the actors in the buff and watching their willies. And if he does it in front of the public, it could be hard! Did you know that on the set of "Niki Ardelean" he used to embarrass poor Coca Bloss by saying: "Oh, Coca, how I want to fuck you!"? She is a great lady, very decent and sensitive, and she was unduly embarrassed - for her petty satisfaction! And, as a worrying warning sign on the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in the Romanian public, so many people are still so stupid as to declare these visual obscenities "works of art"! Will anyone ever have the decency to expose the truth of all this?
