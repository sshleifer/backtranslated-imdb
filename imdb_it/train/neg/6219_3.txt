When THE MAGIC OF LASSIE was opened at Radio City Music Hall, I was foolish enough to believe it would be as good as some of Lassie's early films. Not. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible, the Sherman brothers' songs were far below their usual level, the characters were uninspired and JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY had both seen much better days. <br /> <Also, I was interested to see what Alice Faye's contribution would be, since she had been absent from the screen for so many years and was always so attractive in her previous roles at Fox. Even Alice was disappointed by the insane script and the unflattering photograph. Another disappointment. <br /> <br /> Nothing original here, nothing remotely interesting for an adult to enjoy - and of course, no magical gift for anyone. You can skip this without losing anything.
