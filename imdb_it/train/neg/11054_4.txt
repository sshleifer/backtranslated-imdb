I find it fascinating and inspiring that the team of screenwriters behind hopelessly famous Hollywood films like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, American Graffiti and HOWARD THE DUCK have started their careers with a low-cost exploitation horror film like this. Perhaps as a testament to the talent that would have earned Willard Hyuck and Gloria Katz an Oscar nomination later in their careers, the Messiah of Evil has potential, but unfortunately it becomes frustrating precisely because it cannot muster the cinematic feat to get it out. <br /> <br /> The premise involves a girl who goes to a small coastal town in search of her recently deceased painter. It does not take long for fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and plunge headlong into a disconnected absurdity - and for a while it works very well to the point where you begin to think that perhaps the Messiah of Evil needs to be claimed by the tangle of slavery of the exploitation of the 70s as an example of mysterious and artistic horror. <br /> <br /> The surreal non-sequencers continue to accumulate as their daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a squalid hotel room that is in the city to conduct research on the local legend of the "blood moon", a scruffy and half-crazy alcoholic (played by the great Elisha Cook Jr. in the perhaps best film scene) who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley "eaten" by dogs a little later , the blind old lady who owns the local art gallery and who inexplicably removed all her father's paintings from the shop and, last but not least, a latecomer, murderer and squirrel-eating albino. <br /> <br /> Part of the charm of the film is precisely this bran of basic-business artistic surrealism that defies all logic and gender convention at every stage of the process. Considering that with Lynch is obviously the mark of a talented creator, with Messiah of Evil the boundaries between "intentional", "unintentional" and "they didn't really expect it to come out this way but it's good enough - BEGINNING SCENE 'blur without hope. <br /> <br /> Take for example the double narrative that flows in and out of the image in a drugged, feverish way, held up by the conscience, one who comes from the daughter while wandering from a place to be searched his father, and the other narrated by his father's voice while reading his diary. <br /> <br /> While we are still talking about an image of "living dead", Messiah of Evil is different and only a whole "one - at least with the current preconceptions about what a zombie movie should be. The origin of the living dead here is a 100-year curse, bestowed on the city by a mysterious" Dark Stranger "that one day came from the woods. Hyuck finds time for fragments of criticism on mass consumption in a carnivorous supermarket scene that precedes DAWN OF THE DEAD for a good number of years (you can already hear the MST3K line: "the man is dead, only his capitalist food remains the boxes") and one similar scene, but badly thought out but poorly performed in a cinema. <br /> <br /> I generally think that the surreal works with careful and well-measured doses - how absurd is it to work if it's not hidden inside the perfectly normal? Hyuck just seems to spread it throughout the film and doing so tears up his hand dangerously. When the albino, for example, picks up a girl who makes her way to the city and eats a squirrel in front of her, you can almost imagine that the director winks at the audience, amused and satisfied with his own interceptions. <br /> <br /> Even the general level of cinematographic production is rather low: after half of the path, the rhythm gets confused and the plot is tiring and obviously does not go anywhere and is not particularly fast. Add to that the approximate assembly, the average acting and Hyuck's general inability to capture the real atmosphere - the empty streets of the coastal city are battered - and I would send the Messiah under 'missed opportunities', but the grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate - even if it is not particularly bloody, trash or squalid.
