When Rodney Dangerfield is in trouble, it's fun. In My 5 Wives, it is not in vogue. One-liner times are off, but they are the best thing for the film. The five women who play wives do not add up to just one actress among them. The plot is very weak. The premise is also rather weak; there are some jokes about having multiple wives, but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie. Most of the film could sound the same way even if Rodney's character had only one wife, so the premise seems more like an old man's fantasy than a fundamental part of the play. Fantasy of another old man: we should accept that the character of Rodney is an athletic skier. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller seems to have phoned his role only to do a favor to a friend, and the rest of the name the actors simply have to be desperate for a job. <br /> <br /> The strange notions of political correctness later in the film really do nothing for the film. For those who like their politically correct films, non-PC humor is still there in the first place, and the apparent excuses for this have not yet understood the point. For those who hate to see a movie that breaks for political correctness, PC add-ons are just annoying digressions. <br /> <br /> This must be the blandest R-rated movie I've ever seen. There are some bold jokes and the bedroom scenes would have made the TV shocking 40 years ago, but that's all. Maybe they were topless men (joking). <br /> <br /> The DVD contains interviews in which cast members seem to find depth and importance in this film and their roles. I kept asking myself if they were serious or joking. They seem to be serious, but I kept thinking, "They're joking!" There is also a particular disclaimer which suggests that since the film never actually mentions the Mormons or the Church of Latter-day Saints, that somehow it is not about them. Never mind that the film has a polygamous religion in Utah and refers to Brigham Young. <br /> <br /> In short, My 5 Wives was a disappointment. I was hoping Rodney would get along, but the best I can say for the film is that Rodney looked good enough for a guy who was pushing 80 years at the moment.
