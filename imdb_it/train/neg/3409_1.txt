It is said that when NASA Technical Advisors of this film were asked to keep the picture credible, they laughed for several hours. After all, unless you are a politician or the job / crew of the shuttle, you have no intention of entering the shuttle. Furthermore, the Space (Cadet) Camp is located in Alabama, not in Florida. <br /> <br /> The truth is that everyone on Earth will win multi-billion dollar lottery prizes before the events depicted in this film become possible. This film was meant for children and must have been written by one because they were unaware of the countless restrictions and requirements related to access to KSC / CCAFS. <br /> <br /> This is the most useless film of all time, and it was a well deserved flop.
