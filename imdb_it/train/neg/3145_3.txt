I'm not sure how much they are related, but I'm almost certain that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this film (or the story on which it is based). Very similar plot, and even some scenes and sets seem to be very, very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so watch it instead. <br /> <br /> This moves very slowly, but being a French film of the 60s, one should expect style. Collected in a retrospective from the point of view of one of the girls who revisits the school. Changing flashbacks with current scenes is a bit confusing at the beginning, especially as the sound of each overlay (ie, hearing flashbacks when you see the present and vice versa). Moreover, the "girls" are a little old to think they are in a boarding school. Finally, not much character development to get you attached to the film.
