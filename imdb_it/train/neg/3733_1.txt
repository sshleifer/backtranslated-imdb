Weak, stale, tired, clich√©; wants to be Basic Instinct, but loses opportunities after opportunities for new perspectives, new insights. Bland, banal, grotesque, and without the possibly redemptive value of brevity; oh wait ... it was only 90 minutes ... it must have * seemed * much longer! I would prefer to clean the toilets of the bus stations with my toothbrush rather than having to sit them again. I am expressing an opinion here: I imagine this means that I did not like it.
