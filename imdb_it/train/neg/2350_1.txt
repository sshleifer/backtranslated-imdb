This show was ridiculously bad. The writing sucked, the dialogue sucked. The guy who played Craig couldn't go to a paper bag. Being it was Thursday night, this was definitely great to watch with some beers. Cold music, bad acting, bad writing, everyone got together for my entertainment. <br /> <br /> It was a dramatic / involuntary comedy. I don't care what happened to any of the characters, they were all boring and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, since they could not reveal who the victim was, they had to write the dialogue around it, which was terrible. I mean, the funeral eulogy at the funeral was ridiculous. In fact, all the scenes that occurred in the present were absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> So let's examine. Everything that happens in the present time has been sucked. The flashback scenes, only Craig's writing, dialogue and acting sucked. The music reigned though.
