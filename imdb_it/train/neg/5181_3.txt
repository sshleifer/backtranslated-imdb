This is the first Horrorfest film I've seen and almost thought I don't need to see any of the others. I was told that it is a "thinking horror film" and I must say that if this should make me think that shot I should think about how the splatter / gore films of the collection will look. Don't misunderstand me even the pain of this film deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is very faded with too much art for art. The effects of the camera and the music are out of place most of the time and the characters are trivial to say the least. Several characters and scenes seem useless in the end when they begin to reveal some of the hooks of "The Hamiltons". I found out who Lenny was half an hour when I got the movie. I was so visually subdued and confused by Lenny that I realized I felt completely ripped off. I expected what I got, but they could have gone much further, in fact all the blood fell completely flat. With films like "Hostel" and "Saw" you have to be a little better for a film that is "considered to be graphic or too scary for the general public".
