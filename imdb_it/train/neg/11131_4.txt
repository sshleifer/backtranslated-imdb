First of all, I agree with quite a lot that escapes Mr. Chomsky's mouth. His practical delivery of interesting counterpoints is what makes man a success in the circus of the university campus. He looks nice, unpretentious, pragmatic. It does not fit the current political style (hateful bi-partyism) and puts its eyes on the extreme left and the extreme right, punishing both, and for good reason. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film itself is a real disaster. Actually, I wouldn't even call it a documentary, but rather a collection of speeches. Watching "Rebel Without a Pause" is no different than watching a speaker on a segment recorded on 3am on CSPAN. There are no camera movements, no changes, no stylistic touches. There is no history, no narrative. <br /> <br /> Technically speaking, production is strictly amateur. The audio is terrible and inconsistent; sometimes we can't hear Noam talking, other times we can't hear the questions being asked by those present. When Noam rarely speaks, we can see the reactions of the audience except when we are given a quick look at his wife who apparently participates in every speech and proudly talks whenever we see her. <br /> <br /> I cannot recommend this film and I would say that you are probably better off checking your recorded tapes or CDs to listen in the car. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars ... and today I am in a generous mood.
