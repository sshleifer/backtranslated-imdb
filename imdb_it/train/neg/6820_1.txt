This crazy and far-fetched tale is redeemed only from the opening scene in which a hard-hitting police detective offers some almost audible lines that confirm our greatest fears: he died. Perhaps the film would have been saved if the director had forgiven the captivating star of A. Martinez in favor of this sadly anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment. That a nameless hacker out of the way can save such a well film is no less likely than a criminal committing murder by dropping stones into a quarry for an unsuspecting diver. His moment is short; his promise is immense. Perhaps we will be treated by a dark actor, if ever there is a sequel to this reckless movie.
