For those looking for a sequel to the 1980s South African miniseries, this is not the case. Nor is it a historical drama. Rather, it is a gloomy little fantasy that has nothing to do with the historian Shaka, but simply uses his name to give a certain cachet to Sinclair's idiotic story about an African superhero who is a combination of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman and Nelson Mandela. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are some moments of laughter, such as when Shaka breaks the cross he is chained to and kicks a serious kick. You know, how Jesus would have done if he hadn't been so good. <br /> <br /> True, I've only seen the 98-minute version, but I can't imagine that double of this shit would have been better. <br /> <br /> And what kind of name is Mungo ?!
