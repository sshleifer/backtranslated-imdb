Some of these viewer comments are simply ridiculous. Isn't it painful to watch with your significant other? I apologized to my boyfriend for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was so slow and terribly weird. <br /> <br /> Both Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha were not suited to this, especially with Vanessa doing that ridiculous American accent. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes was the same clumsy girl with sinuous lips who was in My So-Called Life. You still have to push yourself in some way. Girl, find a new way to pretend to cry! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was one of the only saving parts of this film, she was on screen for five minutes and, I swear to God, she reached the movie screen and slapped me. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, who gets better every time I see him. <br /> <br /> Even Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were fantastic in their two and a half scenes. I mean, this was a well-made film, it was very nice, the settings were interestingly dressed, providing relief for the intense boredom I was feeling. <br /> <br /> I don't know, it's simply rather pathetic when a film featuring a cast of "The greatest actresses of our time" sucks so much. He certainly had more than a few obvious editing mistakes, and the main character (Ann) was a huge idiot. I was glad he died. But it's because I felt bad for Ann's friend Lila - mostly because these two women were better actors and made me feel a little empathy. <br /> <br /> Ugh. BAD work, evening the film. You weren't funny and you weren't even stimulating. I really hope the book is better, so it didn't waste any more time on people. 3/10
