I saw it yesterday at the Intel Film Festival of San Paolo. Just before leaving I came here to see how it was evaluated, and at that time it was 7.4, a nice rate ... <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes I was dying to get out (never did this ), but I felt embarrassed to do so while the film's producer was in projection. <br /> <br /> I don't like it at all, the dialogues are superficial and don't lead anywhere, the characters are less deep than the dialogues, nothing to take anywhere, and the worst and the worst: a lot of Siemens advertising Organics on the film. Despite having already paid to go to the cinema and have fun, I still have to be bombarded by the main character who is chatting on the Internet and by the Siemens mobile phone that always shows up on his laptop; or another character who has bathed or cut their hair only to have Organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen! All this would be bearable if the plot, the characters, the love stories, everything was good, but it was bad, really bad! A "I don't know how to do" sex-in-the-city. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time and money.
