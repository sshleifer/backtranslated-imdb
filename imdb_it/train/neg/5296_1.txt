I'm not a big fan of slasher movies as a genre, but even for low-budget exploitation standards, this is really lame. Even in terms of nudity and gonzo, it's incredibly boring (there's a bit of both, but it's all a bit ... meh). Before the home video revolution, it may not have even been released in the room (although it may have done so, * Plan 9 From Outer Space * was broadcast in theaters). There is exactly one good (and competently delivered) line in the entire film; I assume they stole it somewhere. <br /> <br /> Acting is among the worst I've ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had a couple of competent actors, and the rest tended to be ridiculously hammy, which can be fun to watch. However, most of its actors could pass literally. Here, those who do not read their lines like tobacconist Indians sound as if they learned them phonetically. And this film has a distinction: it manages to be badly underpopulated for most of the film, then ridiculously superimposed for the final. <br /> <br /> (Update: I should have identified the actress interpreting the reception as an exception: it is not wood at all, it is not good, but it is certainly not wooden. <br /> <br /> Also the worst slasher movies are generally good for some Puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness, but with that, there doesn't even seem to be anything to provoke a moral outrage. <br /> <br /> And you know the funniest thing? they clearly waited to make a sequel! <br /> <br /> It's so ugly and boring that it actually becomes fascinating in a strange way.I sat in most of the video wondering why someone would bother doing it.
