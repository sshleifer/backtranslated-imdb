I was browsing Netflix and stumbled upon this movie. Having fond memories of the book as a child, I decided to check it out. This is a movie that you should really pass on. <br /> <br /> Not worth seeing. It's very boring and uninteresting. I feel it would be like that for small children too. It has no magic that the book contains. This movie is not horrible, but you'll find yourself not worrying for ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There are moments that come out as weird. The witch character is not very good. The family behaves as if it were not a big problem that these strange things are happening. I know this is a children's movie, so as an older audience we don't have to look too deeply into things, but the whole movie seems to have been written and produced by people who have never had cinematic experience before. <br /> <br /> The DVD I started jumping into the final moments of the movie, and instead of trying to fix it, I turned it off and sent it to Netflix. I didn't really care how it ended. Skip this movie and read the book.
