Unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 (except for the R rating), there are very few things to appreciate here. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we really should see it more) and Sam Jackson are fun and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can consider her environment, but unfortunately, it is. Poor plot Poor acting. Writing and delivery worse. The special effects are lugubrious. Although the whole situation is a strange and terrible joke, the significant individual situations incorporated are all equally terrible. If we consider the parts of the action, there are incredible action sequences in some films that make your head spin and there are some that make you moan. This film contains only the second type. This leaves little to the left. I'm so glad I didn't pay for it. <br /> <br /> Despite any advertising campaign, I can read and think, just as I sat and watched, I didn't expect anything good. I had no expectations, but I was a little worried about entering. And yet, like a train disaster, you can't just look away. And even without expectations, I was disappointed. Bad. Not even "so ugly, it's good" material. I'm tolerant of bad movies, but this makes "Six String Samurai" (which I liked) Oscar worthy. <br /> <br /> No, this piece of CGI junk is in the same company as Battlefield Terra, Omino and Gigli. The way this is currently rated at 7.2 completely confuses me. Brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all I can think of as answers. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but suffice it to say that I witnessed a train crash tonight. I have to go wash my eyes. 1 in 10
