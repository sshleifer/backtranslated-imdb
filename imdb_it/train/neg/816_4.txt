In the 1970s, WPIX ran "The Adventures of Superman" every afternoon for several years. From time to time, we received a surprise when they anticipated nearby shows to play "Superman and the Mole Men". I always looked forward to those days. Looking at him recently, I was surprised how bad he really was. <br /> <br /> It wasn't bad due to special effects or lack of it. True, George Reeves' Superman costume was pretty ugly, the edges of the foam padding making it more impressive and clearly visible. True, the costumes of the Mole Men were even worse. What must have been a furry coat would not have deceived a ten-year-old boy, since the zips, the hems of the sleeves and the badly messed fabric tailored to the baggy costumes were all painfully evident. But these were forgivable gaps. <br /> <br /> No, what made the villain were artificial plot devices. From time to time, Superman has done nothing to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Is a lynching looking for creatures? Rather than gathering the hysterical crowd or looking for the creatures himself, he stands up explaining the dangers of the situation to Lois and the public relations man. Are the creatures blocked? Again, he stands watching and talking, but he doesn't save them until they are fired. Luke Benson, the villain of the city, shoots him? Attempted murder for any reasonable person, but Superman releases the man over and over again to cause more problems. Superman has had many opportunities to break the problem at birth, but he never once took advantage of it. <br /> <br /> Having said that, both George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their characters well, seemingly immediately comfortable with the roles. If only they had a better script to work with.
