I had to do a research on the actresses to find the file of this film because the title is now An unexpected love. It's not worth looking for it, but I wasn't familiar with both leads and wondered why they were headlining a lesbian movie on Lifetime. Everything is rather sober and you really have no idea who these characters are, so as a spectator, I wasn't able to become emotionally invested in the plot. I guess I'm not the target audience for this, but I'm not sure who it is. Everything is mute and soft focus and earth tones ... nothing is very interesting. I had a curious interest in seeing two women, but it is managed so discreetly that I was disappointed. Rent Personal Best instead.
