I recently decided to revisit the Omen trilogy only to find that {insert demonic music here} is a fourth. I didn't expect much from this, and in this sense it certainly lives up to my expectations. If you like bad movies for a laugh, this could be the movie for you. Oh, where to start? <br /> <br /> From the start, the look and feel of the "made for TV" movie was obvious. Music has often been inappropriately combined with what was happening in the film and therefore (at best) distracting. The script had all the suspense of a fictional work of 8 years. But one thing that needs to be said is that the missing script was very well combined with the terrifying acting. Numerous scenes left me thinking about whether it was the script or the acting that was a source of ridicule. <br /> <br /> The story itself is pretty thin, centered on all the crazy crowds of Damien Thorn's daughter, adopted by the wrong and abused nuns. There is the usual number of mysterious and twisted deaths that made me yawn while the "drama" took place, and the usual third party investigator in the whole affair. Later, through some medical phenomena, Damien Thorn Jnr was born. And this practically envelops the plot. All of this is performed rather badly from the beginning with the lack of suspense making the film a monotonous and / or ridiculous scene after another. <br /> <br /> Were there many WTFs?!? also moments that provide unintended comedy relief. For example, what is the greatest overreaction at the beginning of the film when the child scratches his mother's cheek? Hardly a 360 degree omen. I also laughed at the overreaction to baptism. The baby cries and everyone seems very worried. The distressed mother runs out of the church and the priest remains very worried as he crosses himself. Eh? Then there is the new age nanny who seems to have a free hand in exposing an 8-year-old to all kinds of alternative spiritualism. I laughed when the nanny suggested I take the turbulent Delia to a psychic fair to meet the nanny's hippie friends and the mother shrugs and allows her. "Yes, it's fantastic, fill the head of the 8-year-old daughter with all these things of mysticism, it's beautiful, I don't need to be there." Naturally this would be expected from a mother who allows her daughter to adopt an adult Rottweiler they meet on the street and who could bite the girls as a snack. The whole scene at the psychic fair is quite comic in a slapstick way, from the reactionary stares of the psychics to Delia, to the following hell. <br /> <br /> I also laughed at how the death of the nun is considered an "anomalous accident". Here we have a religious fanatic, (who is described as part of a cult), who is fanatically preaching in a pit full of rattlesnakes to show how God's glory will protect them. Antagonize the snakes by handling them and SOMEHOW is bitten several times. Hardly a strange incident. More like a successful suicide attempt. <br /> <br /> The scene of snakes against nuns was not the only comic death. There is a low-speed car accident resulting in beheading in a school parking lot. Then there's the slow-motion demolition ball going directly to the detective. I think I could have gone to make a coffee when the slow motion only began to return to see the wrecking ball that was still headed straight for the "worried" detective. Then there is the quintessence of who kills, who clich√©s, where a gun goes off and both behave as if they had been hit for several seconds while they exchanged horrified glances. Then someone rushes down the stairs revealing who the real victim was. Furthermore, the death of the priest at the beginning of the film seemed a bit strange and useless. He runs around looking at the architecture of the church. Obviously finding this rather distressing, he eventually collapses, clutching his chest and dies. Something demonic was apparently happening, for this was what the music was suggesting. Ummm. OK. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that others have reviewed this film favorably and, in particular, as a "worthy sequel". It is difficult not to notice the senseless script, the unrealistic acting and the inappropriate musical score. The film has no suspense, relying heavily on Delia's "demonic look" to provide a sense of horror, which becomes rather annoying after a short while. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: this is a bad movie with the only saving feature that is the unintended potential of being a comedy.
