This is a bad B movie disguised as a mockumentary. The filmmaker of porn movies in the film has almost the same time as screenshots and dialogues of any other character. This completely destroyed any "documentary feeling" that they might have wanted to create. <br /> <br /> The fact that the film is not actually a mockumentary is the least of its problems. The film is not funny. The film is not sexy. The film has nothing interesting to say about the porn business. It is not even particularly salacious. While there is simulated sex, the amount of nudity is mild for a movie with R. <br /> <br /> One day someone will become a good mockumentary on the porn industry. This is not it.
