I bought this film from the discount container used by Gamestop and the cover made me laugh uncontrollably, so I bought it for 99cents. The film itself is delayed and they use like ten different monkeys throughout the film that hardly resemble each other. Not to mention the fact that they use a stunt double who is just a short, costume guy who desperately tries to impersonate a monkey. <br /> <br /> The director probably committed a murder-suicide with chimpanzees after the film premiered for some other low-fee Warner Bros. films and ended up having money in the studio. It also doesn't help that he wasn't even infamous for the terrible job he did, he wasn't even known for producing a poop poop movie. <br /> <br /> Why was this film ever made?
