This film is horribly played, written, directed and produced. But it's so campy that it's actually semi-watchable. This is SEMI watchable. <br /> <br /> The plot (what little there is) has virtually no meaning. The character of Barney Drum is the only real comic relief in the film and gets tired after about 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Many of the Canadian support casts can be found in TV commercials. None of them went on with anything else I know of. And, of course, also the less talented brother of Sly Stallone ..... = <br /> <br /> Curiosity: it was shot almost entirely in and around the small village of Claremont, Ontario. (about 20 miles northeast of Toronto) I recognized many local landmarks / intersections / buildings. I think the Drive-in scene was shot in the now-demolished "Oshawa Drive-in" just before it was shot down.
