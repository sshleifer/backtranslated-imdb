The moment the attacker left, I knew I was in trouble! The premise is ridiculous at best. The plot was even worse, if possible. <br /> <br /> The acting was rigid and the actors gave off a sense of inexperience. You expect more from people like Slater, Reid and Dorff. The lines were delivered like a robot. And I'm sorry, I like Reid but she was VERY incredible as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff have chosen a bad movie to try to stage their returns. <br /> <br /> The continuity occurred through the entire film. The creatures were not bad, but they were not even good. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, I want ninety minutes of my life back. They can keep the money, but give me time! What a waste.
