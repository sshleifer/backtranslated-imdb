This film masquerades as a social commentary, when in reality it is just as ridiculous as the racism it condemns. The premise of this film: African-American = Strong ... any other race = weak. The worst part is when Rapaport throws a gun on Omar Epps and a Jewish boy. The stereotyped Jewish boy crumbles in fear and begins to implore his life ... but the great, strong and rebellious Omar Epps is strong without fear. We also have the condemnation of every member of the fraternity as a drunken bully or a rapist. The raped white girl obviously starts to consider lesbianism since she's just a weak white girl, after all. When the white nerd boy is rejected by the members of the fraternity, obviously he must come into contact with the skinheads, who are incredible cowards; especially the big muscular guy who is quickly knocked down by strong black men. Wait ... ENVELOPE RYYS BEAT UP A GUY TWICE HIS SIZE ??? Yes sure. <br /> <br /> Obviously blacks NEVER refuse their people and Omar Epps easily moves with them. The scenes in which Ice Cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line are simply stupid - obviously he is the ruler while his weak white companions sit for fear of him and eventually come out. This film was simply terrible and the ending made me laugh really hard. The slow motion too long between Epps and Banks gets hilarious with the faces they make - it's like watching my nephew and cousins ​​make each other's faces (and they're all under 5). Do yourself a favor and skip this crapfest.
