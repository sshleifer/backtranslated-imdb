When I was a child, I remember seeing him while I was visiting a friend of our "uncle" Phil. We're back! A Dinosaur's Story is a silly cartoon about a dinosaur called Rex (voiced by the wonderful John Goodman). It tells a dinosaur boy the story of how dinosaurs returned to Earth to live. He explains that he was part of the thing that brought them back, along with some friends. I think the bad Doctor / Professor of this film may have been responsible for their return, but I don't care about him. The children might appreciate this, but personally it is too vulgar. John Goodman was probably the only decent thing. Poor!
