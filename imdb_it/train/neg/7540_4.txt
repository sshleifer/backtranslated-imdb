The Wicker Man, with Nicolas Cage, is not a good movie at all, but I can't really say it's one of those I regret having seen. I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the film, like the terrible acting and the long scenes in which Cage is looking for the girl, he has a hallucination, followed by another hallucination, followed by a sequence of dreams - with a hallucination , etc. ., but it is not worth dwelling on when it is a film like this. Instead, here are five reasons why you should watch The Wicker Man, even if it's ugly: <br /> <br /> 5. It is hard to deny that he has some really gruesome ideas, the only problem is in his version of cheese, unintentionally funny. If nothing else, this is a film that could inspire you to see the original 1973 movie, or even read the story on which it is based. <br /> <br /> 4. For a cheese horror / thriller, it's really aesthetically pleasing. It is quite obvious that it was shot outdoors instead of using the green screen or elaborate sets, so we can see some fantastic landscapes. There are also many well-made shots. It is a very beautiful film. <br /> <br /> 3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as a force of nature. Whether you are a fan or not, it seems that Cage is impossible to play a "normal guy". There is always a sort of eccentricity or nerdiness that leads to the characters he plays, and personally, I am always fascinated by seeing him in every film he makes. If Nicolas Cage is big or terrible, he always puts his unique energy into play and it is never boring to watch. It's terrible in The Wicker Man, but in the most wonderful way. <br /> <br /> 2. A student could probably write a hell of a paper on this film, as it seems to be the strongest anti-feminist film ever made. "To see?" you could write, "this is what happens when women are allowed to run a company!" Furthermore, the similarities between this society "Summersisle" and a colony of bees are quite interesting and noteworthy. <br /> <br /> 1. If you are reading this, chances are good that you have seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of "highlights" of the film, including Cage running in a bear dress and, of course, the infamous "AAGHH !! THE BEES !! MY EYES !!!" line. These scenes are hilarious out of context, and are still quite funny while you look at them in their entirety. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD used at Blockbuster for about $ 5 ... when you work it, it's a dollar rightly. It's a good deal. <br /> <br /> NOTE: The Unrated version of the film is the best to watch, and it is best to look at the Theatrical version only for its addition in epilogue, which features a cameo by James Franco.
