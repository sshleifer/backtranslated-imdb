I don't think any of Van Damme's films will ever beat Universal Soldier but you never know. This film was good but not as good as the first one. VD returns a Luc and must do battle again. He tries 2 b funny here, but maybe a little laugh is worth a laugh. VD has a son this time from Ally W., good showed a picture of them 2. Goldberg was handsome, he makes his famous move, he forgot what it's called because I don't watch wrestling. VD and Goldberg have had good fights. It was the ending like the 1st but it's not so nice. VD makes his best move in his career, as always, the HELICOPTER KICK. Although, the final finish should have been longer. However, it is worth seeing, but it will never exceed the original.
