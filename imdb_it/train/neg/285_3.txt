It is not really about gymnastics; swap occasional training montages and it could be just as simple with regard to archery, microbiology or a booger throwing tournament. Instead, like any other derivative of Rocky / Flashdance that flooded the market in the 1980s, it is about conquering adversity with the stick-to-power, making all social / personal realities irrelevant to your solitary - naturally with love interest . Ronald Reagan from top to bottom, in short; as well as a piece of cinema is down to the details. Some of the actors are eccentric enough to spice things up - especially the love interest, presented by none other than Mr. Keanu Reeves, who is warming up for Ted; Olivia D'Abo's hateful alkie dad and Olivia D'Abo's big-haired half-sister are more interesting than her sickly mother or her completely inert nemines / teammates, one of whom seems made of porcelain. It is my instinct to be horrified by the comic colored guys, but on the other hand at least they are in the film. But D'Abo does not completely convince with his embarrassing shtick, and in the absence of any other narrative focal point, the lack of interest in gymnastics itself really counts; they are just bodies whizzing around, and not only is the result of the big tournament a foregone conclusion, it is all done by an obvious double.
