I've seen my share of Woody Allen's films and, although they're not always fantastic, you can usually be sure that you'll have fun. Probably the last really good ones were Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95) - since then the ones I've seen have been clear but watchable. And so when I was invited to watch Woody Allen's new film Melinda and Melinda, of which I wasn't even aware, it was released again, I went happily. I hadn't heard much about it, so I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> What I got was definitely the worst Woody Allen movie I've seen. The premise is too explained, the cast is terrible, the script is slow and lifeless. Too many scenes said nothing and yet they were extensive, I presume to fill in what would otherwise have become a 15-minute short film. <br /> <br /> I don't care about the concept behind this film - two directors discuss how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and obviously the film proceeds to show it to us, interpreting both scenarios. The problem is that none of these two "films" is any good. The comedy is not funny and the tragedy is not very tragic. It seems that Allen had a good idea, but then he lost time or time to complete the film. <br /> <br /> Even the general level of acting is definitely negative - Will Ferrell is the only one who brings something to the table, and is basically an impression of Woody Allen. Previously good actors like Chloe Sevigny turned out to be boring and the worst of the group is Radha Mitchell as Melinda (which is a shame because her character is present in almost every scene!). <br /> <br /> just for the actors, the script they are working with is deficient if not non-existent. Definitely far from the Allen we know and love from classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.
