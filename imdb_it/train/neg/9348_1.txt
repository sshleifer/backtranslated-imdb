I found this film embarrassing to watch. I felt like I was putting the plot in my throat as if I couldn't understand the subtleties I needed to constantly dub everything for myself. <br /> <br /> Having a father who is still an alcoholic, I didn't really think it was a movie about alcoholism as such. Alcoholics, real alcoholics are very lonely people inside, in my opinion, of course. They find it difficult to communicate, something the main character has had no problem with, except that he had a problem saying that I love you at some point - which was a bit of a struggle to establish his cold character. He was constantly surrounded by people too! <br /> <br /> I felt cheated that at no time were we really alone with the character to really understand his inner loneliness and turmoil. I couldn't connect with the character and I didn't feel any connection at all, considering my father. I heard absolutely nothing when it was over, only the relief was over. <br /> <br /> Kevin McKidd is an ok actor but he is not a protagonist of the hard genre! The orange clockwork thing was as thin as a brick. McKidd was too old for the teenager, had to have three different characters or avoid the stage for teenagers and focus more on the adult McKidd. <br /> <br /> On a good note, I heard that the little actor was really good at the beginning of the film !!
