I am not an artistically inclined individual. I am a woman with a scientific mindset and I felt that this film was perhaps one of those types of campy animated films with a limited budget. I watched part of it with my boyfriend and my future stepdaughter. We tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest. My boyfriend and daughter voted and we moved to Ocean's 13, but that's another story. In order not to be discouraged, I woke up the next morning and gave the film another shot. I started watching this movie seriously again. I just don't understand, I thought I understood it. I thought the most fun part was the rinsing of the ashes and the urn that found a spot near the fireplace used as a vase for those that looked like dead flowers. Interesting and still inside he had dead things. It was a strange and bizarre film. Perhaps this is what they were looking for, however I will not be deceived a second time!
