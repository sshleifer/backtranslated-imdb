This cowardly and offensive film intrigued me at the beginning. The characters are the young male dispossessed family who often see themselves bored in a seaside town. Robert is a stranger but he has his music that may have been his soul. Instead Clay makes Robert a monster who embarks on a journey into cannabis and ecstasy and intrudes on the wrong crowd. Clay seems to believe in the "reefer madness" and Robert ends the film as a homicidal rapist. One wonders how much experience of real life this young director has. No one can save poor Robert. Clay leaves us with the message that British youth are out of control. A very unclear link is made to the Iraqi insurgents; during the graphic rape we are in vain subject to explosions and images of war. The film shows the extremism of male peer groups pushed to its limits. London's young bombers draw a parallel with Clay's hateful description of the modern male. Clay implies that men simply cannot avoid inflicting terrible acts of violence. It is astonishing that the British film industry allows it to invest money in films that support such divisive propaganda, when in London we are still recovering from recent attacks. This is Clay's first film, I would be happy if it was his last.
