I'm all for the idea of ​​a great epic of the American Revolutionary War. This is not it. (And for that matter, not even Emmerich / Devlin / Gibson THE PATRIOT. But I digress.) <br /> <br /> I saw this film during an advertising screening at the old MGM Studios (now Sony) just before it came out . The audience had high expectations for this expensive vintage piece, written by veteran Robert Dillon, directed by the esteemed Hugh Hudson (of the fame of CHARIOTS OF FIRE), and played by Al Pacino. <br /> <br /> But it didn't take long for people to start squirming, whispering derisive comments about Pacino's horribly battered accent - he had to be an American frontman of Scottish descent (!) - and that of Nastassja Kinski, who she must have recently emigrated to England (!!). Then the story started and everything went downhill. <br /> <br /> The reasons were confused, the dialogue was atrocious, the events had no historical or political context. What there was of a plot dragged on absurd coincidences; by the second or third time that the alleged lovers Pacino and Kinski stumbled into one another had become a bad joke. Donald Sutherland gave an inconclusive performance as a British / pederast officer. His accent was also on the whole map. I imagine there were no English actors available. <br /> <br /> Many people have left. Those who remained tried to choke the giggles, then openly sneered. I pulled it out - I realized that at least the battle scenes could be good. I was wrong. Inexplicably, Hudson chose to film them with hand-held cameras, not even with the Steadicam, the rudeness of giving an "authenticity" to the newsreel that ruined the sense of scale. <br /> <br /> There was an almost famous TV reviewer in the audience in front of me: (the late) Gary Franklin of Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I could tell he was irritated by the behavior of all of us. And sure enough, on his television segment the next day he gave the film a '10' on his infamous 'Franklin Scale from 1 to 10', while he was hastily observing the louts who had interrupted the screening the night before, which clearly was not We know the art when they see it. What a fool. <br /> <br /> After this disaster, Pacino did not star in another film for almost 4 years. Hugh Hudson's career never recovered. You can't say I didn't warn you.
