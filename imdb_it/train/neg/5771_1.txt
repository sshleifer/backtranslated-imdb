I will begin by apologizing to filmmakers around the world for using the terms "director", "film" or "film" in relation to this, but "criminal" and "crime against humanity" seem a bit harsh. <br /> Writing: pathetic. <br /> <br /> The direction: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Acting: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: too inept for words. <br /> <br /> The technical skills used to assemble this atrocity: NONE OF ALL. <br /> <br /> This mass of waste could hardly be called cinema. Most family films are closer to gaining this distinction than Revenge Quest. No, this is just an accumulation of 10 machines captured on video. <br /> <br /> We will skip the plot in this review, because there are too many holes to cover at the same time. Let's just say it smells worse than the rest of this movie. Calling one-dimensional acting would give them credit. What little there is, it is atrocious to begin with, and made much worse by the terrible video and editing. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this atrocity, however, apart from the plot, should be the effect ... or rather its lack of disturbance. There are no empty spaces in the guns, no flashes, and what few sound effects existed were "gun" stock sounds, or were generated by mouth (yes, you read that right). The director really had the audacity to record a "shh" sound for the elevator doors; I think he felt it made them look more futuristic. This should be fixed in the year 2031, after all. However, this does not explain the sounds he created by mouth for punching fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't bad enough, the sound quality is terrible (he just used the microphone mounted on the camera, and shows), the use of the sounds of the standard pistol was almost worse than not at all the sounds. The sound effects are distinguished from the rest of the soundtrack like a drunken yak in a flock of sheep, and they are equally clumsy. Imagine this: the villain enters an office building in search of his prey. A lady starts running in fear. He raises his gun (an uzi) and shakes it. We hear a sound that is clearly not a uzi. The woman escapes from the camera, and suddenly a single packet of blood (only 1) explodes on her back (she seems to have been hit by a paintball), and falls into her face. <br /> <br /> Bear in mind that my description makes too much justice to the inaction of the real sequence. <br /> <br /> In another sequence, one that almost - but not quite - makes the movie quite fun to watch, takes place in a stairwell. The bad guy chases the good guy and the lady he is protecting down the stairs, shaking his plastic to the bottom. You may want to pant; there are poor time sound effects flying everywhere. <br /> <br /> I suppose Alan DeHerrera cannot be locked up to conceive this railway wreck, but he followed up the assembly and release. If there is justice, there will certainly be some karma out there with its name. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this lump of industrial waste - and would strongly advise against it - make sure you watch for all the scenes raised almost literally by Bladerunner and the AM radio that also serves as a walkie-talkie. Try not to focus too much on the plot; it will only hurt you more if you do it. <br /> <br /> 0 stars of 10. And this is being generous.
