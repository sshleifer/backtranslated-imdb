For those of you who have never heard of it (or seen it on A & E), Cracker is a brilliant British television program about an overweight psychologist, an inveterate smoker and a source named Fitz who helps the Manchester police department enter the head of violent criminals. It is considered one of the best shows ever to come out of England (and this is saying something), and has been a huge success in England and around the world in 1993. <br /> <br /> Now, the original stars have Ri - collaborated with the original writer to take out another 2-hour episode. I've loved this show since I first saw it over a decade ago. The DVD box set contains a place of honor in my collection, and I can cite a good part of Fitz's interrogation scenes practically word for word. The idea of ​​Robbie Coltrane who came back to work with Jimmy McGovern for another TV movie about Fitz filled me with absolute joy. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the beautiful. One of the many things that struck me about the original Cracker series was how quickly Fitz was called a character. Five minutes in the first episode ?? with his lecture (throwing the books in the air), his drink, and his cursing the boy after him on the gambling queue? and you knew, I just knew, who this character was. You could hear it "click" in your mind, the kind of click that only happens when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writer. <br /> <br /> Coltrane, of course, remained great during the show, but have I always heard that some of the latest episodes ?? those not written by McGovern ?? abused the character. <br /> <br /> So the good news is this: Fitz is back. As soon as you see it in this show ?? make incredibly inappropriate comments to your daughter's wedding ?? you will hear that "click" again. It is he: petulant a moment and sincerely sorry the next, always perceptive, sincere to the point of being tactless, but brilliantly funny in the process. If you love this character as much as I do, you will be happy with how it is portrayed in the film. And this extends to Judith and Mark: in fact, everything that has to do with the Fitz is managed to perfection. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with this movie revolves around the crime that Fitz is trying to solve. In the standard Cracker fashion, do we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes ?? the suspense is to see Fitz understand it. In this case, we have a serial killer who is out for American blood. And the reason for this, unfortunately, is not due to any credible psychological trauma? rather, it appears that the murders are here simply to allow the writer to show his personal political beliefs. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to write it, because I really believe that Jimmy McGovern is one of the greatest writers in the world. Nor do I have a problem with films that deal with current issues, or films that take a political position. But in the Cracker universe, we expect to see the characters behaving like human beings, not like caricatures. Instead, the Americans in this film are all depicted in a completely stereotyped way. They don't know anything, the Mormonians who complain about everything, treat the locals as disgusting and cheating on their wives ?? one of them even manages to do all of the above in less than 5 minutes. I honestly thought I mistaken channels or something by mistake. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't end there. Do we receive constant memories of how badly the war in Iraq is going? reminders that have absolutely nothing to do with history and appear practically from nothing. The killer is so busy talking about how Bush is worse than Hitler who almost forgets to go ahead with the murder; but more precisely, he is such a spokesman for the political opinions of the writer that he forgets to behave like a credible human being, and therefore we ?? as a public ?? I would not buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man to a tortured soul of serial killings. <br /> <br /> Can't I say this ruined the show for me ?? it was still a good TV, better than almost all the rest of the genre (mainly due, once again, to Coltrane). But has his constant politicization made it impossible for him to be as good as the real Cracker classics like "To Be A Somebody"? an episode that was equally "problematic", but that was managed with much more subtlety and psychological depth. <br /> <br /> Two other small points: Panhandle not being around is a disappointment, but what's worse is its replacements. The whole police department ?? which for so long has been filled with such great characters - now it is full of vanilla. Completely interchangeable cops that lack any personality (how could the personality of Richard Coyle of Coupling be drained beyond me, but in fact he is missing here). <br /> <br /> Also, there are a couple of moments when the show has lost its credibility for me. One of these cases revolves around Fitz, forcing the entire population of Manchester to be restricted from 1 million to a hundred based on very strange criteria (French windows? How does the computer know if I have French windows?)? not only can he do it, but he succeeds in less than an hour. I don't think so. <br /> <br /> So all in all, I was a little disappointed. Viewing is recommended, but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door. Still, if there are new series after this, everything would have been all right: I am convinced that McGovern can still write great things, and maybe now that he has his politics out of his system, he can go back to writing about people.
