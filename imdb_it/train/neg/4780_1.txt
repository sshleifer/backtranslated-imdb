I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I've ever seen. I would recommend this comic to people under 5 years old. I liked this show when I was 4 and 5 years old, I still looked at it only when there was nothing. Now there are 5 more and I would rather do my homework than watch it. The comic was a bit strange but it wasn't enough to make me laugh. Now I'm older, I'm interested in showing that the witch doesn't classify us. I started watching Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I'm interested in things to do with Doctor Who so I'm not interested in 5-year cartoons. This cartoon didn't last very long, it only had 6 seasons, it was canceled due to poor viewers, but some say it's because the writers have run out of ideas, but for most other shows they have at least 8 seasons.
