Heavenly Days commits a serious comedy faux pas: it is desperate to teach us a lesson in civic education, and it will not stop until we have passed the final exam. Fibber McGee and Molly make a trip to Washington, where they see the senate in action (or inaction, if you prefer), they spit with their senator (Eugene Palette in one of the worst roles of his career), getting acquainted with a pack of annoying stereotypical refugee children, and meeting a man on a train reading a book by Henry Wallace. Henry Wallace !! A year later, he was considered an almost communist fool, but in 1944 he was A-OK. Add some really horrible musical moments, lots of scourged banners and a boring subplot on journalists, and you have a movie that must have had Philip Wylie ready to write Generation of Vipers 2: D. Boogaloo. Drastically inadequate, Heavenly Days is another reminder that the devil has the best melodies.
