There was no original idea in this story. The themes have been extracted from various sources; some are The Ninth Gate, In the Mouth of Madness (another film by Carpenter) and The Ring. He even went so far as to present the same damn light circle of The Ring and use it as the film's namesake. The soundtrack of Cody Carpenter was completely raised by Suspiria. We hope that no one will oppose this comment by spreading the word HOMAGE around. Yes, I saw that the theater was playing Argento's Deep Red. To affirm a tribute would be bullshit. This was the bottom of the barrel. Throwing throats and "disturbing" images in the dish do not make a good horror film. The carpenter knew it. It should fade into darkness or acquire a time machine.
