This is an OK movie, but it lacks a real depth, both emotional and in terms of story telling. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on real events and this limits the amount of stock to virtually zero, without any real suspense. <br /> <br /> Washington is credible in the lead role but is sleeping through it, there is no room to flex acting muscles for him or the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> The story simply falls a bit flat, even though I had never heard of the title character, the ending was obvious but unlike other films about such injustices this has no emotional impact, you He cares about him and the motivations of those outside help to seem more academic, concerned about his well-being. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt to inject some emotion using the boy outside of whom the hero adores Carter but this seems forced. <br /> <br /> It's an OK movie but instantly forgettable.
