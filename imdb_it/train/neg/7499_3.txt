John Leguizemo, a wonderful comedian, is a Latin from New York, capable of entering a myriad of characters, both male and female, to show the bizarre weaknesses of an ethnic group that tries to cope with an alien culture. However, it is not Italian. Does not look, think or behave in Italian ... Especially Sicilian or Calabrese, groups of immigrants living in Bensonhurst or Bayridge Brooklyn. Every scene in which he interacts with his "Gumbas" sounds false, as if he had wandered from a university production of "West Side Story" while the other boys were doing a "Mean Streets" at low cost. This is just a problem with this ill-conceived and spiritistic film. Spike detonated this great moment. Btw, CBGBOMFUG means "Country, Bluegrass, Blues and other music for budding gourmets (or perhaps the Gourmands)" He asks Hilly Crystal who founded the club. <br /> <br />
