There is nothing else I can say but to say that this film was horrible. All of Chinese people awakened in your being because of their ancestors was a hard sell. But tell the public that every Chinese knows Chinese history without even studying it, simply ridiculous. It is like saying that every American knows American history without studying or every Filipino, etc. Etc. It is not credible. <br /> <br /> The plot is horrible. He spoke of Shin coming from a monastery in China - later identified by Bejing. However, the first sequences of the film show the map that focuses on Mongolia. I know that the current Chinese regime wants to claim areas like Mongolia, granted. But it is a distinct nation and even labeled "Mongolia" on the map. Have Disney Studios failed the 5th Grade Geography? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is superficial at best, yet she somehow feels connected to him. His training is also in a good mood. And, let's leave you speechless: everything about this film is ugly. It's bad enough to laugh and cry. The action of Taekwondo has been over and unrealistic in many cases. <br /> <br /> The evil eyes thing was poor. However, the left end would have been the only thing of descent in this regard. They should have let the bad eyes end up in it. But instead the evil is somehow defeated. Yey! <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not worth the dog's time in the film. Brenda Song should get along with another study. "F"
