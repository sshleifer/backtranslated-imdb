The film is bad. Nothing special - just a "kid" movie with nothing serious. But there is a reason to observe this: the discourse of animals. Some of them are so funny in what they say, you can't stop laughing. So if you want to hear a dog in the dog say "I'm Keyser Soze", or another animal that says "You're a walking dead cat", or many other buffoons, look. Because there is no other good movie to watch it. Rating: 4 out of 10.
