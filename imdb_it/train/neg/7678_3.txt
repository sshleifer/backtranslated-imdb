This is a poorly made remake, poor of the classic Parineeta of Bimalda. The story is based on the book by Sarat Chandra of the same name and is a distortion of the original. Well, you can appreciate a certain degree of creativity but not fake creativity. Everyone's acting is influenced and the whole film is a fiction. The choice of words by Shekar's father in the abuse of Lolita (Balan) seems cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again the scene in which Shekhar (Saif) slaps Lolita is completely out of place with the flow of the film and the characters, it's pretty shocking to the senses, and could have been easily avoided. Likewise the sex scene between Saif and Balan is rather unseemly for the film and an economic gimmick to attract the public. When a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys its spirit, work goes to pieces. The song "piyu bole" is quite OK. Another silver coating in the dark cloud of this film is the scene in which Saif defends himself and rebels against his father. This is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit. On these counts this film deserves 3 stars. Rekha's song and dance have a touch of firework and is a trick. The song is melodic but I remember hearing it somewhere before and if I am not mistaken the melody seems to have been plagiarized. <br /> <br /> Well, okay, times have changed since then. But this film does not even reflect modern times. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when modern Bollywood directors are increasingly obsessed with impressing NRIs and grabbing the lucrative NRI entertainment market. These films belong neither to India nor to any other part of the world.
