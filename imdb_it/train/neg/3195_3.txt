Two titles in the first row: I think Joe Don Baker can be good or even fantastic with the right material and the right director (the remake of "Cape Fear", a small role in "Goldeneye", "Walking Tall"). And I also liked Baker in "Mitchell", because he played an antihero who was SUPERIOR to be unlikely. Yes, the coverage of MST3K was hilarious, but Baker did a lot of cheap shots - which didn't deserve - to keep things lively and fun - it was appropriate to the level and tone of the movie, and it was the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Final Justice" seems to be more or less the same, but despite the exotic locations and the "cowboy frontier justice" theme, it is a bit weaker than "Mitchell". And the main reason is that Baker's character, as written, is an idiot. The film has the presumption that, as Baker embodies the old-fashioned frontier chauvinism, he challenges his opponents to fast-paced old-fashioned hand contests. And since he is so strong and macho, he always wins, even when he is wounded, wounded, outnumbered, etc. <br /> <br /> It is a presumption with great potential (it worked for Gary Cooper), even if it condemns the film as "B". But Baker is so stupid and obsessive as to needlessly challenge three of the villain's henchmen to a showdown in a public market, with civilians everywhere. He may have simply taken them to the headquarters of the head of the bad guys (which was why he was following them in the first place) and they would never have noticed. Or he could get the fall on them and forced them to surrender, and got one of the henchmen to take him to headquarters at the gun point. But no, he must be a bush league hot dog and a macho blockhead, and so he gets a child taken as a hostage in the ensuing shooting! <br /> <br /> Is this a guy we should admire? <br /> <br /> The whole film is fundamentally so. Most of the secondary actors go somewhere between OK (the hounds) and pretty good (the bad boss and his father, who are two well-known European actors - they have just done things, but they are professionals and even take it in around are decent). But through all this, the character of Baker attracts nonsense and stupid and unproductive mistakes that kill at least two relatively innocent people, in addition to a couple of villains who may have been brought to life without the use of deadly force. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, since 90% of the film is set in Malta or in the Mediterranean, you can see many beautiful landscapes and many beautiful and exotic extras. And actually, Baker himself could be a bit heavy and a bit dyspeptic, but it's not so bad ... it's certainly not the fact that critics of this film (including Mike and the Bot in their hilarious cover) seem to think . <br /> <br /> In short, this film is good for the video background, but the viewer should not pay attention to it.
