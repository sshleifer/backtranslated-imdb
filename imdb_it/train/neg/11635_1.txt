Okay, this is a short and sweet review ... Something that the movie should have taken a practice would have made her life shorter and sweeter than it was. <br /> <br /> This movie is $ ^ @%. There is a good reason why there was a petition with over 40,000 signatures + ALL those that asked Uwe Boll to stop making films from franchisees. Blood Rayne is a biggie there. <br /> <br /> The jokes are good ... if you've never heard them a thousand times before. The acting is down but you can really blame the script just for that. I also wonder if they are even using a script. <br /> <br /> The film has little to NOTHING to do with the original games. HI, if you played the games, you know that the main character doesn't have a real motivation outside of the homicidal stimuli like mass murder because he smashed his toe or simulate. There is too much history for such a stupid movie. as I said. I would NOT even steal this movie. And for the person who says this is "The funniest movie of 2007" .......... need to take a look around, the news is better than this.
