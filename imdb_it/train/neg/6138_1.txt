This film was terrible, from conception to execution. Does the United States need to create a "Star Wars" site in this remote country? Is this their premise? The way to gain access, concludes the American, is to win an obstacle course like the cross-country race, where the winner can ask for anything from the leader. And who is better to win this competition known as the "game" of a gymnast? Obviously! A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission. And don't forget that his father was an agent. Fortunately for our hero, there are gym equipment in lucky places, like the horse with stone handles in the middle of a square (without a reason) in the middle of a crazy city. Perfect. <br /> <br /> But above and beyond the horrible, HORIBBLE premise, are the clumsy clumsy of romantic scenes, obviously very depressed ninja whose only work seems to be to hold a flag to indicate the race course, and the worst climax ever. After winning the race, our hero expresses the wishes of the US government. And here, all the efforts were worth it, because the United States has their "Star Wars" site! Huzzah! IS THIS YOUR TRIUMPH CLOSURE?! Wow. <br /> <br /> But still, being such a bad movie can be a lot of fun to watch. The cover alone, depicting ninja with machine guns, was enough to make me rent this movie. <br /> <br /> But if you were to meet Kurt Thomas (the gymnast) in real life, you probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 1/2 twists in the layout position.
