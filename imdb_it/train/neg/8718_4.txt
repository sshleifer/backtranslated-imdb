The third installment of the "Carnosaur" trilogy includes a group of Keystone Kops-quality military commandos trying to kill two Velociraptors and one T-Rex. I give a 4 of pure sympathy and my affinity with the dinosaurs. The film is certainly the worst of the trilogy, it cannot be taken seriously. More significantly, however, watching this film I can't help but notice some interesting parallels between the "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" trilogies. The first episode in both franchises is a dark and disturbing film that has become a cult classic, the second is an "alien" repudiation, and the third is an ironic, almost slapstick (both intentional and non-intentional) film that You're Rolling on the floor laughing. Furthermore, like the "Xtro" franchise, all "Carnosaur" films are completely foreign to each other. They only carry the name of the franchise to arouse interest in the "sequels", I guess. Obviously "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" have two different production groups working here, but if you've seen all three films from both franchises you find yourself referring back and forth between the two.
