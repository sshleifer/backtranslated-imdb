<br /> <br /> I recently saw this atrocity in my film program, and I thought it was horrible, as I said in my slogan, it was pretentious, trivial, petty and phenomenally self-important. <br /> I consider myself a movie fan, and all the things the film has to offer. If I want to see a documentary on the Cannes Film Festival, I will look at A & E ... and probably would be much more objective about it. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend it, period. <br /> <br />
