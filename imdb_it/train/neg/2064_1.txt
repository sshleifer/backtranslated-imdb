Oh dear. While Chevy Chase and the SNL band have imposed new highs with the sketch show format, this fails miserably at every level. Fortunately Chevy is barely in this and cannot be blamed for this triple. It is seriously very, very bad. Despite being destined to be a political commentary on the United States at the time of its release (1974), it remained neither funny nor acutely observed. The sketches are too long and any saturated impact they may have had is lost because they are all drawn to complete boredom. This is credited as Chevy's film debut and I am pleased to say that everything he did after that has improved. Avoid even if curious.
