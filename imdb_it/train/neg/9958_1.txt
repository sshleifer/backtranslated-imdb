If you like the easiest, regressive, self-indulgent, anti-establishment and anti-civilization, then this is the ideal film. Sparsely scripted, with often incomprehensible dialogues and an infuriating and annoying camera everywhere, this is a film that presents the world in captivating and simplistic Manichean terms: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors) are numb and clumsy at best and predatory monsters in the worst case. The only escape from the horrors of civilization as a whole is a lot of primitive screams (yawn) and childish regression (literally) in a primitive space similar to a cave in the woods, with the utopia that takes the form of a rave party - again, in the woods (of course ...). Show all the weaknesses of a first movie and much more.
