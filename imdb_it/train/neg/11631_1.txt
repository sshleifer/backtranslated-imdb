Today I wrote this review angrily to Uwe Boll and Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has produced films based on one of our nation's darkest days. 911 changed everything. It has changed our perception of security. It has changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity. The most important and devastating thing is that it has changed our world. <br /> <br /> However, I cannot fail to point out how completely rejected, disillusioned and angry I am with the ignorant and shameless Hollywood ignorance that seeks to make a profitable profit from death and destruction. This film and those like him are destined to cause controversy between word of mouth between spectators and critics; certainly to echo the mainstream press. Hollywood has sunk into a new low. Even lower than the low-level bastards who perpetrated the most barbarous acts of ferocity and inexorable cruelty. Behind all this is Uwe Boll. I am very angry with this film. How dare you disrespect the memories of the families of those who have been lost? How dare they make fun of the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the towers doomed on that fateful day of infamy?!?!? How dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the fog of a post-911 mourning and tired world?!?!?! How dare they ... ... don't they? <br /> <br /> To those who have the courage to think they see this morally frightening trauma, I say this with a heavy heart with all my strength: Remember. Think back to that day and ask yourself if you are a healthy and moral person. Think back to that day, ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and a dishonor for the lives lost on that day. Think back to that day of protest of the families of loved ones. Think back to that day of lives lost on those two floors. Think back to the further carnage that resulted from the attacks. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself if you have a soul. <br /> <br /> Think. Remember. Respect the memories of lives lost on 911 by not seeing this movie at all.
