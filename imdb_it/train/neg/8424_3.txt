This film can be evaluated from three points of view: as a story, as a profile of Amin, as an imaginary thriller. <br /> <br /> It fails as a story, mentions in passing the coup that threw out Obote, the expulsion of the Asians, and has the Entebbe hi-jack in the background, but not in a chronological time frame coherent. <br /> <br /> As Amin's profile may have been interesting, because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good, and if this were a better movie, he would get an Oscar. (He understood that - which shows that Oscar's voters don't watch the films they voted for.) Ignore the relevant historical episodes of the novel, which noted Amin and the history of Uganda from the doctor's point of view. Instead it tells the fictitious story of the Scottish doctor and his impossible love life from Amin's point of view. But the story told is the only incident of which Amin was probably innocent. <br /> <br /> As a fictionalized thriller, there is no plot to keep it together. The beginning is tense - we need cinematographic freedom with the novel, but the story is set. The character of the doctor is well defined, but is lost in the second part of the film that suffers accordingly. <br /> <br /> Why does the doctor decide to stay in Kampala is poorly explained, seduced by the power? It's strange to be friends with anyone. The character of the friend in the novel has been lost because the Scotsman has the relationship instead of the black doctor - an entanglement tangle that does not even seem vaguely credible, but allows the film's writers to show Amin's ferocity at hand. The man called Horse bite at the end is laughable. <br /> <br /> Finally in 1971, Uganda drove to the left, not to the right, the plates were three letters and two or three numbers - and where are the equator's fangs ?! <br /> <br /> In short - if you've never heard of Amin, you could spend two hours watching this movie to appreciate Forest Whitaker's acting, but the last hour will bore you to confusion. If you know Uganda or read the book - don't see the movie - it will only depress you. And if you want to know why the doctor was so inconsiderate - he wasn't.
