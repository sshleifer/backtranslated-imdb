This is one of the worst movies ever made. Banal. Predictable. Flat. <br /> <br /> The only thing that evaluated a point was the presence of some beautiful scenes that highlighted Barcelona. I imagine they would use movies like this in Guantanamo or some other hidden CIA / NSA prison to torture suspects. <br /> <br /> Often bad movies have some saving features, this one has nothing. If I were in it or worked there, I'd change my name. Really an asshole. It is difficult to write more, but I believe that the spectators of the world have needed a heads up on this. On the other hand, it will be a great gift for the people you can't stand. <br /> <br /> You could send it to politicians you don't like, to laws, ex-wives, teachers you hated, former employees, Dick Cheney, W. and a host of others.
