What can I say about the cruel intentions 2? Well, I can honestly say, I'll only watch this movie again if I'm tied to a chair and my eyes are open in orange style. <br /> <br /> The movie "stars" Robin Dunne (No, I never even heard of him), whose terrible impression of Ryan Phillipe made me shudder. In a terrible cast case, Dunne tries (and fails) to act as a charming charismatic, charmer. Since the actor is not handsome, neither charismatic nor charming, the character is left completely unbelievable. Amy Adams, (she was in a buffy episode once), tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off and stages the very complicated Katherine ... However, Adams is not a good actress and her performance was flat and devoid of real emotions, it often seemed like it was reading the paperwork just outside the camera. There were two good actors in the film, however, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs. Kensington in Austion Powers), performed very good and fun performances like Sebastian and Katherine's parents and are the the only reason why he evaluated the film as a 2, not a 1. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a poor version of the original, with basses as low as dialogues and imitated scenes that lacked the originality of the previous film. <br /> <br /> I think, as a TV show, it could have worked, but if it had been re-founded with people who could actually act in the main parts.
