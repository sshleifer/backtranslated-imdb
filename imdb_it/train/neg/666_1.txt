I saw this trailer and thought that my god is this movie for real, that he would like to see this movie and at the same time I thought, my girlfriend turned to me and said "we have to go see this movie". ..so said so I saw this about 5 minutes and tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the scary cheap, but there weren't even one of those. It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen the director has no influence, no perspective the same shots were used again and still did not create suspense, the cast was probably simply said scream cried run away. I'd like to see the script as the first 40 minutes were mostly annoying giggles and bad music, there was absolutely no character development. <br /> <br /> The plot is just ... well, there was no plot at the bottom I know I will terrorize a high school group during the night of the dance with a serial killer stalker, it's great! hmmm Acting was what you expect from a hopeless Australian soap opera, the main character in the Blondie dam that bothered me. his longest line must have been a half sentence, and every time he was in front of the camera he was just pulling another rude expression. <br /> <br /> Please listen to me if you have any taste in the movies don't go see this, and if you like me and you don't have a good choice then I wish you luck, maybe smuggling in an iPod or a magazine. I can't believe this movie was made!
