He has a very bad acting. Lines of bad history. Bad Characters You should never see this show if you see it. SWITCH IT OFF. Or you're doing the balls for the next 30 minutes. It should never have been aired. It's not great. You should never see it. EVER AND NEVER. So now, if you ever want to see this show, please don't do it. Go to THE CW for Smallville. Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place, or Nick for Drake & Josh, those are shows for much better families. So believe me, I've seen it before. and it's honestly, and I say Honestly, the worst show I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of TV. So do me a favor, and never watch this show.
