As for the B movies, SCARECROW is one of those that are so bad, that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit down. A lonely losing high school student who is constantly taken in charge by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up walking in his sweeper stuff having sex with a drunkard. Then he chases the boy into a nearby cornfield and kills him. Apparently, the soul of the children was transferred to a scarecrow that then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as the teachers. This scarecrow, in addition to having a single corset for each of its victims, can also do somersaults like the Matrix through the air and kill people on the sidewalks in broad daylight. Also, why did he always look like a decomposed corpse? Just like the two unnecessary sequels that followed this, it's not even worth laughing.
