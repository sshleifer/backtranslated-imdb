First, I have to admit it's not a good movie. And I would never watch this movie if Pacino wasn't in it. <br /> <br /> The film is about the strange 24 hours of an advertiser. And he is overworked, dazed, sick and sometimes sorry. I'm not really boring, after 20 minutes you might fall asleep. And I don't understand why Pacino wanted to be part of this horrible film. Just for money or what? <br /> <br /> Since I am a passionate Pacino fan, I bought this 2002 movie People I Know.If you haven't bought it yet, you don't even think about it, it's just a waste of time.
