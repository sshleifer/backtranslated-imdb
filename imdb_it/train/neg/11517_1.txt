I really wanted this film to like it because the critics were unkind <br /> <br /> (to say the least) ... but it was terrible. Really terrible. Badly <br /> <br /> acted, a light-hearted script, the direction of cack-handed ... Watching this movie was <br /> <br /> like watching a car accident- you want to watch from another leave but keep looking <br /> <br /> because you want to see how chaotic it will be. Well, the car is <br /> destroyed and there are no survivors. On the positive side, photography <br /> <br /> was beautiful, it made me want to go on vacation, if only to purify myself from <br /> <br /> this wicked man
