First of all, the reason I'm giving this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least Peter Falk gave his usual great performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly useless attempt to make a movie. <br /> <br /> At first I was excited to read the comment of a poster that Andrew Stevens in this film gave "his career performance." For me, it was Stevens' abyss exhibition that completely ruined this film, and so I was ready to hurl any kind of insult at the person who made the above comment. Then I thought to myself, what else did Stevens do? So I checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. In the 17 years since this Columbo film was made, apparently every one of the 33 projects in which Stevens has been in the past has been bad, so it's doubtful that anyone has ever seen the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> If you like Columbo, look at the other 69 titles before watching this. Do yourself a favor and save the worst for last.
