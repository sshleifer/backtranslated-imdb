Many people see this as a classic, but of course I must have lost something. Life in Anarene, Texas, in the early 1950s is rather boring, which means that even a film about life in Anarene, Texas, in the early 1950s will be pretty boring! What do so many people see in this? Once the last photo exhibition in Anarene is closed, there will really be nothing to do in the city. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes that point at the end of the film. But even before it closes there isn't much to do, so pretty much everything revolves around sex. High school students make plans on how to lose virginity - sometimes with one another and sometimes with some equally bored adults in the city. See, there's not much to do for them either - except having sex (sometimes with one another and sometimes with bored teenagers) or complaining about the local high school soccer team. Something happened three times that I thought would add some spark of drama to the film. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but because of that nothing happens, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) flee, but nothing happens because of that, Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) kidnaps a girl, but nothing really happens for that. The only thing that added something of dramatic value to the film came at the end with the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms) who really emphasizes the emptiness of life in this pathetic city, while men stop to look at the body discussing where to go to have breakfast. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovic filmed this in black and white, which I suppose to point out how gray this city is, but the only thing I found interesting was the first look at actors like Bottoms , Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (Incidentally, it was terrifying to see how much Quaid - in 1971 - actually resembled his Cousin Eddie character in the National Lampoon Vacation movies.) Classic? I don't think so! 3/10
