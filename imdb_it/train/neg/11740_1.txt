A really terrible George Sanders vehicle that goes from being a thief to a police czar. While Sanders was an excellent actor, he was certainly not a protagonist and this film proves it. <br /> <br /> It is absolutely beyond stupidity. Gene Lockhart provided some comic relief until a moment of anger led him to fire his tragedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, George Sanders and co-star Carol Landis committed suicide in real life. After making a regrettable film like this, it's not shocking. <br /> <br /> The usual eye-catching Signe Hasso isn't really anything here.
