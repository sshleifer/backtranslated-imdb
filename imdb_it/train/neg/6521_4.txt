I'm probably not giving a good shake to this movie, because I haven't been able to watch it. Perhaps if I had seen him in a theater, in his original presentation, I could have appreciated it, but it's too slow for me. <br /> <br /> I read the book about 25 years ago and the details of the plot have vanished from memory. This did not help the film, because it is something less vivid and clear in its presentation of the events. <br /> <br /> This is really four related movies, or a four-part movie, and it was, I think, meant to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation. I found Part I pleasant enough, but all I could do was sit in Part II, which dragged on endlessly. Reading Tolstoy's philosophizing is one thing. If you get a good translation or you can read it in the original, its brilliant writing far outweighs any problems you may have with the rhythm of the story. On the film, however, it is difficult to reproduce it without being ponderous. <br /> <br /> I have other problems with the parts of the movie I saw. It's very splashy, with a lot of hey-but-looks-to this machine work that draws attention to itself, instead of serving to advance the story. <br /> <br /> Clearly, I am missing something, but I could not recall the enthusiasm to raise parts III and IV.
