Going into this film you know that this film has six lab technicians in a laboratory sealed with an invisible maniac. So you are guessing who will live and who will die. The survivors will end up being exactly who you would expect them to be, so no point for twists there. <br /> <br /> And if you're not sure if this is a B-movie or a movie that just happens to take place in a laboratory with a compelling story, William Devane plays a part: the status of instant B movies. <br /> <br /> The film is promising in the beginning. At the lab we are presented to the invisible gorilla that is becoming increasingly violent. Oooh, omen. The best scene of the whole film is when the laboratory team makes the gorilla visible again. Great special effects. The same thing when they make Bacon invisible. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of naked breasts, a really lousy and quite out of place joke that vows to give this movie an R-rating that it really didn't need. <br /> <br /> For a thriller there were really no surprises, except when Shue does as MacGyver in the freezer, which is more than a 'Whaaaa?' OK, there's a surprise. This is when Caine (Bacon) returns one last time to the elevator shaft. It was a surprise, but just because you're screaming on TV, "Noooo! You're already dead! Finish the movie! 'Speaking of screaming on TV, that's all I've done in the last 25 minutes or so.' Wear your f # @% ing of glasses! ' Instead of putting their infrared glasses on so they can see it, they try every other trick in the book (fire extinguishers, irrigation systems ...). Eventually the story really lost it, but the special effects were good, this is the the only reason I give them a 2/10.
