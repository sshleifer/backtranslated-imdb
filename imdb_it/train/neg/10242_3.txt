This film was made by a group of white kids who went to school together. Well, there's nothing wrong with that, except that it seems to have been created by a group of white guys who went to school together. 90 percent of the cast are white males of the same age. It's almost like watching a group of kids at the camp for the guys who turned the camera on themselves. The film has no plot. It simply repeats the same action as the bloodbath after the bloodbath. There are some funny scenes and comic bits. But they do not redeem the flat monotony. <br /> <br /> The graphic comic scenes are used to cover things that were obviously beyond their budget or resources to do, and were not done very well. All that cannot be done with the white boys running on the beach covered in blood is done with a cheap animation. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie after seeing the trailer, which makes it look like a Tarrentino piece. Well, the trailer scenes are as beautiful as ever. The rest of it repeats the same kind of worldly and inane comedy. It works sometimes, but it gets boring after the same stuff comes to you repeatedly. It's more like a series of Satuday Night Live skits than a movie. It's a kind of popular comedy. I can see where the idea of ​​the story is intriguing. But in this film, post apocalyptic America is very similar to Medevil England. In fact Wheatlry says that the ideas of history came from that era. He plans to do part 2. I think you think you are Tarrentino or make a parody. <br /> <br /> At the inauguration in Los Angeles, Wheatley said that he will return more or less the same cast in the second part. He was asked if he could consider a more diverse cast in the next, to which he replied, well yes, of course.
