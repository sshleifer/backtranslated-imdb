I entered this film that I really wanted to align it. I thought the premise had great potential and was ripe for an interesting film. Don't get me wrong here, I didn't expect Citizen Kane, I was taking this for the B movie that is. That said, it didn't live up to expectations. The historical aspect of the story is saturated and the finish left me a little cold. The acting in the film was very wooden. All in all, I gave 4 for a great idea, but the film could have scored a much higher score with a little more attention to the fundamentals of filmmaking. Is it worth seeing? I didn't want my two hours back, but I don't know that I'd recommend it to others.
