This was not what I wanted to see. I bought it on DVD and under the film I found myself irritated and turned the film off for a moment. <br /> <br /> Here's what I didn't like: <br /> <br /> 1 They were turning to their father <br /> <br /> 2 The tribes were really annoying <br /> <br /> 3 the dinosaurs (mostly) seemed distorted <br /> <br /> 4 The bad scientist well was annoying <br /> <br /> 5 The image quality on the DVD was really bad <br /> <br /> What I like: <br /> <br /> 1 The music of Jerry Goldsmith. This music is really fantastic. I have the bootleg soundtrack of this movie. Unfortunately the sound quality is not good, but it's OK for its time. <br /> <br /> 2 The first time we see dinosaurs inspire a kind of awe. <br /> <br /> 3 Baby is kind cute when he's in the water and he's playing <br /> <br /> 4 That funny tent scene. <br /> <br /> 5 The children who see this film hope they learn that evil always loses.
