This film was absolutely horrible, I even feel uncomfortable calling it a movie. It is the typical "mumblecore" film, with a zero plot and a handful of useless whining winds that stumble in an attempt to "understand things". I tried to give mumblecore a chance, but honestly it's horrible. <br /> <br /> I am not out of sync with cinema, I appreciate Dogme95's films, Idioterne is one of my favorite films of all time. So I don't care if a movie is made cheap as long as there is some (ANY) substance. <br /> <br /> Everything in this film is horrible, the acting, the writing (or was it all improvised?), the direction, but above all, above all else, the work with the camera was simply nonsense. The camera had never been logical, there was no consistency. I must admit to being a boy that I heard that there was nudity in this film, so I thought to myself well, even if it is horrible at least that there is nudity (yes, I know, I'm an idiot). Well, thanks to the superb crappy camera, you can never see anything, and the things you see, TRUST me - YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE. This film made me want to vomit on numerous levels. <br /> <br /> The dialogue made me want to vomit, working with the camera made me want to vomit, but above all the idea that this film was praised by some legitimate critics, well now that more than anything else it makes me want to vomit.
