Melissa Sagemiller, Wes Bentley, Eliza Dushku and Casey Affleck play young students at Middleton College in the city of Middleton. The four teenagers form two love triangles. One night during a threatening full moon they drive and fight along a slippery, winding mountain road. They don't look good, but they move to another car and one or more of them are killed. The ghostly nightmare begins ... A horror film quite horrible and politically correct without blood and nudity. It is obviously influenced by "Carnival of Souls". Cinematography is decent, unfortunately, there is no suspense.4 on 10-just another instantly forgettable garbage.
