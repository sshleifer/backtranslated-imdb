This film not only has a poor storyline, bad direction and terrible acting, but it opens up a new meaning to racism. <br /> <br /> In this film the "white" chicks are the sluts, the "white" boys are the wana-be gangsters, and successful (yes again) the "white" businessmen are revolting the toilets' toilets. <br /> <br /> I wonder what would happen if I did exactly the same film with the exact same plot and script, only I did it with regard to Caucasians. "He is beautiful, finally it is good to see that you stopped going out with those black chicks." No one seems to notice, but look at this movie again and you will vomit to how they portrayed the New Zealand "white boys". All of a sudden his whites are the main cause of the group attacks and the whores for a quick bang. Only Samoan girls have a heart, there is no white slutty girl. <br /> <br /> It disgusts me that they couldn't make this film without giving the Caucasian community of New Zealand a loathsome profile. If you think I'm too generous, go see this movie and see what you think of the "white boys". Just because the Samoans choose to call us "white boys" in real life doesn't mean they are fun. If I said hey black boy I'll lose my teeth. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. Don't waste your money. Don't be racist.
