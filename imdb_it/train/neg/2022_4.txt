Friend, this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books. Frankly, I found it too slow and unattractive from the start. I kept waiting for it to get back some steam, but it never happened. This film is largely overrated. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare, with King James English, never appealed to me, so it could just be me. There is a good deal of this in the first half of the film showing Ronald Colman in the role of Othello. <br /> <br /> The positive points of the film include - thanks to a restored print - some decent aspects of cinematography and a young, slim and attractive Shelly Winters. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is simply too boring, too much repetition in some scenes to watch again. Besides, we all know that most of the actors are crazy anyway, but congratulations to Hollywood for proving it here in this story.
