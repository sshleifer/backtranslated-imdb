This is a film that is bad in every way imaginable. Of course, we like to know what happened 12 years after the last film, and it works on a certain level. But the new characters are not interesting. Baby Melody is horribly horrible! Alas, while the logic that humans cannot remain underwater forever is maintained, other basic physical logics are ignored. It's cold if you don't have clothing for the cold if you're in the Arctic. I don't know why most of the comments here go back to getting worse than Jafar, I thought this was more horrible.
