Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman this show does not compliment her at all. The character is not even remotely nice and it's not a situation where you think "oh it's so funny that I love it" only "he's so skilled". This character is just a simple old virtuoso, petty, b * tch.Sarah seems to struggle to have to wear this show because it is the only funny seed in it. The mood, the dialogue is all so damn boring and dry it is like listening to your grandfather go on forever on the marbles collected as a child. <br /> <br /> The Sarah Silverman program is so incredibly boring that I was thinking of changing channels to watch the old Married With children reps something that's funny because the characters are so "immoral" and "rude". I'm sorry but I don't find a show full of dry and banal humor from the stories of the wall about a bitter, bitter, loser, angry, bitter life with his boring infernal sister and gay friends who play like Keanu Reeves with a cold anywhere near funny. I can't stand this show, although I generally find Sarah Silverman who is "I love her because she's such a skilled character" as in School Of Rock, and most of her stands up. I think this show is boring with characters who think they are mean and saying and doing things for shock value, eg. the constant pubis, diarrhea and $ in general to laugh. The Sarah Silverman program tries to be fun and fails or needs a laugh or better writers. Some have compared it to South Park but it's not even close. I have expressed my opinions on The Sarah Silverman Program and will not become a boring troll which means you will not see me being abtech and constantly publishing things like "This show sucks" and "Why is not this canceled." I don't like the Sarah Silverman program if you like it.
