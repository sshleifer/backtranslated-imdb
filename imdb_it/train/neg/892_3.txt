(I indicate in this review the point where the spoilers begin.) My dissatisfaction is divided: 30% tone deafness, 70% lackluster writing. <br /> <br /> 30%: I agree with the synopsis of the first commenter on the lack of diversity in the characters and the scope of the stories. I was surprised that this film, at best, sadly neglected the real New York by presenting a collection of people and relationships so close that it seemed like it was only inhabited by the Gossip Girl cast (this comes from someone who likes Gossip Girl). Some minority characters are written in the stories, but they are included in the obligation, while we can see the gears under the film so clearly, striving to "be different" but always falling so little. <br /> <br /> 70% is the reason why everything falls. All the characters, white plus some symbolic minorities, are scraps of concepts of people in the shape of cardboard. Worse, their interactions with others are written in such a way that for every cartoon in the film the audience is treated to what I would call a "gag": we get a basic hypothesis, then a few final lines that should be clever twisting. But even if we stop the cynicism for a moment, we say "Ok, it was a surprise" ... the stories are still not so interesting, because they too are superficial. When you make fashion stories so that their existence depends solely on the unpredictability of the ending, you're writing jokes. <br /> <br /> Spoilers below ... <br /> <br /> The film mainly tries to tell romantic stories. All right. But the romance is surprising, profound, sometimes complex. These "romantic" stories each have a girl and a boy who at one point share the same position and look at each other. Exchange of words, thoughts are projected through the voice-over, but even they can communicate to the public only that one person is attracted to another. <br /> <br /> Meaning, there is no seduction (in a broad sense) No tension, no clash or communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to welcome the Other. The only story involving a superficial "seduction" is told just so the public ends up being surprised that the boy (Ethan Hawke) is mocked by the girl he is playing, which unexpectedly turns out to be a prostitute. Of course, his words when trying to take it are interesting to listen to and we are having fun as we would be if we were next to them, but there is nothing substantial in this story outside of "A poi B". This is explained, if something like a postcard could "unfold", with all the other stories: A poi B - That's It, the only point is that these occur "on the set" in Manhattan. By the way, the only Brooklyn we see is the Coney Island sketch; the only queen is the flicker of a train journey taken by a character traveling in the West Village. <br /> <br /> It is easy to choose films that interpret all common stereotypes of race, gender, sexual orientation and soon. _New York, I Love You_, however, deserves to be judged more rigorous for its title. We expect to see the real New York, and true New Yorkers, but instead we walked past the selected slice of a demography, its characters flew by The OC, plus some others to make it seem as if we were paying attention to diversity. But when we look more closely at who those characters are, the whole fiction becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and to the ethnic groups and cultures that the film fails to represent. <br /> <br /> For example, the story with the Latin Man with the little white girl in the park, who is mistaken by two ladies as his manny (male nanny) when he is actually the father. Although the last scene of this part was superfluous from the point of view of dramatic construction (it would have been much more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriend / stepfather dismiss the girl), it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene in which we learn with certainty that the girl's father is also Latin must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer. What, dad can't just be a boy from South America? Now that it's obviously hot, is the public more prepared to accept having a child with a middle-high class white woman? Are we so naive as to request this? As if a Mexican construction worker was obviously too unpleasant. <br /> <br /> It's not my place to decide where the movie should be gone. But in every imaginable set-up and twist, the direction taken screams the status quo, appeals to security. All these stories could have been made more interesting, even though we have been forced to maintain the monodimensionality of the characters that inhabit them, at least not choosing from standards and obvious stereotypes. Is the Asian girl who lives in Chinatown dumbfounded by a scruffy old white guy? How about an Asian puma chasing a white kid in college. Once again, I'm not saying that the whole presumption should be changed. It's just that. Damn. premise of history. it's so trivial - and therefore they can't communicate anything about why we can love New York, outside of banality. The real way to improve the film would have been to have written a script that was worthwhile. <br /> <br /> I will grant the pleasure of the soundtrack, the good rhythm of the film (even if what was stimulated was, well, dredge), and the general sensation of many scenes. The film was fine and I wouldn't want to dissuade anyone from doing it. However, he is saying that the most significant tribute paid to non-superficiality is when the old opera singer says (to paraphrase) "This is what I love about New York: everyone comes from a different place". Well, you wouldn't know by looking at this.
