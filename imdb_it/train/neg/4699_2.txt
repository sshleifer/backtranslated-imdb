wow, the Naked Brothers Band. What should I say. I guess I can say that this show sucks. number one: they have no talent, they probably don't even know how to play the instruments. number 2: on the advertising spot it was said that they were famous but no one had ever heard of it until the shit show came. Look, I don't hate it so much, I'd give it as a 4 out of 10, but what bothers me is how everyone says they have such a great talent and Nat is so deep and writes deep lyrics. Deep in my ass! talk about hardcore fighters with inner feelings. wow, I could read what he says on the walls of a bathroom and it would be deeper than that. And they didn't become famous alone, their parents are famous celebrities and they wanted their children to be too, so they did a bad show. I have a feeling that it will soon be canceled.
