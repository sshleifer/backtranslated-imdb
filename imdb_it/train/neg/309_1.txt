Hello. I'm Paul Raddick, a.k. Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this terrible film that fueled Adam Sandler's film career, but was digitized after a short time. <br /> <br /> Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by Sandler who finds work on a cruise ship and fails ... or so I thought. Sandler meets girls who love world history, part 1 and rebound. The girls had to be engaged, but in reality they were executed by Sawtooth, the worst cannibal the world has ever known. Adam Sandler was not up to the Going Overboard, but fared much better in Big Daddy, Billy Madison and 50 First Dates than Jen Leone. Friend, Drew Barrymore was a hot chick. Spanglish is red-hot, Going Overboard is not squat Dooley! End of file.
