Despite the brilliant work of the secondary actors and a clever screenplay by Alan Plater, this film suffers from a fatal flaw - the lack of charm of the central character / actor. One of the characters describes Richard E Grant's character as "a little whining asshole" and unfortunately this sums him up perfectly. There is nothing in him or his performance to make it believable that his girlfriend and the upper class publisher / friend spend so much time and emotional effort on him. He is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and absolutely annoying. The part required an actor who could make you love even when he's prey - for example Ewan McGregor. <br /> <br /> All the witty satire on the class system etc. It was wasted thanks to this irritating and totally unlikely performance. All I wanted to do was shake him and tell him to outdo himself.
