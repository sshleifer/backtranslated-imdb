*** THE REVIEW MAY MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS *** I will make this review short and sweet. I bought this movie from Best Buy because it seemed interested and had some important actors like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad could it be, right? Well, it's pretty ugly. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, an aspiring journalist who comes across a case that could lead to corrupt Edison police. LL Cool J is Deed, a policeman within the strength of a special team called F.R.A.T. (First response assault tactics). He collaborated with an "on-the-edge" cop named Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). In the opening scene we see Lazerov & Deed hiring some bank robbers, but at night they are killing a couple of drug-using guys. I don't want to give much, but things get bad for the guys who do drugs. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman), goes to a trial involving Deeds & Lazerov. He suspects incorrect play and with Ashford's help, some investigate that it becomes ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey) who is inside F.R.A.T. the team joins Ashford to try to ensure justice for corrupt cops. <br /> <br /> It is clear from the beginning that Freeman and Spacey's performance is rather lackluster. Dylan McDermott is the only person to give an exceptional performance. He is a complete nut in this film and made a believer by me. LL Cool J is terrible in this movie. It says each line in the same way and shows more or less the same emotion. He was much better in films like Deep Blue Sea and Any Given Sunday. The film starts with a good action, but then drags its feet in the rest of the film. The ending is far from satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this movie. I'm putting it on Ebay this weekend.
