THE TEMP (1993) has not done much theatrical business, but here's the direct rip-off to the video you didn't want, anyway! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is the new woman of Millennium Investments, a large-scale brokerage company that begins to draw useful insights from the wide-eyed secretary Deidre (Sheila Kelley). Deidre turns out to be an ambitious dad girl who will stop at nothing to climb the corporate ladder, including inculcating a first-rate broker who can't stand and kill anyone who gets on the bad side. He digs the skeletons in Ellen's closet, tries to cause problems with her husband (Barry Bostwick), kills while making her look responsible, kidnaps her daughter and tries to convince her to steal money from the company. <br /> <br /> Harris and Kelley offer competent performances, the supporting cast is in place and is reasonably well put together, but this does not completely compensate for a script that runs a worn path and offers few surprises.
