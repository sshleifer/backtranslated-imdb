Even for a model of film as tired as the nature-against-human cycle prevailed so strongly in the 1970s, ants fall miserably short of even being a bit effective (even if amusing for reasons they did not intend). It is so absurd. Apparently these ants that have been razed near an inn have consumed poisonous waste for decades and have now adapted to emit poisonous bites - hundreds of these bites are fatal. Watching actors of a certain reputation fall awkwardly through tiny black spots is painfully fun in a way that is not really good, but very bad. So many scenes look ridiculous: a guy trying to fall into a dumpster while being attacked, Suzanne Sommers screaming in horror as he lies down in bed, Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathe pieces of wallpaper, Bernie Casey pretending a leg , and the list could go on and on. The danger shown goes from ants crawling from a drain to black lines of ants on all walls. The cast of the film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors seem to believe in the material. Poor Myrna Loy has to sit in a wheelchair through this horror. I hope he found a good use of the money, because it is obvious that the ONLY reason why a woman of her pedigree would have been in this nonsense. Although it is a rather ugly film, it is watchable - once for me, and it has many of those bad qualities of the seventies - front row actors who embarrass themselves, that feeling made for TV and the feared creatures of nature that they hate revenge on man. This time the man has to push his hand into a pile of ants to get hit. Really quite terrible.
