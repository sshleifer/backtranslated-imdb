Well ... now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for his "House of the 1,000 bodies", now I can rest in peace. Nothing of the somnambulistic performances or a trite script would have resurrected death in "The house of the seven corpses", but a groovie ghoulie comes out of his plot anyway (he has!) To kill the bloodthirsty amateurs who make a cheap horror film in his previous abode! In Hell House (sorry, I don't remember the actual name of the residence), a lot of mysterious and inexplicable deaths occurred a long time ago; some, like the arrogant arthritic of Lurch, John Carradine (whose small role provides the only deserving moments of the film), attribute it to the supernatural; the bellowing director John Ireland dismisses him as a superstitious hokum. The result is presented as "Satan's School for Girls" (catchy title, production values ​​made for TV, intriguing storyline) crossed with "Children should not play with dead things" (low-cost films on low-level film producers cost of waking the dead); the problem is that it is nowhere near funny or fun. "The House of Seven Corpses" died at the first frame, and spends the rest of his 89 minutes crossing rigor mortis, dragging us for every painful second ...
