Cult of the Cobra is now available on DVD in a pristine print that does justice to everything it deserves to have as a movie. Unfortunately, this is not saying much. <br /> <br /> He has a competent second-rankers cast who performs well and which might be expected under the circumstances. It is efficiently directed, entirely on sound stages and standing sets on the studio backlot. It looks ok, but it is heavily hatched and at just 80 minutes it is still heavily padded. <br /> <br /> For example, the double cobra attack on the first of the GIs was certainly an attack too many. <br /> <br /> The affairs on Julia that choose to marry Pete rather than Tom never amount to anything. Tom immediately falls in love with Lisa and she never has reason to be jealous of Julia (or her). <br /> <br /> Julia's feminine intuition is introduced as if it led to an important development plot, but it is not. Likewise, Pete's investigations into cobra cults and the suspicion that falls briefly on Tom have no other purpose than to fill the screen time. <br /> <br /> These are just the symptoms of the underlying problem. The film is structured like a mystery but it is not. As soon as the curse is pronounced, we know exactly where the story is heading, so the characters have remained scrupulously discovering what we already know. <br /> <br /> The finish is particularly lame. Julia is threatened by pure chance. Lisa has no reason to want to kill her - she is right in the wrong place at the wrong time. When Tom arrives in time to save her, it's not even clear if she was threatened. So it merely dispenses the cobra the way any of the previous victims could have done. <br /> <br /> It is such a small and insignificant jubilation of a story that I was surprised to wonder why it was launched at the studio's heads. Then it happened to me. Someone said: "Those Val Lewton films have been very successful at RKO, so why don't we make one like that?" <br /> <br /> Cult of the Cobra is clearly modeled on Cat People: mysterious, troubled, the woman who changes shape falls in love with the hero, is apparently cold, kills people, arouses the suspicions of the woman friend of hero and dies at the end. But "modeled on" does not mean "as good" - by a wide margin. Copy, but does not understand what is copying. <br /> <br /> Obviously he is looking for the low-key and suggestive Lewton style, but this approach does not follow the plot. Lisa is not Irene. It is destined to be strange and mysterious, but there is no mystery about her. We glimpsed it after the first attack in Asia, so we immediately recognize it when it shows up in New York. There is never any doubt about its purpose. Nor is there any ambiguity about her not turning into a snake. <br /> <br /> Then, during his nighttime wanderings, we get not one, but two "bus" attempts. Nor do they go out, because the director does not understand what makes a 'bus' work and, in any case, it happens to the stalker, not to the persecuted person. <br /> <br /> These faint echoes of Cat People give Cult of the Cobra any small distinction it may have, but they only draw attention to the yawning chasm between the original and imitation. <br /> <br /> Plagiarism may be the sincerest form of flattery, but I doubt whether Lewton or Tourneur was particularly flattered when this little lukewarm pastime came out.
