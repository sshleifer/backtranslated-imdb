The title song for this film ........... is the biggest free ballad ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /> <br /> I first saw this film in 1978-79 when I first joined the cable. In 1979 the cable was just starting to become commonplace in homes. (or at least that was when it was becoming common here in Missouri). <br /> <br /> This could very well be the first movie I've ever seen on the pay channel called "The Movie Channel" - which was called "The Star Channel" then, they changed the name to "The Movie Channel" in the early 80s ........ I received a free month of "The Star Channel" with my new cable subscription. "The Van" was one of the films that was running on that network at that time. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this movie back then, and I thought it was a typical teen movie (along the same lines as other mid-budget teen movies) ... those where the plot revolves around nudity and parties. <br /> <br /> I completely forgot that this film existed until I saw this film again after having seen it for decades (I found a copy on DVD for sale in an economic basket) I recognized it , and I bought it for only $ 4.99. It seems that I remembered that this film is much better than it was (is). However, looking back was a different experience than looking now (over 30 years later). It was fun to see the list of children of rock music, smoking weed and having sex in the back of an elegant van (often all at the same time). This is what a good movie for boys should be. <br /> <br /> There isn't much plot except the fact that the main character fantasizes about having sex with his beautiful rival girl ... he blows up all his savings for the university to buy a Dodge Van deceived (with carpeted walls, a mirrored ceiling and a bed of water) to attract his attention, and finally manages to have sex with her. But his archaic rival discovers and comes looking for him (so that the two can solve their differences by dragging their vans) ... he and his archer rival end up destroying both their vans and instead of stealing his rival girlfriend with the bow, the heart of a preppy girl wins (less attractive) that the medium / ass sleeps through most of the film and decides that it is happier / better and the film ends. <br /> <br /> the film has its funny moments But watching this movie over 30 years later, it becomes more of a journey into the past. Because I still remember the pizzerias, the pinball games rooms, and I also brought back memories of laps around in a small town while we were smoking the plate like we would have shouted at good looking girls and hoping to fuck (sometimes I would be lucky and I would have a little decent looking for a girl with whom to share a bond with me and we'll have a fuck on the backseat afterwords, I also remember many of the songs in this move (when they were new) ...... this film is a perfect time capsule for this it was in those regards (he reported many memories) <br /> <br /> the only thing that is represented in this film that I honestly can't remember is .... I never remember a time when the vans in size natural were as popular as this movie portrays them. I remember that era very well, and I don't go around youngsters wishing to have a van, but I do remember the youth of the 70s (including themselves) who wanted a Pontiac Trans Am, Chevy Camaro or a hot rod F ord Mustang, but never a van This film makes it appear as if the vans were the most popular object around and that every young man wanted one (which wasn't really true for that time)
