We went to this movie because my husband liked the original version of "My favorite Martian". We had our 6 year old daughter with us. He wanted to leave in the middle of the film that was good with both his parents! The parts we saw were only occasionally funny, mostly either too stupid or coarse. I would expect children between 9-12 to like this movie if that. It is definitely not suitable for younger children. From what I've heard, the original series was far superior and if you're going to "relive the past" you'll probably be disappointed.
