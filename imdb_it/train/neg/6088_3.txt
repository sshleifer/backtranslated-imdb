Why do I watch movies like this? - Apart from the fact that I have some strange masochistic conviction that one day I will find a real gem among all these waste I cannot think of one single good reason. This film was full of slag from beginning to end - but semi-hilarious wake. Where else, in an ugly dubbed Italian movie, could you find heated exchanges of surreal English like that between an honest military type and the sinister head of a secret X-file like an organization dedicated to hiding "The Truth": <br /> <br /> Man in Black: Silence is the best for us until we can prove that UFOs have no war motives. <br /> <br /> Military type: In any case I find your interference illegal. <br /> <br /> Man in Black: Anyone who has to impose his will is. <br /> <br /> I rewound the DVD (you know what I mean) a good half a dozen times and I still can't make those lines means everything makes sense. My other favorite line was: <br /> <br /> "We can be pretty tough with those that violate our interests." <br /> <br /> He is English Jim, but not as we know him. <br /> <br /> The other highlights of this boring film plonker for me were the totally distanced acting of the photographer's character in the beginning. Saddled with the worst EVER haircut in the history of it all, the man just walked around like a fish stunned with an ugly wig until kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of Plexiglas from some aliens. Aliens are no longer seen as a POV shot - freehand camera with a fish-eye lens - a kind of ghostly first time but, used repeatedly, it has lost its power (incidentally, if it is a point of view shot, it means that the aliens always come out of the rooms backwards for some reason). <br /> <br /> The film is set in "England". This meant that the Italian Spanish screenwriters put some British plates on a pair of English cars and put a Union Jack on our hero's printed paper ... and that was all. No other attempt to make the UK seem at all. <br /> <br /> Preferred moment? When the Foley artists didn't notice that the characters they were trying to cheat (is there a word like that?) They were no longer walking on the gravel but they were now on the lawn so their feet kept making "crunch! Noises. part this, another total waste of 90 minutes of my life I hope they show that those UFOs have no war reasons soon ...
