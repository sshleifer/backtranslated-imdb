Rick leads the woman to his home and there they discover that his car has already been parked there, apparently by his father, Dixon Doss (Duvall). Rick and Mallory enter the house discussing the situation in which Mallory undresses carefree in front of Rick, and then spends the night with her. <br /> <br /> Rick wakes up in the morning and Mallory meets him later in the day, asking him to report his father because of his dangerous behavior. Rick, now obsessed with Mallory and willing to do anything for her, manages to have Dixon put on trial and sent to prison, but when freed by his local friends, Rick finds himself in trouble, trying to protect himself and his children from the danger they have unknowingly brought to life.
