I can barely find the words to express how absolutely awful this movie is. I was sold on the promise of action, with Segal and stealth aircraft, which normally are a fun action movie. I can honestly say that I would rather take out my eyes with a cocktail stick than see this movie again. The acting was so terrible that it was almost fun. The story was insanely weak, with such cavernously wide holes that an F117 could fly through them. The script was so poor, if I had discovered that a 10-year-old child was writing it, I shouldn't be in the least surprised. The management and production are so amateurish, I wouldn't even hire these people to shoot my wedding video of the worst enemies. Utter Utter drivel. Those responsible for making this film have reduced art, and should be ashamed of themselves. Steven Segal should never again show his face in public, I can't imagine what he agreed to do in this film, the worst movie I've seen in my life.
