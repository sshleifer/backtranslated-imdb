Ben Stiller doesn't react so much. And it does it very well. It really depends on the comedy that is happening around him. In There's Something About Mary, the standing hair scene only works because Stiller tries to keep a straight face. When confronted with the other two suitors of Mary, he is the most ruthless type of room, but the scene is hilarious. <br /> <br /> In Along Came Polly, the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to understand. Stiller is surrounded by a series of comic talents. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines, of which there are too few. That being said, Hoffman relies a little too much on bodily humor: you know we are in trouble when they go to the farts to raise a laugh. A basketball scene in which Hoffman sums it up is completely overplayed (even if it raises a situation in the form of a shirtless opponent that makes you smile - notably through Stiller's reaction). However, everyone seems to act in a bubble, there is very little reaction. The characters of Hoffman and Stiller could have been much more fun. Aniston takes up the role of Rachael again, but Stiller is not Ross. It's more of a "Joey with a crush on Rachael" scenario. <br /> <br /> Polly is a rom-com with numbers and this is her failure - she lacks heart. You don't root for the characters. With a little extra work we could have had a deeper story, but in the end the failure of the film is reduced to bad writing. It is worth looking at it if it appears on TV on a slow evening, but you will regret cashing in money to see it.
