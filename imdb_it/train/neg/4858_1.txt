Why in the world would anyone make this piece of trash film? The first two Zombie Bloodbath movies were pretty stupid, but this takes the cake for the worst of the trilogy (maybe of all time). Todd Sheets is still the director, but he is no longer the screenwriter, who is not a negative or a positive, considering he is just as talented as the boy who wrote this. The writing is too dependent on the word f, which is used somewhere between 200 and 300 times to nausea. The acting is almost on a par with the last two Bloodbath films, so of course it's among the worst I've ever seen. The special effects are better than the last 2, but they still look crazy. The plot became too complicated for his own good, and involved a government experiment gone wrong and the production of zombies. There are also cryogenically frozen mutant zombies and school-age children who can travel through time, leading to one of the most idiotic endings I've ever seen. After the film it goes offstage, which is strange because this whole film is an outtake. Just see it to make fun of it, because if you rely on a serious mind, you could kill yourself. <br /> <br /> My assessment: BOMB / ****. 95 minutes
