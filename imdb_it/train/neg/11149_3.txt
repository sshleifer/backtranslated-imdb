Summary: full moon. A creature, a huge werewolf, is hunting. Not for the meat, not for the blood (not that it seems to displease biting on the street), but for a companion. He's hunting for a girl. However, no girl. The girl. The girl who is pure (and even a werewolf, even if she doesn't know it yet). Three, check that two policemen (after the first scene) and an old lady bag are all that can stop it, or even know that killing and eating a lot of people around the full moon is a werewolf. This particular powerful werewolf, Darkwolf, is approaching the girl. If he gets it, humanity is doomed. Now the policemen must find the girl, convince her not only that there is someone, a werewolf, who wants to rape her, and perhaps kill her, but that she herself is a werewolf. And then they got to stop it ... <br /> <br /> Comments: This is one for boys, teenage boys. A lot of scenes with half-naked girls more or less important to the plot. Mostly less. Well, I guess you need something to fill in some time because the plot is (predictably) thin. And unfortunately there is little beyond the girls to help the plot break. Usually we move on to two main themes. Nudity. Check. And then special effects. Hmm ... Well, there are some things you could call effects. They are not very special though. In fact, to be blunt, they are very bad. The film seems to suffer from a lack of funds. They couldn't afford clothes for some girls;), and the effects are cheap. Some of the transformations between the werewolf and the human form, obviously made by the computer, are really bad. You could overlook these things. But even the Darkwolf itself is very crude and you never see killings. Only some mutilated corpses later. And there is surprisingly little blood, in a film that honestly should be soaked with blood. <br /> <br /> I don't know what to say about actors and characters. Most of the time they do well, but unfortunately there are cases where the characters (or the actors) lose it. Some of these errors could be related to the problems mentioned above. Like the negative effects, or the scarce budget (?). This may explain why there is a small precious recovery, even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in plain sight (and not in motion). But hey, when you're in danger, there's nothing that will save your life like a good liner ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this can't explain the moments when Cop, Steve, the only one one who knows how to deal with the problem, the werewolf who runs away, when the only things he can be sure of is that the werewolf is coming for the girl, who is right next to him now, and who can't leave let it be her Of course, she allowed the producers to lengthen the end a little more ... <br /> <br /> But I wouldn't mind seeing any of the leading actors / actresses making another attempt in another film . <br /> Good. To give a small conclusion: not a film I recommend. <br /> <br /> 3/10
