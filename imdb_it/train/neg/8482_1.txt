Some of my old friends suggested I watch this movie, but I only had the chance recently. I had high hopes of seeing something interesting from Kamal Hans, what I saw was a pile of junk camera angles mixed at high speed. I could not understand what the message was if not humiliating Hinduism. I am more like many kinds of religion, but I heard that Kamal Hasan is a low profile man for orchestrating this kind of thinking. He could have made a horror movie rather than this shit. He tried to add the kind of Hollywood virus and God does not want him not to turn that boy into a mutant and that he will eventually go for world domination. This is a very appropriate film for a film school compared to a normal audience. Shame on yourself for not having resisted the talent he has. The beginning of history has tried the chaos to borrow ideas from the butterfly effect, then between little religious harmony at the cost of insulting Hinduism (once more offending Hinduism but this film has no equal and my insult is the same for religion in general that could have made this intellectual film.)
