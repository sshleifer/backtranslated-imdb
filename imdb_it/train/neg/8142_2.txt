After being bitten by a bat in a cave, a doctor named John Beck undergoes an accelerated transformation into a man's creature. The wife assures him that there is nothing wrong with him, it is all just because of the anger or the rabies drug he has. The local policeman thinks that John is responsible for numerous murders committed. "The Bat People" by Jerry Jameson is a damn horrible film. The script is deadly boring and there is neither blood nor nudity. This useless piece of shit is so boring mind boring that you'll scratch your head in total disbelief after suffering through it. Even the design of a man-bat creature from a young Stan Winston is completely pathetic and not memorable. like the plague.2 out of 10.
