I tried as much as possible to sit in the middle of this irritating mess, but I couldn't do it. Brad Dourif completely sucked the blow and the whole supporting cast was only marginally worse. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is simply ridiculous, from the terrible acting to the laughable buff to the stupid plot. <br /> <br /> Complete waste of time; don't worry Radical canal therapy would be more pleasant. The bamboo splinters under the nails would be much more pleasant. <br /> <br /> Watching a Uwe Boll movie would be just a bit worse than that. Get the idea?
