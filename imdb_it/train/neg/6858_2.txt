John Huston's Blood Sage was a more horrible misrepresentation than Flannery O'Connor's book than I could have imagined. From the absolutely terrible recitations (and it's not true, "Oh, it was done on purpose, you didn't really understand" me!) For the soundtrack best suited to an episode of Rockford Files, this film was revolting. I saw it without malice at the beginning and, in fact, I expected a pleasant experience. But the misrepresentation of southern characters, from the ridiculous and fraudulent southern accent to the humorous and comical way of their faith, was unforgivable. Until the end, which was completely devoid of any feeling of character, failed in every place that O'Connor's book shone and resounded. Actors portraying "southern" cops may also have eaten hot dogs choked by New York kiosks and cited the Godfather. The acting performance he redeemed was the lively and dead representation of Hoover Shoates, a religious con-artist who listens to the Moates preaching the Church of Christ without Christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities. The powerful book by O'Connor is well known for its disturbing and religious undercurrent that stride at the apparently lifeless corpse of "Faith". Mr. Huston's film is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions, as they are intended by me and most of his fans, if I can be so bold in saying it. While acknowledging that I can't know exactly what the author wanted to convey, I have enough affection for her and her work to want to remain a fan. If I had seen Wise Blood as Mr. Huston apparently did, I would have thrown it in the trash. For Flannery's sake, and mine, I forgive you, John Huston. Oblivion ... it will take time.
