I rented "New Best Friend" hoping for a movie similar to funny teen thrillers like "Gossip" and "The Curve". Instead, "New Best Friend" is much more like "The In Crowd", where there are no chills and the acting is incredibly fake. "New Best Friend" is boring, and the events during the movie are the same. Skip this movie ... it's a waste of time.
