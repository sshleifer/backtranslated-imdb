Born Again is a sub-standard episode of the first season. He deals with the theme of reincarnation and simply does not fly. I have never been great in reincarnation and this could be part of my apathy towards this episode. It refers to the Tooms case which is a nice continuation from the previous episode. But the positive aspects end there. Which is unfortunate because this happens at the beginning of the episode. I think it's ridiculous that a dead person has chosen to reincarnate in the body of a completely alien girl. And wait for the girl to turn eight to start a revenge. There is also a serious lack of witty dialogue between Mulder and Scully to keep the episode afloat. If you like reincarnations, maybe this episode is within your reach. If you are not, at least you can learn what bradycardia is.
