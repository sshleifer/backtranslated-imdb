I've seen this movie a few times and I never thought it was so funny, but it's still fun to watch and good for some laughs. <br /> <br /> Women who work in a company and their boss is an idiot and end up giving him a taste of his own medicine, and try to get the respect they deserve. <br /> <br /> The acting is really good. Dabney Coleman is one of the stars of the 80s who plays a good bad guy, not really bad, just unlikely. Dolly Partin is adorable and fun to watch in comedies and she, with her south, really shines here. Jane Fonda is so-so and does little for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing about this movie, it has the funniest lines and made me laugh out loud several times, I have to love it. <br /> <br /> I could recommend it to anyone who loves 80s comedy. I like the movie but I have things about it that I don't like. It starts off great and has a good flow and then it all starts to come together all at once and made me worry less about the characters. They all have little fantasies about what they want to do and even if "cute" I thought it would slow down the flow of the film. As the film continues, it resumes and the funniest things happen and then, once again, slows down, only to conclude in a fast way that is too good to be true. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars, but try it if you haven't seen it. I think that depending on the mood it can be more or less nice.
