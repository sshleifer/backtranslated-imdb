Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy pair in history, and deservedly so, so I'm happy to see any of their films. Basically a man in a horn factory is the fourth to collapse, and soon enough Ollie cracks with all the horn noises. He's resting at home with Stan by his side, who needs peace of mind, and the Doctor (James Finlayson) phones to say he's coming to check on Ollie. After making the plumbing and electricity is confused by a repairman with cross-eyed eyes, the Doctor arrives for a check, and after some tests, recommends drinking goat's milk and getting some sea air on the Ocean. After Stan played the trumpet, hanging out the window next to the telephone cord and a car accident, he and Ollie approached a dock to rent a boat. They keep the boat on the dock trying to milk a goat, and Stan brought his trumpet! Meanwhile, the front page of the newspaper reads that the killer Nick Grainger - Escaped Convict (Richard Cramer) has escaped, and sneaks onto the boys' boat while they are sleeping, and the goat chews through the rope of the boat, drifting towards the sea. In the morning, they see their position, and the Killer comes out asking for something to eat, and sees Stan and Ollie making fake food, eg. spaghetti string, cheese soap, bacon belt, sponge for meatballs and forces you to eat it. When Ollie starts to choke on something, Stan makes his trumpet sound to help, and Ollie's anger makes him hit the Assassin, and continues until the police arrive, only to have Ollie's anger to get them to jail. . There have been the most minute comedy moments, but it's not a great black and white film. "Well, here's another nice mess you kicked me out of!" was the number 60 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 in the Comedian of Comedians. All right!
