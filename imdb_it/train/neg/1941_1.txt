I can't believe I wasted five hours of my life in this trash. This author's previous five-day offer was a lot of fun and I was looking forward to it. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones has been the main culprit since mumbling or mumbling her lines, but most of the rest of the cast followed her example. Notable exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, old interns whose diction was exemplary. Do producers not listen to productions before they are broadcast to make sure the dialogue is audible? As a result, I suppose I lost track of what was going on, and since the original plot seemed to become that standard between us and the Muslims and the rest, I soon lost interest. The ending was a complete anti-climax. A real disaster.
