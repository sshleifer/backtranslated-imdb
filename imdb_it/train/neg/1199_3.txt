This horror film is really weak ... that is if this is the correct film I'm commenting on. Nothing really terrible continues when a family adopts a cute German shepherd puppy. I had a German shepherd and he is really a good dog. I didn't get the idea to get one from this movie, but rather from the comedy "K-9". This is another story all together though. This movie doesn't really have much horror because the most horrible scene is at the end and it looks really bad. Also, we see a boy who almost put his hand in a lawnmower. That's all. The father suspects something anyway, since his family seems to be rather strange, somewhere it turns out that if you hold a mirror while you sleep you can see if they are possessed. All in all a really weak horror film even by television standards ... the TV movies that work are out there like "This House Possessed" is pretty good and there's another house-infested movie about a woman and these strange creatures that is also pretty good. This is really rather boring.
