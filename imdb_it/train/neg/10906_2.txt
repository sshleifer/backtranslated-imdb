Redundant, but again the case. If you like the former SNL comedian and his antics (in this case, Schneider), then you should go. Basic comedy: human life is saved by the transplantation of various animal organs. Unfortunately, it takes on the characteristics of each animal. The former survivor Colleen looks very pretty here, now that she has no open wounds on her legs and a little face makeup! D
