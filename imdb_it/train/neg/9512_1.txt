I can't believe it was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I laughed a couple of times. (probably because of how stupid it was) If someone had paid me to see that movie again, I wouldn't. the plot was so horrible, it didn't make sense, and the acting was so bad I couldn't even tell if they were rehearsing. that movie was a terrible evaluation: F
