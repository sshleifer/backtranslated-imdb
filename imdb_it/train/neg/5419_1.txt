Why do filmmakers always go against the work of the author? I mean, yes, things must be condensed in the interest of the spectators, but look at Anne of Green Gables. They did a great job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delicious. I can't believe they chose to combine three novels for Anne of Avonlea in such a terrible mess. Look at everything they lost doing so. . . Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, widows, Windy Poplars. . . and Anne's college years, for heaven's sake !!! Would it not have been pleasant to meet Priscilla and the rest of the Redmond gang? Kevin Sullivan should have taken things one film at a time, instead of mixing them all together and combining characters and events as he did. This movie was good, if you leave the novels out of it !! But the beautiful work of L. Montgomery is something that should not be denied. This film was disappointing after seeing the successful way of creating Anne of Green Gables.
