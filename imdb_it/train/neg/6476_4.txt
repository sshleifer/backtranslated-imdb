I had great hopes for this film because I loved the original so much. It seems that Disney, however, is trying to perfect the art of shit sequels directly on DVD. They deserve a raid. Different indeed. I thought the idea had merit, but the music was absolutely horrible and the story wasn't much better. What happened to the great music that Disney had in their films. Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King ... even Hercules and the Hunchback of Notre Dame. They've done so many good films over the years that it's really sad that they went to the point of making sequels that aren't even good enough to be put in theaters. <br /> <br /> I hope this film is not an indication of things to come for the Walt Disney Corporation.
