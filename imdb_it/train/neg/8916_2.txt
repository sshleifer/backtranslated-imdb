I rented this DVD after seeing it while searching for something else. When I saw the title on the jacket I couldn't believe my eyes. I read Yalom's book about a year ago and I loved it, in fact I admire Yalom's work in general. (I am a clinical psychologist). I saw maybe 30 minutes of this movie and had to turn it off. I'm not sure I can take much more. On a superficial level, fake accents, as others have commented, are simply distracting at best and irritating and insipid at worst. Acting is boring when it should be passionate and comic when it should be serious. The portrait of Lou Salome is simply irreverent, and the brilliant Freud looks like little more than a schoolboy. I see very little of the spirit of the book transmitted so far. I was hoping to be able to recommend this film to my students. Instead, I will refer them to the book. Imagine that.
