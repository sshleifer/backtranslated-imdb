For months I heard about this little movie and now I've seen it. I find it cute, cute as so many new directors make films where they combine the creative ideas of other people to make their premise a joke of a movie. Troops, Swingblade, some of the millions of Blair Witch's parodies come to mind. If all these filmmakers want is a foot in the door of Hollywood, then they are doing the right thing and should go on like this because combining the plot lines is how Hollywood makes films. How many times have you heard the phrase "It's Animal House meets Back to the Future"; "It's Wall Street that meets the Dead Poet company"; or "Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars"? I remember when independent films meant original and bold unsafe and predictable.
