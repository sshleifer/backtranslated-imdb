Since I'm not a blood and guts fanatic, I found the bloody scenes totally superfluous (you do the spelling) and they are too realistic for my taste, if you're the kind of person who blasts beheadings on the internet or movies by snuff You say, you accept the belief what kind of person dreams of this crap. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it had the potential to be a great movie, even the music was first class (through the film and especially the end credits). Some parts were a bit far-fetched, as if you had just been found by your girlfriend waiting for torture and death and all you do is tell her about what happened and how you got there, (because she didn't ask if Did you happen to have any wipes or even some fresh air or a piece of gum while working on it?), let's go now, most probably screamed "hurry up and melt, so let the f *** get out of here SOON!". where were the flies, the worms, etc. and when the girl accidentally came across that place, surely the smell of rotten meat would have produced some alarm bells! I would just like to recommend this movie to Dennis Niellson's friends and things like that, I'm sure a video like this would make the sick have a very happy Christmas.
