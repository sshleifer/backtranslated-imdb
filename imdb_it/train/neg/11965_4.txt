Being a history buff particularly interested in this particular historical event, I was very disappointed by the film. Of course, the costumes and the staging were authentic, but the Hollywood representation of this "British Little Big Horn" was really boring. <br /> <br /> The amount of footage dedicated to troops on the march or in the parade must have been unprecedented in the history of cinema. Every time I listened to triumphant background music, I knew I had to prepare myself for another strenuous nonsense filling scene. Obviously, the producers had invested heavily in "staging" and were determined to get their value. <br /> <br /> Despite the cast in circulation, their dialogue was, once again, boring and their characters were never developed. Whenever Peter O'toole or Burt Lancaster finished a scene, I was ashamed of disappointment. Their lines were so weak and meaningless that I couldn't believe they were the same two great actors who played Lawrence of Arabia and Bird Man of Alcatraz respectively. <br /> <br /> There are worse epics, but this is not much better
