An attempt to crossover to appeal to those who do not appreciate the work, taking advantage of the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time, fails badly. All that is desirable in this film is the opera, and you can find a recording of Pavarotti doing what he does best. The plot revolves around a love story with a doctor who heals the throat that suddenly became annoying. <br /> <br /> Just because it came out a long time ago is largely forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor and has a stage presence in addition to his singing talent, and nothing he does in this film denies that opinion. His guilt lies in not rejecting the horrendous script. Perhaps because the great works can have silly stories that tolerated this. <br /> <br /> Who knows, except those involved? We must know? <br /> <br /> The plot is weak and trivial. This film is like trudging through the cold mud to catch some juicy curiosities (opera music) hanging over the mud. We have other ways to appreciate the great Pavarotti, and this is not one of them. It is enough to have one of his numerous recordings of opera or vocal concert and recognize the master tenor in which he is best suited. <br /> <br /> It would be one of the 100 worst IMDb movies if more people remembered it and gave it a few votes; will fit perfectly into a list that includes various efforts by singers, actors, models and athletes to exploit their popularity through cinema. Very often, everything goes very badly due to incompetent acting or a horrible script. Pavarotti would have been a decent actor if he hadn't shown such a superb voice. As effective as an actor (the work requires it), not even Jimmy Stewart could have saved this turkey from a script. <br /> <br /> I give him a polite 3 of 10 because someone might have become a fan of Pavarotti's singing and opera because of this movie.
