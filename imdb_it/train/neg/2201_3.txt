Horror / Sci-Fi which is interesting as it is ridiculous. F / X pretty good ... for what you can see. A film for television thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them. Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant but misguided scientist who tampers with stem cell research and manipulates human DNA with that of a hammerhead shark. The terrifying results give life to an infernal war machine. A group of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo are invited to a remote island to take a look at the brilliant new experiment. Of course, having laughed and stammered in awe ... Coombs' creation, by the way, is his own son cast with a hammer, he is left free to hunt his father's colleagues one by one. Revenge is not always rewarding. Still in the cast: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.
