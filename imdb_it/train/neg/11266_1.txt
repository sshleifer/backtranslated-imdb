Well, what to say ... <br /> <br /> Having seen the movie, I still have to wonder what the hell it really was? V.Dodgy camera moves in the courtyard at some point ... I had to look away from the screen, I felt physically ill ... Round and Round and Round .... You had the idea ... <br / > <br /> VERY VERY VERY strange accents in many places .... "Those who should know, know" <br /> <br /> Except the fact of entering free, or being paid to watch it, or your partner is to make you paint the house or something like that .. then forget it ...
