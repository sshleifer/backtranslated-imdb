Normally I would have given this film a 6. It deals with a very important subject and it does relatively well - despite Katie Wright being a result in and of itself. <br /> <br /> I have no idea if he was actually instructed to play the character this way or is naturally irritating, but he did a fantastic job of making it impossible for me to take care of Lexi. There is no other dimension to her than how she is confused, helpless and ignorant, and how good she is at whining. I can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorder is out of control becomes upset, scared and sore. However, Wright's entire performance is based on incessant moans and groans, the rest is whining. I couldn't help but feel the problem with this girl in particular was not caused by the demon Bulimia, but she doesn't have a backbone. I strongly doubt that this is the point the film intended to make.
