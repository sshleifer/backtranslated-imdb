A guy that goes around for no reason ... I'll never get back those two hours of my life. The boy continued assuming identity and cheating on his pregnant wife. What was I thinking? How did he win a price anywhere? I knew he loved his father, but other than that the film was completely meaningless to me. What was the purpose of walking so much and going to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason. How did he enrich his life ??? Why did we have to see the dying old lady in underwear ???? !!! Why ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> Even if it would be profound or something more interesting. I don't recommend the movie even to leave while I sleep ...
