Really bad. Because someone thinks this is a good movie and much less fun is a real mystery. I like comedies as much as others and I really liked "A Christmas Story". The fact that he has the same director and is based on the writer's own memories leaves me completely perplexed as to why this film is such a complete failure at all levels. Charles Grodin is sadly sprawled as a father to beginners. For another it does not seem to have the same stimulation - it simply does not flow well. Everything looks tired and forced. The joy of life that permeates the first film is completely absent here - you just want the film to end. I would not even recommend this film to curiosity seekers who appreciated "A Christmas story". It's so bad. 1/10.
