The IMMORTALIZER was, uh, interesting. It certainly didn't kill me during its one and a half hour duration, but it didn't impress me much either. A group of children is kidnapped in an alley by muscle mutants (in a scene that presents the overwhelming sound effect of the less convincing head of cinema) and taken to a luxury home on the outskirts. Here the dott. Divine and her team are doing brain transplants for her rich old patients so they can have young bodies again. Hey, this was quietly redone with a big budget a few years later as FREEJACK! Who knew that when you transplant an elderly person's brain into a different body, their new voice will sound just like their old voice? With all this talk of pineal glands and the use of a bright green serum, you can almost see the visions of FROM BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR dancing in the heads of the producers. But production literally does not have the courage to do it. I never understood why, when someone is making a low-budget horror movie, they don't bundle it at the edge of the frame with cool blood. The acting is uniformly terrible, with the only good performance coming from Clarke Lindsley as assistant Dr. Price. He has a pretty evil laugh. The only other thing of note about THE IMMORTALIZER is that it presents many old people doing their stunts. Seriously, most of the cast have serious problems for the old ones.
