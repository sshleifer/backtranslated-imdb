The writer / director of this film obviously knows nothing about the film. I think the PS on this project was linked and replaced by a monkey, because every view was too dark or had the hottest hot spots of the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was horrible, the characters were very one-dimensional. Because someone said that this movie was made for poker fans and not for movie fans, that someone is kidding (he was probably the writer / director). No poker fan in this world appreciates this film. Even your money hates this project. Entering a casino and playing a few hands does not give you the experience to write about poker. Keep your day job. And if you play poker, then you have to be hurt.
