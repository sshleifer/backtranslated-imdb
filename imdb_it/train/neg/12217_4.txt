With the low budget, you usually find that you get what you pay for, and let me say that I didn't pay much for "Frightworld" ... <br /> <br /> Scriptwriter / Director: David R. Williams brings us the story an abandoned amusement park, besieged by the vengeful spirit of a slain serial killer. Not a bad premise, but performed with a bevy of limited budget errors. The camera work tries to be too manageable for the public, constantly using quick cuts to cover up the fact that they really don't have anything bad or scary to show us. This becomes evident right away, as the aspiring killer is presented to us, and soon we realize that (acting) is the scariest thing that happens ... After a painfully long sequence of titles, we are brought back to modern times , yet the acting remains the same. "Frightworld" generates a rather unique cinematography when it shows landscapes from inside the entertainment house, but with an extremely long execution time, it cannot save the film from the inferno below-average indie. <br /> <br /> There is a mediocre nudity, but not so much for the cold blood, which is usually the saving grace for these types of films. <br /> <br /> The really bad B-Movies fans might find something interesting here, otherwise, don't spend a lot of money.
