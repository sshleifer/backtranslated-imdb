I saw this movie a long time ago ... luckily it was free. I have to be one of maybe twenty people who have seen this movie in the theater. I don't remember a whole lot, but I remember that I was incredibly bored, the plot didn't make sense and when I left the theater the only thing I could say was that at least now I know what the worst movie I've ever seen is. I was incredibly bothered by one thing: if they can make the temperature close to the sun low enough to allow humans to survive, why can't they lower it to a comfortable temperature instead of being all hot and sweaty? How stupid do they think we are?
