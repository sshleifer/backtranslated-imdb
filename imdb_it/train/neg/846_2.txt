This must be, by far, the absolute worst movie I've seen in the last 20 years. When I saw that Michael Madsen was involved, I thought it wouldn't be a bad movie since he was in some pretty decent movies, and he was a pretty fair actor. MISTAKEN! No one should waste time with this movie. I made a fast 80 percent advance and don't feel like I missed something.
