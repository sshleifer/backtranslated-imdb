Hey look, handle it, there are much more representations of the difficulties of black America than this. Although I think this story is weak, my criticism is focused on the poor performance of the story, which I mentioned, the shots. <br /> <br /> This was done in the mid-80s and is horrible in the music / scoring department. It's fun to see Oprah as a crazy guy in the last days. <br /> <br /> The scene where Bigger brings Elizabeth McGovern into the incinerator. Pure classic cinema. First of all, I don't care how drunk you are, you'll react to a flame of 1200 degrees (no matter how bad your acting is). But they really milked that scene ... it was comical. I'll tell you what, though, I had great satisfaction in seeing Elizabeth McGovern burn in a mock death; she annoys me.
