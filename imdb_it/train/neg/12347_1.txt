This is easily Ridley Scott's worst film. Ridley Scott is a wonderful director. But this film is a black mark on his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both totally misguided in an exaggerated film about a girl who goes to the army. Very stupid. And there is never a scene that is convincing in any way. It's not really difficult to make a film like this. Everything the crew produces could be anyone's idea. Not even writers have had much inspiration; many silly dialogues that made no sense; and some brainless action. I highly recommend staying away from this garbage. I hope that the many talented people involved in this project realize that this type of film does not deserve their attention and that in the future they will work on more honorable and smarter films than this useless mess.
