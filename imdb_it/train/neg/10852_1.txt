This film is a very funny film. Violence is bad, acting is ... Well, Dani, stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell you usually do. Casual chicks that wear almost everything are just to catch sexually frustrated goth boys. Personally, I think this movie really sucks. The story and the characters could be very good, if we say that the direction, the actors and the other little things have been done better. But the movie is just ugly, the only reason people like this piece of shit is because it has damage in it. This film is perhaps the worst B rate movie ever. And believe me, it's hard to reach, especially when you compete with Def by Temptation and with lousy excuses for "serious" horror films. I'm not a CoF fan, so I only see it as another junk movie ... Really bad. If Dani did it like a comedy, then, that's fine. Very well done. In addition to this, I judge him low, because he is disgusting. Watch it when you are in a happy, cheerful, joyful, joyful way, so you can laugh at everything or if you have many different types of drugs.
