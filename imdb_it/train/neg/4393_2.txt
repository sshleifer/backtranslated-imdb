I didn't like Frosty's returns and this. Both films are absurd with badly written characters and bad voices. The rumors could have been made but Frosty returns it was worse than this due to the inalienable snowman they drew. Frosty's winter wonderland was great, as was the original moving drama. The only good thing about this movie was Frosty the snowman was similar to the classic 60s and a funny line like when they were talking about things that are not real and then Frosty walks by the window humming, whistling whatever he was doing, but everything else was badly written and badly animated and I barely got the plot. I saw the cover of the DVD in the library about 2 or 3 years ago and the art seemed poor, so I didn't shoot it until this year because the images on the back looked a bit touching, but I played this film. It was a poorly crafted character, just like the DVD and it was just terrible about what's going on. I saw it at night and found it boring that I fell asleep on the whole thing (I wait to do it always when I look at something while I go to sleep) But this film was overall boring <br /> <br /> Overall rating: Grade -C <br /> <br /> This is like another bad special blow of a holiday in icy returns and this. This is the 4th sequel as Home 4 alone, I thought the movie was OK, but at home alone 3 was fantastic. But it's like a bad house for only 3 and 4 people hate it this way. My sister didn't look at him so much because when she came to my room to watch 2 minutes and a half, she left as "I hate animation!" I agree with her just as the 3rd Frosty returns. Simply terrible!
