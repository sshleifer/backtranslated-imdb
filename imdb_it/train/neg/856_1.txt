These writings write about the end of the plot so don't read it if you haven't seen this junk. <br /> <br /> I found this junk movie in the horror section that made me think it would be a horror movie. If you had a video store, I insert it in the BORING section. This movie is so junk that it will make you feel like you've lost your stockings. <br /> <br /> This film contains endless shots of people driving as if it were scary. Well, I drive to work and come back (and sometimes to the store or visit my cats) almost every day and I trust myself it's not scary. It also starts with 20 minutes of driving for some people. Even the child does it. Turn and turn and he never stops. What's so scary to watch a child cycling for an hour? I think NOTHING and if you look at it you won't think too much either. <br /> <br /> The family drives to a large castle and is given a tour by simply walking around unceasingly looking at the kitchens. So the man walks for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. This is all that happens and, as you can see, it is rubbish.
