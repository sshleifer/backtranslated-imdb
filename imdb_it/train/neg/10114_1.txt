This is one of the worst movies ever. I like good films, but that's just awful. Where are the images in the film that are on the box? I think more money was spent on DVD box illustrations than for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Why should a company release a DVD that the cover is so misleading? I feel such an idiot to rent this movie based strictly on the box. As much as I can explore IMDb, I would have to do a little research and make a list before visiting my local video rental store. I have no one to blame but myself. I want my money back and the time. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> Even if your curiosity is motivating you, add cocktail umbrellas in your eyes. It will be much more fun. You have been warned!
