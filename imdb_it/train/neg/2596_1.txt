My God! I kept waiting for this movie to "start" ... then I waited for it to redeem itself ... and when it didn't, I sat there, stunned: 1) it could be so bad, and 2) that I had just wasted a couple of hours just out of sheer stupidity. I had faith that Drew could never make such a bad film ... and boy, have I ever lost my faith! Do not worry about it! Drew tried, but the film was poorly written, misinterpreted, and just badly conceived! I can't believe that such a bad script has ever been funded! He had a million chances to really do something with the idea, (the word "concept" is too big for this movie to qualify!) AND STILL wasn't going anywhere! It's just pitiful! Where the other reviewer got the idea that it wasn't the worst, it confuses me! Because believe me, if it had gone worse I would have cut my wrists before finishing it!
