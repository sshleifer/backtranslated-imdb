I'm afraid you'll find that the vast majority of people who classify this film as 10 are highly Christian. I'm not. If you are looking for a Christian movie, I recommend this movie. If you're looking for a good general movie, I'm afraid you'll have to go somewhere else. I was annoyed by the characters and their illogical behavior. The premise of the film is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was Jesus the basis of morality is wrong in itself. A scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal, and then the character goes on to say that it was Jesus who taught us. I find it offensive: should we believe that "not stealing" comes from Jesus? I suppose he wrote the ten commandments? And was the theft acceptable before that? I rented the movie from Netflix. I should have understood the nature of the film from the comments. Oh good.
