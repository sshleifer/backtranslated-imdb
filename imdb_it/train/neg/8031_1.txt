The American Humane Association, which is the source of the well-known disclaimer "No animal has been damaged ..." (the registered trademark of the AHA), began monitoring the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago, after bandaging his eyes the horse was forced to jump to death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, the atrocious act kills for me the whole aspect of the entertainment of this movie. I suppose one can say that at least the horse did not die in vain, since it was the beginning of the public to wake up with the insensitive and painful pain caused to the animals for the glory of the film, but I can't help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice, this surely would not have been the path he would have taken!
