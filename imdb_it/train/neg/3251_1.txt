I saw this movie on FX last night, and as I sat there watching it, it occurred to me that it could be the worst movie ever. Bad acting, bad cinematography, bad sound, absolutely incredible fight sequences, stupid characters. All this was the most unlucky movie I've ever seen. It was so ugly, I was fascinated by its lack of all that was semi-competent that I had to keep watching ... and they made a sequel!
