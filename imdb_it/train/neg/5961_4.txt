It was all over with the shears around 88 so it was time for the repercussions on the dozens of those old movies. The Brain is well done, the script reminded me of Videodrome but then in a poorer way as I said before. Acting can do it. But it's the effects that make you laugh, the so-called brain is really a turkey and the blood is never shown. The opening sequence is what makes this movie worth seeing, the hallucinations are really well done and remind me of Nightmare on Elm Street, remember the phone that comes alive ... Some how you keep watching this movie, waiting for what is going on later. It is visible to all the madmen out there because there is no blood in it and as said the blood is not there, but there is no nakedness for the perverts. I've seen movies worse than this, I just wish they had made it more bloody ...
