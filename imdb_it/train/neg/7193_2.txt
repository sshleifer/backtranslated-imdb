I had absolutely nothing to do last weekend, and tagged along with my friends to check out a movie ... any movie. And since the only movie we hadn't seen was Inspector Gadget, we decided to enter for that. <br /> <br /> GREAT ERROR. This is a film that could only interest children. Oh, and it's not like I don't like films for younger audiences. But this film has absolutely nothing to attract my attention. If you have nothing to do at home, go to sleep. Better than wasting hard earned money on this. Go see the movie if you are a child or if you are a parent with a child :)
