I couldn't watch more than 14 minutes. It's a BIG combination of really bad acting and really bad direction. The shots used are disgusting, they broke the 180-degree angle all the time. My head hurts trying to look at that load of "you know what". The dirt on the "mystery car" window makes you see the light from the illumination of the windows ... annoying. What else ... it's so poorly framed all the time that makes you want to scream at that lady who runs there. I directed only short films, but I'm pretty sure I'd be much better at making a feature film ... the story is incredible, only the long scene of French kisses at the beginning tells you it will be really horrible. So, practically, try to avoid these really bad movies at all costs, it will save you $ 5 for the rental, and that an hour and a half of your life will never come back ...
