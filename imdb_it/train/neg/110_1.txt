I have this film outside the library right now and I haven't finished watching it. It's so bad that I'm incredulous. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent at the time, even though she had practically finished with "Robin and Marian". This is the worst thing about this terribly stupid movie. It's really interesting just because it was his last feature and for Dorothy Stratten's appearance just before his murder. <br /> <br /> There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and her cronies. Small signs and small bows and signs of the true dejected comedy of which this is the palest and weakest shadow. <br /> <br /> Who could believe that there are also some of the same neighborhoods of Manhattan that Hepburn has lived in such a magical and even mythical way in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" twenty years before? The soundtrack of the old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too strong and obvious: you certainly don't have to wait for the titles to find out that something has been subtly woven into the cynicism of the movie to know when the songs exploded . <br /> <br /> 'Restore to type' means to go back and go back, I think. In this case, the chic European lady of Audrey Hepburn is all that is seen of someone who in the past was occasionally an actress and always a star. Here he even lost his talent as a star. If a person whose talent continued to grow over the period, like Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been a life in it, even in the presence of incredibly bad material and mongoloid-level situations. <br /> <br /> Hepburn was a great person, obviously, bigger than most movie stars had ever dreamed of being, and was once one of the most beautiful and fascinating actors in the cinema. After this terrible performance, he continued to make an atrocious television movie with Robert Wagner called "Love Among Thieves". In "They all laugh" it's like he's still playing a naive in his 50's. Even many vain and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted on doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than Hepburn. Turner acted seriously even when he was mean. Hepburn does not take it seriously at all, it cannot be disturbed; even his hair and clothes look gaudy. His last great job was in "Two for the Road", perhaps his most perfect, if not his best in many ways. <br /> <br /> And that girl who plays the country singer is simply disgusting. John Ritter is horrible, there is simply nothing to recommend this movie except to see Dorothy Stratten, who was really pretty. Otherwise, the phrase often used by the critic David Thomson "to lose his talent" never made more sense. <br /> <br /> Ben Gazarra had lost all the sex appeal since then, so we have 2 movies with Gazarra and Hepburn - who could ask for less? Sandra Dee's latest, painful film, "Lost", 2 years later, a low budget nothing, has had more than this. At least Mrs. Dee spoke in her own voice; in 1981, Audrey Hepburn's accent sounded simply silly; she would go to make PBS 'Gardens of the World with Audrey Hepburn' and there her slightly irritating accent works as she travels through English gardens with aristocrats or matches in an effusive way on 'what I like best is when the flowers come back to the nature! as in natural narcissuses, but in a fictional film, it seems ridiculous. <br /> <br /> To think that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" was such a deep and light thing with Audrey Hepburn, one of the most beautiful women in the world - was certainly one of the most beautiful cinema appearances in "My Fair Lady", combining Garbo in several things and Delphine Seyrig in "Last year at Marienbad". And then this! And his brief final role as the "Hap" angel in Spielberg's "Always" movie was just part of the lady stuff - sloppy, easy-going and stuffy. <br /> <br /> I went to his funeral service at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, a beautiful service that included a choir of boys who sang the Shaker anthem "Simple Gifts". The only thing that was not listed in the program was the sudden execution of Hepburn who sang "Moon River" during the fire escape in "Breakfast at Tiffany's", and this brought much emotion and some real tears in the congregation. <br /> <br /> A great woman who was once a good actress (as in 'The Nun's Story') and one of the greatest and most beautiful movie stars in many films of the 50s and 60s that have become really bad - it's not all that common. And maybe it's just a great human being who, in making trivial things like film performances, still has the goodness of the mind to want to point out the unscrupulous defects - that all his late film work contained in abundance. Most of the talk about Hepburn's disconnect concerns "My Fair Lady". But what the original actress should have been was "Wait until dark," starring Lee Remick on Broadway. Never so celebrated as Hepburn, she was a better actress in many ways (Hepburn was completely unable to play something really sordid), even though Hepburn was quite adequate in that part. After that, all his acting went downhill.
