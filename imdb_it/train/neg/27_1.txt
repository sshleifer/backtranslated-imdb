Terrible film Nuff Said. <br /> <br /> These lines are Just Filler. The film was bad. Because I have to expand on what I don't know. This is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn the others. Avoid this movie. Acting sucks and writing is simply idiotic. Bad anyway. The only nice thing about the movie is Deniz Akkaya's breasts. That too was ruined by a terrible and unnecessary rape scene. The film is a poorly invented and absolutely incredible piece of junk. <br /> <br /> OK now I'm going to think about IMDb for this stupid 10 line minimum text rule. First I waste my time looking at this offal. So, feeling obliged to warn others, I create an account with IMDb only to find out that I have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad it is. Totally useless.
