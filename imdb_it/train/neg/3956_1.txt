in fact, it's basically the same film. And they couldn't even correct the chronology of events. Perhaps it was intentional because of laziness or lack of care. In any case, this thing is a real woofer.it not even deserved to be called a movie. I saw this as a second feature on the disc containing the original The Boogeyman. I thought my head would explode, and I urge you to run farther in the opposite direction of this thing, if you were to be cursed with the misfortune of combing your hair through its path.it should come with a warning label like: Warning- can drop your iq by several points if you are in its vicinity. for me, there is no doubt that this thing is a 0/10
