Carlito Way, the original is a brilliant story about an ex-dealer who hopes to leave his criminal past and so invests in a club and takes care of the resulting problems. <br /> <br /> was .... <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer and I knew immediately that it would be bad ... but after closing the films in the past and discovering that they were fantastic (Lucky Number Slevin, Tokyo Drift). .. I gave this a shot and failed within the first five minutes ... <br /> <br /> The script is something a teenager would have thought up if he had given five minutes to prepare ... He was weak, with weaker dialogue. There seems to be an immediate need for romance in a gangster movie. So Brigante decides to beat a guy for the girl ... and she says "Yes!" And if you need to behave badly, throw racism around ... How we learn from 'Italian mobsters' ... <br /> <br /> The acting was nothing short of terrible ... I found' Hollywood Nicky ', hilarious. <br /> <br /> I absolutely hate all these musicians who turn to movies. Let's face it, the only reason P Diddy made this film was that he could play a gangster ... The actress who plays Leticia was weak but beautiful. The sex scene was weak but we got to see it .. that was fine ... <br /> <br /> But overall I expected it to shed light on how Carito ended up in prison and the love of his life. .. And the killer towards the end has completely added the horrendous movie that is ... <br /> <br /> Carlito's Way: Rise to Power ..
