This unpleasant film has little to recommend. Dolph Lundgren offers a better performance than that allowed by this script or its other action films. And there are occasional fragments of dialogue that suggest that the film may have been able to provide some information on a bizarre subculture. <br /> <br /> But no. The reasons are obscure or trivial. Most of the acting is sub-par. The script creates unnecessary confusion. And the director's useless fascination with concentrating on blood is distracted. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine who the audience is for this film.
