There were a lot of really great horror films produced in the seventies - but surely this film is not one of them! It is a pity that The Child is no better because it works with a decent idea that contains a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. We have the idea of ​​a vengeful child, who has worked so well in classic films like The Bad Seed and then we have the central theme of zombies, which of course was the backbone of many successful horror films. The plot is basically this: the girl blames a load of people for her mother's death, so she goes to the cemetery and lifts the dead to get revenge (like you do). That's fine, except it's boring! Nothing happens for most of the film, and even if it eventually recovers with a good gore; an ending is not enough to justify the session through the rest. The film was obviously shot on a limited budget, as the locations seem cheap and all the actors are lousy. There's really not much I can say about the film in general because there isn't much to do. The Child is a sad horror movie of the seventies and I certainly don't recommend it.
