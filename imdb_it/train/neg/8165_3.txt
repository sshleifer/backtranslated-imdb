It's a ghost story. It's a story of cannibalism. It's a story of revenge. It is a very badly done film with a lot of violence. I suppose it follows cheaply along the lines of every slasher movie you've ever seen. It has the usual isolated place, the presumptuous campers, headed for the desert. Of course, there are some pretty intense scenes. It's so boring. Bad modifications and the whole job. There are ghost children who sound like they're talking in a waste paper basket. I'm not really sure what the ghosts are playing and the psychopath with the seed cap. He also has the gross scene in which a man eats a piece of meat that is actually what remains of his wife. A friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of gratuitous and sick violence. I'm afraid it's just another step in our desensitized evolution. Three are not intelligence here, no tongue on the cheek, just a sad waste of time. A lot of blood; small plot.
