Looking only at the trailer for Theodore Rex, you'd think this is a police comedy with Whoopi Goldberg and a boy in a dinosaur costume. This is true, but this is mainly a futuristic story, which looks a lot like Batman Forever with its directing style and bizarre characters. It was mismatched, and should have been marketed as a futuristic tale, instead of a mere police comedy. Regardless of whether this film is mixed or not, it's still a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> In the future, dinosaurs have been brought back to life through incredible technology, and they talk and go around like humans. Teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously, but after a dinosaur was murdered, he took the case to work, but he must be a partner of the toughest cop of them all, Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg). It is up to this maladjusted duo to solve the murder, and it is up to the public to stay awake long enough to get over this cruel piece. <br /> <br /> Teddy starts the image as a normal acting character, but in the end it is unbearable to listen to. For some reason, besides being a detective, he is also a bad comedian and a bad imitator. He imitates famous people and accents, and has really terrible lines. Whoopi blames him for farts and says "It's not my trumpet ass!" Wow! What a childish and immature line, even for a film for children of this caliber. Whoopi is also boring and rude to everyone. I was hoping that Teddy would bite his head for the entire length of the film. <br /> <br /> This film never knew what it wanted to be. When futuristic scenes and actions take place, there is no comedy or humor. In all non-action scenes, the characters try to be as fun as possible, which simply translates into an uninterrupted boredom. Action scenes do not work because they are too bizarre and not violent enough, and as previously stated, comedy is just a bunch of massacred jokes. Nothing ever works here. <br /> <br /> Having a human dinosaur / detective duo seems like a rather original film, if nothing else. No! This film is a huge rip-off of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Replace the dinosaurs with cartoons and set them up in the future, and it's exactly the same storyline. A man is killed, a dinosaur is killed. A dinosaur and a detective solve the murder, a detective and a detective solve the murder. The villains of Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and weasels. The bad guys here are a guy who plays like Christopher Lloyd and guys who behave just like weasels. The club scene in Roger Rabbit where Jessica Rabbit walks on stage is imitated by dinosaurs. This is a great rip-off of a much better movie! <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a bad movie, it doesn't even deserve to be directly to VHS stature. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 on ****. 90 minutes PG for mild violence, rough language and humor.
