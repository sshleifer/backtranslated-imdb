I'm really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones has started making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons I've ever seen. I didn't laugh at this short one time, and it's a Bugs Bunny comic book, for God's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always fun, not boring! Alas, this short appears to be Good Night Elmer (another incredibly boring short by Jones) with the addition of Bugs Bunny. <br /> <br /> The first warning sign of a boring cartoon is never a gag gain. Good Night Elmer was boring because he dragged the same two gags forever with a predictable payoff. This cartoon, on the other hand, is plagued by the second warning sign of a boring cartoon: there is too much dialogue. The comic has at least more than two gags in the sleeve, but most seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer finishes dinner and comments: "It was a wrif www wamb of wamb", perhaps the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters reading a text aloud in Woody Woodpecker's comics 'was later does not count in my book). Although this vignette lasts only 8 minutes, it seems 20 thanks to redundant dialogues like this. <br /> <br /> Elmer's Pet Rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me, but if you sold your soul to Chuck Jones and can't recognize that he directed some clunkers during his career, you might like it.
