It looks just true to form, any movie with Dolph Lundgren is bad! I don't know if it's the fact that the plot is full of holes or that Dolph is such a bad actor. No spoilers here, it seems late to push and push and grab and touch thing in this movie. In my opinion it is a wonder that some of these projects find venture capital to enter the can and theater.
