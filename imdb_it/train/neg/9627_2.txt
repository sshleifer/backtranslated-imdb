Ok, I absolutely love Ben Stiller, even though I am lukewarm for Jennifer Aniston. I don't think this girl could behave in the least part. Every movie or sitcom I've seen it in is very difficult to overcome its fake acting. Looks like you're just standing there reading the script. This film had only one positive aspect, and this is precisely the role of Ben Stiller. This plot is so used and abused it's ridiculous. How many movies have this same type of plot? We can say "Forces of Nature ??" Not only is the plot so old, but the result is so predictable, it's boring. I knew everything that was going to happen before it happened. It was boring, but watching Stiller is always a pleasure !!!
