The people who are praising this film are the real disappointments - I hope at least that Leonard will see something good from this, as his life savings were taken away by a manager a couple of years ago and he is over 70 years old. . But this film is simply terrible. At the beginning Leonard himself says he is not sentimental about his past, and then for the next hour and a half the film emphasizes all the worst sentimental elements of Leonard's songs. He is so damn PRECIOUS with his endless close-ups of singers who emulate their numbers. Cohen's interview is all done in the lo-fi video close-ups and I wanted to see a medium or a long shot of his whole body! I didn't care less about the comments of the artists, in particular those proud egoic boys, Edge and Bono. None of the artists in this film did even one song like Leonard's music and if you are thinking of seeing this and you have some doubts, consider them. This would be a special PBS acceptable, perhaps, for once showing. But I will even hesitate to get a DVD of this. When the film finally shows Leonard's semi-performing "singing tower", it is ruined by Bono performing a verse. Even the occasional good performances (Antony, the first issue of Rufus, Martha's The Traitor) are ruined by the context of the rest of this turgid blabla. Forget about this, and buy Leonard's latest album if you want to pay tribute to him.
