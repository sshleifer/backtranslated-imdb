This film is one of the most distorted portraits in history. Horribly inaccurate, this film does not honor the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous servants that the Japanese sadist killed and tortured to death. The bridge had to be built "above the white man's bodies", as stated by the Japanese chief engineer. It is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors committed by Japanese kidnappers are the source of a film, in which the bridge itself is not even close to the precise point of the bridge. The real bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood. What of the survivors who are still alive today? They hate the movie and everything it should represent. Their friends were hungry, tortured and killed by cruel sadists. Those who did not die from infantry, hunger, or disease are deeply wounded by the film that makes their dark age so light.
