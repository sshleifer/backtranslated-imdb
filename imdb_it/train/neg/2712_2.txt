The 1960s is an occasionally funny movie, most of this show comes from laughing at the movie. It is extremely uneven and includes many annoying elements. Take for example the transition between black and white and color. If done right, this could be quite effective, but because it was done wrong, it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; much of the film had a strange feeling. The acting wasn't extremely bad for a TV movie, but again it was definitely embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were not consistent and ended up causing confusion. How did this family somehow end up in many of the great events of the 1960s? The finish was too mushy for my taste; because it was Hollywoodized, everything had to end right at the end. I would advise you not to waste your time in the 60s and do something else with your time. I'm glad I saw it in class, and not in my spare time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the film was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. These are just my wandering thoughts on the film. I hope you follow my advice and stay away from this.
