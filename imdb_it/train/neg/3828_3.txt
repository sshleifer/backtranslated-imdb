In 1976 the western was an exhausted genre and the producers of this film knew it clearly. However, instead of setting the project aside and saving us from having to see it, they went ahead and did it anyway. Apparently they need an interesting discussion to convince the public to come and watch the film, they decided to make it as brazen and unpleasant as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch so why wouldn't it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch had the advantage of a superb script, but the script for The Last Hard Men is pure old fashioned garbage. <br /> <br /> It's hard to understand what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired lawyer who chases a group of prisoners who escaped from a violent outlaw (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by prisoners and subjected to sexual degradation. <br /> <br /> This is a bloody movie in which every time someone dies they are shown in over- the top detail. It is tremendously disappointing indeed, because the combination of the stars sounds like a mouth-watering perspective. There is not even a sense of rhythm or urgency in the film. It takes forever to move forward, but when the action finally arrives, it is marked by the emphasis on malice. All in all, this could be the worst movie Heston has ever made. I'm sure it's one of the productions he hates to include in his illustrious CV.
