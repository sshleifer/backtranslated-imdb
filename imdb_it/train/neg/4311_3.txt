I saw this movie when I was a kid full of angry hormones and it was a really sexy film like I had never seen, or I never would have seen. It may not have been a great movie. My hypothesis is that it wasn't. I don't remember much, to tell you the truth. I only remember the sexual relationship between Crosby and Biehn. No woman in any film has ever done it for me, as Cathy did incredibly sexy in this movie. I haven't seen him since the first time I saw him on TV in the 70s and I don't think I'd like to see him again since I'm sure it would be a disappointment - my hormones aren't that furious and I've become more tired over Some years. Yet when I think back to the shower scene, I still remember how good it was when. <br /> <br /> Added later: After seeing the movie again, I found it dangerous to go home. What was once erotic is now quite docile. The older woman, the younger thing, still works for me, not so much as it used to be, probably because I'm no longer twelve. That older woman is now younger than me. Furthermore, the dilettantism of the whole affair was not perceived by my twelve year old mind. <br /> <br /> Moral: sometimes it is better not to revisit the past.
