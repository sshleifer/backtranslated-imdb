James Bishop (Matt Stasi) goes to a "mental illness facility" for a medical residency assignment with dr. McCort (Bruce Paynes). There, he realizes that many interns are killed by "The Ripper", which brings their souls to the devil, in a cult sponsored by Dr. McCort. This story is so absurd and foolish that it is impossible to write a summary. The dialogues are so ridiculous, especially when the character of Helen, James Bishop's blond boyfriend arrives in the asylum, which is almost unbelievable that a writer had the courage to include them in a script. And the return of James to the hospital to bring the files of dead patients? And the cast, composed of actors and actresses of the ham? Honestly, I don't know what or who is the worst in this movie: the script, the director or the cast. The correct answer is certainly all of them. I saw this film on cable television and am amazed how a producer can spend money on such junk. This horror movie becomes a lot of fun considering the absurdity of the plot. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Dem√¥nio '(` Devil')
