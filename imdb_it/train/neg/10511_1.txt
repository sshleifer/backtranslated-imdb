Note to horror fans: the only horror here is when you realized that you just wasted 95 minutes of your life in a movie that is so useless that it's offensive. I observed this because: <br /> <br /> The premise seemed slightly promising: it is not. It's just an excuse to use the same set pieces from other low-budget movies that didn't go well. <br /> <br /> The promise of naked forest nymphs seemed pleasant even though the film turned out to be terrible: it is not. It is not so. Amateur cinematography makes the "fallen angels" as sexy as the average homeless. <br /> <br /> The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: it is the king of low budget special effects and low budget acting. Come to think of it, Savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie. It's not that he's bad, but it's almost always bad movies. His only role was in Da Dusk Till Dawn, and since then he has been milked at horror conventions. <br /> <br /> But let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Damned is a great example of how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Everything else is negative. Obviously the writer is allergic to originality. The script is terrible. This is all data after the first 10 minutes. But the rhythm without tracks; the way in which the director treats "plot" and "characterization" as a nuisance which in his opinion is of no interest to anyone; and the long and boring and boring driving, walking and nature sequences (no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film suitable for distribution) show a total lack of attitude to the cinema and to narration in general. <br /> <br /> This is another good example of how to figure out if a film will be bad: if it is written and directed by the same person, they expect rejections.
