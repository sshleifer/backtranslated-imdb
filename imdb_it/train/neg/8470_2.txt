I watch a lot of scary movies (or at least try to be) and this has to be the worst, if not the second worst movie I've ever had, to let me try to sit down. I never knew the depths of masturbation until I rented this piece of moldy cheese covered with a used latex contraceptive. I'm a fan of Julian Sans, but this is worse than I would hope for him. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the story was promising and intrigued me ... for the first minute and a half the credits rolled and I still didn't see what pain looked like the first hand. Perhaps there are some spectators out there who have appreciated this aspect and can point me in the right direction, but then again I know those spectators who understand if they don't commemorate me, especially when we had to turn off the video, and this is simply NOT done with our look (we had to make an exception of course). <br /> <br /> If it were ready for a remake, I'd give it a chance as long as they had incorporated a maximum of 1% of the original. That's all.
