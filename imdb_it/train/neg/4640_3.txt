Hunters chase what they think is a man through the forest, even though the public sees that he is a werewolf. The hunters never seem to realize it, because after they've shot him, it seems normal when they behead him. <br /> <br /> A doctor transplants the werewolf's eyes into a man who has lost his experience in a laboratory experiment. The man, Rich, starts having sex with his nurse (Stephanie Beaton) before he even takes off the bandages. <br /> <br /> After leaving the hospital, he discovers that his wife is also betraying him. When a smoke machine sends the clouds in front of an amateur picture of a moon (with a fake tree branch in the foreground), it turns into a werewolf! His torso becomes larger, his shirt splits, and a giant werewolf mask in his head grows with red eyes in his eyes. His pants remain intact. The mouth chews unconvincingly, although some kind of robotics (or hidden hands) in the eyebrows give it a baleful look sometimes. <br /> <br /> Despite the poor werewolf costume, there is a good amount of blood and blood, and those are pretty well made. There is also a good beheading later in the film. However, when a man falls from a height, a rather bad mannequin does the job. <br /> <br /> Rich has a friend named Siodmak who is a sort of occult expert, and incidentally stumbles into even a small man with crutches named Androse who is also an expert. They try to help him a little. <br /> <br /> Rich kills the people who hurt him. A policewoman investigates the murders and tries to hit Beaton, who doesn't care much about the lesbian scenes, so nothing comes out of it. <br /> <br /> Fairly cheap, but between nudity, blood and blood, and a non-horrible story that combines (sort of) The Most Dangerous Game with The Hands of Orlac and The Wolf Man, it's a little fun. Available alone or in the Scream Queens Vol. 1 casket.
