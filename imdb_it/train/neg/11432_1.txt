I saw this movie yesterday and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh practically had to carry this incredibly embarrassing script for five hours (or how long it actually was). From the beginning, every single element of this film is incredible. This film made me laugh out of hand several times, but it was mainly because of the shock that the director / writer really expected us to believe the many messy elements that tried to put this film together. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is Gray (Graham) and its problems with intimacy. Things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly too much in common. <br /> <br /> Interesting, intriguing. However, instead of revealing this story in something believable and appealing, the director continues to bring Gray into these crazy giggles that actually make no sense. Being an LGBT individual, this film seemed to echo what all heterosexuals think they face in the coming-out process. (I will be insulted if the writer is extravagant.) Had it not been for the nice chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which, by the way, was understandably forced), I would have given him a negative 3 star.
