I was sorry to watch this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, is a fan of the first one. This movie has been sucked! The magic of the first was missing. You could actually understand every word the mice say, the animation is disgusting, the building is very different from the first film, there are new characters that have never been mentioned before and were terrible, fortunately the Prince didn't have many lines they sounded stupid. Basically it's like The Lion King 1 1/2 except the different stories told by mice. The reason I'm giving this 2 out of 10 is because the songs not sung by the characters were the most fun.
