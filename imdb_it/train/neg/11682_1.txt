Now isn't it? Considering all the good work done by Danzel, Clive and Jodie, the film never became anything more than a horrible film of die-hard movies. Yes, a couple of jokes, there are absolutely no unpredictable twists, to be honest the only unpredictable moments are there because both the director and the editor made some stupid mistakes, it's a shame for them and a waste of time for us. IF someone can tell me why the hell they were digging a hole in that safe, who the hell is the Rebe and how the hell they knew the diamonds were in the particular cell, it might just make my day, but it looks like Spike asks us to give up too much in this for granted, and not to raise eyebrows when something seems stupid ... it's just another film in the studio that relaxes and has fun ...
