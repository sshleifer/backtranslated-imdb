I'm a big fan of old westerns and I don't think Hollywood is capable of capturing its old glory. But not even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can help this 1957 film that brings almost all the trite features of the westerns of the reformed gunslinger who became a good boy. crumbling but virtuous woman, bigoted citizens who have to turn to the gunman for salvation, etc. I can't help but notice the surnames of the writer and the young "actor" who plays Granger's son. Is there any nepotism there? I have seen better acting in school plays. Chill Wills plays a cartoon by Chill Wills. Have I already reached 1000 words?
