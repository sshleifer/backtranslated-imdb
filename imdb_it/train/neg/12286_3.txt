The summary provided by my cable TV guide has made the sound much more interesting than it actually is. "Slaughterhouse Rock" is by far the worst horror movie I've ever seen, a title previously held by "Urban Legends: Final Cut". From his opening scene I could say that it will be really bad, but I was so bored that I didn't care less. This film contains laughable acting, especially from the guy who is tormented in his dreams, incredible as in unbelievable twists, and some of the most disgusting music I've ever heard, and I'm experiencing a time when Britney Spears and her Nsync dominates the air waves. The biggest problem with "Slaughterhouse Rock" is that it's not fun. One would be a boring and boring movie and so NOT as scary as this would try to make things a little more unpleasant with some funny jokes here and there, but no. We have the self-centered friend of Tormented Guy who tries to be funny, but instead finds him annoying. (spoiler) And please, tell me, who in this crazy world is crazy and sorry enough to visit a disturbing prison in the middle of the night? Nobody! If you're going to make a horror movie, at least make it believable. This is everything except.
