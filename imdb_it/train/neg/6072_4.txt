DeNiro is a master ... one of my favorites. And I love good sports movies {not in baseball so much, but hey, his sports movies, right? I was expecting a lot more for this movie. It seems to start well: DeNiro is what I expected, Snipes {which I don't really like} is very good as the spoiled star. Barkin's role for me was OK. She is a good actress, but she seemed out of place in this role. For me, they always seemed to hurry the scenes, and then drag themselves a bit in some places. It just seemed like I was so bumpy! Considering the cast and plot, it could have been much better. I classified it as a "4", and I was generous ~ I'm a tough guy with numbers!
