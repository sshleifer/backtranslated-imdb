I was subjected to this atrocity by my wife, I tried to turn it off after 10 minutes, but I was forced to go through the whole thing. This must be, without a doubt, the most macabre fiction of a film of all time ... <br /> <br /> There have been great screenplay moments, such as: <br /> <br /> Sammy - " If you end up here right away you get a bonus "Lady -" A boner? "Sammy -" No, a bonus "<br /> <br /> In summary: horrible script, terrible and incredibly illogical acting.
