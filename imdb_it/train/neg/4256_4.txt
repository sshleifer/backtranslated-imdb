Ascension is actually a step forward in terms of what the original film was in history and in special effects. Jason Scott Lee He is as good as a vampire hunter looking for the same count (if you remember, he was from the movie Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story.) Jason London is as funny as Luke, the guy who helps the woman he loves from a distant body of Dracula from the slab. Diane Neal She is as good as the woman who steals Dracula's body to find a cure for her dying boyfriend, and Stephen Billington is as big as Dracula himself. Offering a better performance than Gerard Butler did in the original film count. Roy Scheider completes the rest of the cast in this film, and does a decent job as a mentor to the character of Jason Scott Lee. This is the second sequel to the trilogy, and they are going well. It's in the air if the last movie closes the series on a good note.
