... is the only way to describe this film on topics that should be sure: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst makes her way into the role of the silent movie star Marion Davies as if she thought she was in "Legally Blonde". The guy who plays William Randolph Hearst will exaggerate to the point where he wants to reach the screen and slap him. Eddie Izzard is pretty good, apart from the fact that he plays Charlie Chaplin and talks about, oh, 125 pounds too heavy for the part? Difficult to believe that this irregular and stunned wreck was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, but then, again, he didn't make a watchable movie, what? 30 years? Sometimes, you can't go back.
