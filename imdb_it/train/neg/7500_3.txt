Spike Lee must be one of the most voted directors I've ever seen. He is the beloved of the critic because he presumably makes films with a "message" or is so bohemian in his approach that makes the critics imbued with the formula of Hollywood movies that eat his things just to be different. <br /> <br /> Summer Of Sam doesn't even do it well. The cinematographic and editing style is Oliver Stone, as is the narrative. The plot is very similar to "Do the right thing". The portrait of "Guidos" or for the Italian-American set PC (of which I happen to be one) came directly from Eddie Murphy's Raw. Only the impression of Eddie Murphy of an Italian macho who fights a much taller African-American is much, MUCH more believable than the large and loaded Italian caricatures shown here (John Leguizamo's character is a possible exception). <br /> <br /> Is there anyone who has seen this film that could not understand how it would end? As soon as Richie entered the film, I could already see the punch in the face and the foot in the stomach, I could already see him accused of being the murderer. This character had the highest integrity in the whole movie, so, of course, Lee will show what happens to the people who stand out in the crowd (what a white clique!) <br /> <br /> Someone please, for Please give Spike Lee a lifetime pass to all the basketball games he wants. So, maybe he'll have too much fun taking a camera for a long time and we won't have to go through his authoritarian insanity and I won't have to see critics (some of them I respect) ohhhh and ahhhh to an emperor without clothes.
