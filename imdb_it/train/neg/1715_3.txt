While it contains facts that are not widely reported, it is not exactly the truth. They took a lot of freedom in rearranging events, excluding people, and using sets that didn't meet the facts of their lives in the 1930s. There were more than Bonnie, Clyde and W.D. in the gang at various times, and those people had so much to do with facts like those included. Buck and Blanche went to convince Clyde to go straight ahead of the shooting, and in fact they turned back into crime. Some of the events that were portrayed in daylight took place at night. Bonnie's wound was much more serious and never healed. It was so ugly that it had to be carried around by someone until it was healed, and even then it stiffened, so it walked stiffly. Clyde also walked with a limp because while he was in prison he cut a big toe. I know, I'm fussy, and it was a TV movie, but even without these concrete errors in this "TRUE" story, the film moves too fast from one event to another and looks more like different separate snapshots of their lives, rather than being a fluid and cohesive story. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth.
