Raymond Burr plays a lawyer involved in the murder of his best friend (Dick Foran) thanks to his affection for his friend's wife (Angela Lansbury). This was a full year before Perry Mason started doing it, so the film could be of particular interest to his fans if he was the inspiration for his casting. <br /> <br /> There isn't much else here that is interesting though. Lansbury is always good, but his character here is very one-dimensional and the reasons for his crime in the mystery are totally obvious. There is an interesting exhibition by Lamont Johnson as a painter who is also in love with the "femme fatale", but Burr's character is quite simple. It is frankly bizarre to see an actor like Burr doing these romantic scenes with Lansbury, and his interruption in deliveries does not match his character very well as in most of the films in which I saw him. There is really no mystery, and all the suspense should be around the title of the film and the way Burr's character is setting up the character of Lansbury to imply herself (the double risk prevents her being processed again for the original murder, presumably). He does it with a very large recorder that does not notice when he enters the room I imagine. <br /> <br /> Some moments perhaps unintentionally funny and in practice the rest of the thing could have been done for TV.
