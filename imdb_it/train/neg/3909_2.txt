When I found out that there was a movie with both my favorite actresses, Meryl Streep and Wynona Ryder, I went through the roof! But I had a hard fall after watching this lame movie and I still have a bruise. First of all the character that Jeremy Irons (an actor whom I still admire even after this disappointment) was simply horrible. He treated his family like crap, especially his sister, played by Glenn Close. I couldn't get close to or sympathize with any of the characters and I'm not a prude, but the sex scenes were really useless or could have been mitigated. The characters of Wynona and Antonio could have been developed much more and their love story could have been much more passionate. And what was in Meryl's character and his "mystical powers"? Why didn't they do it more? This film had a lot of dead ends and the bottom line is that this is a really bad movie and there was a lot of wasted talent here.
