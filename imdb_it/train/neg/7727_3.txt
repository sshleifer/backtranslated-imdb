I'm commenting on this miniseries from the point of view of someone who read the novel first. And from that perspective I can honestly say that while it's fun, I can understand why it hasn't been retransmitted at any time recently. More specifically, this mini has some serious problems, such as: <br /> <br /> 1) It's terribly inconvenient. The actors who played the younger generation were all 15 or 20 years older than the characters. Ali McGraw (45 at the time) played Natalie Jastrow who should have been 26 years old. Jan-Michael Vincent (39 at the time) played Byron Henry who should have been about 22 years old. Henry and Pamela Tudsbury's other sons were also played by actors too old for the characters who should have been in their 20's. <br /> <br /> 2) Some of the acting were absolutely horrible. Ali McGraw sometimes made this mini almost invisible. I have seen more convincing performances in high school performances. <br /> <br /> 3) The direction was poor. To be honest with Ali McGraw, bad acting and character development were probably directing. The portrait of Hitler has been exaggerated. His character appeared and acted more like a villain than the cartoonist and sometimes charismatic, yet always diabolical, genius of Herman Wouk who painted him as in the novel. Some of the other characters are made in such a stereotyped way (Berel Jastrow) that they don't acquire the depth of the character that Wouk has created for them. <br /> <br /> 4) This mini is very dated. The hockey music, the pretentious narration (it sounded like a narration of a film about middle school history) and the whole sensation of soap operas in the mini's early evening made it almost comical at times. Moreover, too often Byron and Natalie are dressed and made to look like they were in 1979 rather than in 1939. <br /> <br /> Someone who looks at this without the benefit of reading the novel first probably won't be sitting by it all, because it will be released later as in the late 70s / early 80s "take too seriously" the early evening soap drama, rather than the TV version of what is certainly a modern American classic. <br /> <br /> Remakes of older and similar films are sometimes badly made, but this is probably a case in which a creative and inspired director could make an extraordinary production, memorable and critically acclaimed. I never see it since a remake should have been just as long (15 hours) or longer to do it right, and given the lack of attention from the current American public, it wouldn't have flown.
