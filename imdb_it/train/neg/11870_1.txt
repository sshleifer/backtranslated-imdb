This is the most depressing film I've ever seen. I saw it for the first time as a child and even thinking about it now upsets me. I know it was set in an age where life was hard and I know these people were poor and the crops were viable. Yes, I understood everything. What I find difficult to take is that I can't remember a single moment of light in the whole film. Maybe it was true for life, I don't know. I'm pretty sure the acting was top notch and the direction and quality of the shots etc. Etc. They were wonderful and I know that every film can't have a happy ending but like a family film it's terrible in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained by a movie. I can't stress enough how this film struck me as a child. I was talking about it recently and all the sad memories are flooding again. I think he would have everything but the heartless to reach Prozac.
