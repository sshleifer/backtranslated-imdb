At least the set of less than ten years will remain interested. Eleanor (Geena Davis) and Fred (Hugh Laurie) Little, a handsome wealthy couple, have decided to bring a new baby brother to their son George (Johnathan Lipnicki) from the orphanage. They return home with the new strange brother ... a small decidedly cut mouse named Stuart (voiced by Michael J. Fox). Yes, mouse. Stuart is happy to have found a sense of belonging even though he is in a world of enormous dimensions that contains his pet cat Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane). Stuart undertakes the experience of family loyalty and general friendship. George will finally accept his new little brother when the elegant Stuart will save him embarrassment in a model boat race. <br /> <br /> In the cast: Julia Sweeney, Harold Gould, Estelle Getty and Jeffery Jones. And the voices of: Chaz Palminteri, Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly.
