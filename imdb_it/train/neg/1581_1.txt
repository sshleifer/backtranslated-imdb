This was a waste of 75 minutes of my life. The acting was atrocious and the plot was ridiculous. It's about an evil lesbian getting rich with married men to have sex with her, and then blackmailing them for money. One of the victims is a candidate for DA, who is causing problems in his relationship with his wife. Another is a plastic surgeon, even a married one, and the evil lesbian happens to seduce even this boy's wife! Meanwhile, the girl from the wicked lesbian doesn't like it much when she sleeps around. It ends in a happy ending where everything is forgiven. Women also get very naked, especially in situations that extend reality. hurt hurt hurt.
