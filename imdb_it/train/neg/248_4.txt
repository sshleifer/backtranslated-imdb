When will the wounds end? I never want to see another version of a Christmas song. They continue to make films with the same story, falling off each other in an attempt to make the film better than everyone else, but unfortunately they can't do it, as this is not a good story. Happy, conservative, moralistic, old-style thinking. As if people learned. The many different versions of this film show that we are not.
