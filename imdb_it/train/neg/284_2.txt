Today, I only picked this up at the 99 cent store, and I still think I was robbed. "Dream to Believe" is a rather boring and unrealistic gym drama and $ 1 is too expensive for this. This film is probably only noteworthy for 2 things: 1. It has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. It is directed by Paul Lynch, the man who also made Promo Night. Now on the film. <br /> <br /> This is a girl named Robin (played by Olivia D'Abo) who is seriously injured due to a car accident that cost her father his life. So the incident prevents her from competing in gymnastics tournaments, is often caught during her lessons and eventually meets a wild kid named Tommy (played by Keanu). Robin, when not in training, works part-time, along with his mother and stepsister, in a laundromat owned by his abusive stepfather. In the end she is chosen to compete. <br /> <br /> In general, Keanu alone and some catchy songs from the 80s are what prevent me from giving this 1 star, and it's not even one of the worst films of all time, but still far from good. The DVD itself does not receive any medal as it seems to come from an old VHS and towards the end, the sound goes out of sync and when the credits are almost finished, it vanishes in black, even if the sound can still be heard. So this can probably be passed as a bootleg. The DVD artwork does not make any sense as it has the recent photos of Keanu and Olivia and the background has nothing to do with the film, as it is not even in the film itself, so the cover is obviously photoshopped. In any case, avoid at all costs, unless you are a Keanu fanatic. I probably won't think about it anymore. I'll probably give it to The Cinema Snob, which is a big critic YT btw. Hey, if any of you have any lousy movies that you don't want to see from them anymore, feel free to give it to him to keep his show running.
