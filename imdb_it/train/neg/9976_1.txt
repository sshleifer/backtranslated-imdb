The first scene of 'Problem Child' has a baby peeing on a nun's face. For this film, it's witty. A bad, bad "comedy" is inept at so many levels that it begs beliefs. John Ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from hell, and congratulates him on having maintained his dignity in the surrounding assault of a note, of annoying performances and childish humor. What the hell is Jack Warden doing in this mess? Slackly directed by Dennis Dugan and hateful in his attempts to ignite sentimentality when crudely done, the film is so badly made that it is a rather bizarre experience. But it doesn't matter all this. The weak point of the whole thing is Michael Oliver, the most repellent and unpredictable child actor who has ever hit the screen ?? believe me, you'll want to hit him in the mouth.
