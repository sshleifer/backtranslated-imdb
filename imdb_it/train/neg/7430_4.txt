It is interesting to see how Pierce Brosnan's career was entered before Bond arrived on the scene. In this "tense" thriller, Pierce Brosnan plays the kind Patrick, who works with the ghetto boys in "trust courses". Romances a woman, who has a mid-90s boy called Mog-top called Eric. The woman's former drunk husband soon arrives on the scene and starts messing with Pierce. <br /> <br /> At one point Pierce is innocently doing "vegeburgers". The husband enters. Pierce goes back to being a vegeburgers. The husband then assaults Pierce. From the mouth of Pierce fall small pieces of vegeburger cut in half. The struggle ends abruptly without showing the result. This is as good as the movie. <br /> <br />
