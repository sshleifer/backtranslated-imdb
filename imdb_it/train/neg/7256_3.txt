I bought this movie on Blu-ray because it promised great visual and musical effects. I was also a big fan of a similar movie ... Baraka. The film is very styled after Baraka, wide-angle, very similar shots with the cameras set to capture the passage of long time in each shot. Also some scenes were identical (the road with traffic). While Baraka told a great story, juxtaposing nature, the environments created by man, the spirituality and the horrors of the world in a compelling way and with great music, this film leaped from one shot to another without a comprehensive story, mediocre music and then. ... POOF, it's over! I thought there must be some sort of error! World history? Half of the film is Egypt and the landscape (it looks like Arizona, but I didn't bother to check). Seriously folks, this is horrible, rent it if you have to, but don't buy it. Filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for doing so.
