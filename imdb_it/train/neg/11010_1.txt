This film doesn't even deserve one. This was a complete waste of time. It was a waste of movies and money. It was not offensive, but everything was provocative and disgusting. My spoiler is one that I think should be read by everyone. There is complete frontal nudity and disgusting language. But not only that, there is NO plot, the actors are terrible, the accents are horrible, the actors are small and I was also EXCITED watching this movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I rented it was for Brian van Holt (who by the way only got a part of fifteen seconds). I think this could have been a mistake in the directors and parts of the publishers, but they repeated the same segments two or three times, adding only one new sentence. <br /> <br /> A film similar to this is Eraser Head, perhaps the most disturbing film in existence. There is no plot, and it's not funny. Even if he's not trying to be funny. DO NOT WATCH ANY FILM.
