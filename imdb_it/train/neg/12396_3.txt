There are not many positive things to say about Underneath, Soderbergh's false feat in neo-noir. Soderbergh faithfully reproduces Robert Siodmak's Criss-Cross noir, without altering the plot, however the adaptation drains him of every ounce of his noir atmosphere to the state of the art, giving the same story set in the less attractive places, styles of life and anachronisms. Soderbergh, who would later make wonderful detective films like Out of Sight and the Ocean's series with great style and atmosphere, embarks on the dangerously obvious road to modernization by renewing the story with the ugliest, flattest and flattest fashions of the early years. 90. The nightclubs have terrible and disgustingly dressed garage bands, the uninteresting version of Peter Gallagher of Burt Lancaster's anti-hero is left by his fatal girlfriend for the compulsive purchase of modern cinematic lifeless devices like stereo, TV and other instruments modern that suck the reaction out of the movie. <br /> <br /> It would have been more fun and less boring if he had a little thanks, like a good score, more meat for his characters, more than William Fichtner who offers performances that are not t in wood, a brighter rhythm. Unfortunately, Underneath doesn't have any of these things. Soderbergh, a good director, this time does not use his dry posting to benefit his film. That arrangement works wonderfully when he is driving a detective film with more tongue on his cheek like the previously mentioned George Clooney photos, or a social drama or characters like Traffic or sex, lies and videotapes. With a film like Underneath, it intensifies the boredom experienced by the viewer.
