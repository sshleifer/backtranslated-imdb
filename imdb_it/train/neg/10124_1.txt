there is no suspense in this serial! When an episode ends the acting is so poor, the effects are so poor and the script is so terrible that the last thing on your mind is how Batman and Robin will save the day. No, in fact, the last thing you have in mind is to watch the next episode! This show is so boring that I can't see how it was ever made, let alone published on DVD! Obviously the effects are not up to the contemporary Batman films, but the script is horrible too. An inconsistent mess of an evil professor and a ray gun or something, I'm not entirely sure, because it's too horrible to follow. Check out the 60s version, or the 90s versions, or even Batman Begins, anything about this version!
