The very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Too many missing characters, romantic scenes, changes in the plot, too short, appeared to be low budget. Enough dialogue to understand the story if you are not familiar with the novel. In some scenes it seems that Lorna has a cold sore on her upper lip. I'm sure the trick was to hide it. I guess they didn't want to stop filming until he healed, too bad. Most likely because this film lacked kissing scenes. Just a scene of the disappointing kiss at the end. Lorna Doone is a great epic tale and should be said true. The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is twice as long, more romantic, much more pleasant and more faithful to the book.
