It may have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of the most famous American serial killers, but unfortunately it doesn't even come close. Terrible editing, directing, bad acting, your name. This film is literally about 10 minutes into a 100-story plot. The only thing that redeems is Bruce Davidson as a father, but it's not enough to save this stinker. A 1 out of 10.
