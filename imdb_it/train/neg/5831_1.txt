This film is hugely boring and pretentious. There is only one good time when a sailor shaves Mr Barney's eyebrow (thinks the purple dinosaur unpretentious). The music is inexorably cloying - it's sad that Bjork, someone with so much inner beauty, has been reduced to false falsehood in his art. The magnificence of the tea service makes a beautiful insipid ritual. mythology and culture are not respected in this film that are revoked. Not only from Japanese culture but from another director ... (stay tuned) In a perfect moment of "art imitates life", the ship's crew finds a giant piece of sh * t. What is the audience found in the theater. There are some pieces that are very composed and artistic without heart --- so get ready for spoilers - I'm talking to you MR BARNEY. <br /> <br /> The emperor has no clothes! Mr. Barney, you've been outted! I saw Jodorowsky's HOLY MOUNTAIN. And your thin, fake BS veil has been removed. You stole your images from your style and your ENTIRE ART CATALOG of this man. Now that HOLY MOUNTAIN has been released FINALLY we hope that the powers that are found in the Art Councils of the world STOP FUNDING YOU! Poor Jodorowsky, lost in a financial battle with the Beatles lawyer when he is the Lennon / McCartney film. AND BTW while Jodorowsky is the Beatle-YOU ARE THE MONKEES! A nice, thin, soulless graciousness only appealed to the easy kitsch college freshmen. And by the way I'm a director. If you are interested in making a reality film, I will legally tie you in a ring to defend Jodorowsky-tu, openly defending theft.
