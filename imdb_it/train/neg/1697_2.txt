I'm a big David Lynch fan and I have everything he made on DVD except for Hotel Room and the 2-hour Twin Peaks movie. So when I heard about this, I immediately grabbed it and ... and ... what is this? They are a bunch of cartoons in black and white, crudely drawn, that are noisy, sullen and not talkative. Maybe I don't know what's good, but maybe this is just a shit pile that has been tarnished by the public under the name of David Lynch to make some money, too. Let me make it clear that I didn't care about the vulgar linguistic part, but I had to keep adjusting the sound because my neighbors could have. All in all this is a very disappointing version and could have remained only in the deluxe set as a curiosity. I highly recommend not spending your money on this. 2 out of 10.
