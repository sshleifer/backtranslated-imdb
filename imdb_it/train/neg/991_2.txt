If you want to see a good movie about how women can fight against sexual aggression, then this movie is not the movie you want to watch. It was a social commentary on a woman who was victimized and fought. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson overturns the tables on his assailant. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim uses vigilantism. You essentially cancel the judicial system. The film "The Accused" was a much better film because the victim uses the court system and wins. What is the "Descent" saying to the victims of aggression that they should resort to violence? Is the victim better than the accuser? No!!!
