I don't know what that other review was about. This is definitely not a child movie, in fact, I don't think there was a decent looking girl. No, it's just a Ed Woody-style science fiction skeleton, shoddy and mischievous. And it's bad I can't even start telling you how bad it is. I saw him late at night on cable, and I was shocked. The fact that this film was ever released is an insult to all of us. The actors were friends of the producer or mentally retarded, the special effects are a joke and the pace is insanely slow. For me, though, music surpasses everything. A monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone. Don't rent this thing, but if you ever see it via cable, look at it. You will be surprised how bad a movie can be.
