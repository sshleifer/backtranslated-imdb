I'm definitely in the minority opinion on this. "The Hurt Locker" has won more "Best Picture" awards from critics than any other film this year. However, not only did I not like it, I found it difficult to sit. <br /> <br /> There is a minimal plot and a little character development. They disarm bombs, fight and disarm other bombs. This is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But the worst part was that the camera never stops and shakes continuously. This has been a recent fashion in film production and should make everything seem more real because it has an economic and documentary aspect. The camera was shaking so much that it made me feel sick to look at the screen. Normally I don't care about war movies and "The Hurt Locker" was no exception. But you don't need to believe the word because critics love it.
