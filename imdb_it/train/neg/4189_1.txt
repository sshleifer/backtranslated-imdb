I had the unfortunate misfortune of returning to two of the worst films of 2004 this morning: first, the inconsistent void of The Chronicles of Riddick, led by CGI, and then, the embarrassing vanity project known as Greendale. One costs millions and the other costs a few, but they are both bad. Really, really bad. <br /> <br /> In advance, I have to say that I am not the biggest Neil Young fan in the world, but he contributed his share of classic songs: from Buffalo Springfield (whose best compositions were Young) to Rust Never Sleeps, Harvest, and Mirror Ball, the man wrote some really great songs. Unfortunately, there are no great songs in Greendale, and a few precious few good ones, and the film around which they were built is a really trivial and simplistic political slogan. Completely devoid of merit as an art and unimportant as a controversy, Greendale is best left forgotten. Buy the book if you feel obligated to contribute to Young's bank account.
