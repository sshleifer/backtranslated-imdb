Elvis Presley plays a native American "half-breed" ("Indian") who must defend his reserve from business magnates. Everyone likes getting drunk, fighting and having children. Fighting, fighting and "punching" replace the stereotypical expression "How"? <br /> <br /> Even if he has rigged, it is obvious that Elvis is healthier than he appeared in previous films; perhaps, he was preparing for his famous "return". It couldn't be because the script of this film was something to be excited about. Joan Blondell trying to seduce Elvis, and Burgess Meredith in "war paint", should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> The best song is "Stay Away" (actually, "Green Sleeves" with different lyrics). The most embarrassing song is Elvis's love song to the bull "Dominic". There are some surreal scenes, but it never becomes fun enough to succeed in that genre; however, "Stay Away, Joe" could provide laughter if you are in the right "mood". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, stay away. <br /> <br /> ** Stay Away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
