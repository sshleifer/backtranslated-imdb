I understand that this film is made for children and, as a parent, I sat in many films that do not particularly interest me, but I can appreciate from a constructive point of view how it is received by my children. After all, parents should be encouraged to take part in their children's activities and monitor the quality of the entertainment they see, so there should be something to attract an adult audience at some level even in children's films. Disney has always understood this and that is why it is so difficult to understand how it could allow such a complete piece of drek to carry their name. <br /> <br /> Technically, sound editing is horrible and all dialogue sounds are dull and unnatural. I personally hate it, but it was doubly terrible considering that the dialogue itself seemed to have been written by a twelve year old for a school project. The "acting" reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had a range of emotions in their voices. Fortunately it was a short film. <br /> <br /> Now, before going out as a video-geek who measures a children's movie with a stick for adults, the only thing that can save even the worst film for children is a positive message. determine how a message should be delivered until it's the right one. Let's take a walk through this film to see what messages are given: <br /> <br /> If you are lost, don't worry, you will inevitably find your way home. <br /> <br /> Approach wild animals without fear. <br /> <br /> You can win any competition just because you "know" you can. <br /> <br /> is my favorite, the final message left in the film: <br /> <br /> It's okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right.
