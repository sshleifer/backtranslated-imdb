This is only the second time that I feel quite forced to comment on a film's imdb. The first time was probably for the best film I've ever seen and was for Memento. <br /> <br /> Seeing Darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to Memento, as in the worst movie I had the misfortune to see Apart from the two scenes containing naked women, there is nothing in this film to be lifted from the pile of waste it is. <br /> <br /> Let's see, scary effects, clich√© scripts, bad acting and even about 90 minutes long. My wife and I have laughed for the most part in disbelief of how bad. Surprisingly I saw it until the end, as I did that I don't know! TO AVOID!!!
