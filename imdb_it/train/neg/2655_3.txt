** 1/2 for this farce of Diane Keaton. <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Mrs Keaton, enough of your philosophy and your Annie Hall hats. <br /> <br /> This movie is too much Keaton's daughter, Sara, dies in a car accident while her boyfriend survives. <br /> <br /> Keaton, who could not be reached by telephone, because he was in the sack with his friend and had pulled out the plug of his phone, grieves in a new way for grievers. <br /> <br /> He retires to the summer club where all Sara's friends stay. He cleans the house, sleeps for two days and then begins to reveal things that were better not revealed. It seems that sweet Sara slept with her girlfriend and the guy who eventually married the latter. Also, he had an abortion thanks to this boy. Now we are all involved in this journey of guilt. <br /> <br /> His only hope is to find the elusive diary that Sara kept. He also hopes that the boyfriend, Adam, who is a playwright, does not include all this in another play. <br /> <br /> When the journal is found, it was written in Japanese. Sara had a doctorate in this language. It's not great news for mom when a diary excerpt is translated by a Japanese chef into a Japanese restaurant. <br /> <br /> Of course, everything seems to bond well in the end. <br /> <br /> The title of this shmaltz comes from The Wizard of Oz. Each time Mom and Sara talked, they would both say Surrender Dorothy. <br /> <br /> As if this were not enough, in the course of this bizarre extravagance of mourning, Keaton tells Adam not to be another Woody Allen in his film, Interiors, where he tried to successfully emulate Ingmar Bergman. Ms. Keaton also tries drugs with the group. Come on, folks, can we realistically believe that anyone in their right mind could cry like that? <br /> <br /> The fair and mediocre look best sums up this film.
