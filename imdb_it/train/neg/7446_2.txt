I have 2 words for you. Sean Bean. It is the only useful presence in this film. But even so, don't watch this movie. Even if he is as good as the main villain, you don't want to waste time. <br /> <br /> I didn't care about the characters (except the kid) and in fact I didn't really care that cross-star lovers ended up together or died. The film did not make me worry or BELIEVE that these people took care of each other. I read many "classic" novels after watching the movies and this film made me not even want to read the book. The story seems so boring. But I can go ahead and read it to try to redeem the story in my head. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Doone. The actress who played Lorna was also in Sense and Sensibility and she was much better. Watch Sharpe, Horatio Hornblower, A & E has great novels films like Pride and Prejudice. Or miniseries like the Forsyte Saga. Check them out, don't worry about Lorna Doone.
