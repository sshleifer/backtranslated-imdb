KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963, who I remember voting BOMB) was my introduction to the work of the cult director Honda; this is not necessarily better ?? it's just that I've learned to be more tolerant of such an inherently low rate! <br /> <br /> Here, in reality, we take two Kongs for the price of one: an ugly looking and drugged giant monkey and a robotic variant that looks even worse! The simian creature lives on the world island (!) ?? where it is shown that it fights a couple of other monsters and befriends a trio of humans. Of course, he falls in love with blonde (and insipid) heroin; in fact, more intriguing is a femme fatale in league with the bad genius of the movie ?? called Dr. Who and showing off the anemic and cloak aspect usually associated with a vampire !! <br /> <br /> Kidnaps King Kong and hypnotizes him to recover Element X, which is embedded in the icy waters of the North Pole; apparently, the giant ape is more impervious to radiation than its mechanical counterpart (and, to ensure its full cooperation, Who captures even its three "companions")! The female agent therefore has a change of heart, helps the heroes (one of whom, typically, is anonymous anonymous) and is killed by Who. Eventually Kong manages to escape and arrives in Tokyo, where he has a final showdown with the robot. The doctor escapes the consequent chaos in his sub ?? which, at the request of Kong's dreamgirl, is summarily trashed by the giant monkey.
