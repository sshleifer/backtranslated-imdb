This is not art, it is a long-distance, politically correct propaganda! Jindabyne's political intolerance goes beyond the unforgivable ... he does not see people as individuals, but rather as members of categories. <br /> <br /> This is the most paternalistically offensive Australian film that I can remember (and it's up against rather stiff competition!). A film of messages, every tired theme, dear to the fashionable left, is there: the aborigines are victims; white men are violent or alcoholic; white women are not so bad - especially if they are lesbians - but they are most likely of a depressive nature. <br /> <br /> Four men who go fishing find the body of a murdered woman (aboriginal, of course) and leave her in the river for several days while they catch the trout. It is a strange decision taken almost without discussion, as if men were animals. The only man who shows briefly is the good ... we know this because he lives with a bisexual woman - he likes to keep his child very much - and eventually he moves to a more fashionable coastal position (away from all these beastly inhabitants of bush). <br /> <br /> This is a film made by those fashionable urbanists who live in fear of the Australian landscape and those evil rednecks that reside inside. The ignorance of life in the country is almost as shocking as its contempt. The film is crossed by a long-distance vision of the bush supported by mysterious and presumptuous music. It is made very clear in the end that the aborigines are the only ones at home in this landscape. It ends with an excruciatingly implausible scene of reconciliation in black and white. <br /> <br /> In Jindabyne, country life is reduced to little more than a background for a story that implicitly proclaims the superiority of the values ​​of urban lighting of the left-wing inhabitants of those of other Australians. <br /> <br /> This film was not made by people with real work but funded by the government's Film Finance Corporation. It is a product of the artistic set, of the soulless void populated by wonderful people for whom rich government funding supports these offensive projects (which are detached from real life as possible), instead of making popular films that people want to see. It doesn't matter if the movie is a stinker, they are still paid. <br /> <br /> Save useless time, avoid it like the plague. More faded social commentary than real entertainment, this film deserves to do an overview!
