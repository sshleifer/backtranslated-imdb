Like most festival signings, Hamiltons makes it interesting to watch a movie that has all the ideas and a little execution. Although impressive for its obvious low budget, the film falters in its latest twist and becomes terribly long during its impromptu and obvious conclusion. The film is about a family of marginalized murderers trying to survive after their parents died. They kidnap people, drain their blood and feed something locked up in their cellar. There are some beautiful darkly humorous performances by Mckellhar and Firgens and the rest is just so-so. The film never seems realistic or very disturbing. But for the first half it's up to a strangely humorous and obscure mixture that is a surprising result. The next part is not so successful when it recedes into the oblivion of the cinema with unrealistic twists in a ridiculously arrogant ending that turns the entire movie into shit. It is a pity, although there is no doubt that some talents have been involved in this production and, although deeply imperfect, it remains original and creative. pity that when it comes to delivery it fails completely at all levels. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
