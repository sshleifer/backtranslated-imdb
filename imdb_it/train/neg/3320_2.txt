I honestly had pretty high expectations when I started watching this movie, but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> First of all, the pace is incredibly slow, so it seems much longer than it is (and it's not short). I'm sure that when Jane Austen wrote the book, she made several pages, filled it with descriptions and didn't want people to read one day, or she could drag and lose her charm, which "Emma" certainly did . Now "Sense and Sensibility" had this defect of a slow pace, but at least it had lively lines to compensate, as well as some good performances! <br /> <br /> This brings me to defect # 2, which is, of course, acting. While I hardly care about anyone involved in this film, I'm sure they are capable of a good job, but I haven't seen much of this film. It was as if people were trying too hard to be witty, too difficult to be "upper class", too difficult to be English (well, some of them), so they just came out as a group of actors and not as people. <br /> <br /> # 3. The cast, as I said, looked just like actors, and not really like the people who were playing. Maybe it's a good thing, because the people who played really weren't that good. Why does everyone like Emma, ​​for example? Sure, he was kind to the rich and beautiful people in front of them, but it was a terrible gossip behind them. If her friends were "ugly", then she didn't even bother going behind them. So why is this girl so big? Why do people have to tell stories, "just to make them laugh?" Obviously the snob could not even do it well. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow, and her "Emma" has not changed my opinion. <br /> <br /> Well, it's easy to see that I didn't care about this. I'm sure it's a lovely book and everything, but some books aren't meant for the big screen, and "Emma" is one of them.
