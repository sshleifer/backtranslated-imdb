First of all let's start this review with the fact that I SIGNED IT ONLY TO WRITE THE REVIEW AND NOTIFY THE PEOPLE TO SAVE THEIR MONEY !! <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst pieces of trash I saw from The Hulk. The plot was the most predictable garbage imaginable. If you expect 24 but on the big screen, immediately download the expectation in the bathroom along with the money you would use for a ticket. You could get more fun that way. The acting was terrible, the plot was completely unrealistic, (in the end the so-called "twist".) I have to say this. The ending surprised me, I'm not referring to the surprise that surprised me, but instead the simple way that they put together what could be considered the ONLY scene of a fairly decent action in the whole film. They hurried to finish so quickly that I didn't even realize it was over until I saw the end credits turn and at that point I thought I'd burn the film reel if I could only figure out how to get into that screening room. <br /> <br /> The casting was horrible for some reasons. First of all, they must have mistaken the characters' tasks by accident, because Michael Douglas played the role of CLEARLY that Keifer Sutherland should have acted, while Douglas was lurking between agents, touching telephone lines, slipping into systems and pulling people out that hunted him down, Sutherland plays the least capable agent who is always in the mood for announcement even when things don't go wrong for him. He plays a very bland agent, nothing like his type of Jack Bauer that makes us love 24 fans. <br /> <br /> I can almost promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas. It can be compared to the remake of "The Fugitive" / "In The Line of Fire" but written by people with mental disabilities
