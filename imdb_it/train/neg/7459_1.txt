please save your money and go see something else. this movie was such a piece of shit. I didn't want to go, but I had to, so I thought I'd laugh at least once, NOPE. not a single laugh, it was so horrible! chris kattan will never get a good comic role after this and "a night at roxbury". this film is completely obvious, it doesn't have a good mood at all and it repeats itself over and over again. listen to me and get as far away from this movie as possible!
