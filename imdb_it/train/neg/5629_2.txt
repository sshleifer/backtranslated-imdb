I just rented (yes, I paid to see!) This movie. OMG. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As another reviewer, Mrs. Colagrande, said, get out of the movies, PLEASE! Please never do or appear in another movie! The lady has the charisma of a melon. No, it's not fair for the melon, which is probably more successful. You don't know how to act; he always looks disgusted (it reminded me very much of my young sisters and always disgusted by Europe). She is not charming; she's not pretty. There is no real story. And the assembly! There was nothing I could see! It's pretty ugly when you watch a movie and, just to get past it, press "forward" on the remote, and ANCHOR nothing happens! I mean! ..... I continued to scream unintentionally, "Cut! Cut!" What were they thinking? Well, obviously, they thought they would make a movie together and pay to make love on the screen! Good enough for THEM; pretty raw deal for the viewer! I think I'm going to throw up now ....
