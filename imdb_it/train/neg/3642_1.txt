Unfortunately the film is more interested in limiting social commentary on a real event, but it doesn't have the balls to legitimately document what happened. The constant rhetoric of how violent video games are not to blame (I have the impression that Ben Coccio is an avid gambler), or how the media and music are completely devoid of influence is the obvious message (we also have a ridiculous scene of the two guys burning ALL their CDs, let's talk about finesse!), but the film only manages to get away with it because of its "fiction". Good try. Yes, it's a great idea to alleviate flu media, but how do we know that children who actually planned and performed a school shooting were influenced by the media? or video games? We don't, and we won't be using this movie because once again these guys are smart enough to completely abandon the media, yet stupid enough to burn a Nazi symbol on the ground? haha somehow I don't think so. <br /> <br /> The film blocks you in the head with its portrait of the normality of families, it is almost a disservice to think that there was not a serious defect in the dynamic family of children who actually went out and shot their companions of school. Why is everyone so worried about making murderers "normal" when they are so obviously not? A completely false and false representation.
