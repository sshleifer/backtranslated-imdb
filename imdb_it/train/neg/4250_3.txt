It's like what Dracula's other films always do, Dracula's servants always on Dracula's side, which is what disappointed me in the end. Regardless of whether the person wishes to remain a vampire or not, I'd like to see something like the first movie the minion fights against his master. It's very interesting (since you can almost predict how the story goes) that only the priest or D. wins the game (we need amazing plots!).
