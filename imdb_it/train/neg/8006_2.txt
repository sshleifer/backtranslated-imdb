What this film does well is to combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that excites more audience emotions than a typical horror movie. Unfortunately with bumpy narratives, frustrating plots and contradictory scenes, this film caused me mainly frustration and is hardly "the greatest monster movie ever". <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good things: comedy, acting and special effects. From the beginning, this movie starts fast and brash. The initial scene - the origin of the monster - is campy and fast, paying homage to the classic "environmental" disasters that gave birth to many other monsters. The pace is fast, a pleasant break from the long and often unnecessarily dramatic opening scene of other monster films and allows the film to immediately enter into action. With within 10 minutes you get the "why", "where" and "how" of the beast and you're ready for action. In this the film carries. <br /> <br /> After another short sequence, the characters are introduced: the lazy son and his precocious child, the kind grandfather and the talented sister (aunt) and, of course, the monster. The characters are brought into context with one another and their conflicts are immediately apparent, allowing the public to try for them when the monster suddenly appears to devastate the river area where they live and work. <br /> <br /> The monster itself is a magnificent appearance: alien yet familiar - a bit like a dog and a fish torn to pieces by a squid. The effects of the creature are second to none and even if it seems strange it is credible and at no point in the film could you see its strings. "Even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar, like a growing and excited rottweiler on the linoleum that the monster he staggers through the crowd, slipping on the surfaces, crushing and eating those in his path, when the path of the monster intersects with the family and the tragedy ensues, it's really a painful moment, and you can feel the need for revenge, but from there forward, the film's appeal begins to unravel. <br /> <br /> After the beginning of the dynamite, the film quickly loses concentration and continuity: the plots are introduced, then abandoned, the characters change position for no apparent reason, and the play is intertwined in dramatic scenes that confuse intent, while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random. <br /> <br /> As for the comedy, let me say: I am willing to accept that much of the humor is probably cultural. I'm not familiar with Korean humor, so maybe things got lost in the translation. However, as an Asian scholar in college and as someone who has lived in Japan for the past 5 years (still here) I would like to think I have a better understanding of Asian humor than the average white guy. That said there were many parts of the film that I realized had to be fun, but, for me, they weren't. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example: after the initial attack in which the young daughter is lost, the family is at the funeral; everyone is grieving A new character is introduced, a brother, and the tension increases even more, as it becomes clear that the two brothers are in conflict with each other. Both begin to suffer from their loss and end up competing with each other over those who are more grieved. This competition is, in essence, fun: two brothers who do not love each other so much that they even compete for a funeral - it shows the thorny nature of common family love in Asian comedy. This subtle slap-punk comedy that mocks the family and ritualized mourning should be fun, but it really seemed out of place in the context of a lost child. ************** END SPOILER ************** <br /> <br /> Then the holes in the plot arrive. there are so many points raised in this film that they are never explained, or worse, they are explained and frustrated only to prove themselves powerless and useless in the end. Finding an obstacle is not an obstacle it can be a good thing for a character, but you would expect some comment to that nature. Instead, the public is struck by moments of anti-climax when the problems simply "are gone" and nobody gives the indication that it was always a problem to start. So I ask you: why bring it to the forefront? <br /> <br /> This was prevalent during the film, as the problems gave rise to new problems and suddenly the film world is full of opposing forces that have never resolved. Naturally the introduction of new and greater problems is a story that tells the tradition, but if the introduction of a new arc leads to a forced shortening of another, one would expect at least that the new arc has a complete explanation. Not in this movie. Instead it was as if I obtained several stories, each explaining only 20% of the route and, in the end, the parts never converge to complete everything. <br /> <br /> Again, I am willing to accept a lot of this could be "cultural". Perhaps it is in the Korean narrative tradition to put the play into a tragedy. Perhaps it is normal for stories to go everywhere like a child coloring outside the lines on every page, but it never ends. Perhaps it is right to present a problem to develop the plot, but then remove the problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis. Or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and the rampant bad story in a film that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.
