This film is so ugly that it simply challenges reality. Filming is at its best in school material, acting is pathetic and the director should be banned forever from making films in any form. So bad that it can't even be seen as a comedy like something along the lines of Showgirls. The only thing this DVD had in store was the cover. <br /> <br /> All I can write to those of you who have not had the misfortune to witness this is please do yourself a well deserved favor in advance and do not waste time or money on this piece of junk. If you want to watch a film about comedy, there are many more worthy of this garbage.
