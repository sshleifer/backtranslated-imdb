It was thought to be the flagship of the open source community, something that would stand up and scream to the media around the world to realize that we are not stuck in the marketing trap with our options to produce good work with open source tools. After downloading the basic version (die hard fan here on a dial-up modem) I finally got here and hit my first hitch. Media Player, Mplayer Classic and winamp failed to open it on my xp box, so Totem, xine & kaffeine failed to open it on my suse server. Mplayer managed to manage it impeccably. It will be difficult to spread the word about it if normal users can't even open it ... <br /> <br /> The movie. Beautiful soundtrack, extraordinary lighting, masterful chamber work and impeccable texturing. Everything seemed real. And then the two main characters moved ... and talked ... And the movie died for me. Everything apart from the lip-synching and the actual animation of the two main characters (except for Proog in the dancing scene) they appeared fluid and totally alive. The two main characters have been so badly animated that I sometimes wondered if there are any games on the market with cut-scenes that involve less realism than this. <br /> <br /> Any frame in the film is fantastic .. as a frame, and the thing is beautiful if none of the actors moves. I'm so glad I didn't recommend it to anyone. It would ruin my reputation. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the final fantasy had a more perceptible and cleverly designed plot. <br /> <br /> this movie would have gotten 10 stars if it wasn't for the tragedy that is right there on the screen.
