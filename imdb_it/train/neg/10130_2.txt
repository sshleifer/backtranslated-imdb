I own almost all of Seagal's films (yes, even those like this on a low budget), and I must say that this could be the worst, not only of his films, but of all the films ever made. The only highlight of this film, and the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1, is that A. is Seagal, and B. Seagal has some sweet action sequences, specifically in the store, and even when never takes pulls out a whole army with a knife. Next time give me 90 minutes of Seagal killing people, and don't even worry about a plot, because the plot is not only cloying, but also acting, the fact that the F-18s and F-14s somehow they turned into F-16s, and also the fact that the Stealth was as fast as an F-16. Even Stealth has never had to refuel ??? And since Afghanistan is considered hostile territory from an Air Force standpoint. the last time I checked, Afghanistan has no Air Force, we (US) control the skies. Furthermore, this top secret mission was played through the speakers to the entire crew in the room, yet the admiral still whispers to the other boy that it is secret. Also, how did Seagal go up from the bottom of the truck? Please tell us why they imprisoned him, since the pilots of the Air Force are great commandos (unless they are Owen Wilson?) And since when their drunks are in Arab countries, considering that Muslims do not drink alcohol? Also, since when, since the Arabs listen to orders of women like the # 2 in office? The highlight of the film was surely Seagal who killed people in the store, and the other 50 people he killed with a knife, as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere.
