What a pity that Alan Clarke should be associated with this tripe. This does not exclude him however; take a bunch of guys and some little stars together and have fun playing this time again and again and rolling on the floor in tears of laughter. Great wasted night stuff. Al Hunter hosts a well-publicized theme from the late 1980s - that thugs were well organized and not very interested in football itself - often with respectable jobs (real estate agent ???). But like Clarke, he can convince us that all the two-bit actors who move away from other low-quality television productions (Grange Hill) or soon go into a poor quality drama (Eastenders) can make us believe for a nanosecond that I'm a hard kick thugs is ridiculous. Do we really have to believe that the ICF (which is obviously drama based) would NEVER go to another city to fight with SIX blokes? <br /> <br /> The ICF would eliminate metro stations and the like with hundreds of people. Andy Nicholls' Scally must be read before contemplating a story of this nature. The acting is scary and provides the most laughter- Oldman is so camp that it's incredible. Many of them seem to be in a Mr. Matey's bathroom bubble. A real source of inspiration for anyone with a digital video camera who thinks they can make a change.
