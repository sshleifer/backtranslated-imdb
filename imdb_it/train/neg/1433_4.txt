The images are fantastic and reflect Canada's landscapes well. The story was, on the contrary, quite boring; In my eyes it was a love story in the woods, just like Titanic was a love story on a boat. I didn't think that Gray Owl was a great environmentalist. I usually like Lord Attenborough, but this was ... bad.
