I didn't even bother to finish the film because I was so bored that I thought I was going to faint watching it in theaters and my friends and I are tired, so we got up and left for another movie, if we ever had to sit for 2 minutes of that movie again I think I'll shoot myself ... and I know the whole movie because my friend told me what happened in the end and it didn't surprise me at all I mean those who didn't know her. She was going to do the right thing and let it be happy, I really mean you should be a complete idiot for not knowing. I know that I didn't miss anything and if someone asked me to see that movie I would say "on my corpse".
