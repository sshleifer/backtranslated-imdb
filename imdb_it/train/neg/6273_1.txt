This was a nice movie to the end. The ending was just another despicable effort to evade men and empower women at their expense. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive / aggressive nature to control and impose her will on that guy who eventually surrendered his power and control over the relationship with her. It is no coincidence that she was sitting behind the driver's wheel in the car as they left at the end, after he had to implore her and beg her to bring him back. This film is a victory for all women who think they have to be responsible for all men and have control over their relationships with them. It was a despicable film for this reason.
