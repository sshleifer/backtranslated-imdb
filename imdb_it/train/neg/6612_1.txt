I downloaded this movie yesterday through a website, the quality was pretty good! I was watching the movie with great expectations (even though I knew it was a flop), especially since the film has superstar Amitabh Bachchan who plays the role of a villain. Even if at least actors like him would have done something for their roles. But unfortunately, Mr. Bachchan has failed to amaze as the villain has shown that no one can compete with the magical process of AMJAD KHAN Rgv to re-ignite the reluctantly twisted past! Sholay, the old is a milestone in Indian cinema with an all-star cast, a cult dialogue, elegant cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack that is still a success with present generations. A good actor as TALENTS ARE of Ajay Devgan is wasted and his performance was average. Prashant Raj, a newcomer does not know what acting is. Nisha Kothari has shown that she is one of the worst actresses we have. I don't know how she is in the RGV team yet. Urmila and Abhishek seen in a song without excitement and passion. film It was a total carnage of the original Sholay
