What a waste of time and money! My husband and I saw this movie - after seeing the previews and thinking "it could be fun". MISTAKEN! This film takes about 90 minutes. The actors are trapped in a poorly written script and can't get out. The jokes are weak and tired, and not even seeing Wilson's bare shoulders can redeem any part of this movie. The special effects ..... are not. I almost expected to see the harnesses and wires that blocked Uma in her flight scenes. And when the effects apparently weren't able to dominate the flying or projectile combat scenes faster than a superhero, they covered it all with a swirling vortex of blurred screen - which hid the terrible effects quite well. Wilson's shoulder was a bad excuse for a man and Wilson had no confidence in Uma or his co-worker in the office. Sex scenes weren't sexy and funny scenes weren't funny. I guess I just waited too long from these actors. None of the characters was really nice, so in the end I didn't care about any of them flying figs. The only memorable performances were the guys who played Bedlam and G-Girl as teenagers - at least THEY had some chemistry. Overall, a super stinko movie - I wouldn't even recommend it as a rental - it would still be a waste of money!
