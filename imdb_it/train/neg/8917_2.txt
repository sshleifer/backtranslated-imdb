The prerequisite for making a film of this kind is a total ignorance of Nietzche's work and personality, of psychoanalytic techniques and of the history of Vienna. Take a known genius that you haven't read, describe it as demented, include crazy doctors who treat it, a couple of slightly beautiful women, have their role played by an actor with huge mustaches, that each character speaks with the strongest accent , show ridiculous dreams, include another prestigious figure that has nothing to do with the first (Freud), mention some words used in the works of genius, overdo everything you can, especially music, and you're done. Public, please stay away.
