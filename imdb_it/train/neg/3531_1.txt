This film is now my indicator against which all the other films will be compared ... like in "was it stupid like Revolver?" I also participated in the Toronto International Film Festival last night, when a room over 2000 people came out in an eerie silence after being completely shocked by 2 hours of pure nonsense. Jason Stratham would have been fantastic if he had only one purpose. Within the first 10 minutes he was given a proposal by Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (of Soprano's fame) that does not make SENSE A EVERYONE! Then there are some shots and then there's Ray Liotta wearing embarrassing bikini briefs, then there's animation, Ray Liotta's bare ass, lots of pitches, teeth grinding, art house wants to be pretentious and more than just Liotta's embarrassing body that caused laughter at each screening. .I am not quite sure it was the reaction he was looking for ... not 5 times anyway. Everyone in this film thinks they are smarter than the average bear and Guy Ritchie thinks he is the embodiment of the Yogi bear. The lines of the plot would not go anywhere but the location was out of sight! The only way this movie could have been worse is if there was Madonna herself.
