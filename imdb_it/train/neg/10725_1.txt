Although I don't like to say "myself" in response to other comments - it is entirely true that the first 30 minutes of this film have absolutely nothing to do with the infinite land that includes the next 90. <br /> <br /> Having been banned somewhere, it is not possible to watch a movie. Just because it doesn't look like a Hollywood product doesn't make it credible. <br /> <br /> Worse still, in addition to no recognizable plot (except that there are many muddy places in Russia and many people, even very old, drink lots of vodka) a number of images are so unnecessarily nauseating they are in my second package of Rolaids. <br /> <br /> As for the spoilers - well, the film is so devoid of any narrative thread I couldn't write one if I tried. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time and money, and don't confuse this with good Russian cinema.
