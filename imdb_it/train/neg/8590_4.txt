Ridiculous. Annakin, a 9-year-old girl, turns into a 19-year-old marmorina, Annakin, who somehow looks attractive to Amidala, 5 years older than him. Now the 22-year-old Jedi warrior hero Annakin has a couple of bad dreams, and so leads to slaughtering the children, her friends and the entire structure of her existence because an old fool convinced him to) his precious wife could really die, and b) only he can prevent it. Ludicrosity squared. <br /> <br /> I think the people who like this movie don't pay attention. The story is ridiculous. The characters are incredible (literally, not the perverse sense of "fantastic", "wonderful", etc.). <br /> <br /> Obi-wan Kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series, but in the climax, he cuts Annakin's legs off, makes him burn in lava and lets him suffer. Does anyone think it's a little off the character? Not to mention the fact that it was rather stupid to have a chance for him to live, apparently. <br /> <br /> I expected at least one story to show characters that were consistent with plausible reasons. None of this here. The story may have been written by a 10-year-old child. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the CGI is quite interesting.
