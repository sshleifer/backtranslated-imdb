Rather than long dance sequences and close-ups of the characters that dragged the film - the film would have been better served to explain the characters' story and motivations. <br /> <br /> The marginalization of Nubo, the minister, auntie, mother - and the nonsense of the dynamic and IMPORTANT rivalry between hatsumo and mameha, hatsumo and sayuri made the film devoid of real depth. If you hadn't read the book, you wouldn't really understand why Sayuri loved the president and why Mameha became his mentor. <br /> <br /> Visually the film was amazing - and the actors did their best with C's script being assigned to them, but it was all thanks to this movie.
