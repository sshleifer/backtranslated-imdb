This film is another Christian propaganda film in The Omega Code line. Not that this is necessarily negative, but due to the fact that most propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the message they wish to convey. If you like the picture of polystyrene on the life in the streets and the way the Gospel can change a life, maybe you could enjoy this movie. I say, save your money and rent The Cross and The Switchblade or The Mission. When will Christian filmmakers learn that sometimes people say bad words? It was frustrating to see the criminals depicted who are not allowed to swear (eh? The criminals say bad words?) And flat characters I could never relate to. Also, it would have been nice if the movie had shown some T & A. Now it would be something I would like to pay to see. Who was the foreman who compared this thin communion to the story of a film with The Boondock Saints and The Sting?
