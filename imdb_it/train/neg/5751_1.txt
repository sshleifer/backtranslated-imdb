The film must have been shot in one day, there are scenes where you can see the reflections of the camera and its red pointer, even the green light of the scenario that blends with the actors !!! The plot and the lines are really terrible without even the slightest inspiration (at least as a thriller genre). Everything that has to do with Poe in the film, has a superficial and childish approach. The film is full of clise and nothing electrifying. If you want to see a fun b-movie for a relaxing evening with friends, then go for it you'll like it (like I did) but there's no way to take this movie seriously!
