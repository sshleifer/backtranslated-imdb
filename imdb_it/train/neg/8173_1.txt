One of the most annoying cutters ever ... If you can even call it that. I wouldn't look at this if it also ended up being a kind of porn movie, which looks completely like. The fact that you're looking at a small group of middle-aged people in the woods is really unbearable. They made this kind of movie for kids, so who did they really aim for when they did this sleep fest? My favorite part of this film is the cover and it's the only reason I chose this movie, which was part of a Suspense Classics 50 Movie Pack .. and after seeing the other movies in this 50 pack, you I realize that it does not belong anywhere else. So if you're in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods, I recommend Just Before Dawn and The Final Terror.
