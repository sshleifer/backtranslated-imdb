This is not a movie. It is a collection of unrelated, ill-conceived and poorly assembled scenes that resemble the new results of a 10-year-old child with a mini-DV camera. In fact, I have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor - the one with the greasy hair, the impassive look, the ipod and the nervous tic - probably shot herself in a creative phase. <br /> <br /> If you did it over the ten minutes I did, don't worry about trying to adapt what you saw in the context of the mentality of European artists praised above. This is a real and complete waste of time, money and film that would have thrilled William One-Shot Beaudine. <br /> <br /> The unfortunate part is that the infinite series of vacuum-packed characters is representative of what now goes through much of humanity. <br /> <br /> What are the prospects? Did six directors take social reports at the Wal-Mart snack bar?
