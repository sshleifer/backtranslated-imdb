I bought it from Blockbuster for 99p. The guy behind the counter said the reason he was so cheap was because the record was scratched, but he didn't mention that the reason it cost so little was because the film was a poor effort that sucked harder than Paris Hilton in a video of a hotel room. Speaking of home videos, from when it was right to publish them as a film - I mean the films used to employ actors and technicians and screenwriters and so on - not anymore - collect your friends and lame ideas for the weekend together, lavish the producing with a budget of £ 8.00, and dropping someone down the stairs with a Casio keyboard (the soundtrack) - then slapping him on the shelves, for a while poor (me), to take home in desperation alone. But here's the tire - I took a quick step forward for most of this, and threw it to one side, ready for the hammers ... until the next night, while watching a horror of Darren Day "Hellbreed" ( £ 1.99 to take home and keep me from a different Blockbuster). Now this film has made "The Grim Weekend" appear as The Exorcist, so I postponed the Grim Weekend, to capture some of the moments listed in the wonderful IMDb tables, which viewers declared to be hilarious. Sure enough, once the suffering, the pain and the horror had been overcome, to realize the weekend of Grim was good for the toast, I could enjoy it, savor it, and definitely get down to the fun things. And there's a lot of that. Check the tabs. Then check the movie. Hell, it could even be worth it. AWWWWW CRAP!
