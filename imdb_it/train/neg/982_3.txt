The real protagonist of this ridiculous story is the glorious technicolor. A visual treatment for the eyes, the film fails to stimulate the mind and the heart. At first, I was intrigued by the idea that Dietrich and Boyer left religion to "find" their ability to love. What follows is a huge disappointment. Boyer is the only real actor in production and feels his torment. Dietrich's incredible wardrobe exceeds his performance - sometimes his face is scary to look at - an insensitive mask. As a monk, Boyer kept the formula for the liqueur of the monastery (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse) - when he leaves his "marriage to God" the reaction of his brothers holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion. The viewer believes that Boyer got rid of his past. However, the following journey is too predictable.
