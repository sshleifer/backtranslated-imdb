Having seen Versus before, I had high hopes for Alive. The description of the film on the back of the DVD jacket looked promising. Alive did not deliver. VERY slow development. A lot of potential with interesting cast and images. The premise was intriguing but the compensation did not compensate for the accumulation. He could have done much more in the end. Most of the film is simply "sitting". To put it plainly, three of us were invited to sit down and watch this movie and at the 50 minute mark we were fighting to get to the end. He really needed more shock. If you are looking for Ichi the Killer or Versus fights, save yourself some $ and a lot of disappointment.
