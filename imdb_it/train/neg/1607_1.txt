This "documentary" is a test of the talent used for medium purposes. The fact that it is financed by the Venezuelan government gives it a lack of legitimacy in order to seek the truth about what really happened in those horrible days of April 2002 in Venezuela, something we Venezuelans don't know for sure. /> <br /> There are ways of lying, and the directors of this stuff are found both by omission and by knowledge. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan political process is too complex to be easily understood by the foreign public and takes advantage of it. For example * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * show pro-Chávez demonstrators shooting in an empty street (what the hell did they do for?) In a way of saying that they didn't kill anyone, but they didn't bother to show the images we all saw here , of opposition protesters (and a journalist) who fall dead or injured on the other side of that "empty" road. They can't explain why the political police helicopter was the only one allowed to fly over Caracas that day and did nothing against the snipers that were everywhere on the roofs of the buildings near the presidential palace, something that would show how inefficient it would be to be security measures to protect the President. A few days after the "coup", the incumbent military chief was asked by the National Assembly (our Congress) why they did not act against the snipers and said "because they were not there to act against the president" , isn't it a confession? <br /> <br /> There is much more, the fact that the highest military rank announced that Chavez resigned and two days later said he lied because he is "political" and nowadays is the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Chávez administration. <br /> <br /> I would need thousands of words to explain all the lies represented in this "documentary", made with the intention of selling to the world an image of the good old Hugo Chávez who governs for the poor and for the bad rich opponents who want him out at all costs, when the truth is that 60-70% of people refuse his government, and that percentage includes the poor. > <br /> I hope that those of you who have seen and purchased it can see a different version that is made b a group of Venezuelans who show no less than 30 lies. <br /> <br /> Nazi propaganda is back!
