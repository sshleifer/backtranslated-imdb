In 1967, the miners find the remains of an ancient disappeared civilization named Abkani that believes that there are the worlds of light and darkness. When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something bad slipped before the gate was closed. Twenty-two years ago, the Government Paranormal Research Agency Bureau 713 was headed by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), who performed experiments with orphaned children. Nowadays, one of these children is paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has just obtained an Abkani artifact in South America, and is chased by a man with skill. When an old friend from the foster home disappears in the middle of the night, he reveals that the demons are returning to Earth. With the support of the anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and the leader of the Bureau 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), and his team, fight against evil creatures. <br /> <br /> Despite having a charismatic cast, led by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, "Solo nel Dark" never works and is a complete disaster, without character development or plot. The reason can be explained by the "brilliant" interview by the director Uwe Boll in the DVD extras, in which he states that "video games are the bestsellers of the young generations who are no longer guided by books". Moreover, its target audience would be people between the ages of twelve and twenty-five. I'm sorry, but I find both statements disrespectful to younger generations. I have a daughter and a son, I know many of their friends and I'm not the kind of stupid stereotype that the director says. Furthermore, IMDb provides excellent statistics to show that Mr. Uwe Boll is absolutely wrong. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Alone in the dark ?? O Despertar do Mal" ("Alone in the dark ?? The awakening of evil")
