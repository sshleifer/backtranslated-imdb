I took this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. But I had no idea what I was meddling with. <br /> <br /> I started the film and was soon drawn into a world of pain and visual torture. <br /> <br /> I finally know what hell is like. It's this movie. For eternity. This film has no value. It doesn't even have a plot. There were things that happened in every scene, but no general explanation of why something happened. <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this movie I suggest you brush the blender closer with the oil and try to fill as many bullets as you can. You will find that the result will be much more pleasant than this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't even look at it. Not even to see how ugly it is. I pray you. If you look at it, it means they win.
