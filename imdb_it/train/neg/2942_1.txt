This is without doubt the worst movie of all time. A combination of Whoopie Goldberg (the worst actress / person in history) and a speaking wing of Jar-Jar-Binks dinosaur are added to a painfully ugly film. That was an understatement. This film is unwatchable. For God's sake, don't watch this movie.
