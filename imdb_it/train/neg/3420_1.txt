I saw this movie the first time at around twelve on a Saturday night. It's really the perfect time for this. I have NEVER, ever seen a film that was actually more predictable and stereotyped. If you want to see an electrifying action movie, don't watch it because you may lose the will to live halfway. However, if you want a good laugh, please look! I even bought Chuck Norris' 3DVD collection thanks to my pleasant Saturday night. What particularly struck me was that every scene that would be expensive to do was copied from a Discovery documentary or an old US special army television series. I was also amazed that they did not make the slightest effort to make production real. Afghanistan is, as far as I can remember, nowhere near any sea yet with a single click, Deke escapes from the sand castle of the terrorists with his jet pack and is taken away by a submarine (probably Discovery). Later in the film, Deke launches an Islamic terrorist against the wall. In the slow-motion scene you can wonderfully see the long stuntman's hair rising in the air as they crash into the wall. You must love it. I advise you to watch it with some friends and a good dose of beer, only then you will understand why I am angry enough to spend 6.99 euros on the box.
