This film is a cringe-festival of poor acting and poor scenery, as well as sticky lines and a lame plot. But it's so fun to watch. Everything is hilarious. The basic plot is a group of scientists of the future who travel back in time to capture their evil co-worker who is intent on destroying them all. They reach it in the year 1146. The scientists' futuristic laboratory of the year 2033 is an eighties-style room with a group of "futuristic" flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a garden shed. The actors express their lines with ease and nonchalance, which is not difficult to understand, considering that the lines are usually splits like "I double checked everything twice!" Have you double checked everything? Did you check it four times? Not only that, but they give you the whole premise of the film in the first five minutes, and continue at a fast pace until they hit the medieval part. When Roger Corman ran out of money. And he had to stop traveling in time and consequently several sets. The medieval set is a comic mixture of everything, from the end of the 10th century to the 16th century. They used whatever costume they found. I imagine that chain mail was not in the budget, because everyone wears sequin shirts disguised as armor. The fighting scenes are ridiculous, with men casually throwing themselves down on cardboard swords with abandon and dying in death launches with a blow. It sounds really terrible, but I enjoy it every time I look at it. The sun lines are enough to have you in crisis and all the rest is combined to create a fabulous B series film that, if you are a connoisseur of imaginative films, I suggest you see. And once you have, read the review on Unknown Movies. I love hearing them indicate all the funny and really terrible parts of the movie.
