Whatever the merit of the film, it is poorly studied. As others have pointed out, the film shows the locals in Iran who speak Arabic rather than Persian. This is enough to lose credibility for anyone with the slightest knowledge of the area or country. The landscape could not be more different from the real. <br /> <br /> Other concrete errors: a train is shown operating in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan has no railways. The Turkish ambassador wears a Fez (red hat), while the Fez has been banned from Turkey long before the film is set. The Turkish ambassador's daughter is actually dressed as an Indian and Indian classical music is playing in many scenes. I suppose the filmmakers wanted to show an exotic woman, and the sari was what they decided to make it exotic.
