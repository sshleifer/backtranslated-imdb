The annoying mouse and lullaby really struck me and I really had nothing to do with the story ... It's something I would have done my first year of film school. Very sad. Furthermore, the story seemed to drag on for no apparent reason ... there were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story, which makes me feel that the creative team really didn't know what they were doing, or just that it should have been shorter ... that it would be a blessing, not a crime. As I've just seen all the episodes up to this point in the last week ... I have to say that this was by far the worst, and I just wanted to warn others not to start with this.
