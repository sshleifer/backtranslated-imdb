Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is determined not to be alone this Christmas. Drew is not just a millionaire; but also hateful and guilty of being very grandiose. Drew returns home where he grew up and offers the family that lives there, the Valco, $ 250,000 to be his "family" during the Christmas season. Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) is reluctant, but is greedy enough to accept Drew's offer. Christine Valco (Catherine O'Hara) has little to say about it, but learns to have Drew around ... not exactly the same feeling with her daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate), but even that has room for change. Drew's girlfriend, Missy (Jennifer Morrison), tracks down Drew and wants his parents to meet his family. The real fun is in store for the fact that Noel becomes a hilarious dysfunctional nightmare. Other cast members: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Affleck is comical, though strange.
