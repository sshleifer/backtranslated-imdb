Well, I have to admit that this was one of my favorite ones as a child, when I watched it on a home projector like a super-8 coil. Now there is not much to recommend, apart from the intrinsic value of the field of actors "terrified" by replicas of human skulls. The special effects are rather silly, mostly consisting of skulls on wires and superimposed "ghost" images. <br /> <br /> But there is something to be said for the sets. The large villa in which it takes place is rather disturbing, especially because it is mostly unfurnished (probably due to budgetary reasons?). <br /> <br /> Definitely more laughter than screams, anyway. Try not to laugh when the wife (who does more than her part of screaming) enters the greenhouse and confronts the ghost of her ex-husband.
