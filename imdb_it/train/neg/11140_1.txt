I thought I saw a scary movie ... and I ended up laughing the whole movie. In the scene where the human turned into a werewolf, I thought they were joking. Today's computer games have ten times better animations. Low budget, it's an appropriate comment. I would recommend Wolf (1994) with Jack Nicholson for a good werewolf film. It has good special effects as they should be (human transformation into werewolf). Unless you want to laugh well, I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. This film is a joke.
