Obvious attack on Microsoft by people who do not seem to understand intellectual property or market economies in general. <br /> <br /> Loony liberal tim robbins plays a painfully obvious caricature of invoice gates and is a cartoonist corporate criminal who orders left and right murders. <br /> <br /> While Microsoft may engage in anti-competitive activities at times, it is unlikely that they will actually kill people. Therefore, the film is exaggerated and ridiculous from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The "deeper" point is apparently that the main technological innovations should be free to the public and not subject to intellectual property laws. However, this ignores the fact that most major innovations would never have been developed were it not for the incentives (and benefits) of the market provided by intellectual property. <br /> <br /> It is one thing to be against anti-competitive conduct - - this is common sense Another thing is to be against market competition in the first place, which represents what the film's mantra (" knowledge belongs to humanity ") represents. <br /> <br /> Yet another example of Hollywood that is completely out of touch with reality.
