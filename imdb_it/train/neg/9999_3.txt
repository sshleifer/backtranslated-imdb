This is the kind of film that my happy enemies always watch, but it's not damn true. I only watch it once in a while to make sure it's as bad as I thought it was. <br /> <br /> Some types of mobsters hijack a Boeing 747. (This, at least, is an improvement over having Boeing hijack much of the Pentagon.) The airplane descends into the Bermuda triangle and collapses under pressure up to the bottom, a kind of post-facto submarine. <br /> <br /> He has one of those star casts. , the stars fall or just above the horizon. <br /> <br /> "We are alone!", says the pilot Jack Lemon. He is right. Except for George Kennedy. It is in all these catastrophic films. <br /> <br /> Watch another movie instead. Oh, not "Airport" the original. This is not good either. Instead, watch a decent movie on airplanes stuck like "Flight of the Phoenix".
