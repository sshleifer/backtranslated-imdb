This film is about a Japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on the skin. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely bizarre. I can't see any "sensual" or "erotic" undertones. The plot turns an ancient art form into a fetishist pornography. Furthermore, the scenes that are shot in Hong Kong certainly represent bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the airport in the city center, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the film, I still think "The Pillow Book" is insulting Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment. <br /> <br /> "The Pillow Book" is a perverse but boring film. Stay seriously away from it.
