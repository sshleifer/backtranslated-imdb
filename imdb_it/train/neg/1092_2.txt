Well, I suppose the good news about the William Winckler opus of 2001, "The Double-D Avenger", is that it manages to bring together three of Russ Meyer's mammoth wonders - Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven de la Croix - in one photo. (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satan and Babette Bardot were busy the week they shot this thing ... or they managed to see a copy of the script in advance!) The bad news, though (and there are many), is that this film - if it can also be called that, having been shot directly to the video - is a complete misfire, a total abortion, a real atrocity, an absolute abomination, and truly one of the worst photos that have ever seen. Look no further than the smallest superhero movie ever made! The plot here, as it is, deals with Gattina earning superpowers after knocking down the rare cockazilla plant in South America to treat her breast cancer (oy), and then fighting a trio of megalungai bikini dancers in Los Angeles . Too bad that every lame whore trots the joke off completely (you should forgive the expression) flat, that in the film there is absolutely ZERO nudity (apart from some old photos of Kitten in his golden age), and that some shaving cream and a mass of paper mache are the sum total of the special effects. The Meyer girls here are a little long in the tooth / saggy chest, to put it mildly, even though Sheri Dawn Thomas, as bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!), Manages to stand out well. So why did I give this youthful, not funny, failed 2-star movie instead of 1 embarrassment? To be synthetic: Joe Bob Briggs. His off-screen comment in the special features of the DVD I have just seen is absolutely hilarious, especially when he extracts about 100 synonyms for the word "breast" from the over 1,000 in the "list of canons". The man is a national treasure, and he is able to update this skeet of a disc in a coaster state!
