John Candy. Should we add anything else? That's the main reason why you should see this movie. Most people do not realize how gifted he was as an actor. It testifies by changing from a poor slob to a horny jerk. Just a simple (thin) facial change and let's go. There are many great pieces in this film and many really stupid pieces. The best moments for me are the scenes of KUNG FU U and the moment when John (in a trance) takes the stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend, that is how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend. I'm sure that by reading this you might think that this sequence sounds really rough. It is, but it's also a lot of fun especially because it's John Candy doing this bit. The story in general is rather lame and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (both students of SCTV with Candy) are not given enough to do in the film. Levy has his moments, especially the wedding shootings at the end (thinks Rod Serling) and the fantastic scene when he is talking to his mother on the phone. Overall a good movie if you've had a difficult day and you need to put your brain to stupid. I give this 4 out of 10.
