Before seeing this film, I expected an imaginary drama based freely on the ideas of the book; instead, it is the book, interrupted by dramatic scenes that illustrate the different "diseases". This didn't bother me much, but it hindered my enjoyment of the film. A story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed through the film would have been preferable, in my opinion. If you are going to base a movie on a psychology text, you need to find a more interesting (and preferably accurate) text of this. The film drags during the parts where it is little more than a video encyclopedia of nineteenth-century sexual psychology and would be absolutely intolerable if it were not of a sexual nature (because "sex = interesting" for most of us, even for me) . Fortunately, there are several stories with the development of the character that involves us. <br /> <br /> But disappointingly, Krafft-Ebing's sexuality theories have not been disputed, for the most part. I was hoping that he would use the stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic vision of psychology, which is still held by many to this day. <br /> <br /> So in the end, what do you have? A detailed catalog of some fetishes and orientations, with some slightly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations of some "sexual deviants" before being treated. For most of the film, the film moves with the speed (and mood) of a trail. And, as a low-budget film of course, cinematography and acting are not exactly high-level. Even though * I was * satisfied with music, costume and interior design. <br /> <br /> I heard that the subject of this film was just my alley, and I still feel it's a film below average. Worth a 3/10; a 4/10 if I felt extremely generous. I can't imagine anyone appreciating him if he wasn't already interested in sexual fetishism.
