This is a bizarre film, as Santa Claus lives on a cloud in space and fights against Satan and his minions ... but it's still pretty funny. <br /> <br /> He has genuine laughs .... though all are intentional it is certainly debatable, though. This film is not good, but I can say that I really enjoyed watching it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film about "Santa Claus conquers the Martians", "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or "The Santa Clause" with Tim Allen.
