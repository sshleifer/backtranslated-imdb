This game has the (dis) honor of being the first game I stopped playing right in the middle and felt like crushing pieces and then burning. Congratulations. THE FIRST AND LAST Tomb Raider that I will play will assure you. <br /> <br /> Plot: Writing this word made me laugh. There is not one. Nor is the development of the character. Finally we have a heroine girl who can take care of herself, who is not a * beeping * mary-cue, but unfortunately dresses like a bitch and her breast is huge. They had to attract the sexist players of the boy you see. However, all he does is go to a grave after the grave has fired things while she walked. Because I don't have any idea. I had subtitles and t.v. the strongest I could and still didn't understand anything. The development (or lack of) of her, her two friends and the * bad guys * were ridiculous. There will also be levels to overcome that give you no clue as to what to do next and literally you'll be in most of the boring hellish tombs for HOURS trying to figure out what the hell you are supposed to do. There is a course (out of two) in particular with her on a motorbike (believe me it is not funny at all) that there will be ATLEASE an HOUR with no point of view in sight. This means that you have been hit by another motorist and that the van guys have shot you or hit a tree to start the one hour journey OVER. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: You know, it allows you to make the levels very long, they have practically no save points, they have no history, they don't develop characters, they don't give variety to the game, they have the most music on longer levels and give no sign of the player so they can stay longer in one place instead of arriving at the non-existent plot. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck one: Those sound like stunning ideas. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck two: I agree. Who needs character development, plot, or non-boring game. <br /> <br /> Todd: I'm sorry, sir, but these ideas seem to hurt the player a lot. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: Zitto Todd. You're fired. <br /> <br /> Game: all it does is shoot. Obviously you can throw while SHOOTING, skipping while SHOOTING, or kicking SHOOTING again. But flipping, jumping and kicking does not erase the fact that all he is ultimately doing is shooting. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: introductory music is extremely beautiful. I love listening to it. The music in play goes from tolerable to wanting to cut ears. <br /> <br /> Visual: Considering that this game was made in 2006, I expected the images to make me jump away. Well, I jumped, but definitely not in a positive sense. <br /> <br /> Bottom-line: this game is a plot without a character's development, with young, well-dressed women (THANKS) who lead boring graves for some reason boring (what could be that I couldn't tell you) with fantasy-free gameplay. Stay away from this B.S. !!!!!!!! You get two stars for having a woman who is not a damsel in distress (no matter how succinctly she may be dressed) and beauty in music.
