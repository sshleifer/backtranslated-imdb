This is absolutely the worst movie I've seen throughout the year. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I will say that the acting was very good, and of the whole cast. <br /> <br /> apparently meant to be very unconventional, and in that sense he succeeded. Likewise, the story revolves around an aspiring selfish, who is a cruel and talented liar whose self-confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers. <br /> <br /> It was worse than watching a car accident.
