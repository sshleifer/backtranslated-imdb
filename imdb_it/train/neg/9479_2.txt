It seemed that this film would be better than it was. The cinematography is good, the acting seemed solid, the dialogue was not too rigid ... but then about twenty minutes there is this long scene with a doctor who you know is actually a patient in the asylum pretending to be a doctor and goes from the south. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the demon speaks of the dumbest Godzilla-like teddy bear in Curse of the Demon. There are also some demon worshipers who wear masks that look like teenagers exploding from the start of Logan's Run. <br /> <br /> In the end, cinematography could not save this film. Despite some pretty solid performances by the actors, the story doesn't go anywhere. I think "Hellbored" would have been a better title for this.
