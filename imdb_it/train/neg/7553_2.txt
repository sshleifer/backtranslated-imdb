A phenomenal result in terrible. It's actually incredibly horrible. <br /> <br /> First of all ... Nicholas Cage must now have arrived at the finals in the Over-Emoting category in his acting class. Wearing new flower heads and with a face that has been raised so many times his pointed rear ears seem to strain to touch his back, not only exudes a sickness but creates a "hero" character who is not interested. <br /> <br /> I don't know what it is with Neil Labute and female characters. It makes the females completely deviant and evil ... and pays them back by giving Cage one more punch directly in their face and calling them all "b **** es" a couple of times. I enjoyed the first LaBute films and some of his works ... but it's a strange fascination he has. <br /> <br /> I would give this film a 2 out of 10 based solely on the performance of Ellen Burstyn. When he finally makes his appearance (bravely fighting in his scenes with his line of wigs clearly visible on the forehead) it seems that all hope can be lost. You deserve an Oscar right here and now for saying your jokes with a straight face and when you appear with a white mummio and a face painted blue, white and gold that explodes on The Wicker Man you know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin he really prepared for this role rocking well. <br /> <br /> This movie is so wrong and the cuckoo has to be seen to believe it. <br /> <br /> The highlights include: Nicholas Cage running away from a swarm of bees and then falling off a hill. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage steals a bicycle and looks like Mrs. Gulch of the Wizard of Oz that surrounds it. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage running around the island breaks down the doors in search of the missing girl. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING from a promising career as an actress in a "fight" with Cage. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn dancing around a saying while mumu. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage shouts "Who burned him? Who burned him? Who burned him? Who burned him? Who burned him? Who burned him? Who burned him?" for no reason. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage in a bear costume (I'm not kidding) running through the woods, taking off his costume (but leaving the bear's feet) and then doing some karate moves to some bad guys. <br /> <br /> And you didn't live until you saw the last 15 minutes of the film and its terrible epilogue that seemed to have been shot yesterday in your cousin's basement. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if you can get past this movie without laughing hard, you deserve a medal. There was actually a point in the film where I stopped laughing to ask myself if maybe it wasn't an elaborate "hysteria" movie ... only to be remembered when Cage would have screamed / shouted / whispered his dialogue that he really he was taking it very seriously. I think this is going to become a cult movie all over again ... just because it's so terrible.
