I've seen anime but I'm not a huge fan; and I don't read manga. I say this because many of the reviewers who are doing a lyric about this film seem to have this background. I saw "St. John's Wort", and although it's not a masterpiece of any kind of imagination, it made me choose "Shinobi", especially since everyone seems to love it. <br /> <br /> Well, I watched it this afternoon, and fought very hard to keep watching. Yes, it is very beautiful - the water scenes in slow motion, the autumn leaves on the trees, even the flick of the CGI eye - majestic. I liked the hawk, the costumes, even some fight scenes, but overall this was boring as dirt. <br /> <br /> It seemed that someone took "Romeo and Juliet" - the translation also says that they are lovers of crossed stars - and threw some "X-Men" for good measure. Two of the characters share Wolverine's powers - the boy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the gray-haired boy had his ability to heal himself. Then you have the girl who has a poisonous kiss - it's Poison Ivy (from Batman). Why do they give these women such stupid powers? The poisonous girl shows her leg and then kisses you to death. Friend, this is great power for you. And the other girl, can create insects from this yellow dust that rubs on her hands. The other woman, one of the lovers crossed by the star, has the power of a hypnotic gaze. Wow. <br /> <br /> In a way I came to the end of the film, making it slide quickly, and I saw a little more tragedy than I expected. Some people are comparing this with "House of Flying Daggers" and "Hero". Don't make this mistake. They may share similar endings, but that's where the similarities end. "Shinobi" is made by an amateur - the other films are made by an experienced director. <br /> <br /> I would say to avoid this movie unless you are 12 or 18 years old.
