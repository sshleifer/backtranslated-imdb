This is perhaps the worst attempt at a Zombie movie I've ever had the misfortune to see. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Any review found on this site is obviously the work of the director, the family of directors or a friend of the director. How does this movie suck? Let's try to count the ways ... <br /> <br /> The plot? Inconsistent. Dialogue? Atrocious. I will not beat the effects / gore, since I understand that this is a low budget. But was there also a zombie who was not obese? Come on, come on! And for a movie set in Rhode Island, why did that truck sport a Massachusetts license plate? Continuity, find them. <br /> <br /> The girl dances while the soldier "Be careful". Please do not put your friend's ex-girlfriend or sister in your nude movie. This was a bad movie full of ugly people, and has nothing to do even mentioning Romero on the cover. Next time you decide to make a movie, don't do it.
