--- what happened to these unlikely people. Alan Arkin was, as usual, little fun and he just passed the role. Children are all a mess. Probably Mariesa Tomei wants this role to never come his way. And what are Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno doing in this really bad, bad movie? If you like to watch losers wallow in their dysfunction, and try not to do any better, this is your movie. Everyone else, take a walk, read a book or see something else. <br /> <br /> Jane
