I didn't expect this to be a great movie, but I didn't even expect it to be so terrible. I hated the mother character so much that I had to turn the channel. I turned back, hoping it was just part of the movie, but no. And why the daughter sit there being embarrassed, or almost taken out of a job, or driven to madness in her own house? Are you kidding me? I was educated to respect (and even fear) my mother, but I would have rushed her to the nearest hotel if she had been annoying at my house. After all, I had to follow a series of rules at my mother's house. <br /> <br /> I didn't buy it. I tried to give him several possibilities, really. Sorry.
