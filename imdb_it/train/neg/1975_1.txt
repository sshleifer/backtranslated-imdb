To be completely honest, I haven't seen many Western movies, but I've seen enough to know what's good. This is by far the worst westerner on the planet today. First of all, blacks in the wild west? Come on! Who ever thought that this could be a cold film that everyone would love were slightly, no no, completely retarded! Secondly on that day and older women in particular black women were not inclined to carry and use guns. Does the Asian chick speak perfect English? If the setting is western, Asia is not where you are going. Finally, the evil gay chick was too much, the film was just crap from the beginning. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not racist or white, so don't get noticed after reading this movie, this movie is the worst presentation of black people I've ever seen!
