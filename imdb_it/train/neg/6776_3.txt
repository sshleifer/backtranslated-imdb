I wanted to love this movie. How could I not love him? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; all the icons in their own way. However, Suzy Parker's train crash has ruined the whole experience for me. His acting was so terrifying that I sat there with an open jaw, not believing my eyes or ears. I could barely pass through a vision, It is so scary that it is in this. <br /> <br /> Cary? Beautiful and in beautiful dramatic shape. Jayne? Adorable, captivating and obviously with a ball. The supporting cast is fine, and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its splendid, retro elegance. <br /> <br /> Then see Suzy Parker trying to speak his lines with a woodiness, a death, an absurdity that simply defies faith. Who told this creature that it could act? Oy VEY, people.
