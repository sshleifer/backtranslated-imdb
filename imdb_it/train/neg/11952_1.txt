His first film after the death of his longtime friend John Belushi, Aykroyd shows a lot of effort trying to pull out a character that would have been a snap for Belushi. <br /> <br /> Instead, "Doctor Detroit" gives us the Lebanese professor Aykroyd disguised as a strange and violent pimp to chase away a rival known only as a mother. It's bad enough, but it also has lessons to teach, a school dinner to host, four women from the evening to be protected and a pimp dinner (or something similar) to attend. It is no wonder that Aykroyd seems amazed for most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone? <br /> <br /> It was in this film that Aykroyd met his future wife Donna Dixon. At least a little good came out of this messy mess. <br /> <br /> One and a half star. You want the good Aykroyd, see "The Blues Brothers". You want ugly, see "Doctor Detroit".
