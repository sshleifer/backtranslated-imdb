Maybe not my thing, but the plot was horrible, as was acting by Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino. C. Thomas also seemed uncomfortable with the role of being seduced here (while on marijuana? Why was this included? This plot weakened considerably). Also the Farentino charac. it would have been better if he had more respect for a relationship. Would the film try to say? not so much.
