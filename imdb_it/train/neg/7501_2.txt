I went to this film waiting for a synthetic film about the effect that the Son of Sam had on society. I didn't expect Spike Lee to force me to feed more garbage about racial tensions, popular justice or the inability of the ordinary citizen to make a choice under pressure from peers. Lee presented an extreme opinion. <br /> <br /> The entire film could have been more effective if in a 90-minute format with more focus, less tangential sub-plots. <br /> <br /> Don't even bother to rent the video unless you love Spike Lee passionately; in that case the theater is worth it. This is not an escapist movie.
