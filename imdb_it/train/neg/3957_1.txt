The original Boogeyman was a stupid but fun supernatural slasher film. It was not at all a great film, but fun in the right frame of mind. The third episode of this series, Return of the Boogeyman, on the other hand, is simply atrocious. It consists of two things. First, a new economic and lifeless video. Secondly, LOADS of recycled pieces from the first film. The new material is incredibly amateur but not fun and inept, simply incredibly boring. This video was clearly shot down quickly and without any effort. It serves as a framing device for the infinite clips of the first (and possibly second) films. And boy, they milk those clips from previous movies; sometimes reusing sequences over and over again. The only new addition to these parts is a voice that unnecessarily describes exactly what we can see with our eyes. The whole experience of watching this is really shocking. <br /> <br /> Boogeyman's return is an example of the worst kind of exploitative film; the type that uses the public in a very cynical way. I want to keep this review brief and essential because this film doesn't deserve more. There is nothing of value here. This is worthless.
