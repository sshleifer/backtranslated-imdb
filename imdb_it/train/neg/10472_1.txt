I should have known that I was in trouble with Casper Van Diem as the protagonist. Words cannot describe, nor do they do justice to how terrible this film was. But please let me try to describe it: horrible acting, terrible dialogue, trivial situations and through all this you have the feeling of being forcefully fed by the beliefs and propaganda of the Trinity Broadcasting Network. It's a weak attempt to show Hollywood that a movie can be fun and have a deep and religious message attached to it. They failed miserably. It was clearly the worst movie I've seen in a long time.
