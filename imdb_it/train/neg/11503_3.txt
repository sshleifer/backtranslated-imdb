Quentin Crisp once stated that when things are shown too well, one is romantic. When things show themselves unbearably gloomy, they are realistic. And when something gets ironic treatment, it's perfect. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa, he falls into the second category. This director has obviously tried to make a "Ken Loach" film in Spanish, without being able to capture the comedy, and the warmth between the characters, which elevate Loach's films from the simple "depressing". Los Lunes al Sol, it's just that, just depressing. Things are not realistic. The last moments of suffering of the characters reach the apex in the same point, and if the glum story is not enough, Aranoa washes the story with a palette of visually gray and filthy colors. The films have been ridiculously overrated to the Goyas. A film that shows empathy for the weakest citizens of society, in this case unemployed port workers, does not automatically create a good film, even if I would be the first to sympathize with the fate of these people. This film only manages to make me grow uninterested in their destiny. In the 21st century in Spain, the unemployed do not live like beggars, and public transport ferries have decent sanitary facilities, and it is difficult to come across a bar with so few bettors and so little happiness to meet. Leon de Aranoa obviously does not have the slightest idea of ​​the Spanish working class, and does not do favors. Pretentious is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene in which the men watch a soccer game for free was copied directly from a film that deals much more realistically with the theme of the "poverty" trap, or "Purely Belter", which is much more engaging, fun, yet sad.
