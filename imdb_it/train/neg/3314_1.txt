Reading all these positive reviews, I find myself baffled. How is it that so many have appreciated what I consider a sad adaptation of my second favorite Jane Austen novel? There are many problems with the film, already mentioned in some reviews; in a nutshell, it is a threatening chaos, over-act and chilling from the end credits to the slaughtered ending. <br /> <br /> While many characters are mis-cast and neither Ewan McGregor nor Toni Collette put in a performance that is worthy of them, by far the worst is Paltrow. I really liked her performance in some roles, but here she is abominable: she is self-conscious, nasal, delicate and completely disconnected from her characters and those around her. An extremely disappointing effort - even if a perfect Emma could not have saved this film.
