This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I rented it as a joke, expecting to get a laugh from the first few scenes, and let me say that I never laughed so much in my life. The first scene in which the ninja blow up randomly and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly funny and stupid action movies of my life. This is not a dinosaur movie, but more a movie that makes the kind of action fun (and by no means means). I didn't see the first two, but judging by the complexity of the plot, I don't think there's much I missed. If you want to see a movie that works great with a six-pack or herbal remedy, then I insist that you rent this movie and sit down and watch the 100 years of advancement in the cinema that is thrown in the trash and made bust by carnosours
