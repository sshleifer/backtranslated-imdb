"I caduti" falls into the category of waste of life (WOL). I am sad that I am now two hours older was not entertained. My other family members also watched this movie and made degrading comments on the screen and took root for mom. I felt sorry for the actors (Wagner). I have read other negative reviews and can not add anything else to this film other than what could be reduced to 25 minutes, so it could take a 30 minute slot on TV without any plot loss. It reminds me of a dish that has many good ingredients, but when served it is tasteless and tasteless. In my humble opinion, the 42 foot mummy should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot by eliminating the mystic and replacing it with several people who want to deny the facts and want DNA samples for evil reasons. The heroes are discredited and thrown out of their universities. Later after everything was ruined by evil people. The heroes will save the day and show everyone that they are wrong.
