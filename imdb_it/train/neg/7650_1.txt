I know I'm in the minority, but ... <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll is as talented as a frog. Not even a toad; just a frog Remember a hundred other talented hacks that churn out one useless crap after another. <br /> <br /> This movie? It's crap. Slater's talent is used only minimally to make him believe that he has other things (like his failed relationship) in his mind. Reid performs as if he has forgotten his acting lessons, has been seriously hit in the head and DOES he forget his acting lessons, or have one of the worst directors in film history. I am voting for the third choice, myself, even if the other two are always possible. <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll has never done a single thing that gave me even the slightest pleasure. Frankly, I'm satisfied that he did this stinker. I was worried about Bloodrayne competing with "Underworld: Evolution" for ticket sales. Now, I'm confident that Len Wiseman has nothing, and I mean NOTHING, to worry about. <br /> <br /> This rate is a rating of 1.0 / 10 for this lousy, complicated crap, from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
