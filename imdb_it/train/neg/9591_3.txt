If you've read the original novel, like I did, you'll probably hate this thing. <br /> <br /> The film version of _Absolute Beginners_ is a nightmare conglomerate of the anachronisms of the 80s that attempt to create a set of "vintage pieces" in the late 1950s and fail to recreate or even pay tribute to that period - _Dirty Dancing_'s American monstrosity is similar to that of 1963, except that the film was financially successful despite having written an equally amateur script. In addition to suffering from "looking too 80s", the characters have been changed, reorganized and minimized to the point that the only features they have in common with those of the novel are the slightest superficial aspect and, of course, their names: Suze is transformed by the fickle ex-girlfriend of the narrator and promiscuous negrofilo who willingly plans to marry an old queen closed for money (at her own admission in the front pages) in an unfortunate and naive "Eve" - ​​archetype seduced by fame and glamor, exploited and in some way cheated in a fictitious marriage by his boss, who surprisingly was not given a Van Dyke and pointy hairstyle. She and the narrator, renamed "Colin" (after the author of the book, Colin MacInnes) for the film, are also in a relationship. <br /> <br /> The character of Big Jill, an apparently butch lesbian yet "acting like" in her mid-twenties, who acts as a pimp at a group of young lesbians with bubbles, and one of the most close friends of the narrator, dispensing a frank wisdom to the narrator, is reduced to a sort of "extra" with a few lines to throw away and tons of comic clothes. <br /> <br /> The Fabulous Hoplite, a young gay and another close friend of the narrator in the novel, is also reduced to the point of being useless in the film, camped and anything but ignored. <br /> <br /> The narrator's father in the novel is a sort of sad secondary character, but in the film, he played to be optimistic and strangely lively despite the squalid neighborhood, and the disorder of his marriage with the narrator's mother seems, for all practical purposes, ignored. <br /> <br /> In his favor, the music (for what it is) is well composed, and you have to give credit to the production and to the writers for actually taking a joke from the book ("... some days, they will write 50s musicals ... ") as inspiration for writing a musical, but in the world of badly encamped musicals, this is among the most badly performed of the group. Unlike _Shock Treatment_ or _Starstruck_ the crucial plot elements are treated as second thoughts. Unlike _The Apple_, there is an irregular and inconsistent flow between musical numbers and pronounced dialogues. <br /> <br /> You can't really blame the fact that it was conceived in the 1980s as "too 80s". The film version of _Annie_, published in 1981, makes a wonderfully well-executed tribute to the New York appearance in the 1930s, and "Napolean Dynamite" manages to capture a gritty 80s look despite having been made on a low budget in 2003 (although it was not explicitly established in the 1980s, those who lived through the decade cannot deny that the film "feels very 80s"). Obviously, it was possible to create something good from this, especially considering the iconic status that the source novel has in the United Kingdom, but fails more apparently in appearance and touch, and also in its treatment of the source material, which is decidedly disrespectful. . <br /> <br /> Maybe if you haven't read and you're not going to read the novel, you could enjoy this anachronism of the 80s giving a shameful parody of the modernist jazz set of late-fifties Soho London. I can definitely see what the writing team was trying, but they certainly could have done better. With Boy George as a family name and mixed-race musicians and bands in the UK in 1986, they have absolutely not had to lull the characters the way they ended. In fact, I would say that the authors ended up harshly criticizing both the book and the film, ending up with a bunch of unleashed adults and having its target audience of teenagers target two idiots for a quick buck off.
