This film shows a clip of mutilation of live animals from a machete stricken animal and ripped the skin. I know these horrible things are happening in the world, but I'm watching movies based on the fact that what I'm looking at isn't really happening on the screen. These footage of live animals are not meant to be in movies, they are meant to show people belonging to some organizations to help the horrible things humans have to do for other species. <br /> <br /> This should be banned and destroyed. I also contacted Netflix and other resources to help remove this film from the market !! <br /> <br /> This film should be removed from the public. The person who made this film needs psychological help.
