There is a key aspect of the film that Jobson seems to have forgotten - he has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you. It is not necessary to tell the public what to think, because they will see it. The action here is interspersed with some of the most ponderous narratives unleashed on the unsuspecting public: the purple prose of the sensitive fifth ex. And it shouldn't be necessary because theirs is a refined cast here and some wonderfully composed and shot images. Perhaps Jobbo felt that the basic story needed some support. And maybe he was right, he has no basic credibility: the Edinburgh of the 70s wasn't exactly full of beautiful smart girls with a weakness for the Velvet Underground and a weakness for a fleeing sociopath. From the too clean and new clothes that the character wears for the intellectualism of the cod that tries to connect it all together, it's too invented for my taste.
