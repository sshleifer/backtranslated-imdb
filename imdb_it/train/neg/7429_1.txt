Who, me? No, I'm not kidding. This is what he really says in the case of the video. <br /> <br /> Plot; short version: the beautiful woman stands smiling. This, for some reason, kills all men. <br /> <br /> "Find Ariel ... Where's Ariel ... You can't find Ariel ..." It's right behind you, idiot ... <br /> <br /> Most of what can be said about this horrible Space Opera has already been said, it seems. <br /> <br /> A group of horny actors who play mostly condemned arrive after the first the selection of the actors is interrupted very quickly. Then they are thrown down in the same way. Each scene is broadcast almost fifteen minutes early. Perhaps it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had the greatest viewing time and a larger payment control. The virus / alien hologram / sorcerer / glitch VR seems physically impotent and does nothing. Why can't he just stay at the computer instead of doing his "teleport vampire" routine? (Actually, it would have been more interesting if she had been a vampire, or to do something more than stand and look at people, which is all she does. That's enough to make all the men kill each other at vicenda ..) <br /> <br /> This is not really a twist. There are many more shots of the old western trail, the Easy Rider trail of the 50s, the Film noir night club scene, even a fantasy beach run, neither of which has real depth or even makes sense . The night club scene is in black and white, of course. He worked with "The Wizard of Oz". It doesn't work so well here. This is probably a good thing, since those few shots that show of space are depressingly silly. You will probably cry in those moments, especially when you see that whirling "spaceship", which seems about three inches long. <br /> <br /> Nothing is heard of any of the characters, not because they are detained or have personality, but because they have a serious need for acting lessons, except for Billy Dee Williams who seems really depressed and at a loss, probably being in this work ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that, if watched with friends, will cause extremely "noisy" silences, especially when the nerd launches his comic strip attempt (including the joke about the French kiss of a meteor ...? Right? Maybe not ...) <br /> <br /> The original virtual reality girls are "killed", which means nothing, since they are not even real to begin. Well, the other "characters" are not, too, but this is not the point. Haha. <br /> <br /> What's funny is that the scene that pays tribute to the video case is a kind of thing looking like an alien skull-horror (green filter added on top of that, to give it more of a ... uh ... green look), which is actually the android after he was killed and in the end has nothing to do with anything else on foot. <br /> <br /> Another strange affair I noticed. Whenever there is an explosion (at least on my cheap DVD copy), everything becomes highly pixelated. I don't mean a SMALL pixelate, I mean HUGE blocks of about 1/16 of the screen size. Wow.
