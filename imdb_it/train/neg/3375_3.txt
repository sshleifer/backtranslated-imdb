Hi everyone, if you've seen "Singing in the rain", you remember the scene of Gene Kelly dancing in the rain. He also remembers Donald O'Connor's dance number, "Make Me Laugh." If you've seen "Royal Wedding", you'll remember Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling. If you saw "Jailhouse Rock", you will even remember the dance number of the title choreographed by The King himself. <br /> <br /> This is what is missing here. There could have been some very successful ballet numbers in this presentation. The closest was "I Can Do That" by Chuck McGowan. the mere fact that you have talented people on stage moving together is not a great dance film. Richard Attenborough was the cause of this failure. He aimed the camera at the stage and thought it would be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Screaming at people doing auditions for a part in a Broadway production is not entertainment. Michael Douglas would have been so ill if he had been in a western or a comedy. It's okay when he's in a Michael Douglas movie where we see him screaming at someone we'd like to scream. It doesn't work here. <br /> <br /> The cast was good except for Michael, of course. A good movie could have been made using even the songs that were in the theatrical production, but someone would have to think about how to film it. <br /> <br /> The next time they do one of these, I hope they call me first. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
