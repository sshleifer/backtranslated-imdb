I couldn't wait to see this movie, but after seeing it I was really disappointed. The best thing was when Stephen King was in it. Rober John Berk cannot act to save his life and neither can do it. Some of the performances even made me laugh out loud! The film was not as I imagined, after reading the book that was fantastic, I imagined it to be darker and much scarier. If I were Stephen, I would be really angry! <br /> <br /> I don't know why they changed the ending, I thought the end of the book was very good. If you just found out that the cake killed your daughter, I wouldn't give it to anyone else, would you? <br /> <br /> The book was much better!
