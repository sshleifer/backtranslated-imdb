a documentary recited / manipulated on one of the darkest places in Guatemala. portrayed as a fun, safe ... but sad place, there were a group of prostitutes playing on a soccer team, gathered in what seemed to be no more than a week! the main objective of the documentary is to show that the company rejects this type of "workers", even if no solution to these poor women has ever been reached, except that the people who documented this have made them a sort of "star "(just as the title says it) in exchange for being exploited to make this virtual reality documentary. however, it has its own documented reality ... but, which unfortunately has nothing to do with the main plot. I would not accept to see him again; but I would recommend it only for general cultural purposes.
