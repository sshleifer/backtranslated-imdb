I like character-based movies. I also think that Hope Davis is always doing a good job, so I had high hopes for this movie. Those hopes were soon dashed. <br /> <br /> The main flaw of this film is the direction. There are many scenes that are sequences with open eyes. The film often uses the character of Denis Leary as an alter ego of the character of Campbell Scott. It doesn't work at all for me. This would work better as a game than a movie. <br /> <br /> There are also problems with the plot. It is important that the characters of a film undertake a journey and end up in a different place from where they started. I didn't think the characters grew up in the experiences portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, even the assembly was not well done. In the middle of the film there was a very deep wave that was exceptionally boring. <br /> <br /> With the exception of acting, which I have heard being constantly strong, this film has failed in almost every aspect of cinema.
