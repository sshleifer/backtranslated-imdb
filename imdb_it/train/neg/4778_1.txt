This is the worst show I've seen in years. I believe it should be taken off by T.V. because of his delay. He is so stupid that I could faint when I look at him. (although I never look at him because he is poor in SOOOOO) <br /> <br /> Goofs: when Mac says he can eat sugar, he eats sugar in another episode. Almost everything in the world has sugar in it !!! In the episode "Eddie Monster", when Eddy shouts at Terrance, he falls into the chest twice MORE the moment he falls in he does not fall, he falls to the side. What stupidity. I can't even say the word Foster Home. I also did a song with my band about how this show was delayed. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
