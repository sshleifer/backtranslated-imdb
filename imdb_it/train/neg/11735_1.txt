This film really made me angry because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent. I've lived in Iowa for 29 years and I know people don't have a southern accent here. This film is about a guy who makes methamphetamine and I don't know the real plot or what the film is supposed to be. It has a rather amazing use of the drug and is really offensive, so see these people using methamphetamine as if it were sugar. I lost my brother to methamphetamine and this movie makes my stomach hurt because it's a way to charm drugs. The film makes me look cool using the drug, but in the end I was happy when the boy almost reached the demarcation line. I also know that most women who suffer traumatic rape do not want to make love with their boyfriend or husband the next day. The film is simply wrong in all directions. I would suggest "The Basketball Diaries" if you were going to propose a drug movie.
