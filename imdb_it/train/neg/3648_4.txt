A childless couple (Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga) goes to a doctor (James Karen) to try to conceive. It works, but Adams slowly realizes that there is something really wrong with the child ... <br /> <br /> The rather interesting idea is completely managed by a lousy script: the basic idea is OK, but it becomes screamingly predictable towards the end. I saw every "twist" coming. Direction is poor - it seems to have no idea how to shoot a basic scene. Production values ​​are - to be beautiful - very bad. Very shabby. And the blood scenes are too unpleasant (I almost turned it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing me in the stomach) with very bad special effects. The film is completely derailed at the end when it becomes clear enough that they had no idea how to end this film. <br /> <br /> Some good acting makes it a bit bearable. Adams, Hayenga and Karen are all good at their roles and have been keeping an eye on me, but that was all about it. This film was just released in 1991 and remains unknown - it's easy to see why. I give him a 4.
