When I read most of the other comments, I heard that they were too glowing for this movie. I discovered that he had completely lost the spark found in previous Zatoichi films and only goes to show that after a long absence from the screen, it is often better to simply leave things. I completely agree with the Star Trek analogy of another reviewer who compared the first Star Trek movie to the original series - millions of enthusiastic fans were waiting and waiting for the show to return and were forced to watch a bland and sterile approximation of the original. <br /> <br /> The plot is sometimes incomprehensible, it is terribly bloody (although the recent NEW Zatoichi by Beat Takeshi is much more bloody) and the heart of the originals is missing. I didn't care about the blood at all, but some could be turned off (in particular the scenes with the severed nose and the severed heads). Also, time was not good for Ichi - he looks like a sad and sad man in this film (much, much more than usual) - and it's something that fans of the series might not want to see. <br /> <br /> This was a very sorry return for Zatoichi. Unless you are like me and want to see ALL of Zatoichi's movies, this is very simple. See one of the previous versions or the NEW ALL of 2003 version.
