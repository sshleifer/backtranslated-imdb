Wow! I watched the trailer for this and even if "nah, this is not for me". I saw my husband and the faces of our friends during the trailer and I knew it was a "kid movie". I mean, bye! a bunch of bartenders playing - another striptease? <br /> <br /> then, I started looking at it, it didn't look so bad. so I kept watching. I saw it until the end what a fantastic movie. if anything, this is a chick. these girls have an attitude. it really is a wellness film and a little love story. really leaves you with a good feeling. <br /> <br /> in essence, the story of a provincial girl who makes her great in the city, having crossed the usual big city c ** p. there have been a couple, it's almost a new urban legend. but it also makes you think about your life and what you've achieved. well, me anyway. I think it's because all the work in a bar scene is very familiar, not just for me, but for many people I know. Don't trust trailers for this - it's aimed at getting men in.
