Someone owes Ang Lee an apology. In fact, many people do it. And I'll start. I have never been interested in the Ang Lee film, Hulk, due to the almost unanimous negative reviews. Even the premium cable channels rarely seemed to show it. In the end I decided to watch it yesterday on the USA network and, wow .... <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOR ANG LEE'S HOLK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK <br /> <br /> It was boring! I almost couldn't get past Ang Lee's Hulk. Eric Bana was expressionless, Nick Nolte was horrible, Sam Elliott was unlikely (and it's not funny, he's usually a nice character). Actually, I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his non-descriptive face was the easiest to imitate with computer graphics - and it was clear that Ang Lee Hulk was meant to look like Bruce Banner abruptly in his non-angry state. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle I was ready to give Hulk the worst superhero movie ever. <br /> <br /> But then something happened. At about 3/4 of this boring movie, there was a really exciting and - I dare say - reasonably convincing action scene - extensive starting with the Hulk coming out of a containment chamber at a military base, fighting M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert, then riding an F22 Raptor in the stratosphere, only to be captured in the streets of San Francisco. This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I must say that the CGI was pretty good. This does not mean that the Hulk was totally convincing. But it didn't require much more suspension than disbelief than is required in many non-superhero action films. It really is a business. <br /> <br /> Of course, the ending really became stupid with Bruce Banner's father who turned into some sort of bad form, but the previous long action sequence put any short Iron heroism to shame Man. And in general, apart from the animated mutant dogs, it really seemed like Hulk's CGI was trying to convince you that it was real and really interacted with its environment. It was definitely better than I expected. <br /> <br /> OK, but what about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what ... Even boring! It has only a few Hulk appearances and here's the thing - the CGI in this movie is horrible. Perhaps the version of Hulk in Ang Lee's version appeared sometimes false and smoking in others - but he also had his convincing moments. The Incredible Hulk seemed decidedly ridiculous. He had the skin tone and the muscle tone that didn't even look like a living creature, just a kind of computer-generated texture. It was really absurd. The lighting, the environment and the effects of the face did not seem 5 years more recent than those of Ang Lee, they seemed 10 years older. And there's really no excuse for that. We really live in an age where computer programmers can ruin a movie with the same accuracy as any director, actor or filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Worse, the writer and director of this film seemed to learn almost nothing from Ang Lee's "Failure". All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is practically emotionless. The general is so relentlessly implausibly one-dimensional as to seem fake to Hulk. Love interest is not convincing (I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, even though both are pretty easy on the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson exceeds almost as much as Nick Nolte, even if it is only in the film a few minutes. Hulk actually doesn't do much in this film, certainly no more than in Ang Lee's version. The Incredible Hulk was slightly faster, but since nothing happened anyway it's not worth it. Oh yes, the villain is just as fake as the Hulk. In reality it is much more interesting as a human than as a monster. <br /> <br /> Here's how I can definitively say that Ang Lee's version was better: if I ever had the chance to review Ang Lee's version, I might be able to sit down and see good action sequences , or else I will try to appreciate the dialogue a little more (more likely I would just like to go fast to the better parts). But there is absolutely no single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is worth seeing once, let alone twice. It's really at the bottom of superhero movies. The CGI comic is an insult to the public - at least in Ang Lee's version it looks like they were trying to make it realistic (except for the giant poodle, of course). <br /> <br /> It is absolutely shocking how the directors intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk by doing almost exactly the same film. <br /> <br /> It is thanks to Edward Norton who seems to be distancing himself from this film.
