I rented this movie on Netflix after winning all the Oscars, to see if it was really that good. <br /> <br /> The Hurt Locker is a very realistic (mostly) portrait of a rotation group of a soldier in Iraq. The film focuses on Will James, a reckless soldier who gets his share of adrenaline from taking risks and defusing bombs. <br /> <br /> Where this film seems to be missing in my opinion is the plot and the direction of the film. This film does not have a clear plot unlike other films like Black Hawk Down. What this film tries to do is focus more on the characters and their different attitudes towards war. Bigelow does a good job focusing on the characters, but there are many points in the film where dialogue seems to drag. Hurt Locker is 131 minutes long, yet it looks like a 3 hour movie. <br /> <br /> A scene in the film that was particularly horrible, and ruined the perfect credibility of the films, was the scene of the sniper in the middle of the film. It was both unrealistic and very long. <br /> <br /> Overall, I thought this movie was OK, but the reason I gave it a 6 instead of a 7 was because it was a big disappointment for winning the Best Academy Award at the Oscars . I had the feeling that this film could have been much better considering that the rescue of Private Ryan lost the best film, but it was much better than this movie. Another important mention is Black Hawk Down which has only won 2 Academy Awards. I honestly don't know how he got the best photo. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an action-packed war movie, rent Black Hawk Down. This film will be forgotten in a year or two.
