This is one of the worst things that ever came out of England, so this says a lot there. The tension when we have to find out if Lembach is or is not surprising though. The upside is seeing the beautiful secretary, Sheila, in her intimate picnic table print for a while after being captured by Dr. Rat Face. This film also has different points of view on London, although none of them is good. There is also a point where there is almost a car accident that brings your heart rate back to just below normal. There is also a clock that is teleported away and the fear that the woman does not resume her watch is parallel to the horror of "The Sixth Sense", only much more boring and British. Add a furious shootout between the British police and Dr. Rat, which does not lead to anything besides the electric discharge of a lot of people, plus a cat and you have yourself ... ummm ... A British film. The MST3K version is pretty good, though not one of the best.
