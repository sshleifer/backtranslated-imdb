The film started out strong, LL Cool J (Deed) as an undercover police officer, with partner Sgt. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott of the Practice, probably miscible as bad?) Committing robberies and murders. Deed refuses to kill the drug dealer, who sets up the conflict of a dirty conscience policeman. The other big names (Freeman, Spacey et al) are well expressed and the film promises to be promising. <br /> <br /> The film is becoming scarce as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced. Given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will probably see repeatedly, or one that teenage girls will once see because of Timberlake, I would choose the first one. Even talented actors have to work hard at their art; Timberlake has NO talent and no effort can save him. I would have thought he would put on a better show, since he has been acting for years. Everything he did in this film was not convincing. <br /> <br /> Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells stadiums, it doesn't automatically translate that he can act successfully in films. Even N'Sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are some holes in the plot, such as the sudden skill of Pollack's sniper and the deadly functioning of warehouse machinery. This film has had many promises. Disappointing.
