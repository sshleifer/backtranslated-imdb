Hearing about how hilarious this movie is, I finally entrust it to the video store and for 75 minutes maybe I laughed 3 times. This movie <br />, a collection of skits that make television fun, is an inconsistent mess. The jokes fall flat, the humor faces the problems of the 70s that are no longer relevant, and <br /> <br /> the jokes go on too long (almost like the new SNL performs in recent years <br /> <br />). Yes, Chevy Chase is in this but maybe all <br /> <br /> about 1 or 2 minutes. I liked the fact that this was very <br /> vulgar and had nudity galore but couldn't it be fun? Do yourself a favor and rent it Kentucky Fried Movie, a quality movie <br /> <br /> made in
