Wow, my first review of this film was so bad that it was no exception. I will try to resize this. Be real !!! No one wants to see a Chuck Norris movie where HE is not the main character. In the end there was a good fight scene, but the rest of the film was stunned. I have to ask myself if old Chuck can no longer hang at his best. Has it slowed down so much that he has to throw out stuff like that and hope his reputation takes him through the whole movie? Chuck is a fantastic martial artist, and as we've seen from Walker, Texas Ranger, a pretty good actor, but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his films, and this one doesn't. Very disappointing for us Norris fans. Chuck, it's the main character in your films, because this doesn't work for you ... Gary
