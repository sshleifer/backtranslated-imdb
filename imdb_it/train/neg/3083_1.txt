... intentionally bad bad ... <br /> <br /> This little gem shot directly on the big MST3k screen. While it is obvious that the film is not trying to be taken seriously (I hope their goal, anyway ...), the film is still ugly. Hell, it makes Leprechaun In Space look like a big budget ... <br /> <br /> In short: Paint my muscle colored car!
