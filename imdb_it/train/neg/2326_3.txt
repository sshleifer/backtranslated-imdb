Dr. Mordrid is terrifying. I would not advise any adult or child to see it, unless they are already falling on the killers. There is so much dirt in this film that it hurts my yes. Speaking of eyes, there are eyes in the sky, against the background of stars. Only the devil himself could have imagined such a wicked thing. I rented every copy I could from local video stores and crushed them with a 5 pound crucifix. That film should remain closed in a cellar behind the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting beasts of hell. This is where this movie belongs. I suggest you if you want some outrageous entertainment, go and rent All Dogs Go To Heaven or Angels In The Outfield. Those films deserve to be seen. If you want to commit a sin and love terrible movies, you have to see Dr. Mordrid.
