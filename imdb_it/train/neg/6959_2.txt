I went to see it a few days ago, and it's hard to forget that movie ... for the wrong reasons. This film should be fun, it's not, not a laugh in the theater (perhaps for josé garcia and gérard Depardieu), and it's boring, boring, boring. Sometimes it was even difficult to understand what they were saying. They speak only to fast and do not open enough to allow us to understand. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times I found myself saying after a joke that it should have been fun "what, what he said", and I'm French. I hate to say this, since I think good films are made here, but I apologize in advance for all the foreigners going to see the movie (if ever they will be shown outside France). <br /> <br /> I deeply regret that cr @ p. 2/10
