Well, the artyfartyrati in Cannes might have liked this movie, but I'm not afraid. If you like the kind of movie where the shots linger so long that you wonder if the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman has gone to lunch, then it could be for you. A large part of it is so with brief stays in the realm of unpleasantness. I didn't find it shocking or disturbing like some other reviewers - just a little unpleasant and meaningless. The only reason I didn't give this star is that the acting is commendable and the film is shot quite well. The plot, however, has little to recommend. Much of the film shows a grumpy woman who teaches or listens to the piano, which some people might like. But not to think that this is harmless enough, prepared for some fragments of pornography and sexual violence only to wake you up with a bitter taste in your mouth. Not recommended.
