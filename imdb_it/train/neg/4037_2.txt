I have no idea what the producers of The Shield were trying to do, but the result speaks for itself: The Shield is practically unwatchable. <br /> <br /> The performances on The Shield are great ... <br /> <br /> Actually, the show is put together so badly that you can't even see the performances. For example, the assembly cuts off the reaction shots before they have had their full impact. <br /> <br /> I don't know what intellectual logic there is for this, but it robs the show of every emotional impact. <br /> <br /> I will give The Shield a point for ambition in its subject, but that's pretty much all I can give it. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see a number of talents the performer wastes his gift on something so strangely badly filmed.
