God, I'm so sick of the crap coming from America called "Cartoons"! <br /> <br /> As souls have become popular, US animators produce a cartoon with a lazy 5-year-old drawing style ass (Kappa Mikey) or some rejection of Japanese animation. (Usually ruin the classic characters) No wonder the anime is beating American cartoons! <br /> <br /> They don't even try anymore! <br /> <br /> Oh, I just heard about this last night; I live in the UK and when I found out that this show came out in 2005, well, I never knew that the UK was so up to date with current shows.
