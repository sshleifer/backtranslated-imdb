The film is grossly horrible and humiliating for rape victims. On the face of it, it could be a bold movie about rape, but if you dig under the surface, what lies is a not very positive message about rape. Aishwarya the victim of rape proves to be a helpless victim who cannot cope with everyone because she is a WOMAN. He needs a man to help her. When the company makes jokes about her and sends her comments, she doesn't defend herself. Everything is left to Anil Kapoor to do all the talk while Aishwarya does all the crying. <br /> <br /> The director (Satish Kaushik) has taken the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive. What would have been most effective is to portray a strong woman who rebels against her enemies bravely. The director is famous for being a chauvinist. His films are usually full of weak women but try to hide them in controversial roles. He needs to learn that just because the role is controversial, it doesn't mean that the character is strong. <br /> <br /> The most degrading scene in the film is when Aishwarya "cleans" herself after being raped. He does it to please his father who thinks it's dirty now. Although it is laudable that Shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such harsh light, what he doesn't show us is if Ash's father was wrong to have his daughter do something like that. So we remain with a confused message about rape. <br /> <br /> Even comedy is not necessary in a strong subject like this. Even more, the comedy is simply not fun. Ash is wooden in his role while Anil Kapoor does nothing but scream. The music is mediocre except for the title track, which is beautifully represented (the only bright spot in this film). The role of Sonali Bendre is disappointing and unnecessary. Overall, what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being a bad mix that will give viewers a serious indigestion.
