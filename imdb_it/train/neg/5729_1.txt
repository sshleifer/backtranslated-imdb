This must be the worst movie ever !!! Acting is scarier than the movie. Lots of blood, but I have no idea where it comes from, because they don't even show you the cuts. I can't believe I wasted time watching this movie. We laughed as if we were watching a play and not a horror movie. This is a shame for horror movies !!! For one if I'm in Asia, why is there a white cop driving the garbage cans? There is so much of another language that you don't even know what happens half the time. The editing of the film is a joke, my teenager could do better. And if I went to a movie theater and the old villain worked at the window that would be the first clue. DON'T LOOK AT THIS FILM !!! DO NOT SEE ALSO WHAT IS BAD, WE WILL BE SORRY YOU DID IT !!
