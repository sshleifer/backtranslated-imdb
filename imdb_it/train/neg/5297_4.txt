It really drives me crazy when someone comes across a movie like this and says it's one of the worst slasher movies out there. This isn't by far the worst, it's still not a good movie, but it's not the worst. Go see something like Death Nurse or Blood Lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think Night Brings Charlie is the worst. The film has decent work and editing, which is much more than I can say for many extremely obscure slasher films. <br /> <br /> The film does not show death on the screen, there is a death in which you see his pruning saw tearing into a neck, but all the other deaths are not interesting. But the lack of graphical violence on the screen does not mean that this is not a slasher film, just a bad one. <br /> <br /> The film was obviously not meant to be taken too seriously. The film came to the end of the second slasher cycle, so it was certainly a reflection of the traditional slasher elements, done ironically. For example, after a kill, Charlie goes to the welcome sign of the city and marks the population down by one less. This is something that can only make you laugh. <br /> <br /> If you like slasher movies, definitely give this movie a watch. It's slightly different from your usual slasher movie with the possibility of two killers, but not by much. The film's comedy is practically telling the audience to relax and not take the movie so damn serious. You could forget the movie, you could remember it. I will remember him because I love the name.
