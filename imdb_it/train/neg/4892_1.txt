they have sex with melons in Asia. <br /> <br /> ok. first I doubted it, but after seeing the rebel cloud, I changed my mind and was finally convinced that they had sex with watermelons, with dead or alive people. no safe sex, of course. the main man (terrifyingly ugly) shoots everything at the lady's mouth after she has died. never heard of HIV? I guess not. <br /> <br /> the rest of this film is mainly boring, but also incredibly revolting. in fact, in some parts it was so disgusting that I could not take my virgin eyes. sex with dead people! How bad is it? and what is the message behind all this? we need water, we need melons, must we be dead to have sex? sorry, but this stinks!
