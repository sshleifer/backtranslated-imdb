Really no reason to examine this aspect further because of some misleading and bizarre claims. <br /> <br /> A perfect example is when the director claims "Saul" or Paul of Tarus (The Book of Hebrews writer He says) has no idea that Jesus is or was a human being, this statement is deliberately false as it accuses others of presenting, or is ignorant of what it says "The Bible". <br /> <br /> first we can examine his misleading claim on Hebrews 8.4; showing a quote "If Jesus was on earth, he would not be a priest", so right here He establishes the ignorant and unlearned viewer to accept his false premise .. why? It does what the so-called Bible believes the people it accuses of doing, all the same. This is taking things out of context. <br /> <br /> verse one of Hebrews 8 is; 1 .. "Now of the things of which we have spoken this is the sum: we have a high priest, who is placed to the right of the throne of the Majesty in the skies" The context above is CLEARLY speaking of a Jesus who was on earth and ASCENDE in heaven after his alleged resurrection. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with the way the director wants the viewer to take his writings out of context. Here it provides a basis, that "Paul was not aware of a HUMAN Jesus, but only one in" paradise "<br /> <br /> to follow? <br /> <br /> lets see if the director is honest Hebrews 7, 14. "For it is evident that our Lord was born of Judah; of which tribe Moses said nothing concerning the priesthood. "<br /> <br /> heh, the director has not just mentioned the writer of Jews trying to show that the writer of that book has no knowledge of a" human Jesus "- it is likely that Paul did not write Hebrews, but I won't do it here, but the director claims that Paul did, and this is the premise of the point given here. <br /> <br /> It's not like this director doesn't make decent points in certain areas, he does, but he is engaging in the same blind prejudice of the religion he is attacking: once he engages in these tactics, in my strong opinion, he loses credibility as a religion he chooses, and the film is no longer a documentary, but a personal opinion , and a prejudice of the director, nothing more, nothing less.
