I respect the fact that this is a very popular show. However, in comparison with the ingenious, exhilarating, hilarious, and revolutionary classic of the 1970s of the Robert Altman film, this show was probably destined to be less than mediocre ... even if it was performed for 11 years, which is not necessarily makes it no good. This show formed an all-too-integral part of my early childhood (it was again every night, and guess the parents who looked at it and laughed), but it's one of the memories I don't miss. And now that I've seen the movie, I can give this series an accurate critique. In itself, it's not nearly "2 out of 10" bad. However, the characters in this show do not resemble those in the movie. Some of them are technically the same, but they are only similar in name. For example, since Alan Alda resembles Donald Sutherland? His style of humor is totally different, as are his characterization and his vision. The new characters are not great; they only serve to make you lose the ones they are replacing. It's the same with the new actors (including Jamie Farr). The only thing that actually transfers to the series is Radar, which is still (even if interpreted by the same actor) only a pale imitation of the original. What else? Oh yeah. With a trace of laughter (it doesn't matter if it was used in surgical scenes or not), it is disturbing, due to what happens in the other settings. And since it lasted almost four times longer than the Korean war, it takes viewers into this bizarre temporal rift that doesn't work outside the world of cartoons. I never liked this show, and I never will.
