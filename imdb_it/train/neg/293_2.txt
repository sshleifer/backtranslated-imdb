This film basically talks about some girls in a Catholic school who get into trouble because of the red dye in one of their shampoo schoolmates and after being reprimanded for this act they decide to leave for Florida on vacation. Along the way they meet some guys at a local restaurant and decide that they will both meet in another position later. The girls end up on the side of the road near the woods and stop for a while and while one of the girls decides to walk a little she sees a murder happen in which the same local sheriff is involved. She gets scared and runs to tell others what happened. The other girls decide to go and have a look at her and two of them are killed by the murderer. Then the two remaining girls are captured by the killer and placed in the local prison cell. Meanwhile, the deputy sheriff watches over the girls and despite their insistence that the sheriff is the murderer, he ignores them both and behaves as ignorant and all the others in this film who can't put together two or two much less a bad investigative job at that. The best part was the rape scene between the murderer and one of the girls in which he decides to rape her in his prison cell and it seems that the girl actually WANTS to be raped by this man and the bare chested scene I admit was good but first their lips meet has other things in mind. This film reminds me of the low-budget thriller "Blood Song" with Frankie Avalon staring at him, the same reason only for a different character part. It's not a movie worth renting even for a low-budget movie from the 80s and the ending was the worst ending I've ever seen in a movie and left my money behind!
