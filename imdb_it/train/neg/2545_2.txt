There are laughs in this movie, that's for sure. Michael Keaton is a talent and was once fun (before deciding he was a serious actor). However, what bothers me so much about this film is how practically all the characters are unthinkable. Apart from the two main leads, everyone is an idiot. I mean, these losers from a small town are as rough as you can. You just have to look and think, man, these losers should be unemployed. Moreover, the American worker is depicted as a lazy and ungrateful slob. It made me wonder if this film was made by Japanese nationalists. Oh sure, in the end they all come together, but I didn't like the journey to get there.
