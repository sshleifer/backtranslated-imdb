This is. This is that This is the worst movie ever made. Never. It beats everything. I've never seen worse. We pick up the trophy and give it to these people ..... there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Even three days after seeing this (for some reason I don't know why yet) I can't believe how insanely horrible this movie is / was. It's so ugly. So far from anything that could be considered a movie, a story or something that should have been created and brought to our existence. <br /> <br /> This made me doubt that humans are really put on this earth to do good. It made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe. This type of film hurts us sincerely as a society. We should be ashamed. I cannot really stress that our global responsibility as people who live here and create art is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good. It's an embarrassment. I don't know how the hell any of these actors, writers or the director of this movie sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making "Uploads". I don't know what kind of disgusting monsters love watching these types of movies. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I love a good "bad" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, I am HILARIOUS. I tell all my friends to see them because they are "bad". <br /> <br /> But this ....... this crosses the "bad" line in a completely new dimension. This is embarassing. This is evil where you know everything that will happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence BEFORE they happen; and not just like a second or two before, I mean after watching the first 5 minutes before. <br /> <br /> Every editing "effect" is shamelessly used over and over again in one point of view. I never want to see the "shaking" effect of the camera "from a drug blast" or the cutting of jumps or turning cuts or ANY FANCY NEVER CUT AGAIN. This is meticulously boring, repetitive and simply tortures the public. <br /> <br /> But ....... and let me be specific here, the most LOST thing about this movie is that given the production, it seems that somehow decent amount of money has actually been put into this excrement. Personally I'll take the director's shoulders if I ever see him and shake him submissively, asking him to run home and swallow two liters of Drain-O or I'll do it for him. <br /> <br /> If we ever needed a new form of inhuman torture for our prisoners of war abroad, continue to show them this film in a padded cell over and over again. Trust me, I think they will become more extravagant with suicidal methods after the seventy-second time they sit down. <br /> <br /> Stop these films, they are just the meanest of all aspects of our society. Please. Stop. NOW.
