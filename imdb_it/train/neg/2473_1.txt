if my grandmother made films, she would probably do a much better figure than this ... incredible ... the main characters (mom, dad and son) are OK. Especially the mother is a good actress and even the child is particularly good at the scenes where it should be scary. But the director knows the meaning of the words Plot Point, Triller and Good Script. the script does not have an evolving atmosphere to become a suspense thing. If you like being chased by trees, you'll probably like it, otherwise stay home and sleep. oh ... actually there was something funny: the movie is from 2001 but we didn't realize it since the image is so bad (like on mini-dv) and the machines are so old (like 70 and 80).
