My husband and I bought the Old School Sesame Street DVDs for our daughter and I have to say that I don't allow them to watch the new episodes on TV, because I find ALL the annoying characters. Baby Bear AND Telly? SHADOWS WHAT IS FANTASTIC and useless blabber can anyone think of their 'skits'? Helmet? Give it a rest, not everyone likes it, once again, annoying and not teaching my son ANYTHING. Mr. Noodle? what a refusal I think the only time I shot the "new" show for her, she and I were more stupid than before. The show definitely took a wrong turn. I remember Yip Yips, Kermit's Breaking News, 1-2 2 Little Dolls, Mumford the Magician, Bert and Ernie, Grover the Waiter, all the GREAT EDUCATIVE sketches of OLD SCHOOL SS Sesame Street suffered a blow of boredom and stupidity since then death of Jim Henson in 1990. The show no longer has the educational, funny and interactive sketches he was used to. I find the new versions simply unbearably annoying and full of useless non-educational blabber. The way to go for the producers / writers of S.S. you still have another comic show for parents to sit there in front of non-creative, untrained children to take their hair off. For producers / writers: I suggest you take out the old muppets and start recording content similar to those on the first Sesame Street. God knows I don't want my son to talk like Baby Bear or Elmo.
