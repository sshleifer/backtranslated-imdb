As far as I can understand, TIW WATCHER is the first job of a young director. My doubt is whether this is the job of a normal boy who loves movies or if this is the job of a film student, since there is a reference to Oporto School of Arts in the credits. <br /> <br /> However, the director Ricardo Pinho demonstrates with this film a total unawareness of some basic notions about cinema. What is a movie? How to tell a story? Never mind, for the novice director. One of the first things you learn in school when you study cinema is how to tell a story. You learn that, just like in novels, in movies you should also build your story in three acts: introduction, development and conclusion. You learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax. You learn that this is valid for a 3-hour epic, for the normal film, for a short film and even, believe it or not, for a 30-second commercial. You will also learn that there may be levels of subtlety in your approach to the academic structure and that, ultimately, you can even deconstruct it. <br /> <br /> In approximate terms, TIM WATCHER introduces us to his main character and then, the film ends - the whole movie looks like the introduction of Jeunet's characters from AMÉLIE. There are no second or third acts in TIM WATCHER. This is not a parody or an art film, so you can't even try to justify the lack of respect for the academic structure. You expect a story to be told to you, and it doesn't happen. Worse still, TIM WATCHER defines himself as a warning; and one without a real purpose. It does not have a point or, at least, it is not valid. His point is childish, with a sense of revenge. The situations portrayed are absolutely simple and his approach is Manichean. <br /> <br /> I expected a lot more from this short. The film opens with a rather nice sequence of credits and you quickly realize that you are looking at something with better production values ​​than the normal Portuguese short film. I don't know the budget for this film, but to judge by the list of credits in the credits, the credit must go to the production team to have good connections in a country where it is difficult to have doors open to young directors. > <br /> TIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise in style, color and carefully chosen plans, combined with an excellent score. That's all. There is nothing else There is no plot. And this is a pity because it seems a waste of production values. Hardly, you can see in the usual Portuguese short film such a diversity of places and so many extras available to enrich a story. <br /> <br /> As absurd as the comparison may seem, I have to refer to the BMW shorts as a fine example of how a good story can be told in a short film severely conditioned on product positioning and elegant cinematography and top.
