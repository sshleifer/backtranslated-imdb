I saw this movie a long time ago, and I have no desire to see it again. <br /> <br /> This film is about Preston Waters, a preteen with hard sex, who always seems neglected by his family and who always seems to be short of money. All this changes when a bank robber invests Preston's bike and gives him a blank check as compensation. Preston uses the check to withdraw $ 1 million from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check). Preston then buys a villa and says he is working as an assistant to a mysterious and wealthy supporter named Mr. Macintosh (named after his computer). After that, he goes crazy with money. <br /> <br /> On paper, it looks like a great idea. However, on the screen, it's one of the most empty films I've ever seen. First, it's too incredible. I know that some parts of the film were meant to be incredible, but I make a joke about a twelve-year-old boy who goes out with a woman of thirty and is put in charge of the small fortune of an imaginary person. Moreover, this was a superficial film with weak acting, a predictable plot plot and characters that are less than memorable. The characters were either cheesy, over the top, annoying or underdeveloped. But "Juice" was a fun character. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip this one.
