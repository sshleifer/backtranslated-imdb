I recently saw manufacturing landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival. I was attracted to the film as a photographer because I am both familiar and a fan of Burtynsky's work. While I believe the film does a good job getting the message, I couldn't help thinking that it was completely rethought with the photographs and Burtynsky's subsequent popular book. Obviously, one reason for this is the extensive use of still photographs with zoom and panoramic photographs on them. Although this is a good effect when used economically, I have heard that 75% of the film was just still images of Burtynsky's book (which I already own). It's probably an exaggeration, but that's how I felt. If you own the book or are familiar with its work, it might be better to skip this.
