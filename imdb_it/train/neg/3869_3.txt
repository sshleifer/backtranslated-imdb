This is the second time I've seen this movie in about 12 years. These comments come from someone who finds Kane and Ambersons as wonderful and noteworthy films. But the rest of Welles's career is unfortunately wasted on material unworthy of his talent and too fragile to resist his film embroidery. And when he makes a gigantic dish like Shanghai, the lack of something substantial to hang his tricks on, is just a little sad. I couldn't tell you what he was exploring here. It's all as fashionable as Welle's mischievous Irish; which requires a lot of effort, but adds absolutely zero to the film. Several projects by Welles have become too developed and baroque. Mr Arkadin (choose a version, any version) is a similar project. The material is irrelevant. It does not bear the weight of all this noodling. For a director who deals with reality-based drama (as here), he has never had any attraction to link his bundle of concepts to reality; or for a coherent story. The assassination plan for the rental is ridiculous. Kudos to Welles, though, to have Hayworth cut his hair, and get that performance from her. The camera loves it. She is the most elegant, sophisticated, sensual and charming femme fatale ever staged. But his betrayal comes so late in the film that it seems a desperate decision, made so that the film has a certain genre in which it fits. The film cannot be saved by a noir convention deployed in the last 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> When all is said and done in L.F.S., the convulsions are all for what? to convince you that you saw something thoughtful? give more to Welles? to make you roll your eyes? Welles has no sensitivity to the scale of a story or to tell a story directly. One wonders what Shanghai has to say to those who are not a paralyzed billionaire, who organizes a four-way rental scheme or a fanboy in love with film meaningless omens. <br /> <br /> Overwrought, absurd, disengaged.
