There is nothing unique either in the TV series or in the film. Which is a prequel to the television program, which is not found anywhere else in life and entertainment. Both before David Lynches, disgusting style of telling stories, and after. <br /> <br /> From the moment the body of a poor misguided girl washed herself on the beach. It is presented to some of the darkest and darkest immoral characters of the Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> For the mind that almost numbs the pedophilia, the film seems to romantically tell the destruction of a human life through some random psychedelic phenomena in the movie Twin Peak: Fire Come Walk with me. <br /> <br /> I looked at everything to make sure I didn't miss anything. I didn't. It's simply an obvious sexual fetish that spans a long series enchanted by a ridiculously over-pornographic movie. The suspense is saved from anxiety and looks at anything else that at least has the ability to tell a story, rather than seduce you into some kind of mental porn movie. <br /> <br /> I have heard many reviews, deceives and wails about how great David Lynch is. For his ability to define misery and tragedy and make it a kind of wonderful thing. This is not the life that imitates art, as much as it is a version of twisted and sick art that does its best to inspire a complete life without mind. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage.
