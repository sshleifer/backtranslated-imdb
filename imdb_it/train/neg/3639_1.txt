This movie sucks from the beginning until (especially) at the end. You're probably not getting worse, acting, plot, photography, working with the camera, etc. it's all very bad, very, very bad. <br /> <br /> But that's what makes it a "big" watch, I'll give you more than pretty laughs. The worst, the better! <br /> <br /> I really have no idea what ever these people were thinking about doing this movie. A serious Vikings movie? The story is damn ridiculous, it's more like an incognito comedy, a bit like Mafia, even useless but damn funny. <br /> <br /> And look for the very end of the film ... uhum.
