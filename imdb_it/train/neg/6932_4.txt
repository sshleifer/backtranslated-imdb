I waited a long time to see DR TARR's TORTURE DUNGEON and after seeing it, I was very disappointed. It's not the baroque film I expected it to be. The trailer (which I saw on a Something Weird DVD) is much better than the whole movie, which is extraordinarily forgettable. There are almost no relief scenes and the appearance is interesting but it doesn't even come close to other Baroque-style films, Fellini or Jodorowsky. The characters are boring and there's almost nothing dramatic going on, even if we see rape, crucifixion, madness, etc. <br /> <br /> The main problem with DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON was the fact that it was a talk-a-thread more than anything else. It was almost like looking at a book. I just wanted the film to have moments of silence or mood or something, instead we see / hear the main characters chit-chat without end on boring things. <br /> <br /> A missed opportunity.
