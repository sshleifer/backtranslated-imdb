"Sleepwalkers" is the first film for which Stephen King wrote a screenplay. That said, and the excellent song by Santo & Johnny that they used as the theme of the film, you would expect a strange and ultimately satisfying viewing experience. Unfortunately, that's not what you would get. The fact is that they probably would have made a good movie. The beginning is intriguing with the spooky atmosphere of the small town. But something strange happens about 20 minutes into the film. The film becomes fun for no apparent reason! From that moment on the whole "Sleepwalkers" atmosphere is ruined. For those of you who have seen it, who can ever forget the good old Johnny who shouts "COP KABOB !!" after throwing the pencil in that policeman's ear?!? But don't get me wrong, humor has no redeemiing quality. I just rented it again to see if mabye was wrong the first time, given the original plot of the plot, but I was right. Friend, what a waste. I can't believe they got the rights to that song by Santo and Johnny. I gave this to 2.
