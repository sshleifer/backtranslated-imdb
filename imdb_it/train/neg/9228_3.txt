CQ is incredibly slow and I'm a fan of David Mamet. The film follows a young filmmaker who is making a very Barbarella film. After the movie started getting lost. Deep and deep? Not exactly. The "Dragonfly" film made in CQ has the problem of having no end. This is in great parallel with CQ, which also lacks a final (in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to see this movie at the SxSW film festival. I had pretty high expectations having just seen Y Tu Mama Tambien and many other great movies. I couldn't wait to see Jason Schwartzman's performance. But it was not an easy film to get. If you are not in the science fiction or slow film of the 60s that do not go where, jump. <br /> <br /> CQ feels like a student movie. If you want an independent recent science fiction film, Donnie Darko, it won't make you sleep.
