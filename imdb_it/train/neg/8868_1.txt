Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The acting, the dialogue, the manuscript, the sound, the lighting, the plot. Actually I can't say anything positive about it, even if I like Swedish films. The fighting scenes are so ridiculous that it's impossible to take them seriously. And when the main character happens to lose his shirt, while dodging the bullets in a strip, I'm not sure it's a joke, or if someone really thinks these are the ingredients of a good movie ?! Regina Lund is the only half-descendant actor, but she disappears in a wave of laughable pronunciations and incredible reactions. It leaves you horrified that someone has spent time and money on something like this ...
