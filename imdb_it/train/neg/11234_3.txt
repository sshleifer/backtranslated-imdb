This film is a bad ugly vice on Friday 13. The film is about a murderer named Bernie who kills people around a camp counselor's training camp. It kills people because the camp counselor's training camp is located on land that was owned by his father, and when the police came to forcibly take his fathers' land he accidentally killed his mother (another F13th takes off) . The introduction is seeing Bernie kill his first victims. Then we are introduced to a family that goes camping in the same forest, shortly after their arrival they are joined by a strange old man who loves to talk about his son. Later we find out that his son is Bernie and that he locked him up in the back of his trailer after he got him out of a mental institution. He puts Bernie behind the family so they can get their things and then the chase is active. <br /> <br /> This film is recommended only for those who love 80s class B slashers.
