I'm almost drowned in CHEESE watching this movie. Actually I couldn't even finish it. I want my money back. Another of Hollywood's weak attempts to propose a new idea. Fortunately, I keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge. In the case of. They had to give Nic Cage a hat and a whip. Swashbucklin '. Cage's performance in Raising Arizona or Leaving Las Vegas beats this "lemon". People who are completely and totally commercialized (and most of them are) should love this movie. If this movie had been animated, I would have taken it more seriously. I would have preferred to pay for a completely stupid movie that didn't try to hide it. In my opinion, this was an incredibly stupid film and made the attempt to hide that FACT even more incredibly sad. <br /> <br /> All the SHEEPS seem to love anyway.
