A veritable explosion of the film to the letter. This British film is boringly done. <br /> <br /> What an exciting storyline! A terrorist square bombs on a train. How could writers and producers of this stinker turn this into a boring story? <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, like the expert called to defuse the bomb, receives horrible writing material to work with. Of course, just as it's called, his wife, Anne Vernon, is about to leave him. No wonder we have never heard of Miss Vernon. After such a film, it would have been enough to end his career. <br /> <br /> That old man who loved trains and interferes is our 1953 version of senile dementia. I thought it was highly offensive to show this man, even at the end.
