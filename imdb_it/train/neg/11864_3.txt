the characters in depth. you saw all the characters in other movies, I promise. the script tries to be angular and hateful but fails miserably. Throws in some hangover meets the superb comedy, but the jokes are out of the left field, completely forced, and are almost completely ignored after being broken. the hot chick is old and has no personality, she is just a blonde girl of the early thirties with a pair of non-intimate breasts wearing jokes that is less engaging. the attraction between Molly (the hot chick) and Kirk (the loving love interest) is barely communicated. the attraction of nowhere is a completely platonic relationship until an embarrassing and predictable kiss on the seat belt occurs. provided they are in a full and simply incredibly lame relationship. the main objective of this film is not the relationship, but a failed attempt to make an exaggerated and vulgar film with a semi-captivating plot. I could compare it to hangovers, in its forced nature. I won't go into that I could go on but it's just useless. just don't pay to see this movie.
