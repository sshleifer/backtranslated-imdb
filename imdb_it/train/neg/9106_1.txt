From the opening scene you will notice how hard they tried to imitate the very intelligent and powerful "intent cruel intentions", and how flat they landed. You'll also notice what a terrible choice they made when they chose Robin Dunne as Valmont ... Then in the second scene, you met the two best things in this film, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother. I mean, if you can get over the fact that Kathryn wasn't blonde in the first movie ... Then the movie continues, you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago, and you see that Sebastian has already met Anette in the past, here called Danielle , and a Cecile, here called Cherie ... How original is for a prequel. So it turns into a low budget movie 'Wild Things' with lots and lots of "my twists". As I said, Robin Dunne was a bad choice. Not that he's a bad actor, he's good ... He doesn't have the charisma that Ryan has. Amy Adams, who in my opinion is one of the most talented young actresses of our time, offers once again. But with all the talent in the world, there's no way to save this garbage. Overall, this "movie" looks like an episode of "Beverly Hills, 90210". The score was stolen from 'Cruel Intentions' and 'Jawbreaker' ... Yes, they used the JAWBREAKER score ... Couldn't they at least leave him alone ?! You'll want to pass this. If you want more cruel intentions, look at the dangerous reports of Stephen Frears.
