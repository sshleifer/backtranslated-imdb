Roman Polanski has made many, many films that are not exceptional. His fame baffles me. Nothing stands out as a high point except Chinatown (I didn't see "Knife in the Water" or "Tess"). Every contribution he made to the cinema ended more than twenty years ago; his work is simply embarrassing, safe and / or boring (The Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, The Ninth Gate, Pirates). R's Baby must have meant the end of the plant by the time it arrived. It's a luxury concept and high enough for a 1968 horror movie (never show the child). But this is just a horror misunderstanding. Everything is artistic to the point that the plot becomes irremediably clear very soon (um, thanks for the title that destroys the ending), and on a clear day you can see the turning point that ends for days. He did not support my interest. I find that whatever this movie may have been, it is completely derailed from the 1960s version of what femininity was. Farrow is an unemployed / distracted housewife and chronically defenseless. Its fragility is oversold ... it is irritating to the extreme. There are no real ideas in it ... nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil. <br /> <br /> The Dakota is barely exploited for its mysterious potential.
