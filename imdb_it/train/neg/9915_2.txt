I just finished "Dark Chamber" aka "Under Surveillance" and I'm stunned. Stunned, not from the movie, but from some of the rave reviews I reviewed and that influenced my vision. The story was so devastated by the holes in the plot and most of the acting is so flat, that it categorizes it as a comedy seems appropriate. Seriously, I found myself shaking my head and laughing puzzled as I tolerated this movie. <br /> <br /> Justin leaves the confines of living at home with a drug addict mother to live with his police officer despite the fact that his mother warns him that Dad is not good. When a young woman is found killed, Giustino becomes wary of tenants residing in adjacent apartments. With the help of a couple of friends, install hidden cameras to keep an eye on these people. As the truth begins to unfold, Justin discovers an unexpected secret. <br /> <br /> A positive point is that Felissa Rose is HOT! I would have generously slapped a star or two more if she broke off a little, but not so lucky. It would have been the potential saving grace of the film. Eric Conley played Justin very cleverly, I thought, and I wouldn't be surprised to see more about him in the future. <br /> <br /> The general premise of the film, even if plagued by clich√©s, would probably have worked had it not been for the ridiculously empty "performances" of the main cast members, particularly Alexandra Eitel (Kayla) and David H Rigg (Justin's father). Horror! (excuse the pun). <br /> <br /> I have nothing against low budget movies. In fact, I believe that independent cinema is our only hope for a decent film in the days to come. I will reduce the flexibility of low-budget films when it comes to special effects, lighting, even musical score and overall image quality. I do not give compensation, however, for the recitation of stylized figures and for the script of a lover of Swiss cheese. There is a vast number of competing low-budget films out there. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I can't help but suspect that at least some of the reviewers who praised "Dark Chamber" here are somehow affiliated with its production.
