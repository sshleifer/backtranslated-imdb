This film has left an impression on me forever. I saw him as a freshman in high school and that night I was home alone. I think I lost all respect for Robert Reed as an actor, having been a big fan of the "Brady Bunch". I also thought that the role of Chuck Connor was horrendous and evil. However, this film has had such an impact on me that I am now a volunteer in the state women's prison doing Bible studies and religious services and trying to change women's lives, one at a time. What fascinates me is that so few people have actually watched this movie. None of my friends looked at it and my family didn't understand until today when I discuss this movie because they didn't see it.
