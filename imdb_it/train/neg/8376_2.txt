"Little Man", now on DVD, is a flop of Wayans Brothers. It is the story of a criminal smaller than a midget played by Marlon Wayans, who hides a diamond in a woman's purse after a robbery. He and his partner Tracy Morgan prepare the brilliant plan to disguise Marlon as a child and plant it at the woman's home. So he goes through all sorts of "Home Alone" or "Child's Play" as a chaos to recover the jewel and be treated like a child. I was surprised how low the humor was in this film. The jokes have been made in other places so many times, that they are not nice or funny. I almost think the movie could have been more fun if they hadn't used CGI and used the small actor with Marlon's face glued to it. In looking at the deleted scenes (minus CGI) this actor was fun in a Mini-me way, but they chose a different path. Some cameos and Tracy Morgan do some funny scenes ... Spend your rent $ on Borat if you want to have a laugh these days. <br /> <br /> http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
