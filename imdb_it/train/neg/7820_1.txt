or: is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, look ... It's a disaster! or: No need to look up into the sky. <br /> <br /> or: (... OK, that's enough.) If the singer tried to make a romantic titanic movie to break the box office record, he failed. The SR structure cannot do it, the scheme of dark and limited colors (I would call it "wishi-washi"), the boring usual dialogues, the clown with advanced alien technology, the missing fun and magic, etc. Make the film completely disappointing. <br /> <br /> It just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> The main thing in a character like Superman is that he is a superhero. This is the core, the most important thing. <br /> <br /> Love problems and sadly lost depressive depression can only be an aspect in a 2:40 Superman movie, not all the time. <br /> <br /> Because then it is no longer a superman or superhero movie. It is like one (and in this case a very bad and boring social study), in which every 30 minutes a person flies around. <br /> <br /> This is a big difference. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke. Holy skywalker, this is Superman, so give us supervillains, Superaction and most importantly, Superfun. <br /> <br /> We want ENTERTAINMENT! Singer, if you want to give a soul from 2 to 40 troubles about love for lost and sad people? So take normal human characters and do a yentl remake. <br /> <br /> They say: Superman returns. And then, supersadlysoftie is in the door. <br /> <br /> Maybe the singer tried to kill the legend without kryptonite, but a bad movie can't do it. Don't give up, plan a sequel ... <br /> <br /> The singer of the next release (and Warner Brothers), creates a superhero movie, not a depressing superlame soap, or let it be. A superhero movie means a colorful fantasy with lots of fun and magic. <br /> <br /> This film is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover. Yes, technically there are all sorts, yes, there are a lot of little speeches, there are some jokes, an action scene, etc., but the one thing that all these worst pieces have in common is their poor quality. br /> <br /> It's nothing but a super boring patchwork and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The cast's ridiculous strategy (throw them as young as possible, so it can make sequels in the next 25 years) gives the rest. Kate Bosworth plays a 22-year-old reporter star, looks like 19. Superman was five years old, so he slept with her 6 years ago, so he was 16 (he looked like 13) and a journalist on the planet, writing " I spend a night with the superman ". Warner Brothers, it's too much. <br /> <br /> Routh is not so bad, it is playing a little wood, but the whole film is wooden, so ...?! Temporary goods were impregnated and sometimes laid. The rest, forget it. Even spatial, this is not his terrain. <br /> <br /> Reeve / Hackman / Kidder behaved so easily, with fun. What difference. <br /> <br /> Even Jesus' poses are ridiculous in the end. What the hell is this supposed to be? The problem here is that they mean this seriously, not as a joke. The next time Spiderman or Batman or Ironman fall and stand up like Jesus or the angels? Or speak directly to God. Why not? They are superheroes, who save lives every day. So at least one talk with God every week should be possible ... Oh my God. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this was not the real film announced, but it is from a bizarre opaque parallel universe. <br /> <br /> For the warner brothers, this super-depression depressive film will probably be the greatest disaster in history. Not just for the money. I understand how difficult it was (perhaps) to create and transport some messages or feelings, but to show lonely, lost and unfortunately new people and thousands of movies or TV shows have done better, in old or new ones like magnolia. And the flying frogs were more impressive than this flying super woman, I'm sorry, superman of course. <br /> <br /> Singer and WB, this is simply nothing. It's actually even more than nothing, it's like a black hole that destroys the passion for movies (comics / superheroes) and steals three hours of our lives. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Smilla's little brother. (Very angry and green as the wreck.)
