Larry Buchanan. Yes, the same guy who did "Attack of the THE Eye Creatures" and two conspiracy films on Marilyn Monroe. It's to blame here. <br /> <br /> Adding to his ever-growing stack of folders left by Oliver Stone's "eh-I-grown-out" conspiracy drawer, here is "Down On Us (ie-" Beyond the Doors ") which is the operational definition of historical inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> Forget everything you THINK you know about Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, says Big Lar, because this is the real deal! Y'see, the three big names of the 1960s rock were KILLED BY THE GOVERNMENT because they were subversive or counterproductive to Truth, Justice and the American Way, or to subdue in that way long. <br /> <br /> To each so, three people (Chatman, Meryl, Wolf) that seem strangely like their shadows of real life (ie, if you close your eyes completely, turn your back and walk five miles from them) show that instead of their deaths you recorded, the good old A's US scores them! Yes, that's the truth! <br /> <br /> Man, I can't believe that I saw this movie. strive credibility at the breaking point, it is ridiculous; the acting makes the TV commercials very dramatic and if you look at it honestly until the end, you deserve the final "twist". You really do it, really; I swear. Genius. <br /> <br /> But as the man said, "Rock and roll is dead - long life to rock and roll." <br /> <br /> It's not this movie, though. <br /> <br /> No star for "Down on Us". And this is the audience of the film that describes the film, among other things ....
