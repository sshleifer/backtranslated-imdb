This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This film has nothing positive about it. Some of you really like this movie! I saw a lot of Dracula's movies and I liked all the ones I saw, but when I saw this movie I said to myself: "What the hell is this?" What a stupid movie. Now they have Dracula who becomes who he is because he is Judas. For those of you who do not know who Judas is, he betrayed Jesus Christ and then felt so guilty that he hanged himself. You are making a fool of me. This is the dumbest reason I have ever heard because Dracula has become bad. Who asked a reason anyway? What a piece of sh ** this movie is. Anyone who has ever invented this sorry excuse for a film should be beaten. Even the Dracula is horrible. If you've ever seen this movie, you wouldn't even think it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Should this title impress me? Don't waste time or money on this junk.
