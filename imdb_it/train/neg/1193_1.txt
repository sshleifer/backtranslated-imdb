Do you know how sometimes you can watch a lousy movie with friends and laugh at all the imperfections in the movie? Well, this was beyond this. I bought the DVD on Tower Records because it was like $ 3.00 and I felt that this was a movie that could be laughed at. It is really pathetic to say the least. About 30 minutes into the film, my friends started asking me to turn it off. About 45 minutes they implored me. After an hour, we compromised fast progress to the end, so we could see how the conflict was resolved (and why we had been watching all the time for Matt Walsh). Seriously, don't watch this movie. It is beyond all limits.
