Thanks to the BBC for this show. I suffered from an inferiority complex, I hated leaving the house, talking to new people and I had the overwhelming feeling that people hated me. However, after seeing an episode of 4 non-blondes, my fortunes started to change. After episode 2 I started applying for new jobs, wearing fashionable clothes and I really felt talented. When the series finished, I was directing the sales department at work, hitting a flood of women and often won the karaoke contest on my premises. If you've ever had a crisis of confidence and don't know where to turn, take a trip to Poundland and get the DVD is only 99p.
