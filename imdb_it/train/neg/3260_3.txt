Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze is a horrible movie. Poor script, over-act and simply silly. That being said ... it is actually a funny movie on some level. This film asks to be seen in a group with a large supply of cheap beer. It's one of those films like "Santa Claus conquers the Martians" or "Yor, the hunter of the future" ... so bad it is almost good. If you have the right group of people this movie is a show to watch. He is camped. It is funny. It has a theme of Sousa. If you are looking for a good movie, look elsewhere. 3/10. <br /> <br /> BTW, I've heard that some studios are exploring the possibility of a remake ...
