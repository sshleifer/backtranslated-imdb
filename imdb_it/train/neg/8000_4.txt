I already know that critics and some viewers say it was a satire, there were numerous political and social messages, the names refer to other names, etc. It could be. I can't do things like that (I don't want to do it anyway) because I don't care, I'm interested in 'cinema'. As for the film itself, it is again said that the film is intelligent and dramatically powerful. I couldn't see anything that we don't see in monster movies, except the scene that takes place in an office in the second half. Yes, that scene says something about humanity, but it doesn't make the film brilliant. The film is funny (moderately) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but no more. As for the biggest flaw in the film, they are visual effects. It was simply shocking, I couldn't get back together for a while, because I was expecting a realistic monster, because it's not one of Gojira's old movies, it was made in 2006, but it wasn't. It's like you don't believe there's a monster, you don't care. If you agree with me on this, I highly recommend Cloverfield which is extremely realistic. The design of the monster is not interesting, but at least expected, there is an effort. Dramatically powerful criticism. Some critics talk about it as if it were a Kurosawa film. Yes, it's rather a drama than a thriller or an action, but it shouldn't mean it's dramatically powerful. I don't want to compare The Host with other monster movies, but I try to say that The Host doesn't do something that other monster movies don't do. By the way, it could be that some people call the masterpiece of the film because of their sympathy for Asian cinema. Yes, I like Asian cinema too, but that's the fact.
