Wow, I saw it on T.V. as one of the "scary" movies that show around for Halloween. Has this been classified as G? There was really nothing to make this movie scary, or worth watching. Besides, other people say it's a parody, but I don't think so. For a parody, you need something called "humor". This low budget crap party didn't have a shred of humor, and it didn't make much sense. Basically you have a lousy-looking monster (a man in a rubber suit) who comes out of the closets, killing people, I guess, since you never see the monster do violence to someone or any bloody consequences. The revolving newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster, so I guess it's good enough. <br /> <br /> The army weakly tries to kill the monster, which is not much bigger than a man. They have a very bad goal. So the military FLEES! Wow, did this movie make the United States look pathetic or what? The monster, although difficult to kill, does not do much besides mixing and roaring. Oh, and occasionally a second head comes out of his mouth and screams. It was a rather interesting but total alien repudiation. <br /> <br /> What was the agreement with the scientist who played the xylophone to attract the monster? It was difficult to understand much of the dialogue due to poor sound quality. Also, why did the monster carry the wimpy boy around for so long? Why didn't the monster go into the closet when he had a chance? Why do I insist on trying to make sense of who doesn't make sense?
