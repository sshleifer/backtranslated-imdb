What else can you say about this movie, except it's just terrible. Tina Louise and Adam West are the reasons to see it, but, it is so, but their talents are wasted in this stuff. I think they used a double in some of Adam's scenes, like when he runs, because you can't see him in the face. If Adam were embarrassed to be in Zombie Nightmare, think about what he should have tried to appear in this ??? If it was before or after, I'm not sure, but, in any case, Zombie Nightmare is a classic (look at the version of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 first and last) with respect to this. The band is very annoying and over-acting by some of the actors. A rip-off of The Wild One starring Marlon Brando, of course. Tina looks beautiful. I hope you and Adam got a good salary !! Step!
