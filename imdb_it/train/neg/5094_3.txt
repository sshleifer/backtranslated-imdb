This movie sucked. The acting sucked, the screenplay sucked and the film in general was sucked. There were two threads in the film that were not developed and the viewer had to do some work to understand what was happening. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it needs to be explained, but suddenly you find that things happen and are said as if you had the faintest idea what they are. Examples: <br /> <br /> The heroin's negative comments about the hero. The public is never shown how he knows anything about the boy and how he is related to the death of his boyfriend. The viewer also has minimal exposure to the boy's death. <br /> <br /> Also, suddenly there's a scene with a bunch of guys loading and arming machine guns and that's all you see before cutting back to the other scenes. No explanation regarding guns and people with them. <br /> <br /> We gave a 3 because we didn't want to go back. It was fun to gape the movie as we watched it, so at least it gave us some fun. ;-)
