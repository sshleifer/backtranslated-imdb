Except for the best acting abilities of the two protagonists, this film is really very ugly. Low-cost production values ​​do not help. Obviously, you won't really notice that production values ​​are cheap if they don't keep trying to convince you that you have a production value to begin with. Even for a genre of B-movie films like me, this movie really sucks.
