Resnais, wow! The genius that brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the challenge of creating a 1930s French musical with bright colors. The opening of the voiceover with old and intricate titles was a nice touch. Then the camera aperture opens (like the old crankers) on a black and white sign. The camera turns off (or better, on), suddenly showing us the surprisingly bright colors of an elegant table set for a tea party. That's all in the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the music starts. A rather banal and forgettable backside with an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls blabbering some nonsense that have no bearing on the movie (and yes, I speak French, so I can't blame him on subtitles). Those characters whiz outside the door and are replaced by other people who intrude on an even more forgettable song. Then they leave, and in the end Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue for 15 minutes in the film. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Resna meant starting with such a waste of time and cacophony music. But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to throw pins at the screen and run away. I resisted. <br /> <br /> It didn't go much better. I'll tell you why. There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters. We don't even see their faces for half the time (as Resnais seems too intent on showing expensive scenarios to worry about real people facing the camera). People go back and forth like moths on a lamp, and we the public cannot concentrate on a particular person or plot. It is as if you had to take each episode of the Brady Bunch and insert it into a 2-hour movie. With bad songs. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me looking until I did (1 hour) was that I was looking at the techniques, the lighting and the scenery of the camera which, after all, were excellent. But is it enough to get your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe tomorrow I'll try to watch the end. Aw, who am I kidding. I have more important things to do. I'm sure you do too. Skip this.
