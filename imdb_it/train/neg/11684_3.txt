This movie doesn't make any sense, there are plot holes big enough to let huge vehicles of the New York police pass. The characters do not act in any plausible way. I'll post my comments on the bulletin board, but I'll save time and money, this is stupid. I hate it when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash-bang equipment and uses fantasy editing and fantastic music, and doesn't care about having a plot that crashes along with even the most basic level. But it's nice to see Denzel W. prevail over Man, who comes in 3 flavors, Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Captain Von Trapp. There is also a sweet little boy with a video game that is beautiful.
