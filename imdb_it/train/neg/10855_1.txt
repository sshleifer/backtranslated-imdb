This is definitely a comedy that I probably won't forget for a while. <br /> <br /> Normally you wouldn't mind commenting on this movie: it's so small that nobody would look at it anyway, but as it happens it is popular in p2p sharing networks like Kazaa, so this saaad production has to be exposed for what it is . <br /> <br /> So what is it then? Well, of course it's not really a comedy; instead, it is intended as a horror film - "intended" which is the key word here. The script is a totally inconsistent and unbalanced mess, the special effects are special only because they are particularly pathetic, and as far as acting is concerned, well, let's say if this was my elementary school diploma, my teachers would I burst into tears over our talent. Of course I realize that this is a very low budget film and that in these cases expectations should be lowered, certainly as regards special effects. Also, even though I'm a huge fan of the horror genre, I'm aware that these films are rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top-notch acting. <br /> <br /> But still. <Br /> <br /> Movies B often have some features to redeem the lack of funds, such as humor. The only laughter in Cradle to Fear is found in the ridiculous performances. If you can find the humor in this - and for the first 20 minutes or so, to doze gradually after that - then that will be the only thing the film has to offer. Oh, that and two or three pairs of breasts. <br /> <br /> Woohoo, what a thrill. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's not even that you don't try to convey anything: the victims use drugs and / or are involved in serious crimes. The lesson: be careful, bad boys and girls, because one day you will get paid for what you did. <br /> <br /> I rest my case. <br /> <br /> So all in all, a little sex, a good dose of drugs, but absolutely zero rock 'n roll. <br /> <br /> Rate this 1 out of 10, but I'd go to 0 if I could. Or maybe I wouldn't: it deserves a 1 to correctly write the names of the actors in the titles. I mean, it's something, innit?
