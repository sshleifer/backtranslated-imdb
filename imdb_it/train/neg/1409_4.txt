Not really spoiler in my opinion, but I wanted to cover myself, however. As an executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants audiences to ignore the many absurdities of his character in 10 Items Or Less, a film with intentional independence, and to simply be absorbed by the mentor / be-all-that-you-can-on theme . He plays an alternative universe, a semi-washed version of the real Morgan Freeman, who is accompanied by a child in an old Econovan up to Carson, California, by Brentwood to study his next film role. Because Carson, it's a mystery to So. Residents of Cal He could save the trip and go anywhere in the San Fernando valley and find the same elements. Paz Vega is nice to look at, a cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, playing a displeased drugged concealer in a large but slow local market that apparently is the main source of Moragn Freeman's research. His character is known only as "He" to allude to how actors are considered when met in real life by ordinary people- "Psst, this is" him ", etc. Unfortunately, I was too distracted by the fact that He had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice, but he had no reliable return to his home in Brentwood, he did not carry cash or debit cards, or he had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him.If one has such a high opinion of oneself that he believes have an answer all like He does, then I have to see money and a Blackberry that shows intelligence and good instincts of survival to preserve that great ego that He definitely has. Nothing really happens in this film. I don't think any of the main characters had fundamentally changed from the encounter with one another, flirting with the idea of ​​adultery, but then that thought vanishes. This for me was similar to Steve Martin's Shopgirl, without the sexual relationship. o-indulgent for Freeman and unconvincing for the public.
