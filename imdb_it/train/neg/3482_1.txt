So, I know I voted 1 out of 10, but in reality this doesn't deserve more than half a star. I hated it. It was so stupid and unrealistic, I can't believe that any of the stars has signed up to make this absurdly absurd project. <br /> <br /> James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were excellent in their characters and Ben Affleck and Even Christina Applegate were equally good, but the story sucked and I encourage anyone to see this in the video store not to take not even the trouble of picking it up and reading the back cover, but just leaving ... I don't even want to understand what the movie is about, because it's too stupid to pontificate. <br /> <br /> Don't rent it! It's horrible! Horrible!
