I took this film on AZN via cable. It looked like a good movie, a Japanese "green card". I cannot say that I have never appreciated an Asian film, on the contrary. Some of the most incredible horror films of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I'm a big fan of John Woo's Hong Kong movies. I'm not against light-hearted films like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favorites), so I thought I would like it. Well, I'd rather cut my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this strenuous, misinterpreted movie again. <br /> <br /> I think the director Steven Okazaki must have bent the water with Quaalude, because nobody in this film has a personality. And when some of the characters tried to act, instead of muttering a joke or two, their performance turned out to be forced and incredibly false. I honestly didn't think anyone had ever acted before ... the ONLY person who seemed genuine was Brenda Aoki. I find it incredible that this is promoted as a comedy, because I didn't laugh once. Even more surprising is that the CBS morning news called this "a refreshing comedy breath". It was neither refreshing nor a breath of comedy. And the ending was very predictable, the previous review must be an idiot to think things like that. <br /> <br /> AVOID this movie unless you want to see a boring plot line and a wooden acting. Actually, I think "Spike of Bensonhurst" is a better acting film than this ... and I came out in the middle of the movie!
