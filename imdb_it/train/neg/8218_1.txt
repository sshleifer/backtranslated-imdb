I never finished this film for a reason, it was terrible and this is just acting. I wasn't even sure what the movie was, it didn't make much sense and the violence was terrible. I mean I usually like a little nude in a movie (lol), but it was simply bad because of what was happening. ALL the characters bothered me and it was full of loud screams and the camera was shaking to the parts and it seemed like a sequel to the blair with the project but without good qualities. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time and I wish my time please. I would not recommend this film to anyone or even consider it. (N)
