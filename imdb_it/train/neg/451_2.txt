I don't care how many nominations this junk got for the best this and that, this movie stank. I didn't know whether to turn off the set or file a lawsuit with O.J. for unlawful damage to my mental health. I rarely got bored; calling this manure show is a slap in the face to every viewer around the planet. The whole story was stupid, the acting was not inspired, the "drama" was emotionless. I am grateful that I do not have to pay for this unsatisfactory experience.
