The film starts well. Widower with the new girl and children. <br /> <br /> The film is full of stupid choices by the director. How "leaves separate". "I'm coming down to ..." doing what? Stupid stupid Stupid. <br /> <br /> Please don't waste your time hoping it will improve ............... Not barely.
