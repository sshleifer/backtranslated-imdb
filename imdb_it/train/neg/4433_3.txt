I really wanted this movie to like me better than me. This is because I love the strange foreign comedies, especially the strange ones that completely surprise you. However, although this often took me by surprise, these were almost never pleasant surprises. It reminded me of South Park as almost EVERY social norm was violated until the only ones left to escape were too sick to be funny. For example, after exploring adultery, drug abuse (of almost all types - from the pot, heroin, speed to glue the nose), prostitution, S & M, suicide, murder, etc. , The film has arrived at fun (?) Pedophilia topic. Mom encouraged her only son (who was about 12) to sleep with the nearby men. In fact, at some point in the film, he gives this boy to the dentist in exchange for a payment for dental work! Funny?! Are you kidding. This film goes too far and digs into the "black hole of comedy". What should they tease about the next tumor or rectal cancer?
