This is probably one of the worst "you want to be a low-budget hit movie" to credit the dinosaur genre. The film is so predictable that you could go away, cook dinner alone, go to answer the phone or whatever and when you come back you will know exactly what happened. The special effects are so poor that you would have thought that Lego bricks were used and that "super fast" dinosaurs were so domesticated as to make a companion dog a super predator. The acting is over. They try so hard, yet there is not enough character behind them to get into the characters and as far as the scientist is concerned ... Yes, ok, we know exactly what will happen to the blonde girl with glasses. Stereotype was created for films like this. If you want to watch this movie, I suggest you not have a serious mood like the cast and crew obviously. And if you really like dinosaurs and you know everything about them in the world, don't look at them, you could break the screen - the facts are so far away.
