I didn't like the movie, Joshua, at all. Maybe it's because I saw another much more similar film, called Orphan 2 days before, but maybe it's because this film wasn't very nice. I go with the ladder. Of course, the plot of an evil child is not exactly original, but this does not mean that the film cannot succeed. It could have been suspenseful, fun and chilling, but instead it was slow, boring, uneventful and in reality it didn't let me think of anything more than "it wasn't very nice" when it was all over. <br /> <br /> In the end, Joshua's motivations are revealed. I won't give it, but the reality is that he hasn't really achieved his goals because despite Vera Farmiga as his mother, Abby, who disappeared around 3/4 through the film, all the arrows indicate his return home soon. She was engaged in a psychiatric institution because she was losing her mind, but then Joshua's father / husband was accused of tampering with his medicines which tell the public that the institution realized that she was not mentally ill, but that she had been subjected to medical treatment. So ... shouldn't he be home soon? Has Joshua not failed? Will his mother not soon live with him, his sister and perhaps his father? I ask the Father why his future is left open. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, I didn't care about the characters. The bad demon son Joshua wasn't really scary. The plot moved slowly and when it was shot it was still boring. The suspension fell flat every time. When it was all over, I couldn't believe I sat for the rest. <br /> <br /> 4/10 only because the acting was good from the parents, in particular Vera Farmiga like the mother, but if you want to watch a movie about an evil "child" go see Orphan. This is a film that took a non-original concept and created a brilliant film.
