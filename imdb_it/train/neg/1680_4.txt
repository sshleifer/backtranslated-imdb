Even with a cast that boasts such reliable names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland fails to give any sense of depth to this film. Barely touching the surface of the incidents that occurred on that July night in 1981. Kilmer merely makes gestures while John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are both hopefully misunderstood in the other two main roles; like Holmes's wife and underage girlfriend, respectively. The rest of the cast has such small roles that it is impossible to get any size from them. The film features Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and a Paris Hilton cameo.
