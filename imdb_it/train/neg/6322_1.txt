This was among the STUPIDEST and PREACHIEST of the anti-nuke films of the 80s. <br /> <br /> The idea that a child and a basketball star can "change the world" is quite unbelievable, given how many "peace marches for children" and "celebrity protests" were and are. <br /> <br /> But the idea that the Soviet Union would agree to a total nuclear disarmament, because some apparatchik boys have learned of a "silent protest" in the West, is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> What put an end to the Cold War? America is tough, I dare say the "reactionary" position and the internal failures of socialism. They were NOT peaceful marches, "die-ins" or movies like "Amazing Grace & Chuck", "Miracle Mile" or "Testament".
