Words cannot simply describe how awful this film is. I saw it on video last night and simply couldn't believe what I was seeing. Basically, "Snakeeater" is about a former soldier (Lorenzo Lamas) and his search for the kidnapped sister who was held captive by the liberty-style Rednecks. The acting, writing, directing, photography and editing of the film are deplorable along with a song called "Soldato" which must be one of the worst thematic songs of all time! <br /> <br /> However, there is a surprise. "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) of "Welcome back Carter" is in the film that plays a ridiculous bad boy. Otherwise, please avoid this mess at ALL COSTS.
