As an army veteran, I was deeply offended by this film. In my opinion, it is a disgrace for those who fought in the Vietnam War. To say that the real SF soldiers I knew were offended by this shit is an understatement. If the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon (it was), it would have been better received. But my many people have been taken seriously, especially abroad. Silly as it may seem, wherever I went in Europe in the late 1980s people seemed to judge me and the Americans in general from this movie. Unrealistic? Hmm, let's see. A monosyllabic muscle-bound cretin is pulled out of a prison gang to go on a secret mission to Southeast Asia to free some American prisoners of war. In an ongoing battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an M-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammunition and never overheats. And he never loses, running with a 32-pound gun supported by an arm. I could go on, but I get a headache. I gave this 2/10 only because it is slightly better than Rambo III.
