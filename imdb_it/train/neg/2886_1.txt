Horrible, horrible, horrible don't waste your money to rent this movie. It's like a low budget for Canadian TV movies. Absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen and there have been many others out there. This film is not worth the time it takes to insert it into the DVD player or video recorder. : ~ (It is possible to write ten lines? The acting was horrible, did not have any flow. I saw the TV movie about the BTK killer and it was much better (than this). Sure of what they were going to produce this movie, but if it was to educate or tell a story about the BTK killer that they lost for a mile, it seemed to be more of an animal rights spot.
