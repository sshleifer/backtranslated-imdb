Let's start by saying that "JAWANI DIWANI" is just a pathetic film. I agree with the last person who said "I lost the game". lol. <br /> <br /> The jokes were simply terrible. Performance was average. Something went terribly wrong in the film. Emraan absolutely deserved something better. All that CELINA JAITLEY did was exhibit. Hrishitta was ok. Even Emraan hashmi was fine. <br /> <br /> MANN (EMASH HASHMI) is a desperate boy who wants to become famous. so he uses RADHA and pretends to love her, just because his father is a music director and could help him become famous (since his father obeys everything his daughter says). One day, MANN and his friends go to GOA to have some fun. There he meets ROME (CELINA JAITLEY) and totally falls for his appearance and tries to flirt with his BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> Then, that night, ROMA can't open the door to her room and Mann decides to help her. Seeing that he can't do it, ROMA goes to ask for help. While she is away, MANN is able to open the door and decides to enter and sits on her bed BLA BLA BLA. ROME arrives and they have a night in the stands. However, on that night, ROME falls in love with him. That morning, they identify the underworld don (MAHESH) that sees everything. The don loves ROME and could not stand what he saw. He orders him to marry and, scared, MANN obeys the order and Merry's ROMA. Then, their marriage news ends up in the newspaper. MANN will then discover that he loves ROMA after making a music video together. Now he is trapped between love and fame. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> the film is horrible. The songs "SINI NE SINI NE" are fantastic, the remix version is even better. "DIL DIWANA" is also great. The title track is fantastic too. KIDS, AVOID LOOKING AT THIS FILM.
