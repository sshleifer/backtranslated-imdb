An actor who is still famous but decadent (Morgan Freeman) has not toured for four years. When invited to participate in a new project, he asks the director's clumsy cousin to leave him in a poor Latin neighborhood of Carlson to look for the job of a small supermarket manager. He sees the splendid Spanish cashier Scarlet (Paz Vega) and becomes attracted by his skill. His driver never returns to pick him up and Scarlet gives the actor a lift. But first she has a job interview for the position of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her to be prepared; then spend the afternoon together having fun. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. However, the useless "10 articles or less" is absolutely disappointing. This low-budget film does not seem to have a storyline, and is supported by the chemistry and improvisation of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega, and in reality nothing happens during 82 minutes. The ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous, with the character of Morgan Freeman returning to his silver spoon world and telling the simple operator that they will never see each other again. Was she afraid of having a love story with her and destroying her perfect world with her family? Or was it a clash of classes, and does he realize that his luxury neighborhood would not be adequate for a simple lower-class worker? My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Astro em Minha Vida" ("A star in my life")
