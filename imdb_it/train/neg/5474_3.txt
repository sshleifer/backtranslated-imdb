To be honest they did all they could with a budget of five shillings and six pence, but the dialogue was less than 9 pounds of emmental and the CGI was a little old hat now. maybe if some actors weren't so perfectly sculpted in granite, it would have made the film a little nicer. To say that it was terrible is to make a wrong movie, if you want to see something that is totally execrable, you have to sit down and waste a couple of hours of your life watching 'sickle', which is so terribly terrible, it's actually good (many however, large alcoholic beverages are a bit derelict, it's worth a look if you haven't seen it yet, just don't expect anything along the lines of "jurassic park, the lost world" or "apocalypto".
