What made the original Killer Tomatoes fun was made by people without a budget who were simply extravagant for a couple of days ... <br /> <br /> This was something with a budget, but it wasn't exactly as fun. John Astin of Adams Family fame is actually making an effort here to be comical, but it is supported by lame actors, cheap special effects and little fun gags. <br /> <br /> The plot. Dr. Gangrene (Astin) escapes from a French prison and decides to put a suitor on the French throne ... The hero, his French girlfriend and the "Pomodoro Fuzzy" similar to Gizmo decide to stop him ... <br / > <br /> Forget Direct to Video nonsense ...
