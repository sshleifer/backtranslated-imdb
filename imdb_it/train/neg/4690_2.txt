This British film is really horrible, and it's hard to believe that Glenn Ford is in it, even though he has a lot of sleep. The idea of ​​a bomb on a train sounds good ... but it turns out that this train ends up parked for most of the movie! No action, no movement, just a static train. The area where the train is parked is evacuated, so there is no danger to anyone. In fact, this movie could be used in a movie class to show how NOT to create a suspense movie. The real suspense is generated by letting the public know things that the characters don't know, a seemingly unknown fact to the director. SPOILER: the train actually has two bombs on it, but we are led to believe that there is only one. After the first bomb has been defused, there seems to be no reason to watch the movie anymore. But at the last minute, the villain, who has no apparent motivation for his actions, reveals that there are two. Nor are we sure WHEN the bombs will explode, so we don't even have a classic "tinkling" sequence of tensions. They spend 10 or more minutes watching Glenn Ford's French wife think about leaving him, and then she wonders where he is. He's such a annoying character that we don't care if she reconciles with him, so when she does, there's nothing exciting. Most other characters are rather lacking in personality and no one has problems or problems. It's only 72 minutes, but it feels long because it's boring and boring. Do not waste time.
