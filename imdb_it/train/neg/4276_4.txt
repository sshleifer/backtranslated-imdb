This overrated, short-lived series (a miserable two seasons) is almost experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a bar. I'm not quite sure what they mean by "innovative" and "original" when they spy on Lynch and his stupid little television work. What exactly are their criteria for what is original? Of course, compared to the "Bill Cosby Show" or "Hill Street Blues" it is original. Definitely. Next to "Law & Order" TP spits originality left and right. <br /> <br /> TP enthusiasts often say that the show was canceled because too many viewers weren't smart enough, open enough for the alleged "strangeness" of the show ", its allegedly naive wildness, or anything else "As a fan of quirks, I have to correct that misconception. There is nothing too off-the-wall about TP; it is a simply watchable, rather foolish whodunit that turns in circles, turning spider webs in every corner but (or for this) in the end is not going anywhere. The alleged strangeness is always forced, the characters do not behave in a strange way as much as they behave IDIOTIC for half the time. There is a difference ... <br /> <br /> Every time I look at the sequence of "bizarre dreams" in "Living In Oblivion" in which the nano criticizes the director (Buscemi) for having succumbed to the tired old man, let's use it-a-pagan-in-a-dream-scene- clich√©, I think of Lynch. Do you want strange? "Eraserhead" is strange - in fact, it is al beyond the strange, it is fundamentally abstract. Do you want a unique TV program? Look at "The Prisoner". Do you want a strange looking cast? Felini and Leone's films offer it. TP looks like an overly appealing criminal television drama in which all young people look like fashion models. The cast gives TP a plastic appearance. Kens & Barbies en masse. <br /> <br /> Indeed, one of the TP producers said that Lynch was looking for "unique faces" for the series. Unique faces? Like that of Lara Flynn Boyle? Sheryll Fenn's? Like those "pieces" with an effeminate face that come from male catalogs (or from gay magazines)? Do not get me wrong; there's nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast, especially with beauties like Fenn (the way Madonna would look if she was 1000 times prettier), but then not going around saying that you're doing a strange show with people strange looking ". And I never understood Lynch's misguided fascination with Kyle MacLachlan (I should get a medal to worry about writing his name correctly). It is not unlikely, but it lacks charisma, it seems a bit too bland and shiny. The ridiculous "eccentricities" of his character were not at all interesting, just one of Lynch's many attempts to force strangeness, striving to keep his reputation high - having completely lost his advantage, but that time. All that Lynch did post "Elephant Man" was much lower than his first two films. What followed was often a mediocre effort that was based on the relatively small but fanatical Lynch fan base to keep an eye on, interpreting the meanings in his misplaced stories that do not hold water with closer scrutiny. In other words, Lynch is the treasure of every aspiring intellectual. <br /> <br /> So Laura Palmer was killed by her father ...? He was obsessed with the devil or certain nonsense. This is the best this "great mind" could come up with ... You have B-movie horror movies that end up with more originality. <br /> <br /> Lynch is neither brilliant nor hard-working enough to invent a fantastic story. <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and take a look at my "TV & Cinema: 150 worst cases of nepotism" list.
