Nothing will ruin a film as much as the combination of a poor screenplay and bad direction. This is the case of "The Tomb of the Mummy". <br /> <br /> The script consists of advanced ideas of older and better horror gestures such as "Dracula" and "Frankenstein". The direction is trivial and stale. Acting is mediocre. Chaney's Kharis is also weak compared to Tom Tyler's in "Mother's Hand", and the producers are foolish enough to add footage from Christy Cabanne's prequel and point out the weakness of their movie! <br /> <br /> Universal realized how bad this film was, and basically re-made it two years later as "The Mummy's Ghost" with a better script and director. The result was probably the best film in their four-film cycle "Mummy", although not nearly as close to the original Karl Freund's 1932 film. The Cabanne movie takes this film to 3. The "new" material is a 2 to the best. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were probably pleased to see their characters escaped, so they would no longer have to look disgraced like this!
