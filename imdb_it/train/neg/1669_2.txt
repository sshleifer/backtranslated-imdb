Here we are: two travelers from a distant futurist world arrive on earth ... one is on a desperate mission to preserve a life, another is an inhuman machine to kill determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the savior of an entire breed. <br /> <br /> So how can we call this killing machine? It's almost like it's some kind of destroyer, or grubber ... kind of like an exterminator or something. What is the word I am looking for ... something that - things ends -? Hmmmm .... <br /> <br /> However, the protector (who quickly removes the white robe he stole from Luke Skywalker in favor of local clothing) finds the young woman first and impregnates her with a future-born hero- to be. The evil uhhhh ... "exterminator" kills some rednecks and steals their guns and clothes, then tries to locate the woman by visiting his workplace and asking around looking menacingly into people's eyes and repeating his name in a threatening way. <br /> <br /> Then begins a desperate race for survival as the apparently immortal and unstoppable "exterminator" chases the couple through the countryside. At some point he could buy boots and a motorcycle, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, in an exciting finale, he will try to crush them under the wheels of a huge tank truck full of. .. acid. Then the truck will crash. They will be saved ... but no! Then it will re-emerge, stronger than ever. He will kill the protector and chase the girl in a meat packing plant, where in a terrifying end, he is pushed into a large piece of industrial machinery and destroyed once and for all. <br /> <br /> But maybe I'm extrapolating too much ... after all, I stopped watching this movie after Mr. Protector magically impregnated Sean Young by kissing her in a bar, then tells her that the baby will be born in 3 days . <br /> <br /> The costumes and effects are fantastic in this movie ... I loved them the first time I saw them on Star Trek: Next Generation! Sean Young makes another big breakthrough as a non-emotional Replicant, and Stephen Baldwin, career sweat, is also aboard Young Fat Fat's boyfriend. I'm not sure where it fits into the plot ... maybe it's imported from another James Cameron movie?
