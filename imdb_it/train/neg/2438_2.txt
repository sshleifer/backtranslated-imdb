This notorious end of Koen Wauters' career came to my attention through the "Night of Bad taste". Judging from the comments index I was not the first and I am not the last person in Western Europe to know that this musician (undoubtedly one of the best of the contemporary pop scene, even the Dutch agree on this) has tried to be an actor. Whether or not he should have made the attempt cannot be judged. <br /> <br /> In "Intensive Care" it is rather nice, but it seems uncomfortable with the film in which it participates. No one can blame him. It deserves its position in Verheyen's Hall of Fame by all means and standards. The story of the killer man who is presumed to have died in an accident But Is Alive And Wrathful has been told dozens of times before, and even without original twists a director can offer a more than mediocre story through innovative settings and cinematography. /> <br /> IC contents with a hospital wing and a couple of bourgeois houses. The rhythm is boring. The tension loses the last part of its credibility for the musical score, since every appearance of the killer is accompanied by a boring threatening melody, followed by orchestral explosions during the murders, which either largely suggested and in any case bloodless as a small budget can do it. The sex scene is free but not at least appealing. The Amsterdamned couple could have made it work, though. While dealing with the couple's subject: the entire subplot between Wauters and the girl doesn't work. A more effective emotional connection could have been established on the screen if they were only the other future victims, who loosen their nerves in the middle of the physical relationship. I will not even grant the other cast members the dignity of a mention, because they should all have been cut into pieces. In fact, most of them do it. The ones I remember where obvious for the genre: a beautiful nurse and two policemen. <br /> <br /> So, in a slasher, the cavalry arrives only in time for needing the rescue itself. The (anti) hero must take the bad, especially through intelligent thinking, because the former red caps do not often get parts in these films; they could overcome the illusion of invincibility surrounding the killer. Translated to the events, Wauters kills the doctor and saves the woman in danger. <br /> <br /> No people, I'm not done. This is not how history goes. Wauters makes his heroic attempt but is beaten with a fury that comes close to "A Clockwork Orange", so it is up to the girl to take the act of the drill killer and pierce the doctors' brains. Although this method assures the killer more than the usual round of 9mm bullets, the doctor survives to allow the IC to reach the score of 80 min. <br /> <br /> I should have expressed my point of view. Intensive Care is a bad film, which can only be appreciated by lovers of Bad Taste, who can verify Verheyen's captivating statements and invent something for themselves and in this way try to sit down. For example, the value of the (unintentional) parody of the doctor's clown mask (Halloween) and the final clash in the park (the chase at the end of Friday 13). <br /> <br /> However, let me conclude by giving an overview of some soft items that give the IC a little credit. George Kennedy is not one of them. All he has to do is put up with a horrible monologue from a French doctor / actor colleague and look horrified when they let him go up in flames to label his name on a substitute. He could play his Naked Gun part again, to end up like beef, but with a longer screen time. The ending could be one of them. I had never seen a maniac be knocked down by throwing fireworks in his guts to crush him against a flexible fence. It's good for a laugh. <br /> <br /> Give a name to something really interesting about Intensive Care ... Koen Wauters learned his lesson and devoted himself entirely to his musical career. I wonder how many editions of the Paris-Dakar race must have an abortion before coming to their senses. <br /> <br />
