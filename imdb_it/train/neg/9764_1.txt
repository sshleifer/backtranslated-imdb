In a word ... abysmal. I give him a star for hippie sex scenes and women with sweet eyes, otherwise I forget it. Corman's worst effort, without exception. Ben Vereen should have left the name definitively struck by the cast. I can't believe this will now be on DVD (from 05/15/05) with "Wild In The Streets" - another stinker retro. I woke up sick in bed this morning with a cold, I decided to watch a movie to cheer myself up a bit, I scanned the digital channels ... the premise seemed interesting enough to me because I like watching sci-fi movies, hippy culture and rebel teen movies. He seemed familiar in some way and with Ben Vereen in the cast, I thought ... why not? What a big mistake ... it was a horrible start to my day. <br /> <br /> Only after seeing it, now I know why familiarity has crept into the recesses of my newly awakened brain. I remembered seeing the attractions coming for this film as a fourteen year old (I am 45), in the early seventies of Sombrero, a local art theater that no longer exists ... the whole theater laughed hysterically and indeed he complained about how bad this movie was. Acting: terrible, history: horrible, cinematography: almost-terrible, music: terrible, sound: horrendous, direction: a joke. If you choose to watch this after my warning, remember ... "I told you so." <br /> <br /> "Gass-sss" is the perfect title for this movie ... you feel "gassed" after watching this putrid movie - or maybe you should be taken to a "gas" room to waste your brain. I've seen Super 8 home movies that put the film to shame. Definitely a new addition to my Top Ten WORST movies of all time ... it's up there (ahem, over there) with "Tentacles". <br /> <br /> Ted in Gilbert, AZ
