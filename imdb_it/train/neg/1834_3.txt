I can't say much about this movie. I think he speaks for himself (as well as the current ratings here). I rented it about two years ago and I totally regretted it. I even tried looking at it twice, but couldn't. I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time, ever again. And I'm not one to throw a movie, but I really think it was horrible. It wasn't even funny in the slightest. The only things I liked were the few scenes with Christopher Walken in them. I think this movie ruined both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I can think of when I see one of their films nowadays is this terrible movie, and it reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is also very boring. <br /> <br /> Overall, well, I think you understood my point. By the way, the stars are for Walken.
