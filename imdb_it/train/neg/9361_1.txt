When I saw the preview of this on TV, I was thinking, "ok it's going to be a good werewolf movie" but it wasn't. it wasn't scary at all! acting was good, the plot was horrible, the military offer was simply stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel could do better than this piece of shit. The film made it appear that Arron was about to turn into a werewolf, instead he went crazy and bit a doctor's throat. If you've read some of my other reviews on other films, it's all positive, but this isn't simply because the story was terrible. One in 10 max. I'm sure you all expected a werewolf stroke, but I bet you didn't expect that. Besides Loch Nes it was much better than this movie, heck, any movie on the science fiction channel is better than this movie.
