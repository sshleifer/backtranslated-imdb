Acting was weak, but in a horror movie, I can live with it if the story is good. It wasn't. The initial event was a clumsy and obvious ploy to exploit the adoration of the children of most people. OK well. Fast forward to the "place in the country" where they will recover emotionally. I like the revelation of ghosts. OK, great - this will be a supernatural horror story, with things that partly rot in our world, partly in ... where ever. Then the action starts to pull like a three-headed dog in a flurry of cats and birds - Is there an evil force that tries to attack them directly? Is there an evil force that tries to attack them directly - make people do horrible things that they really wouldn't do? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole REGION is a kind of psychic echo chamber in which environmental discord can reverberate in murder? OK, wait - maybe it's just a little red-style "Delbert" guy who misses his mom and is in a kind of binge like a K-Tel that Norman Bates takes off? Oh, yes - extra points off: the only Black character seems to be the grandson of a bus porter "Our Gang". The actor plays the most drastic role that can give the poor dialogue, but the fact is that his purpose is "You did everything, betta, go outside, boss!" At least they wrote it smart enough to leave us the GTFs. The bite with the girl silenced and pulled away was decidedly disturbing, as was the girl in the shower. Those were just two of the many delicious morsels of this movie. The problem is that they are combined in disharmonious ways, such as a steak bite, a bite of chocolate and a bite from a Gummi bear. Is everyone fantastic on their own, but mixed? Yuck! This potential. Wasted.
