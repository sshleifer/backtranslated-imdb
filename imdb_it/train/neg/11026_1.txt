I just finished reading a book on Dillinger. This film was horribly inaccurate. It's like they have a list of names and just did everything. His robberies and escapes were well planned, until the second - when the time was up, they left if they had all the money or not. They had notes on every street, where to go, etc. Purvis never saw him at the restaurant, he was told that Dillinger paid for his meal after Dillinger left. Purvis never even saw Dillinger before the night Dillinger was killed, just pictures of him. The way his gang members died was fictitious. Dillinger has never robbed a bank alone, as he did in this film. If I had never read the book, maybe I could have enjoyed the movie. The acting was somewhat exaggerated in some places. The action was also exaggerated. Looking back, I doubt I would have liked it very much even if I hadn't read the book.
