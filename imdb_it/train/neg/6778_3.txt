Oh dear, oh dear ... <br /> <br /> For JM fans, this was the nail in the coffin with regards to his high-level Hollywood career. After a solid run in Girl Can not Help It, Wayward Bus, The Burglar and Rock Hunter it seemed that Jayne was on track to become one of Tinsel Town's hottest stars. However, an obsession with lively publicity and an appearance in this clunker have relegated Mansfield to the margins, ie cheap euro loans until Fox was able to terminate the contract at the first opportunity. <br /> <br /> This film is really diabolical to waste everyone's time with the exception of Suzy Parker who is the only thing in this film that is bad enough for the material. Many people blame poor Jayne and her grateful performance for the poor returns of this movie at the box office and while she is a pain in this movie, she can only do her best with the material. After all, Cary hardly focuses on the screen, does he? After a handful of great dramatic and comedy comedies, Jayne takes 10 steps back in her search for a serious actress by accepting (simply for the sake of appearing with Grant) to portray this heartbreaking and idiotic threat. Her character from Alice is a child complete with cartoons and even though she looks good enough to eat in a boiler suit, all her appearances in the movie are rattling your nerves. We all know that Jayne could do a lot better than this slag and yet she's around like a pudding at the prize. Such a pity. <br /> <br /> Avoid this so-called comedy. It's more depressing than funny.
