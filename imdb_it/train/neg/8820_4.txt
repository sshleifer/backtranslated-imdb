Entering a film like this, I didn't expect anything funny at all except for a bunch of kills ... the one I got was even less. <br /> <br /> Christmas Eve 1947 a child attends his parents who do it while the father wears a Santa suit. Horrified, he runs up the stairs and cuts himself. The story begins 33 years later and Harry Stalling is your normal everyday joe ..... apart from the fact that he's obsessed with Santa Claus. After his boss teases him, he goes crazy, he disguises himself as a Santa Claus and starts killing unbelieving supporters and his boss. An unruly neighborhood reaches him and just as they are about to burn him, he pushes his van from a cliff ... to the moon. It's not the best ending I've seen, but it was original. <br /> <br /> It was a slow and boring film that actually had no salvific qualities except when Harry went apocalyptic on church goers. There was almost no blood and even "sex" scenes were attenuated. <br /> <br /> Too boring ...... 4 out of 10
