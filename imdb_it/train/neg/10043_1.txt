I would have liked to have written about history, but there was none. I would have liked to mention a couple of dialogues from the film, but "hinglish" is fun for only 5 minutes, after which it is excessive. I wanted to disappear for the "suspenseful suspense", but it was predictable as ... um mm, a film by Yash raj (?). I would have liked to talk about the action in the field, but I don't really like cartoons. <br /> <br /> * sigh * <br /> <br /> All in all, this film is perfect for: 1. people who attempt suicide - I promise that it will push you beyond the limit 2. Sado-masochists - This film is much more effective than the barbed wire that the boy from Silas in the Da-Vinci code wore. 3. People looking for alternative ways to spread terrorism - I swear that the public leaving the room seemed to be in the right mood to kill someone 4. Film Piraters: more power for them. If any film deserves not to have the public spending money to watch - that's it. 5. Beanies, most types of plankton and green algae - Because almost all other living things would require an IQ factor somewhat greater than what the film offers. Afterthought: the director of the film, of course, is a species apart from himself. (And I hope it's the only one of its kind ... that's enough) <br /> <br /> Things that could have made this movie better: 1. A story 2. A choreographer 3. A Writer 4. A coordinator of the stunts 5. A story (Did I mention it already?) 6. A director - preferably one who is not mentally challenged (although even one who has been challenged could have done a better job) 7. Anil Kapoor = Bubonic plague - Avoid at all costs 8. A statutory warning - "Watching Yash Raj's movies is harmful to your mental health"? <br /> <br /> Things I liked about the movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2 English subtitles - "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" becomes - "My heart is in a vacuum", "Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya "turns into" Im a flirt, Im a lover, Im a vagabond "... priceless. /> <br /> In short, Tashan for me, it's like the opposite of a Rubrics cube - The cube should increase the player's IQ, Tashan promises to lower your IQ and that ... in just 2.5 hours! Woot! <br /> <br /> * sigh * .. But this is just for me. I could be wrong. You were warned anyway.
