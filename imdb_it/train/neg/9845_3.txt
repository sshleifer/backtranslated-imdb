!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER MILD !!!!! <br /> <br /> While watching the first part of GUILTY AS SIN, I couldn't believe it was created in 1993 because it sounded like a JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterhas clone from the mid-80s. He starts with a murder and is left to the public to think "Is he guilty or innocent and will he sleep with his lawyer?" from his "movie type" that ends in a ridiculous way, and GUILTY AS SIN has an even more ridiculous ending in this regard. <br /> <br /> This is a very poor thriller but the most unforgivable thing about it was directed by Sidney Lumet the same man who gave us the all-time classic drama in the classroom 12 ANGRY MEN
