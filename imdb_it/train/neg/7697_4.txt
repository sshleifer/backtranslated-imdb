This mini series is actually more fun than others with much bigger budgets and bigger aspirations. SOTD falls between "Kung-Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff" in the entertainment spectrum. If it wasn't so long (almost 3 hours) I think children would like a little. He has adventure, action, "cliffhanger scenes" and not too much romance or other "icky" things. When you are young, you are not too critical in flexing rubber swords, country acting and repeating scenes. (At least two scenes are repeated identically in the film, just as it was done in a series of old times to get the audience up to speed.) Finally, children usually accept more American English dialogue by getting out of Asia's mouth. (Not to mention the fact that many of the main roles are played by non-Asian actors.) <br /> <br /> I was going to give this film three stars, but I felt like the director, the producers and the cast deserved some more credit to at least complete the project. This film is not art, but how to paint your house, it actually took a little time, effort and discipline to make it happen. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a recommended use for your time, but it could keep kids having fun while traveling in the mini-van. <br /> <br /> Oh, yeah ... hey, IMDb! "Dialogue" is the favorite and traditional spelling. Your spelling checker seems to think that "dialogue" is the correct spelling. While "dialogue" is acceptable, both Webster and the OED consider it an alternative form.
