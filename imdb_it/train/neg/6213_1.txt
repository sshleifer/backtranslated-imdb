This film has become one of my 10 most terrible films. Horrible. <br /> <br /> There was not a continuous minute in which there was no confrontation with one monster or another. There was no chance of character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except for the big bad machine I wanted to destroy them) <br /> <br /> The scenes were obviously stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> Examples <br /> <br />> The ghost scene was finally stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /> <br />> The spider machine at the beginning was exactly like Frodo attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both films) and waits ...... hypnotizes (stings) his victim and wraps them ..... eh uh ???? <br /> <br />> And the theme of the whole machine against humans was the matrix ... or the terminator ..... <br /> <br /> There are other examples, but why waste the time? And someone will tell me what the Nazi was?!?! ???? Nazi <br /> <br /> There was a youthful plot brought to a youthful conclusion. The film could not decide whether it was a children's movie or an adult film and it wasn't much. <br /> <br /> Simply awful. A real disappointment to say the least. Save your money.
