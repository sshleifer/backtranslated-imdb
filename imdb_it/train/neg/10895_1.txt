I've seen a lot of bad movies. Most of the time I can enjoy a lousy horror movie for what it is. But this really brings evil to new extremes. <br /> <br /> It is bland, the plot for what never really goes anywhere and takes its time on it. There are no shocks, no horror, no suspense, just a load of guys rubbing for an hour and a half and then a quick finish. <br /> <br /> A scourge of the disgusting horror genre, avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
