My one-line summary should explain everything, but I try. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, this film seemed like an exaggerated soap opera, and that's all I can comment on. There were some interesting scenes, like the "Big One" that hit during the middle of the film, but wait, what is it? The earthquake * starts *, wait a minute! That's Dante's peak! Well, parts of it have been slaughtered and slapped. I can't believe how bad this film was, "borrowing" scenes from other, much better films. One wonders what director thought the spectators were so stupid as to believe that there are large wooded and mountainous backdrops in the center of LA, wing Dante's Peak. <br /> <br /> My advice, forget the Bond Wanna-be, Nash, in this movie and go for the real thing (again, someone from Dante's Peak by coincidence.) <br /> <br />
