Another fact for the tv piece of junk! This is an insult to a war movie (I use the word film in its freest possible form!) I thought Telly Savalas's career had hit the bottom when he made the voice on that visit to Birmingham which is shown on Tarrant on TV in a regular semi-base, but then I forgot I was involved in this! I had tried pushing it into my subconscious memory, but cable TV took my memory and screamed from me !! <br /> <br /> I like a little (sarcastically laughs!) in the film that claims to be a Liverpool scene in the 1940s, but is blatantly a blow from the Zagreb Cathedral in the late 1980s. The Commando's steam train is also training on JZ logo shows (Yugoslavia Zeleznice, or Yugoslavia) on the side of the locomotive quite clearly, even though the manufacturers have tried to obscure them. Why not just films in the UK, if that is where most of the film is set? <br /> <br /> Cheap rubbish and celluloid waste!
