This is one of the worst acting I've ever seen. I love Almereyda's Nadja, but this is just an absolute disaster. Apart from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music, this film is just a constant recitation and stupid material. Jared Harris is particularly bad, but nobody in this is remotely good. The plot is a joke, but not the haha ​​type. I don't even know if you can forgive such bad films. Please delete the last hour and a half of my life. How did this director make Nadja and Another Girl Another Planet?
