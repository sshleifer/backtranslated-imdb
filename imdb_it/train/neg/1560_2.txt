You can't even say that this film is bad, unfortunately it's just painfully mediocre. Lacking any wit or imagination, a subtle plot is taken to the absolute limit and the "beats" (which are predictable and worn out) are turned so messily that boredom and yawns quickly overcome the viewer. Another notch that marks the sad decline of John Waters and a reminder that what has "shocked" or amused us 30 years ago does not work the same way now. We have already seen it before and no longer breaks any taboos because they have long since vanished. A great lack.
