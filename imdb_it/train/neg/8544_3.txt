I was never quite sure where this was going. These people seem interested in what is happening on some mountains. They investigate, they have narrow loopholes, they leave, they come back, they leave, they put themselves in danger, they pass the nap, they are attacked by witches who have a coherent wardrobe, etc. Etc. The boy seems to like the girl, but leaves her many times unsecured. She is taken away, takes it back, leaves it again. Get the point. Everything seems to go into a sort of sacrifice, I think, but I'm not sure, or turn people into witches, but I'm not sure. It's just boring and endless and not worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the press is so bad that there are times when twenty seconds of darkness are not unusual. It is caused by age or excessive use of night filters.
