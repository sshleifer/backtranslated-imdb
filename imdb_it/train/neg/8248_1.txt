There were more interesting Polish documentaries on worm breeding, in brail_ !! The competition (breeding of worms) had a better plot and more interesting characters. I was physically sick after watching this movie. The cheating husband (I think dougray_scott_) was a joke in every sense of the word. Poor Jennifer must really need the job, and what was with the accent !! The locations and the casual meetings reminded me of a high school joke and I showed the humility of a 10 year old child in a cooking class. It was so bad that I think I will write the sequel entitled "this is not a lax". Thank you for listening, it was a great weight of my conscience.
