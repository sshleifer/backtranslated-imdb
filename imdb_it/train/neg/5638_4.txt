Only one thing could have redeemed this sketch. A healthy firefight between the happy couple, the exotic model of the delicatessen shop, and the motel veteran who was (it would have turned out) secretly looking out of the woods and was aging the boy for rent for the boys when they "d shared the rubber house. <br /> <br /> In the process, they could have blasted that chilly shack into a thousand pieces, solved most of the obstacles, like the ode "bitch" on the windshield, the reason why the the protagonist had no "friends", apart from explaining his coldness under the pressure of a bloody pad, incessant phone calls ... and that elegance to crawl, the green thumb and his attraction to the simpler life. with the human body, anyway. Ex-abortionist? Assistant morgue? A little heartbeat would have been nice. <br /> <br /> It was fun to watch these people move, I suppose, but the stupid Italian games of Eleanora were stere otipicamente suffocating while the caretaker had been in too many yoga lessons: a Dick, a mind and a pick-up summed him up for him. I also wish they had a little more baggage: Eleanora is ready to go after putting black underwear in her noble red suitcase and the caretaker just needs a cardboard box there at the motel. <br /> <br />, you could well say it. I agree, even if the insignificant bits have not been added precisely in this flagship work. Good owl, anyway, and I felt really cold all the way.
