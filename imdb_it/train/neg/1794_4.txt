not your typical vampire story, not bram stoker or anne rice here. a truly original vampire story. these vampires are genetic mutants that sunlight does not disturb. they are evil for <br /> <br /> the film is not perfect. many actors are clearly amateurs. the two protagonists who play van helsing and gather the vampire chick are pretty good though. the film is intensely violent which can disturb some people. it is also loaded with scientific details that many will find difficult to understand and may get bored. I was sold on the clever plot and the good performance of the couple. not to say how successful this movie would have been if they had a bigger budget and had achieved mass distribution
