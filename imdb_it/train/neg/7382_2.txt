Well, let me tell you that I have always been a fan of Steven Seagal and that his films are generally fantastic but this is not up to the rest. This in my opinion is very stupid I did not like everything. The biggest reason why I don't like it is because it is very imperfect and for me it doesn't make much sense. The acting is bad, even Steven Seagal does not play well, the rest of the actors see him because he is limited to directing the videos. It doesn't follow a straight line, everything happens at once, so why doesn't make a lot of sense. There is practically no action in it and to make an action movie good it is usually necessary to take action. The special effects are very bad and you can tell that they are fake. So all in all this is the worst Seagals movie, so if you want to watch a Steven Seagal movie don't rent it, pretend it doesn't exist. So avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ** on ********** <br /> <br /> * on *****
