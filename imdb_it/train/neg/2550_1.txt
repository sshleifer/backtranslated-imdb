It was the tagline "in the tradition of American Pie" that tricked me into renting this movie. What I got was a piece of junk in the style of Jackass, with the main difference that compared to this Jackass the Movie looks like a Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> This movie made me regret having rewarded other films with 1 out of 10, because now I can't go below that. This makes some bad films similar to cinematic feats. <br /> <br /> Actually I turned it off after 45 minutes, and it's something I do very rarely. But it was simply too boring, stupid, uninteresting and useless. <br /> <br /> I can't believe some people reward him with 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? Do you fall into your head when you were just a child? Or was it the first movie you've ever seen, so you have nothing to compare? Are you still a virgin and have your breast all you think? Something must be wrong, at least. <br /> <br /> My advice: stay away from this. Even if you're in the mood for a simple movie that doesn't require thinking, choose something else, or you'll regret it for sure.
