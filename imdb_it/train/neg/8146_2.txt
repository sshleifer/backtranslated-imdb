1st watched on 7/11/2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-John White): film of a rather lame gangster about a family like a Godfather in Brooklyn who loves to say bad words to four letters and kill people. The only thing of interest here was their attempt to show that the feds were very similar to the gang. This is the only attempt to make a good movie. The rest of the film was predictable and was made at a low cost. The quality of the photography on some scenes inside bars and floating joints almost made you think there was a problem with your DVD player because of the bad contrasts and some of the actors were hard to hear sometimes because of the bad sound . The acting was a veritable incarnation of all your favorite gangsters from top movies with cheesy names like Vinnie "Knuckles" and Jimmie "Tattoos", and the plot also followed these patterns very well. So, go see a better gangster movie before spending your money on it.
