Someone mentioned the editing. This was badly changed and what started out as a bit intriguing has become an incomprehensible disaster. To begin with, let us know what you are trying to do with these experiments. Why are these people the best choice for the kind of experimentation they are involved in? And what are they testing exactly? Apparently there is a great plan that an agency is about to exploit. The acting is pretty ugly. Everyone is emulating. Everyone is keeping secrets. They often mention that if it wasn't for the money, they would hang it. There is an unbalanced minister who spreads the Scriptures. Again and again. But again, the biggest hang-up is the lack of a playing field for the actors. There are some really bad elements. Those little rooms and those deckchairs. The terrible wallpaper (was it wallpaper?). It was interesting, but it didn't seem to go anywhere.
