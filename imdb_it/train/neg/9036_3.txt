I can't believe spending time looking at this garbage! I did it because Leonard Maltin gave him an "AA" rating, and for TV movies this is usually a reliable indicator of some quality entertainment. <br /> <br /> The acting was OK, but anyone who wrote it should be denied access to any means of communication forever. The plot is ridiculous, the motivations of the "bad guys" totally absent and the various silly and superficial family interactions. For example, Dad preaches that the violent reaction to aggression is BAD, but turns out to be an "admirable" person NOT because of his "ignore the idiots" philosophy, but because he is pretty good with fists ... > <br /> The only message I managed to get from this mess is that the nuclear family is good and alternative life patterns are bad. Oh, and bad people happen to good people.
