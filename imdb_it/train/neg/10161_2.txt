I didn't expect much from this film as it has people from Parkersburg WV, which was my life, acting in this. This city is boring and so is this film. There were some decent scenes in the film, but I was distracted by all the crappy landmarks that had made a point to show. This film may have been good if there was really acting, but there was none. Unless you're from Parkersburg and you're interested in seeing what you see every day, then stay away from this movie. Dialogue will put you to sleep, acting will bore you to tears and Steven Soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting bullshit like this. It is a predictable film without surprises. What you see is what you get and this is a 73 minute tour of Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a storyteller.
