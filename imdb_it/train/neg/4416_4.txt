A less than subtle blow to the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church has a darker shadow of death towards the end of the show. During the show, dark humor plays a role through which many commonly asked rhetorical questions are posed, in particular "If God is so good, why does he allow evil to exist in the world?" Diane Keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version (although some may disagree) of a stereotypical religious teacher who peeps on the "company line" and condemns half the world to burn in hell. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of his school, invite his first students to come back and perform during their Christmas show. <br /> <br /> However, when the quartet "updates" their game to parody the "fallacious" teachings of Sister Mary, the nun is pushed over the edge, sending the story spiraling into a chain of unhappy events. The ending eventually leaves the audience with a feeling of being sick in their hearts. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Go watch the game instead.
