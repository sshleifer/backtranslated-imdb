I should never have started this movie and stopped looking after 3/4. I lost the really messy ending. This film was a disappointment because it could have been much better. It had a nice atmosphere, a first-rate cast and director, excellent locations. But a baaaaaad plot, a bad script. I paid attention to Kenneth Branagh's southern accent: it was better than the script. The plot was stupid - driven by characters who acted in unreal and unlikely ways. Nobody behaves that way outside of Hollywood scripts.
