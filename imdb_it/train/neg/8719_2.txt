Well, here I go with another film of sector B. It's pretty sad to see some badly made films, but I don't care if a sector B or C produces the film. Show an effort in your work. The characters are really bad. Acting is not in question in this (surprise), but the plot is. How can a close-knit team attend two of his massacred comrades, and then continue as if nothing had happened. What bothered me was the way the writer even threw a scene into the remaining members in which they joked about how nice the doctor's ass was. Give me a break.
