Despite some oddities that slightly stimulate the script and the general value of the film's curiosity, Fury of the Wolfman emerges as a boring and uninteresting excursion to lycanthropy, saved only by the statuary presence of the Cristal report. The rest of the players, including the Hammam Naschy, is a complete write-off (although of course no one is helped by often atrocious dubbing). Although the script contains enough variations on the werewolf / Frankenstein / Dr Moreau themes to give a dozen films a shape, the plot is so irregularly developed, the characterizations so weak and the dialogue so verbally ridiculous (at least in the English version), that any latent interest in turgid procedures is soon canceled. <br /> <br /> The direction of Zabalza seems jerky, even amateur. His staging is clumsy and ineffective. It is not helped by the brilliant lighting of Villasenor. Even the promising sets are photographed in such an atmospheric manner that the director's few attempts to scare the public are reported well in advance <br /> <br /> The other credits fall into a similar pattern of ineptitude, although the music is too much emphatic and ridiculous and absolutely primitive special effects deserve special condemnation.
