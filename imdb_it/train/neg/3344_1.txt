I should prefigure it by saying that I am a fan of Dolph Lundgren. The man discovers some of the most fun imaginable clich√©s of action and Detention is probably my favorite. * Spoiler * although there is no Dolph spoiler since the scripts are so absurd to begin with: a chase scene with a handicapped child carrying a gun against a guy on a Harley with a machine gun, through a high school corridor baby wins? Good game, the Oscar goes into detention. Dolph, if you're reading this, thanks for the laughs, old friend. <br /> <br /> In summary: fantastic film that is a guaranteed laugh. I recommend inviting some friends for this and forcing them to sit down. Funny.
