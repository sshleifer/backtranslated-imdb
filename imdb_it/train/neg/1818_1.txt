Connie Hoffman is very pretty and is sometimes attractive topless. <br /> <br /> That's it, folks. The only reason why you are considering whether to watch this movie or not. <br /> <br /> These pieces from the 70s sexploitation period are sometimes amusing by virtue of their very age (flared trousers, big hair, Zapata mustache etc.) This is not. <br /> <br /> The script is ugly, the acting is bad, the direction is bad, and the idea of ​​having an elderly man driving the elderly is exceptionally bad. <br /> <br /> The title, which alludes to a sexual comedy, is decidedly misleading. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that you avoid this like the plague.
