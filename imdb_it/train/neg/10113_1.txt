I discovered that this film is rented based on the packaging. the zombie in the front of the DVD looks cool and scary. then you get to the film and it's the women with raccoon masks. zero special effects ... and even the fighting scenes you can see can't beat 2-foot fists. the funny thing is that Lommel plays briefly in the film and is worse than the rest of the film's actors. the only thing I can think of is that Lommel is just trying to make a movie so bad that people call it a "cult classic" ... anyway, I can't imagine anyone thinking that it's just one of the worst movies ever done. the real horror in this film is how ugly it is. I'm embarrassed that I rented it and vowed never to see another Lommel movie!
