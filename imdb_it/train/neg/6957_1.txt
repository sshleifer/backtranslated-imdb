Avoid this, unless you want to watch an expensive but poorly made movie. Example? The sound is good but the dialogue is not clear - a capital sin in a French film. <br /> <br /> This film attempts to combine westerns, drug intrigues and costume ancients in epic costumes. What? Well, consider this. Cowboy music is hilarious during sword fights. Or what about the woman in her underwear, holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed? <br /> <br /> Someone should do a 'What's Up Tiger Lily' on this bomb. Rewrite the script and then perform the dubbing or subtitle. Heck, it's almost like that now. (BTW, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, both known to the American public, have roles.)
