The biggest joke in the world. The largest and most exclusive joke in the world. <br /> <br /> Emulating the brazen humor of the human office, this film pushes the fascination of this film into the ground making humor such that it is only adequately appreciated by legal secretaries who write books. The public is asked to take on the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary, and then to empathize with the incredibly stupid protagonist. <br /> <br /> The entire film focuses on the legal secretary who finds leisure time, listens to music and writes a novel while working. These are his goals. You can't imagine the slap in the face is for the public when (halfway) they discover that he had a job that fits all three criteria, but then he gives it! The director and screenwriter (Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth) completely remove the motivation of the public to empathize or even find amusing a protagonist who in the past has thrown away what he complains about for his lack. <br /> <br /> Apart from that great obstacle, secretive secret internal humor fails because they must be explicitly explained to the public whenever they happen. Without these aspects, the public would not have noticed anything particularly strange. Humor is effective only if it is not necessary to thoroughly explain to the public what is fun.
