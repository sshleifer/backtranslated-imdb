This movie is pretty awful, but I have some interesting information about it: <br /> <br /> It was shot in 1976 at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, as well as at the Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, Arizona . A good portion of the extras in the film are NAU drama students. I was a freshman there that year, a minister in the theater, but for some reason I didn't let myself get involved in the production. However, I knew many people who did and can provide this rather strange fact: <br /> <br /> There is a scene in this film in which two of the principal, as part of their ritual of hazing, must run naked in the woods. They are seen from behind in the film, doing just that. The fact is that those are not the actors at all but two guys I met from the theater department. The identity of these "stunt posteriors" will remain anonymous, at least on this site, unless they decide to "reveal" themselves!
