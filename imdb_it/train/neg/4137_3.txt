I have a high tolerance level for crap, so I couldn't wait to do it. He did not disappoint. Apparently based on Sheridan Le Fanu's classic Carmilla, she follows a father and daughter who hunts down a female vampire who, fortunately, travels with them. Then we have Santa Claus (or the general, as he likes to be called here) who runs on random zombies. Did I mention that there was a zombie epidemic? The dead are coming back to life, but no one seems too worried. We have zombi from a construction worker, zombie soldier and even student zombies of the Holy Trinity. Apparently, Santa is looking for his daughter who was turned into a vampire. Oh wait for there to be no vampires, the girl is in a madhouse and Carmilla is her nurse, or is she? The zombies are back and Santa is crazy. Lesbian sex, I like vampires and I like zombies but I especially like lesbian sex. Nothing like a simulated cunnilingus to make the juice flow. When will we see vampires fight against zombies? Is she a vampire or is she crazy? Or both? Is Carmilla a sexy sexy lesbian vampire or nurse? More cunnilingus, you can never have enough cunnilingus. The zombies of the Holy Trinity arrive. Chainsaw time !! More lesbian sex then the zombies kill and eat vampires. I guess the zombies won, didn't they? To track? Who needs a plot when you have lesbian vampires and schoolgirl zombies? And cunnilingus?
