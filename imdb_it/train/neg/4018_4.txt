This film is too skeletal. It's a low-cost movie (I hope!) That justifies it a little, but the lack of a decent cast and a full story hurts him too much. Phillips is quite credible in his role as a torn-off son of a wealthy family looking for himself (although his family is ... er ... well, a little too white ...), but the rest of the cast is clinging to straws. Any moment that has a potential is ruined by excessive melodrama, and there are * via * too many secondary plots (which is a clear sign of a lack of plot. They needed to be filled ...) I would not recommend this film to anyone who is neither a Phillips hard-core fan, nor one who has absolutely * anything * to do. 4/10.
