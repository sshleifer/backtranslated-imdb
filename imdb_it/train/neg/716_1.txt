This film is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is absolutely no plot, the gags are only for delays and there is absolutely nothing else that can make this movie worth seeing. In the whole film Fredi (oh my god, what a funny name he has) does not ask ONCE how he came from a plane in the middle of the earth. There are a lot of stupid and totally unpleasant characters whose names should look funny. for example. : Gandalf is called Almghandi, Sam is called Pupsi ... and so on. I didn't even smile once during the whole movie. The gags seem to be made by people whose IQ is negative. If you laugh when someone's coat is trapped in the door (this happens about 5 times), then this movie is maybe for you. Another funny scene: they try to guess the code word for a closed door (don't ask why, never ask "why" in this movie) and the code word is (ha ha): dung. So if you laugh at these examples you might like this movie. For everyone else: go to Youtube and watch "Lord of the Weed": it's much, much more fun.
