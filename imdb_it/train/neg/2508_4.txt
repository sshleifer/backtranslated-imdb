About time they released this film on DVD. I know some say WB is quick to release this movie because of The Dreamgirls movie. But how can you hasten the release of a movie that has been in your catalog since 1976. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with the DVD release of this film, no special features, no DD 5.1 sound. from WB, you can do much better than this. The audio and video quality of this film needs serious help. <br /> <br /> Seem WB has not devoted much time and attention to this film because it is a black film and my sales are right. They could have kept the CD which, by the way, doesn't have all the songs on the original CD. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this DVD for purchase. Yes, because it's a classic movie. But WB needs to add other special features. Take notes from other group films, The Five Heatbeats or The Temptation, you could only see the performance, and the sound on both is much, much, much better than this DVD.
