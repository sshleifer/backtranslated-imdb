Judging by the hype and other reviews on this site, I was ready for a fantastic horror movie focused on junkies. What I got was a complete shit focused on junkies. I wonder if there's another movie called "Kitchens" that these people reviewed? There are only 3 main characters, and none of them struck me as well written or well acted. In practice, the whole movie I just spent shook my head and marveled at the stupidity of these addicts. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Don't rent this movie. Rent "Cabin Fever" or some other decent horror film. Damn, rent "Mary Poppins"! Animated penguins are scarier and more convincing than anything found in "Kitchens".
