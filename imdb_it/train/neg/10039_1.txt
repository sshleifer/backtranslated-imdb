This movie is horrible. Acting is a litter box. No crying, no action, hopeless songs. Although the scenery is fantastic. I always wanted to go to Greece. <br /> <br /> However, as for Saif, you would expect a great performance, but he too has disappointed people. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar, recognized as the Bollywood pimp and Singhs voice. He was sensational in this film. Only for this performance, Filmfare should introduce another award. Toiletries reward for the worst performance. Among other things, the trophy should be a toilet seat. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor. First of all it is not comparable to his sister Karisma. In acting, in looks or in the body. Now she wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her. Enter this movie wearing bikinis, tank tops and shorts. I really wonder why Saif Ali Khan is leaving such a suit to his future wife. But he must have impressed some people dressed that way. And if you ask how, then consider that every man is having an erection by watching this movie. They are dreaming of having Kareena Kapoor in bed naked with a condom. Including me. Personally I think she dressed like a whore, but I really liked her. <br /> <br /> I'm forced to give it a 1/10, but I'd really give this movie at 0/10. An unrealized film.
