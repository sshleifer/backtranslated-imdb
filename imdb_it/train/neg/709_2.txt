This film was written so badly, direct and recited that it begs beliefs. It should be redone with a script, a director and a better casting service. The worst problem is acting. You have Jennifer Beals on one side who is lucid, professional and totally credible, and on the other hand, Ri'chard, who is sadly disconcerting and just jarring in this particular piece. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just as horrible as the slave who owns (and holds) a couple, even though both normally do a good job. The actors (and the director) should not have tried to make accents, are inconsistent and unbelievable. Much better to have focused on doing a good job in actual English. Casting is ridiculous. Because the children of an "African" merchant (therefore less socially desirable for the company gens de couleur) have been interpreted by actors with very pale skin, while Marcel, apparently socially desirable, has pronounced African traits, including an obviously dyed "fro" of blond? It is as if the casting directors did not take the trouble to read the script they are launching and to choose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse black actors. It's so strange! This could be a great film and should be redone, but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and qualified actors. There are many good actors out there, and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben would make an appropriate cast, a good script and a good direction.
