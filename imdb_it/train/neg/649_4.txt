OK, this movie was made for one reason and one reason TO MAKE MONEY !! The producers obviously didn't bother to kill a classic horror movie. I knew this movie would suck as soon as it would become a pg-13 how many pg-13 slashers movies turned out to be good? Is it like asking how many women have been on the moon? The answer is NONE !! The 1980 year-end dance was not a masterpiece, but certainly deserves to be recognized as a film that remains true to its genre and does not seek to be anything else. <br /> <br /> My problem with Prom night 2008 is the way the killer handles and I have 3 main problems with him .................... . <br /> <br /> 1) The way he escapes, he was locked up in a psychiatric institution and escapes through an air-conditioning outlet !! WHAT THE HELL? why would they have a conditioned air in the patient's room? Do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something? 2) His intentions are somewhat uncertain the killer wants all the main victims of the family and dead friends so that he can have everything for himself, he says he loves her but then he tries to kill her, so he wants to kill her do I love or simply rape her ?? 3) The killer is too good, how did he develop all his skills? He was a teacher, so in this scene where he kills the boyfriend of the main victims while he is basically asleep and she doesn't notice, all stupid 2 stars out of 10 terrible, silly, stupid horror film attempt
