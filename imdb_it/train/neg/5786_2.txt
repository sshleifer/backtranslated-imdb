When you look at this now and hear all the language here, it is surprising that this has been classified as "PG", but this is the evaluation system of the 70s for you. Peter Falk spits the name of the Lord in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this film! Yet few people consider it offensive, and certainly not the charlatans who make films or the people who "evaluate" them. <br /> <br /> The cast is a hint of how profane this film can be: Falk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino are not exactly actors they wouldn't find in "The Sound Of Music ". <br /> <br /> I like the robbery films and many films of director William Friedkin, but this script does not offer and has an excessive touch of "Sleazy" of the 70s, visually and audibly. For those who loved Falk in "Columbo" on TV, it must be shocking to hear him use as much swear words as in movies. This is far from the only case.
