The bad news is that it's still terrible. I gave it a 2 because occasionally some of this kitchy slapstick parody sounds really funny. <br /> <br /> It should be better than "Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker", and progress should be rewarded. Or maybe I was drinking heavily when I looked at it and felt generous. Whatever, "2" is. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that it's too fast. It takes elements from most of the key themes of Kill Bill I & II and fights the scenes, tears them apart, sends them down, dirty the dialogue and disqualifies all the chaos in about an hour of really terrible amateur video. <br /> <br /> You'd better smoke a lot of something powerful if you want to enjoy this. And bring this DVD back to the video archive in time! You would really hate yourself if you were to pay a delay.
