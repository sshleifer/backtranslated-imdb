At the end of "Dragon Heat", all I could think of was why I took the trouble to sit down for the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is interesting and that - in addition to Maggie Q - is what attracted me to the film in the first place. But I was always disappointed. The director and screenwriter Daniel Lee does not hold a comparison with the likes of John Woo, Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen. Lee is so wrapped up in his visual style - and I use this sentence in an incredibly casual way - that fills the film with completely useless black and white frames, frozen frames, slow motion, fast movement and other visual nonsense. I suppose he did all this to make up for the lack of a good story or dialogue. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are nothing special and perform like a hopping music video more than anything else. There is little to worry about any of the characters - including two alleged professional snipers who could not hit the wide side of a barn from the inside! - which are then loaded with some of the most saccular dialogues I've seen in one of these Hong Kong actors. <br /> <br /> The plot is devoid of twists - from the initial set-up, everything takes place predictable fashion - and Lee feels the need to keep reminding us of the past stories of the characters in case we didn't have the first several times. This is a terribly amateur script and film and wastes the talent of Sammo Hung, Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. However, to be honest, I have trouble remembering that Biehn is in a good movie that was not directed by James Cameron. <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood for a great Hong Kong actor, it's much better to stick to some of the main points: "The Killer" (1989) and "Hard-Boiled" by John Woo ( 1992), "City on Fire" by Ringo Lam (1987) - which Quentin Tarantino stole for "Reservoir Dogs" (1992) - or his remake "Point Blank" (1967), "Full Contact" (1992). Or, take a look also at "So Close" by Yuen (2002), an extremely funny but absurd popcorn movie. And there is always the terrifying French police officer, "The Nest" (2002). <br /> <br /> True, many, if not all, are a bit exaggerated, but they were films that remain exciting, thrilling and even full of suspense. They have characters that we care about and amazing action sequences. <br /> <br /> "Dragon Heat", on the other hand, is terribly mediocre. The problem is that Lee didn't make a bad action movie, he made a boring one.
