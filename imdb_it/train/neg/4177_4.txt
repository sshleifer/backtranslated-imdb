Second film in the casket. Originally titled Bloodsuckers, this film was pretty average. It's a bit boring in some parts, but there are some gore effects, but they're not great either. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the year 2210. Vampires have practically conquered the whole world. The V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) team, which also has its own spaceship and is led by Churchill, which is captured by vampires, receives a message from an Earth and the team, formed by Quintana (played by the very hot Natassia Malthe), rookie Damian and the rebels Rosa and Roman (the Roman is played by Aaron Pearl from Wrongfully Accused). V-SAN later meets with vampire leader Muco, played by Total Recall's Michael Ironside. He has no intention of living in peace with humans, for he is determined to dominate the world. <br /> <br /> Although this film was not a waste of time, I doubt that I will return to the DVD player at any time.
