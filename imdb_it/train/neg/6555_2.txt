So the other night I decided to watch Tales from the Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson. O power, passion, murder as it is called in the Netherlands. When I bought the film I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was the protagonist and I thought she should say something about quality. Unfortunately no. <br /> <br /> 1) The plot of the film is really confusing. There are two narrative lines that run simultaneously during the film. Only they have nothing in common. Throughout the film I was waiting for the moment when these two stories would come together so the plot would be clear to me. But this is not yet the case. <br /> <br /> 2) The film's title says the film will be about Natica Jackson. Well it is, sometimes. As mentioned, the film is about two different stories and the part of Natica Jackson is the shortest. So another title for this film would not be a wrong choice. <br /> <br /> To conclude my story, I really recommend that you leave this film in its place, on the store shelf in a place that nobody can see it. This way you won't lose 90 minutes of your life, like I did.
