1 Â° looked at 18/06/2009 ?? 2 out of 10 (Dir-Pete Riski): strange psychotic film about a girl with autism who is tested in a hospital, the flashes of power, and then all hell breaks loose. Honestly, I'm not sure what the filmmakers' intentions were on this. What we get for the next hour and a half (at least it was not longer) was a horror / twilight / zombiefest / ghost movie that eventually made no sense until the end. Initially, after the power goes out, everyone is missing in the hospital except for a small group of misfits including the girl and her father. There is the typical annoying character, a creepy old man, and the typical tough guy similar to many scarefests and, of course, the girl the main character is attracted to. Casual things start to happen at various times like ghosts and monsters that appear, a hint that time has stopped and people have died while this small group tries to escape from whatever it is. Of course, the autistic girl is the center of everything in some way and I really hate how they used the affliction of this girl and insinuated that she was the cause and put her in a hospital where people are cared for is really lame. We never really found the answer to what was happening, which is very strange, so please avoid this dog. Unless you want to be scared and confused for an hour and a half, this is not for you or the viewer. What a waste of time ?? really !!
