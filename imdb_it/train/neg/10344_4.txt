I saw this movie shoot in the small hours on TCM. Several problems with the film were evident from what I saw. First, adults do not age when children have been doing for 10 years. Several parts of the film had continuity problems and for some reason the actor who played the younger son seemed the oldest when the 10 years passed. <br /> <br /> The copy I saw was missing about 20 minutes or so, at least a huge blank with the black screen appeared. It's a shame, because even though the script left something to be desired, Bergman and Russell both played the film well in their roles. It is a pity that the big piece is missing, but what is here is watchable. <br /> <br /> I just wish it were all intact. The script makes little sense in the fact that Bergman's character is sent away when the children are small, but is he then taken back to look after them when they are adults? Even some time lines don't make sense. There is a stock market crash that resembles 1929 but children grow up to fight in the First World War. All the acting of the support people in this film is fine. I just wonder what the gap in the movie was that I couldn't see because it was missing.
