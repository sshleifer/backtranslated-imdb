Yes, MTV is really a way to market Daria. What started as a distressing teenage anguish - "comments on everything that sucks and makes the viewer feel better about their teenage bloodsucker life" the sitcom has now turned into "how you should face your problems" I always looked at Daria and I love it. Now, sitting here after seeing the so-called "movie", I can only ask myself what was the point of all this. Does Daria tell us how to lead life in college? I'm sorry? did not make the point that Daria did in each episode that what you like to do is ok, as long as everything goes well with yourself, no matter what the rest of the sick and sad world thinks? The whole thing reminded me of the "Reality Bites" scene, the film channel shows the documentation for the first time.
