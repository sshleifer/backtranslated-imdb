This film is another example of the curse of East Asian cinema: two or more separate stories have been turned into a film. Obviously, other reviewers have also taken us up because there are several mentions on the "first part" and on the "second part". How can you have a character development or a deep storyline when the characters and the plot are present for so little time? I was enjoying the first part until he stopped abruptly (he didn't "finish", stopped in what appeared to be the center of the story) to be replaced by an incredible and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus on a girl who reorganizes and cleans a boy's apartment (wow!) I look forward to the day when Wong Kar Wai will be given a decent script to work with!
