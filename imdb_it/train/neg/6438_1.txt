I really didn't know what this movie was about when I went to the theater to see it (hype on Satanism etc etc) because the trailers of the last movie I saw were pretty interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh dear, Roman Catholic mythology? It's not my idea of ​​a good scare and honestly, I just felt like watching a really nice, scary movie, not a generic plot that tries to get an economic thrill by making a girl get bloody every few minutes ! <br /> <br /> I will try to stay away from spoilers (!), but I find it very strange that an atheist, who receives a beaded necklace from a dead priest, may suddenly end up with the wounds of Christ (they are not suppositories stigmata be profoundly religious ??) I mean, she goes out with losers, does loser things, behaves like a typical rebel and others, and here is showing the wounds of Jesus Christ ?? Come! <br /> <br /> Scenes from his crucifix, upside-down head, screams, blood everywhere, have become rather boring after seeing him a dozen times. It was neither scary nor scary, just repulsive. However, it became quite painful to watch - those blurry scenes were very annoying ... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: If you are Catholic, you defintly don't see it. If you're not, you still don't see it.
