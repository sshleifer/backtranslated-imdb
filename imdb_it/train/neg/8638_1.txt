Action, violence, sex and vulgar language are the things that the characters do during the whole movie. And all they do is done without reason. Mark L. Lester is (dis) known for his violent films (without reason) (Commando, The Base). The story is strange but stupid. Actors play their stupid characters very well ... I'm not saying they're stupid, but I mean they are very bad actors. It's another low-budget action movie from the B series. If you've seen something like Operation Delta Force, Drive, The Patriot, Sanctuary or something like these bad films of the same kind as Misbegotten ... don't rent it ... and, by the way, don't rent any of the films I mentioned ... I give 1 and a half su5.
