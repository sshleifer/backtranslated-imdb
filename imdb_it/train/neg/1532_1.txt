Although properly warned, I sat down to watch this movie. Partly because usually every movie gives me a break and because I thought a single movie couldn't be that bad. I'm correct. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks. Only once, during this humor abandoned in parody, did I laugh. That is to say during the scene of Simon says. The other jokes are badly executed or simply trivial. And some of them actually see it coming a mile away. This movie has just what it takes to be a good parody like Airplane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III), or Scary Movie. Everyone had amusing gags, B. good dialogue and more important than all the unforgettable quotes of C. Men in white has none of the above. To call this film bad would be a gross euphemism. AVOID THIS FILM ALL YOU YOU CAN! CONSIDER TO YOUR GOOD!
