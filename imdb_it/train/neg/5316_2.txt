Throw this lame dog a bone. So bad ... you can still watch it. Kol (Ross Hagen) is an evil intergalactic who escapes from being vaporized by a zealous spaceship commander (Jan-Michael Vincent). Kol manages to steal a shuttle that crashes on Earth. An unstoppable android assassin is sent to bring the wicked back alive or dead. John Phillip Law plays a forest / park ranger who urges caution in treating these two visitors from far away. The costumes are outrageous and the script lacks intelligence. Vincent definitely took the money and it worked. The law shows the only sign of effort. Too bad it's almost comical. Still in the cast: Dyana Ortelli, P.J. Soles and Dawn Wildsmith.
