My comments could be a bit of a spoiler, for what it's worth. Stop now if you care enough ... <br /> <br /> Saving Grace should have been titled "A subtle excuse for older British women to have a big screen". This movie is stupid. Incidental music is a nuisance, as are the obvious and banal melodies that occasionally jump to comment on the narrative ("Spirit in the Sky", for example - Oh, I understand!) This is basically a Cheech and Chong movie made believable by his heavy English environment and the overwhelming force of Brenda Blethyn to inflict emotions on an audience using only her voice. I could literally hear people in the High Times magazine getting their jollies on the huge "buds" that cover this image. Worst scene? Easy. Brenda tries to pass off her illicit articles on the London road with a white jumpsuit at full volume. Not funny. Not original. Not interesting. It's not a good movie. The evaluation 7.2 is the result of an excess of votes by the Zealots. Do not waste time ...
