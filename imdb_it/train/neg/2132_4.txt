This film has tried to be too many things all at once: pungent political satire, Hollywood blockbuster, a saccharine romantic comedy, family values ​​promo ... the list goes on and on. It failed miserably to all of them, but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end. <br /> <br /> Although I appreciate the spirit behind WAR, INC., it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort, especially when it is taken by its goals to reflect the lack of a serious criticism, rather than simply the bad writing, direction and production of this particular film. <br /> <br /> There is a criticism to be made about the corporatization of war. But making fun of it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening. It reminds me a little of TRE RE, which similarly trivializes a real cause for concern.
