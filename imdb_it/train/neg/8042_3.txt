The secret is ... this movie is blowing. Sorry, but he did. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> In this nasty riff on I KNOW WHAT I DID THE LAST SUMMER AND SCREAM, Beth, played admirably by Dorie Barton, joins several friends on a spring trip. The group rents a luxury home and tries to enjoy a fun vacation. So the deaths begin. First one then the other then another of the friends is killed, leading to a sad and banal climax with predictable results. <br /> <br /> A note, Dorie Barton is Reese Witherspoon of the poor ?? she looks like Reese, behaves like Reese and could pass for Reese in a police line. Maybe that's how they chose it? Anyhoo, the decent cinematography and the right acting are not able to compensate for the bad dialogue and the terrible writing.
