What happens to Robert "Pretentious" Altman? Was he saving on lighting? Everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was ridiculous. I mean, have you ever seen a law firm where everyone works by candlelight? <br /> <br /> Don't waste time. In fact, don't waste time on anything that Altman does: it's all a pretentious waste of movies.
