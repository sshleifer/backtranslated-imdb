I'm trying to decide if jumping into a wooden chopper would be more fun than this dreck. The destruction of what was once a classic movie couple ends. With Jedi, Menace, Clown and Sith we have the death of Lucas' career. Do you want us to swallow the fact that Annakin is an absurdity of Vader? I never believed it was true. This film confirms these feelings. The story didn't work from Phantom Moron, and every new movie just piled up the shit until only a parade of toys remained. I have to go. I know where the new stones are to launch. Do you want spoilers? They arrive. Luke and Leia are NOT related. Vader is NOT their father. Duke Countoo would have had to change position while he could still. Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra. His advice has never been good to anyone. Obi Wan lied to Luke for the first two films. Annakin did not create C3P0. He found it in the desert and lied to his mother to put it back together from scratch. Chewbacca has fleas. This whole mess with Vader and the fall of the Republic can be blamed for that stupid amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If she had a brain, she would not have returned to Annie's light year, but she had said to do what George Lucas had written for her. What a drug!
