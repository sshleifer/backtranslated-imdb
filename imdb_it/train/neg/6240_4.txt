A suggestion that I think can be gathered from the various comments on this thread. <br /> <br /> I was rather surprised by the number of people who liked this movie that want to make it "mandatory" or "mandatory". <br /> <br /> I think this gives us some insight into why this movie and the underlying problem is so polarizing. <br /> <br /> The problem of global warming attracts people who want to force others to "do well". It appeals particularly to more "liberal" people, because it has nothing to do with the morality of the bedroom, which is what conservatives usually want to force to "be good" to go. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem with the movie. Al Gore is a politician. And one of great success in this. He cannot help appealing to those people who want to force others to do what he wants. The political appeal is too big. <br /> <br /> And there remains a scientific question that can be of enormous importance, reduced to a political issue that is addressed to those who are in the political body with a predilection to force others "to do well". <br /> <br /> Another interesting question is how did the hijacking of the environmental movement to these people?
