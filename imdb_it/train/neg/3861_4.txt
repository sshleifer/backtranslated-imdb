I'm not a big fan of rom / com at the best moments. Some have been pretty good (Dream for a Insomniac check), but that's just about the same. <br /> <br /> With a run time of 100min, I expect more than 1 laugh every 30 minutes. The only real belly laugh is when strangers and male friends instinctively help Lee's character. <br /> <br /> All I can say is AVOID. The gaurentee there are at least 10 other films on the shelf that deserve you $ 3 <br /> <br /> out of 10 (And just because I'm a big fan of Lee)
