Marilyn Miller made only three films before her premature death - the wonderful SALLY (1929), the comedy HER MAJESTY LOVE (1931) and this nonsense - SUNNY (1930). He is rather poor both as a first talkie and as a musical attempt - although he has four dance numbers, he sings only two songs (WHO? E ONE MAN ALONE). The rest of the soundtrack including the song's track is discarded, although we can hear the latter in the background score. Miller looks overweight and amateur here - no stellar quality. Even his dances are overwhelming. The film is written very badly, a stock full of jokes stale and joking and stupid situations. If you are interested in Miller as an artist, take a look, but for general entertainment, stay away.
