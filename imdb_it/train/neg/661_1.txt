All right. So I just got back. Before starting my review, let me tell you something: I wanted this film to appeal to me. I know I've been negative in the past, but I was hoping to be surprised and actually liked the movie. I did not. <br /> <br /> It's not just the fact that every imaginable horror cliché is in this. Isn't it just the fact that they do every little thing in a fright to jump (walking on a baseball bat left on the floor? Are you kidding me?). It just wasn't scary. One thing that surprised me: there was more blood than I thought there would be ... which is not saying much. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Donna left by Lisa's mother to her House. She enters ... goes upstairs. The camera rotates on his dead father on the sofa. Frightening. Go upstairs, where the scene of the aforementioned baseball bat happens. Find his brother on his bed, apparently dead (how could he say that? He didn't have a drop of blood on him). Killer arrives, Donna hides under the bed, her mother dies. He runs out screaming for help. Killer behind her: "I did it for us." Cut to the therapy session. This confused many people - everyone asked if his family had actually died or if he had imagined it - and she mentioned how the nightmares started coming back. The Filler dialog follows. <br /> <br /> Keep the chase ready. A few scenes at the salon, they go to the hotel. Obviously the killer is already there (for some reason, he ran away 3 days ago but the police / family have not been informed until he is already there). It follows a further filling. <br /> <br /> I will not talk about what happens in the film, because I don't want to ruin it too much. If you want to know who dies, Horror_Fan has already done a post. But on the issues of death: they weren't so exciting. The people in the theater actually laughed out loud (an experience I never had before in a horror movie, not even in When A Stranger Calls) during many of them. One in particular: the bus guy who gives the most exhilarating "scared" face I've ever seen. The only blood death was Lisa's, and it was rather poor. His throat is torn, blood (if you can even call it - it was almost black) splash on the tent thing. The only other blood was on Claire when we see her body. Apparently, Fenton decided to stab her a few times after choking her. Um, okay? The film was one of the most clichés I've ever seen. Let's see here .. mandatory near-mirror-curtain-BOOM! scene. Check. Twice, actually (you could say they were fighting). Mandatory back-up-in-killer. Check. There's also the back-up-in-lamp scene, but you've all seen it. Oh, you say you want a scare that flies away? Well, you understand! (Yes, they managed to incorporate one of those in here). And, of course, the we-have-security-on-all-ex-but-he-still-fused scene. I must go on? I could. <br /> <br /> Anyone who said the characters weren't stupid, are you kidding me? "Oh, even if the huge alarm is sounding, literally saying PLEASE TAKE THE BUILDING, and 3 of my friends are missing, I will go upstairs to get my shell." These characters were some of the most spoiled and stupid characters ever. The only nice character - Lisa - made one of the most stupid moves in the film. "Oh, I just realized that the psychotherapist is here, I have to leave my strong boyfriend to run away from me to warn her! Oh, shoot, the elevator is about to slow down? I suppose I'll take the stairs and escape the yard!" Ugh. At the end of the film, everyone deserved to die. The only death to which someone felt remorse was Donna's fiancé (I can't even remember her name - is it so ugly?), And at that moment the audience was completely drained by this poor and cliché movie. <br /> <There were some positive aspects: the acting was good for the most part, and it was well shot. But that's all. <br /> <br /> I would give it a 1/5, and it's generous. Just for the laughter (and believe me, the public had some), and Brittany Snow. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the reaction was very bad. Very ugly. People were whistling after the movie was finished and the buzz after was very negative. Expect bad legs for this.
