Yesterday I saw the movie Flyboys and my girlfriend told me it was the worst movie I've ever seen ... Since I thought it was horrible enough, it made me think: what was the worst movie I had ever seen and this was the only one film that came to mind. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a couple of years have passed since I saw it, but I remember the horribly miscible Dean Cain as a conceited military man (the handsome boy Cain doesn't do it very well). The strange agreement with the CGI helicopter when it would probably be cheaper to rent a helicopter than to hire some CGIs to make it, but my guess is that they found the helicopter as a free sample for some CGI program or the producer's son liked play with your new computer. And how did it seem ?? Terrible. And when the dragon loads through the corridors of the complex and then reuses the same shots over and over - it looks VERY cheap. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie - it's really terrible ...
