This film has little to recommend it, although for the little that is the breathtaking scenery, the cinematography and the direction of the wild life, it is difficult to raise its weaknesses in the company of such enthusiastic reviews. It is these things, however, that make the disappointment of a satisfying storyline and its execution so disappointing. <br /> <br /> I saw this with my children and none of us was too impressed by the end. Yes, the images were fantastic, the wide landscapes through the forest and the magnificent mountains, but what was happening in the foreground? The rather boring narrative of the stupidity of an insipid girl who learns all too slowly a basic lesson about being friends of nature - and goes away quite easily given the curriculum of that kind of thing. It is certainly not a new story, in fact there is nothing remotely new in the way it is told, and we have seen it before, and, indeed, much more eloquently by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. <br /> <br /> The only thing that can really be drawn from this film is the feeling of how to work with these wonderful lenses and the lighting of the forest; the rest is a waste of time.
