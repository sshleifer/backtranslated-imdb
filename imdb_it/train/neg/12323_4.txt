As many people agree, Origin is a beautiful artistic soul. The music, the graphics and the created world are wonderful and really lies above most other modern animated works. However, if you are looking for more than this, then I suggest you look elsewhere. Beauty is interrupted by its appearance, and when it really comes to plot and characters, there is nothing special. The action is slow and minimal and people are flat, sometimes insignificant, and do not act realistically. Not to mention the hole in the plot here and the hole in the plot there ... So, in summary, oh my God, I've never seen a beautiful anime like this; and oh my god, it's like ... -poke- people don't behave like that. It took a giant step forward in graphics and music in anime, but it also took a few steps backwards in moments of bad characterization and, unfortunately, there's not even much action to compensate for this ...
