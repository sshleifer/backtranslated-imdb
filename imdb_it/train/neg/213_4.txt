Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. A love biangle, (sorry for the poetic license, but it's not a triangle!) An interesting story, unfortunately badly told. The image is sometimes strange, sometimes OK, the image appears crowded and short-sighted. Sound needs more attention (usually in Romanian films), light and color filters are sometimes poorly chosen. The soundtrack is short and does not help the action. Regarding acting ... sorry but the best actress is the hostess. The others act immature and fail to convince the viewer. Acting is poetic when it should be realistic and realistic when it should be poetic. It is a picture for adults, told by children. Disturb only if extremely curious.
