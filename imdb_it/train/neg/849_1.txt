A star. This is all that this documentary deserves. I didn't feel disappointed watching a movie, let alone a documentary, in a while. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of the "Walking With ..." series, including Nigel Spin-off by Marvin, for all their fun and informative information. And although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me almost as much as other prehistoric creatures, the subject is still interesting and unique to explore. After seeing all the other documents in the series, I thought that I should also see this, especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places. <br /> <br /> Good for those of you who have done a good review of this doc ... what were you thinking ?! lol. <br /> <br /> Although the information they were able to obtain was interesting, the presentation failed in any other way possible. It had a terrible flow, it was incredibly blurry in what it was trying to say (with scrambled and sometimes misplaced information), horrible effects (which include the few moments of CGI and especially the effects of make-up) and excessive use of style MTV photo effects. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the effects of the make-up, a reviewer here mentions how ridiculous the scene is when the cavemen come across this giant monkey and how it looks a lot like a 70s man-in-dress horror movie . Well, there are a lot of moments like the one where the people who portrayed the monkey men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous. None of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions. <br /> <br /> The worst part of all is that none of these are shown in an interesting or dynamic way, or seem distantly real. It doesn't even seem to have been taken seriously. Furthermore, there was no emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had. Remember the episode of "Walking With Dinosaurs" of the fate of Ornithochirus (sp?)? That episode still makes me cry every time I look at it. It is this kind of involvement with the subject that is missing here most of all. When you are more involved in the subject and in his personal history, even in what is only speculation, you worry more about the facts surrounding him. <br /> <br /> The only saving graces of this production are the pretty good narrative (at least in the BBC version I saw) and the music. Otherwise, don't even worry about renting it, unless you want to have a good laugh (which I did frequently, but usually followed by rolling eyes). This does not belong to the shelf together with the other "Walking With ..." documents. <br /> <br /> And does it make sense to learn that this document was NOT produced or directly involved with the same people who have others in the series? Hmmm ...
