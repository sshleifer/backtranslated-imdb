My 7-year-old daughter loved it, as Disney executives cruelly calculated that she would do it. This is the problem with "Air Buddies". It is a strictly numerical children's film, full of a carefully calculated sweetness, a politically correct morality and enough humor to avoid the dreaded vote G. As a parent, or even as a 10-year-old, you have already seen everything before and done better before. Think "101 Dalmatians meet alone" and get the general idea. I am of the opinion that a good story for children is a good story, period. "Air Buddies", which is as original as recycled paper, fails to meet this standard. It's not the worst video your child can watch, but there are megatons of the best ones.
