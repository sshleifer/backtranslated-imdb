OK, I've been a big Black fan for a long time and I was DISGUSTOS after watching this movie. Let's name the problems ... First this movie has a lot of the same crew that the first two had. It was also called PREQUEL to the original Black Stallion. Why can't they get the name of the Shetan dam or its color? In The Black Stallion Returns, we learn that Sagr was the mother of Black's CHESTNUT and in this film she is a gray mare name Jenny?!?!?!?!? WTF? And it's set in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I could be wrong, but the first was set in the 40s and even when the ship's wrecks. The time line doesn't seem quite right. Also, first of all, there is a Frisian at the beginning of the film that should be Shetan's father ... after a further warning it appears to be a gelding. Ben Ishaak is the only character who has been able to make this film seem related to the previous two in any way. It could be a cute family movie for some, but it's my biggest movie disappointment of the year.
