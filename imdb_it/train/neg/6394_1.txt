This film was bad. This film was horrible. The acting was very bad. The setting was unrealistic. The story was absurd: a comet that appears once in eons should appear one night. Most of the world population has decided to look at this comet. Then, the next morning, all but a small group of people were turned into dust by the radiation of the comet. People's clothes are still intact, there are plants that are still alive, but people have been turned into dust. No bones, nothing. It's ridiculous. How can radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact? <br /> <br /> Even better, the comet has changed some people into flesh zombies who ate monsters. Their make-up wouldn't even look scary for a newborn baby. The Insane Clown Posse scares me the most ... and they should look stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there were the survivors. The people who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared zombies and death. How can steel block the radiation from a comet that incinerates people on their tracks? <br /> <br /> Equally insulting is the horror music of the 60s that plays in the background through parts of the film, or the 80s rock that serves no purpose to the film and makes you want to shoot yours television. <br /> <br /> The most stupid part of the film, however, are the characters it focuses on: two Valley Girls and Chakotays from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally unrealistic. Who would go to loot the day after an apocalypse with meat that ate mutants that ran everywhere? There were four 5-minute horror scenes throughout the film, and most of them were dreams. Among these scenes there is an unsophisticated dialogue that makes South Park look smart. The silence between elementary dialogue was painful. I could have made a better movie with four monkeys and lots of Cheetos. Never see this movie, ever.
