Warning! Spoiler! <br /> <br /> This is your typical Disney movie. <br /> <br /> 1.Ptictically, correct what with the adoptive house that has a uniform division of races. <br /> <br /> 2. Insult the intellect of the spectators with its simplistic lines. <br /> <br /> 3. The mellifluous father of the boy is taken almost directly from the infinite story 2. <br /> <br /> 4.In a world full of crime, disarmament, corruption, hunger and of other principles that must be taken into consideration, only a losing team deserves a divine intervention.UGHHHH !!! <br /> <br /> 5. Did you know that angels don 'like to swear ?! Where the hell he came from! <br /> <br /> 6. To help the team, the angel causes pain and humiliation to the opposing team. Really very angelic! <br /> <br /> 7. The team the angels are helping are called ... you can guess ... THE ANGELS! Disney at its worst! <br /> <br /> 8. "I just got his training wings." Brilliant line! <br /> <br /> My conculsion: I didn't like it at all.
