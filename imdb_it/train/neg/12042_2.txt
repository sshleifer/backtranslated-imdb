To confess to having fantasies about Brad Pitt is a rather tough admission for a heterosexual. But what can I tell you? Perhaps that famous extra is something that everyone talks about and turns a star into a star. Cross that barrier. It takes you into an unknown sensual and emotional territory. Brando had it in spades, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean and, more recently, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. The women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and very recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt alone redefined the concept. He is the only reason to go out, get in the car, find parking, buy a ticket, popcorn and enter a theater to see "Troy". If you liked the "Jupiter's Darling" style poems you could enjoy this. But if you don't, go anyway, we want to keep Brad Pitt in business.
