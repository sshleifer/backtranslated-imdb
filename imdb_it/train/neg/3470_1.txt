Like most Ben Affleck movies, the play is dry and the plot is predictable. This is if you want to call this a story. Many points remained connected without any thought. I want to thank the director for not having explained the points better. I say this because that would mean that torture would last longer. As with all Ben Affleck's failures, this is no exception and has survived only by the other actors. Even then, acting for the most part was invented and not credible. The journey in memory with actors I had not seen for years was not worth the admission price. Everyone thought they had to be told, they too are rapidly joining the "fact" ranks. My choice was to wait for my car to be repaired or watch this movie. I made the wrong decision. All in all, I would like to give him a laugh ... especially because it's all I got out of it.
