Mike Brady (Michael Garfield who had a tiny part in the classic "The Warriors") is the first person in the community to realize that there are killer snails in his small town. Not just some snails, mind you, but carnivorous killer bigger than normal, changed from toxic waste slugs (which still only go as fast as a normal snail, which is not scary, but I digress). No one will believe him sooner or later, but they will. Oh yes, they will. <br /> <br /> Ok, the killer snails are right above the psychotic sloths and right under Johnathon Winters like Mork's child in the creepy factor. So the absurdity of all this is completely evident from the beginning. The film is pretty funny and is of the "so bad that it's good" variety. I appreciate that they explained that this was Slugs: the film in contrast to Slugs: the Children's Game or Slugs: the Other White Meat. Probably not worthy to watch it more than once and promptly forget it except to play a rather obscure trivia game. Director Juan Piquer Sim√≥n is best known for his previous films "Pod People" (which MST3K deservedly derided) and "Peices" (which is probably the ugliest film ever made) <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Rose shows T&A <br /> <br /> My Grade: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: just a theatrical trailer for this movie
