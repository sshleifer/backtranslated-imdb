Sly Stallone is certainly not the best actor in the world, but compared to his brother, Frank ... well, bring out those prizes now! Mullet with hair, muppet Frank seems to think that every part he plays calls him to play the role of a wise American / Italian refugee from the "Godfather". Please, someone makes him a recitative offer "can refuse!" This film sucks, even if the terrible overwhelm of this film, Frank continues to steal the actors. All the people compensate for their lack of talent by shouting their lines and throwing their arms around, wildly gesturing in a style that went out of fashion again with silent films. <br /> <br /> The plot, what is it, is, it makes no sense when a meteor lands and turns all women into sex-crazy nympho, but since this is a certified film, it simply means that they get naked in underpants and emit whining sounds like dogs in heat. What happens in the end, I'm not quite sure why I was losing the desire to live long before the movie ended. <br /> <br /> Avoid this like the plague and watch "Deep Impact" for a reasonable movie on a meteor that is about to hit the earth. <br /> <br /> NB Order point: when one of the women is wearing strips in underpants, she has underpants under suspenders / garters, underpants over the suspenders to allow women to go to the bathroom with less fanfare. A trivial point, perhaps, but it shows how stupid this movie is when they can't even do it right!
