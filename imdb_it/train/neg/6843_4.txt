A rather interesting black and white sketch of exploitation written by David F. Friedman. Lead actress Stacey Walker is well represented and strangely attractive. Looks like a derelict Renee Zellweger with a bad hairstyle. This girl made only two of these films and then returned to Texas. The music is terrible. One of his boys is played by Sam Melville (from the television program THE ROOKIES) with a different name. <br /> <br /> The best line in Tony's movie - "Are you putting me up, doll? None of my chicks put me up." Good black and white photography by Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS and many others). Good places (fresh pool, also used in THE DEFILERS). Strange final but suitable. A 4 out of 10. The best interpretation of Stacey Walker.
