They had such a potential for this film and they completely fell. In the first cruel intentions, we wonder what drove the protagonists to become the way they are and act like they do. In this prequel there is hardly any kind of character development. In reality it is a very sad story but this film did nothing for me. It was as if they had left out a good script instead of the unnecessary keywords. And the end makes absolutely no sense and explains nothing. The writing was simply terrible. Another thing that bothered me is that they used to lease 3 of the SAME SAME lines that were in the original. Like "down boy", or the kissing scene, and some others I can't remember. I wasn't at all impressed by Robin's acting, but Amy did a great job. This is the only thing that has reconciled this film.
