Well, everything has been said about this film and I hate it when I write reviews where everyone else has already said what needs to be said. But the thing is, I've seen millions of movies and I'm working to write reviews on all the movies I've seen. So, I have to write something. <br /> <br /> Acting is stupid. He is really stupid as the news anchor expresses his sadness at the plane crash. The nun is pretty and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child. the three main murders of the film are so weak that you wonder how stupid the creators of this film can be. They do not realize that scams can still be scary. We do not see how grandfather is killed. The dentist and his assistant made me feel that they deserve to die, you just don't like them. And the uncle Tony in the garage dies in a way that could have worked better. We only hear him screaming and we see nothing!
