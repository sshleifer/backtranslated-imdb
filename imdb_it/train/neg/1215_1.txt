I don't often give reviews to a star, but the computer doesn't allow me to do negative numbers. <br /> <br /> The opening titles tell us that we are already in deep water. Although it is a low-cost film, there are 17 accredited producers. No. No. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story the abusive husband Kenneth returns home to his family in a high-level gated community. The house is a pigsty. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger) let the kids run all day. <br /> <br /> OK. We are already in deep water. Mrs. Basinger was 55 when the movie came out. Uh, are these your children or grandchildren? It's Christmas Eve. A guide to the mall, a long scene that could have been cut. To bludgeon at home the idea of ​​male aggression eeeeeevil rampant in the universe, she drives over football players in full uniform playing in the pouring rain on Christmas Eve. Sure. For a bonus you see a vehicle with a slaughtered deer bound to it. <br /> <br /> We still have some suspense in the driving scenes. It is raining and the traffic is bad. First we see Della trying to drive and smoke at the same time. Then, later, Della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time, at some point turning completely to check the bulky back seat for the phone charger. <br /> <br /> Wander around the mall, see an old college friend, try to buy things but his credit card is rejected - oh God, maybe your husband is grumpy because he's going broke, but it's too much complicated for the script to follow. <br /> <br /> In the parking lot a lot will clash with the most ridiculous band in the history of the films. A white boy (Lukas Hass watching his career go to the bathroom), one black, one Asian and one Hispanic. Imagine a company of Up with People gone bad and you will get the idea. <br /> <br /> Even if they have a gun, she gives them the aptitude. A policeman from the mall comes to investigate the ruckus and shoot him in the head, firing more than once. Parking is as crowded as it can be, people everywhere and no one notices. <br /> <br /> Della flees into his car and rather than choosing a well-lit police station or safe area, he drives to a construction site, where he kills all four bad boys one at a time simply with the tools ( literally) at hand. <br /> <br /> The MAJOR spoiler forward. <br /> <br /> Go home. The car jumps out so you walk through the pouring rain. Check the kids, go downstairs, and when the husband asks petulantly what brought him to the mall he shows him the gun and shoots him point-blank. <br /> <br /> The experience with the four punks was to translate into personal empowerment for Della. Instead we know that his children will probably spend Christmas in foster care or in a group home, because the state will collect them while she responds to the murder of an accusation. The four punks can be classified as justifiable murders in self-defense. The husband, another story. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I saw it on cable. If you had seen him in a theater (was something released?) I would have been furious. As it is, I'm just sad to see talents like Mrs. Basinger and Mr. Haas wasting garbage like this. <br /> <br /> A very good thing, though. This was written and directed by Susan Montford. Mrs. Montford hasn't gotten another writing or directing credit since she passed this asshole. There is justice in the world.
