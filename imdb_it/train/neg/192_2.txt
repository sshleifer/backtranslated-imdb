The only positive part of this film is the beautiful scenery. This film was long and boring. The minister should have retired from the pulpit when his son Paul turned away from the teachings he had proclaimed. How many times could your boys invoke the name of the Lord in vain in this film of Presbyterian origin? That's no good. I wanted Paul to be swept down the river without a boat at first to spare us the silly, grimace, selfish story of Paul (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsive gambler that Norm wants to save but doesn't. It is very uninteresting. We see the prejudiced whites supported by Paul because of his native American girl. That was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been turned into a real "wild western". What we see is just a sleeping city where the minister's two sons have nothing else to do than 1. Normally they chase a lame girl and look after her family and 2.Paul invent silly stories at the newsagent while scratching their heads and taking a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies. I'd rather watch a show about fishing for that movie, which it will never be.
