There is a group of Fox TV executives sitting around a boardroom table wondering what new show to commission. <br /> <br /> 'What do you say we aim for something like 24 or The West Wing?' one of them says, but they all agree that it would be too expensive, and the cheap TV is less likely to damage the station if it falls. <br /> <br /> 'Well, how about bringing together some great comedy writers and making a quality sitcom?' offers another and is fired on the spot. "You don't know good writers cost a lot of money!" the big boss barks. "That's why we invented the TV reality." <br /> <br /> "We could do yet another criminal drama ..." suggests a man in a complete bland. "I'm listening ..." replies the chief, suddenly interested. "People like CSI, so we make another copy," Blandman adds. <br /> <br /> 'But there are already too many CSI clones out there, what can we do to bring out our own?' a naive young man asks and is fired instantly. 'Stands out! If we do, people might be confused! Let's give them more than what they already like! the great boss screams. <br /> <br /> 'Let's just add more violence and make it really creepy, after all we're Fox,' another dress suggests an exhaustive answer of 'now you're getting it', from the big boss. "We could make it the Unit for Deviant Crimes," he continues adding, clearly in a launch. <br /> <br /> "For Jupiter, it has it!" the big boss laughs, "and the victims could be beautiful and vulnerable women who wear very little on screen". "Well, this would definitely distract people from the mediocre plays and screenplays," says Blandman. <br /> <br /> 'So it's decided, we just need a name,' announces the big boss. "Could we call it Sex Cops Violence?" <br /> <br /> "Too literal, what about Killer Instinct? transmits violence, but it sounds a bit like Basic Instinct that had a lot of sex." <br /> <br /> 'Puuurfect', the big boss responds and then they slap each other and go and cancel the arrested development.
