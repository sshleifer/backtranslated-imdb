I saw this movie at Sundance 2005 and I was amazed at how bad it was, even though based on the catalog description I was excited to see it. Presumably a "mockumentary" of two high school students making a documentary on high school life, he acted in bad deeds, bad direction, completely devoid of characters as engaging in writing, and all around is a total failure. I love good films about high school, and this is not one of them. The characters are one-dimensional and knowingly "cool" even though they should be rejected. You have the general impression of a group of people sitting around making a deliberately bad film to show their friends, yet somehow it has arrived at Sundance. Mystifying.
