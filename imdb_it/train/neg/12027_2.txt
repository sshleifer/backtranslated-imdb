I saw this movie in the middle of the night, while I was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else to look at. It's one of those movies where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment! - but after twenty minutes he realizes that you can't turn it off, no matter how ugly it is. One of those movies that is in the midst of being so bad is good and so bad it is, well, simply BAD, it's worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that they're both! Excellent half-price rate, if only for the fabulous resistance to tennis. Don't even bother to ask yourself why no one can say that Chad Lowe is so obviously male, because logic does not apply.
