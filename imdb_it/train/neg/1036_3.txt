Ho-hum. The fatal biological weapon of an inventor (Horst Buchholz) risks falling into the wrong hands. Unbeknownst to him, his son (Luke Perry) has always worked in animation. Join the CIA agent Olivia d'Abo and start chasing and shooting the cat and mouse in the car. Also in the cast are Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and an old Roger Moore. Moore seems to barely move in this mess, certainly not one of his best efforts. Perry fans will accept. d'Abo was wrong for the role, but it's nice to see.
