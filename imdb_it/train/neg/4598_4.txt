The wife of a theater producer from London hopes to fix the American man of song and dance, the protagonist of her husband's last show with an acquaintance, an American girl who makes her live as a model in society circles. Unfortunately, the couple has already met alone, with the girl who thinks the boy is actually the producer of the show married to her friend (the fact that she doesn't wear a faith should have discouraged any misunderstanding!). The Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical is finally dragged to earth by Dwight Taylor and the idiotic script by Allan Scott, which is full of youthful behavior. Astaire and Rogers don't just "meet nice" - they meet in a ridiculous way (he taps like crazy in the hotel suite above his and complains). The 1935 public probably didn't care about the way these two would come together - as long as they did, and happily. Seen today, the central characters seem to have no motivation to end up in each other's arms: he makes her fly with flowers (after telling his friend that he wants to remain "free fantasy" in the love department) and she gives the green light. Nothing that a little dance can't cure! This glamorous pair is deliberately unreal as are the settings of London and Venice, but we look simply because the protagonists are Fred and Ginger. It's a fantasy for the poor, those who don't care about the stupid plot. The musical moments break the monotony of the artificial scenario, but fail to transcend the surrounding stupidity. ** from ****
