This thriller produced on TV is all talk, little action. He works hard to set the twisted plot, yet the script is so confusing that the exposure is still at its most murky. In the end, I didn't know about these characters anymore than I did in the beginning. He has a scenario of almost "Ten Little Indians", but leaves him halfway in favor of highlighting Sally Field and his discovery of a killer. The camp manages to overwhelm you here with an awkwardness that I rarely saw from you. The first introductions are good, but the writing quickly moves away from the field and eventually goes beyond the lines. A lot of hysteria, and constant thunder and lightning effects (which adds nothing). A curious failure of the producers Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg. With all this talent, couldn't they give us anything more than a script full of fake strings and Sally Field hidden in a closet?
