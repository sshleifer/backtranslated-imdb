I only lasted 15 minutes before self-preservation pulled me out of amazement by drooling my eyes that this film induced me effortlessly and pushed me to scream again at the bear-armed video store. <br /> <br /> To say that the film was bad would have been a lost opportunity to use words interspersed with characters from the keys on top of my keyboard (just to keep these comments clean). <br /> <br /> To be avoided. <br /> <br />
