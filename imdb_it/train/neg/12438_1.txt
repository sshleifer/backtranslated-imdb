Beat the bad guys ... Once again it is the demarcation line of this film, it reveals so much truth. <br /> <br /> Home Alone one and two, classic films. Home Only three and four, a good movie if you are three! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, as difficult as trying to be funny, it's not. Culkin is replaced by Alex D'Linz or something else. He is a very bland actor with sweet shows, but it's not all his fault, the writing required a mild vocabulary and bland expressions. The jokes are copied from the first two with different scammers, and you should be blind to think that chickenpox is real. A good choice if you are a kindergarten teacher who is showing this film on a rainy day. And to make things worse, a totally different cast, go and see if you don't believe me, but you'll regret it.
