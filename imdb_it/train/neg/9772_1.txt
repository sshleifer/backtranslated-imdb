Only too many episodes of violence. <br /> <br /> The film moves from one scene to another, and in almost all the violence breaks out. <br /> <br /> Now I am not one who is shocked by violence and for me a film without a fight has something missing. But please, not one after the other. My reaction was not shock or horror, it was: "Here we are again". There is a semblance of a story between the scenes of violence, but two-thirds of the film is completely turned off and I couldn't wait for the end. <br /> <br /> If this is the best the directors can do, they should find something else to do with their miserable lives, like making shoes or delivering mail.
