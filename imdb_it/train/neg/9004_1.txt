Nothing could have saved this film, not even Superman. Ten years ago the special effects would have been surprising. A better direction could have aroused more feeling and better performances by the actors. But nothing but feeding the script with a dragon could solve it. Trace holes, wrong lines, terrible rhythm, endless repetition of the same blows of a CGI dragon that tramples the corridors ... ugh. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br />
