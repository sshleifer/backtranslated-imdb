Well, after seeing this, I can say that it's not the worst movie ever made, yes, people are worse than this, there are some positive aspects of the film, you see drunk teenagers, they have horrible deaths, and rats from 'cute look they eat some scientific experiment, and that become grotesquely huge, the drunken janitor, the irritable doctor, and yes a girl in thong underwear who has absolutely no shame, dumb athletes, I could not personally wait for the rat to eat these stupid drunk, I was rooting for the mouse in my spare time, had a good premise, the first part of the film, it was interesting with the scientific explanation of rats and little past history, but I think it's ruined when stupid teenagers come into play horny drunk, the rat in my opinion, the one who gets lost, his name is Brenda, he was so fake, he must have been a rat, he looked like a boy dressed in a chaste dress ro, this was pretty schlocky, lame ,, but not quite horrible ,,
