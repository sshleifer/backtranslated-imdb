"A trio of treasure hunters is searching for the hidden fortunes in the West Indies. The call of gold creates an increase in tension as men approach the treasure position. Deep-water divers hope to trace gold, but find that greed and hatred lead to murder ", according to the synopsis of the DVD cover. "Manfish" is the name of their boat, not a monster. The skeleton that gives the muscular captain John Bromfield (like Brannigan) his half of the treasure map is very good. Old salt Victor Jory (as a professor) provides the other half of the map. The first officer Lon Chaney Jr. (like Swede) plays stupid, and the sexy Tessa Prendergast (like Alita) protects the rum (not very well, of course). Serious editing and continuity problems are not allowed, which otherwise could have been equivalent to something. <br /> <br /> *** Manfish (2/56) W. Lee Wilder ~ John Bromfield, Victor Jory, Lon Chaney Jr.
