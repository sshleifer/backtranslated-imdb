Anyone who can find ransom value in this piece of shit should have his head examined. We have a submissive wife, dependent on heroin, part-time, with lacerations all over her body, lacerations received from repeated beatings by a violent son. Now he is spraying mother's milk all over the kitchen floor, so the release has grown somewhat similar to Helen Keller putting her hands in running water. We have the husband who starts with the condescension of a prostitute who seems to be his daughter (she is angry with him because she arrived too quickly) and ends up killing her colleague, having sex with her corpse, and then cutting it. We have the child who is relentlessly bullied by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mother. See, it's all circular. Deep, eh? The only decent moment in this horrible tripe pile is when the father kills his son's torturers. It's a good thing that this turkey was shot on video because otherwise it would be a waste of expensive movies. If that guy who thinks artists should be interested in this slop is really serious, it's no wonder that most people think artists are crazy. We saw this awful movie, then we put on "Zero Woman, The Accused". Oh my God, it was a disapproval of what was worse. What's happening in Japan these days? Sick, sick, sick.
