Freeway Killer, is a madman who shoots people on the highway while screaming a group of mystical songs on a cell phone. The police believe he is a random killer, but Sunny, the blonde heroine, played by Darlanne Fluegel, detects a pattern. So does the former policeman, played by James Russo, and join forces and bodies in the search for the villain who eliminated their spouses. With Richard Belzer, this movie has its moments especially if you like car chases, but it's not a good movie for the most part, check if you're really bored and you've already seen The Hitcher, Joy Ride or Breakdown otherwise stay away from the 'highway.
