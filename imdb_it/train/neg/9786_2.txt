OK, I bought this Woolworths movie for my friend for a joke gift on his birthday, because the cover had a sexual allusion. <br /> <br /> But we decided to watch it anyway. Only for hilarity purposes. <br /> <br /> And I'm sorry, but this must be one of the worst films in history. <br /> <br /> It all started well, and we thought "Ok this could actually be OK". But after about 10 minutes, we were very wrong. <br /> <br /> It started when the "mysterious dancers" turned out to be the most obvious character, the Scouser / Australian (I say this because he had an accent that could not be identified), the performer could only say that he abysmal state. <br /> <br /> Then he came to the end and, at that time, we had lost the will to live. The paint ball finals. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I liked about this plot is that they actually didn't win, but annoyingly they won by default. <br /> <br /> And I know this has nothing to do with this, but the name the team gave was just awful. Critical damage. I mean they could have chosen a more impressive name, like "The destroyers of the Anti-Christ" or something like that. Or is that what the movie should have been called anyway.
