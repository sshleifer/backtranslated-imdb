Due to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It's practically crap, composed of cut and pasted clips from Season 2 and was described by the writer, Maurice Hurley, as "terrible, simply terrible". <br /> <br /> Because the producers could not simply wait to shoot something decent, who knows. I imagine that because of the strike the production ended the money and we could only publish an episode of flashback or maybe Roddenberry was too ill at the time to be able to veto this half absurdity. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series.
