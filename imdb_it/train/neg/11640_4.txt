Pier Paolo Pasolini, or pee as I prefer to call it (because of his love in showing the male genitals), is perhaps the most overestimated European Marxist director - and they are thick on the ground. How anyone can see "art" in this intricate, cheap sexual concoction is outside of me. Some of the "stories" here could have come straight out of a soft-core porn movie, and I'm not referring as much to nudity as to simplistic and banal stories, often useless. Anyone who has enjoyed this relatively watchable but stupid quirk should really bite into the 1970s German film series "Der Schulmaedchenreport", because that's what "Decameron" has for me. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the film is sloppy on almost all levels, from beginning to end: <br /> <br /> 1. The modification. An example: at 1 hour: 15 minutes: 45 seconds there is a chasing scene that is put quite clearly in the wrong place. It had to be placed about a minute later, but I assume that Pasolini has hired reluctant publishers who have little time for the "nice details" of the film. Pee-pee fans would probably neutralize it by saying that it was intentionally put there, which I doubt very much. Moreover, even if it were true, it would be even worse, because that story gains absolutely nothing making it more difficult to follow. (This is not exactly "Eraserhead" or one of the films in the form of Tarantino ...) <br /> <br /> 2. Act. Vey sloppy. Triple Pee fans (all 8) proudly declare 3P-O to use "real people rather than actors". (Aren't they actors? Or are they Martians? Of course, many actors have comparable IQs but it means we should treat them with contempt ...?) Other directors have used amateurs and they have succeeded (like Alan Parker or De Niro), so why Are the PPP amateurs so terribly terrible in his films? The answer is once again terrible sloppiness. Pasolini is sloppy in everything, and this includes trying to get as much as he can out of his toothless amateurs. He's a lazy manager, an imperfectionist, if you like. The anti-Kubrick, I suppose ... The main goal of peeing was to find as many old toothless as possible (and young people who like it). In Pasolini's world there is a simple formula: lack of teeth + strange face = realism. It's all right and just having them toothless, but at least try to get at least semi-decent performances of these inexperienced neo-thèpies, otherwise you're an amateur yourself - an amateur director, in Pasolini's case. If 3P-0 were not capable of this feat or simply did not care about it, nothing changes. (Who knows ... maybe he didn't even notice the horrible acting?) <br /> <br /> 3. Audio. Synchronization If 3P-0 felt that the microphones are too much of a nuisance during the filming of a film, then it would have had to at least make a concerted effort in post-production, that is to make all these tramps recite their lines in the studio so that we viewers shouldn't watch the mouths move as the elusive dialogue floats elsewhere in the film. <br /> <br /> 4. Lack of concept. We have almost a dozen stories that are not connected in any significant way. Some are anti-Church (we'll talk about it later), while some are just sexual yarns, that is cheap (sometimes gay) cheap fantasies designed to titillate and nothing else. The stories and characters are not funny (if at all) on an intelligent level, but on the lowest level. 10-year-olds can laugh here ... And there's nothing wrong with that, but then don't call it exalted art, intellectual! <br /> <br /> 5. As a result of point 4, there is also a lack of logic in the order of the stories. That goes without saying. Pee pee could have arranged the order in any other way, and we would have had the exact same film. This also means that you can feel free to start at the center and then return to the beginning, etc. "Decameron" is like a bowl of spaghetti in this way: when you start eating it you can start with any wire you want, it makes no difference. <br /> <br /> 6. The futility of story resolutions. Most stories end with a cheap joke / joke, such as a cursed joke directly from a comic strip, while some stories don't even have a conclusion: they just finish. Finished. At best, the stories are watchable semi-anecdotes, barely any deeper meaning there - unless you find "deep" meanings in a porn. Obviously there is nothing simpler than to look for and find "meaning" where there is an absence. So even any hardcore porn movie can be philosophized / meditated endlessly. It's easy and fun. Try it, oh you 8 PPP fans! <br /> <br /> As for the Church's excitement ... Some viewers get excited about his attack on Catholicism and what is not. In principle, that's fine, after all I'm an atheist myself - but what these people ignore is the simple but essential fact that Pasolini was a Marxist. It's like the pot that calls the black kettle. A Marxist who criticizes the Church for hypocrisy and stupidity? Where does he get the courage? Furthermore, Pasolini was not an atheist, so his high and powerful and hypocritical position is not justified. After all, Marxists are believers: they have simply replaced the accepted god with the idea of ​​a utopia, which is simply another supernatural fantasy of wishful thinking. So I can't get excited about PPP's anti-religious antics. <br /> <br /> This sophomoric humpdorama anthology ends with Pasolini saying rather pretentiously: "I wonder ... why produce a work of art when it's nice just to dream true?" Actually he wasn't referring to this stupid film as an art, was it ...? In case he was - the poor man disappointed - then I have to ask myself why he didn't leave him alone to dream, and NOT to make all those bad films ... <br /> <br /> You want to read my altered subtitles Bergman movie?
