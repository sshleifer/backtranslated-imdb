I am an incorrigible skeptic and agnostic and therefore I expected to enjoy this movie. However, after looking at it, I honestly believe that I could have made a better documentary. His arguments seem to have only four spurious sources (although he is listed in the credits on IMDb I have not seen Richard Dawkins anywhere), he is assembled roughly with ridiculous and amateurish computer effects, and he does not even make the slightest attempt to seem impartial he is pervaded by an anti-Christian mocking feeling, almost adolescent, which ruins any possibility that the film can actually change someone's mind in contrast to the simple sermon to the choir (ie me). Although there is some interesting discussion on the historicity of Jesus, the film strikes an unbearable snag when it begins to dwell heavily on the Christian school that the director attended as a child, an institution that apparently marked him badly psychologically while obsessing him about it day. <br /> <br /> Although TGWWT obviously had a low budget, there was still an opportunity to make an intelligent comment on the highly questionable roots of Christianity. There is certainly a shortage of skeptical-minded religious documentaries on the market, and this film may have helped fill the void. Instead, the director chose to insult our intelligence with this piece of junk, which in the end seems to be a kind of therapeutic exercise for him. It is a pity that his Christian education has traumatized him, but he does not need to subject an audience to his coping mechanism.
