This film should be called "plan 9 from joseph smith". I think his strangeness is underestimated. the playwright seems to have read "the bomb of the population (1968)" by Paul Ehrlich and has developed a musical response made especially for Mormons. the central point of the game is that having as many children as you can is part of "heavenly father" (god) plan. and everything that hinders the fact of having more children is very bad. I got it? <br /> <br /> This version was shot in 1989, which is confusing. is the utah, so it seems and seems from 1983, the work was written in 1973 and, of course, theology is part of 1840, part battlestar galactica. some of the actions take place on the earth and some in the "pre-existence", an aimless diamond room where annoying children wait to take their bodies so that they can get off trying not to slam the door on the missionaries, losing their shot to the heavenly glory. <br /> <br /> it is as swampy as it comes, but don't let poor theatrics ruin your appreciation for this Mormon universe in which the "fantastic boys" are all under the control of the population, (presumably) counseling their parents no longer have children !! Having large families was, at the time the game was written, the cultural norm in the ld community and, more importantly, considered part of God's plan. Since then the church has made a 180, and they have made family planning a choice of parents, and large families are far less the cultural norm now. making the whole doctrinal premise of the film for a modern mormon! <br /> <br /> ahhh but it is really only as good as the music, there are some catchy tracks that will not allow this film the death of the 70s dies for which it was predestined. brother and sister sing love songs between them that make you wonder if maybe something else is happening there - wink. and the robust and fashionable kids make the new guys look like metal on the block. so applause to all this! reunite the family, create jell-o shooters and enjoy the show! <br /> <br />
