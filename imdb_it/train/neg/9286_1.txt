OK, first of all let me tell you that I am still amazed at how the plot sucks, <br /> <br /> but again it's a movie that marks Steven's rye movie only with Steven's omni !!! <br /> <br /> only random low-budget action scenes really no point I'm still amazed I burned 90 minutes on this shit really !! <br /> <br /> just rent a movie by Jacky Chan or go see wwf funnier and has no presumed to have and plot !!! plz plz plz avoid it !! among the best actor that plays there is Bill Goldberg and this says a lot !! <br /> <br /> and no he doesn't sound very good as I said plz avoid it pfff I still can't believe I wasted 90 minutes and spent 10 more minutes writing this !! :)
