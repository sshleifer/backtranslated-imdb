A group of uninteresting and unpredictable characters unravels and makes its way through an inconsistent plot that could be interesting, if only I could pay attention to you. This "twist and turn" of which I speak does not refer to the story (which contains all the suspense of a tuna casserole recipe) but to the director's inability to keep the faces of the characters even remotely centered in the frame. On the other hand, Angie Harmon has very nice nostrils and a left ear. <br /> <br /> The only real surprise in the film are the big names that convinced them to do so. If you consider that this film has never been released in theaters despite having a cast of famous actors, you may be inclined to think something is wrong. <br /> <br /> And indeed, it does.
