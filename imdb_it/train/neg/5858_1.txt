This was awarded to fans as the "winner takes all" occurred between two separate "companies" (the World Wrestling Federation and the "Alliance": a merger of former WCW and ECW superstars. It was a tag game - team, the wrestlers were limited to throwing opponents from each side of the ring to another, each wrestler concludes that to weaken their opponents and intensify the game, interference is needed, punches, performs a special move and tags in a partner. The plot had previously been overshadowed by Vince's subterfuge that a member of the Alliance would have been soaked and would have joined the WWF. It was obvious, with this statement, that the WWF would have In general: a very innovative plot but very little execution, which it's not the scarcity of the wrestlers because the format of the game is tag-team, the remaining games are just revolting: <br /> <br /> Edge against T est: powerful "big boot" of Test, but this didn't show the true talent of both stars <br /> <br /> At the Snow Versus Christian: good game but superfluous to pay-per-view <br /> <br /> Taji against William Regal: the worst match of the night <br /> < br /> Immunity Battle Royal: this was an extraordinarily fun game to watch, but because the main protagonists of both companies were involved in the main event, only a wrestler who typically appears on "Heat" and is probably a heavy refusal heavyweight WCW (eg the hurricane that is simply hired as an entertainer) <br /> <br /> Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz: the best match of the night: Jeff Hardy performed a "Swanton Bomb" from the top of a cage and through a wooden table and Matt was stuck in the cage, which seemed extremely painful. <br /> <br /> Since Stone Cold was the WWF champion, Rob Van Dam was the Hardcore champion and Kurt Angle was a "mole" in the alliance, all the fundamental stars in the main event of the Alliance faction "they got a job after the outcome of the match, except for Booker T., who recently attacked a wrestler on" Raw "and will inevitably be given work. Shane McMahon will return to television somehow, and everyone wanted to watch the fall and the end of "the Alliance" to see Stone Cold out of work. The WWF has done much better. A match in which all tilts were brought to a faction would have been better, and what happened to Casket and Iron Man games?
