I gave this movie a loooooooooong "2" because of the attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you can't read like a speed reader, you will NEVER get past the subtitles that try to keep up with the speed of the Spanish language! And, what the hell is going on in the plot if you can't read the subtitles. Infinite looks and looks and constant refusal. Just boring after about an hour. Some good photography but also a little so DARK that you think your screen is burned. How he won something I will never understand. It's hard to talk about "ACTING" because the main actors seem to simply look at each other and look at each other lovingly when they don't push each other. The Geraldo character is so attractive that it's hard to believe that ANYONE would push him away. And what is with his mother? I simply didn't do it most of the time except that there were three guys who seemed to have had a story to each other .... but they never understood who his "EX" was.
