This is one of those films that I remember being in tin for years before something happened. I don't think it's terrible, but it's not even good. Alec Baldwin was quite good, but the plot is quite fragile. The cast is pretty good at what is given, but again you're as good as the script. Baldwin directed this, although I could have sworn he didn't direct everything, I thought I read somewhere or many shots were not bad, but he certainly has potential. Although his work on "30 Rock" is nothing short of brilliant and should keep him busy for a while longer. I just hope the show gracefully greets La Seinfeld, but maybe not even that long. 9 years is gone. So if you want to see a movie you won't get much from, but you won't hate it, this is for you. I can't remember the last time a movie was wrapped so long before it was finally released and only on DVD. It was good to see Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins together again since their excellent, but not many people have seen "The Edge". Now take this excellent movie for true entertainment.
