It is difficult to express precisely the words of this film. A completely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of something that is even remotely recognizable as "humor" or even "entertainment" in "Rabbit Test". So, as a small contribution to this future effort, I would like to suggest this word: <br /> <br /> "Hubiriffic" (adj.) A combination of "hubristic" and "terrific"; used to describe overly ambitious weak such as the movie "Rabbit Test". <br /> <br /> Joan Rivers and "Hollywood Squares" producer Jay Redack have largely outgrown their meager skills to entertain at this 82-minute misery festival. Trying to put together an airplane! style comedy with a musty collection of gags, (known to Joan: German doctors have not been funny since Vaudeville) have been crumbled from their graves in the Catskills - this is bad enough. But aggravating this film crime is River's directorial style, which can be described as "ugly", and a cast of would-be and future futures so eager to exaggerate even the weakest of launch gags. <br /> <Drifting in this Sargasso Sea of ​​sap is an unfortunate Billy Crystal in his cinematic debut role as the unfortunate protagonist of the film Lionel. Looking at Crystal in this photo is like watching a blind man take a walk in a minefield; in the end the shuddering reflection becomes a semi-permanent condition as a cheap joke after an economic joke explodes in his face. <br /> <br /> I can only speculate on the kind of audience that could really appreciate Rabbit Test. Cabbages, molluscs and slightly delayed lizards are probably candidates. But for the self-conscious and self-conscious humans, I urge you to pour bleach into your eyes before recommending "Rabbit Test".
