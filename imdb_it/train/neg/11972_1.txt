The first ten minutes of "Just Looking" really dictate the direction that most of this film requires. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14-year-old boy who lives in New York in the 1950s. He has a burning desire to see two people having sex. Who are the best people he has in mind? Well, his mother and stepfather of course! How pleasant it is. Unfortunately for Lenny, he is captured before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to be with his uncle and his uncle's wife. Lenny's next plan is to see his uncle and his wife having sex. However, the wife is quite pregnant and at the moment they are not sleeping together. Then Lenny makes a new friend. He and his friend spend most of their free time around a couple of girls. They have a small club where all they do is sit down and talk about sex. The problem is ... it is not done in an innocent, charming 1950s type. I'm not an idiot at all, but I found it rather disturbing to hear these guys talk about masturbation, blowjobs and anal sex. That kind of rawness might work in a movie like "Kids" (1995) but in this film it just looks perverse. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is completely wasted here as Hedy, a former bra model who becomes the object of Lenny's carnal desires. Jason Alexander needs to stay as far away as possible from the director's chair. "For Better Or Worse" (1996) was horrible and now this. What a waste. 1/10
