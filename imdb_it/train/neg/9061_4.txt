What can you say about this movie? It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good! Two days before I had watched Lillies and that was one of the best gay movies I've ever seen. So this wasn't the best time to watch a mediocre gay movie. <br /> <br /> The story was stupid and the acting was OK. It wasn't bad enough to shut down, but it had some bad moments and some terrible stereotypes. It wasn't a very good cast. <br /> <br /> Do I recommend this movie? No, you would be wasting time and money. I don't understand why films like these are made and who finances them. Spend your time looking at Noah's Arc on Logo instead. I think this is where this movie was trying to go, but it never arrived.
