This (extremely) low-budget film is compared to the classic "Silent Night Deadly Night", as it is labeled as Slasher Flick. First let me tell you that I think even "Silent Night Part 2" is better than this (the one was full of flashbacks of the original for more than half of the movie). "Christmas Evil" tries to become psychological by introducing the main character as someone who goes mad, (a strong word), slowly (very slowly). He is irritated by people who do not understand the true meaning of Christmas and at work cannot stand the way that manufactured toys are made with such a lack of quality and love. Disguised as Santa Claus, he ends up killing. Even a strong word, since only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects. No tension, no chills, no blood, no cast. For an exception: Jeffrey DeMunn is inside. He is known for playing Tom Hanks as one of the guardians of the classic "The Green Mile". He still has to kick himself these days to always accept the role. He is really the only one who can really act, his supporting role is better than the main protagonist. (which is not so bad, but if you are overshadowed by a small supporting character, you are not even good at it). What about that weird ending? (you have to see it, to believe it). "Christmas Evil" is definitely boring, nothing happens and the artwork is misleading. This is not a slasher. Want to see a real Christmas slasher, check out the biggest ever: "Silent Night, Deadly Night".
