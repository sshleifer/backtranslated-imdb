I'm a big fan of Lon Chaney, but the script for this movie didn't work for me. The story jumps in a strange way (since I learned that the film lacks a section), the characters appear and disappear with irritating improvisations. Some of the subtitles are overly explanatory (for example, "because you are no longer a child!" - reduce to the image for a long, slow beat - "you're a woman!" that require explanations that never appear. (Let's hear the subject of Luigi and his blond girlfriend, please!) The plot, which implies incestuous desires (figuratively if not technically) was disturbing to the point that it was difficult to look at. To the writer's credit, this problem has been treated as a problem, and a May-December game is not interpreted as the right and good inevitability of some Mary Pickford films (eg "Daddy-Long-Legs"). Chaney gives a good performance, as usual, but I think he was better directed in the past - he exaggerated a couple of times here, IMHO. I liked the clown sequences and was very impressed by the stunts. Loretta Young was charming, though surprisingly young. The film has its moments, but so far it's my favorite Chaney image.
