Zombie Nation 2004 R <br /> <br /> Hey, I was bored. I looked in my comic box to find a movie to watch. Zombie Nation? Hey, I love zombie movies. He says the filmmaker has a sort of cult in the description. Strange how not to warn me not to watch this movie. I could have used that advice. <br /> <br /> Zombie Nation is just like Troll 2 as it is completely wrongly named. It has little (if anything, depending on your point of view) to do with zombies and takes place in just one city. This film revolves around a corrupt cop, acting in the worst possible way (he must try to suck it so much), while arresting women for trivial bullshit and then killing them. Yes, he's a serial killer cop. Not only is this film imperfect in thinking it's a zombie movie, but its serial killer facts are completely wrong. Serial killers love to kill, they live for it and they break down and are personal with it. This boy knocks out women and injects them with poison. He doesn't even have sex with the corpse or the forgetfulness. Talk about boring! In the end, one of the five women she kills has Voodoo protection made for her and for no apparent reason, all five come back to life and leave to kill this boy. They were all buried or thrown into the ocean, but you wouldn't know how to buy the clean, sharp clothes that everyone wears. Women then act very badly and retaliate. Oh yay. <br /> <br /> This movie sucked in every category. Crap acting, crap writing, crappier sets and crappier makeup effects. Women don't look like a zombie, unless you contain the really dark makeup around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie. They can all speak, behave, think and act perfectly human. The gore is weak compared to many PG-13 films and the nudity is beyond short. See the view of the breast in the opening sequence ... Then the exact same breast after! Go figure. Guess that only one actress was willing to go topless for this banality. The police station is so badly built that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse where they are obviously filming. You can see the tubes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse setting and even, unless you are blind, you can see that the director is failing. Avoid, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> 1/10
