and it doesn't help the case of Rohmer that Syberberg arrived a few years later and did an incredibly large job on the same subject (with a little help from Wagner). <br /> <br /> maybe this film didn't do it. When it came out, it looks so poor, without the film syberberg to compare it to, that it was probably shot on an even smaller stage with fewer resources. Actually I can't remember at the moment if there are horses in the syberberg movie. all I know is that the German version is pure magic, while this looks like a documented university production on film for archival purposes. <br /> <br /> the music ... the musique ... is not even credited here on IMDb ... but someone based it on 'arias from the 12th to the 14th century "or something like that .. . well, it is not very helpful for the film, it is presented as inauthentic and mischievous, as per !!! <br /> <br /> rohmer is one of those French authors who like his top men, generally also unattractive, and this does not help the patient. Syberberg's Parsifal was adorable and can now be seen on German television by selling a kind of special bicycle that he invented .... <br /> <br /> I shudder to think of how to look at the syberberg on video I remember that the last time I saw the film in a theater, the press was so bad that the experience was a laborious parody of 5 hours, but even so I should have overcome what this version has to offer, I fear. <br /> <br /> points for seriousness, for chutzpah, but ... this film simply needed beau-coup pi dollars. not look like a medieval manuscript seems CHEAPO! BON MARCHE !! oh and yes, it ends in a very arbitrary way with Parsifal going to church and this poor passion is interrupted ... blah!
