The lack of content in this film amazed me the most. First I thought that people would compare this to Rock On! but I'm really surprised to say that this was worse than Rock On! So-so story The horrible cast Ajay Devgan Jamming with Salman Khan and Asin will be kidding me. The music was Okay Khanabadosh was the movie track, the rest was bad! Vipul Shah has not yet learned from Singh is King's critical comedy. Now Asin ... where it comes from, sorry for the Asin fan, but it sucks in this movie with a bad acting that doesn't look good on makeup! My final verdict goes to watch Aladin with your family instead of wasting time here.
