the author of the book, with the same title, should not have let his name be used for this film. if you read the book, this film takes such a liberal interpretation of the real events in the book and its spirit that the film and the book seem to have quite little in common except the title and some superficial details. the film does not add anything, in terms of artistic merit, to the literary realization of the book. <br /> <br /> for those who have not read the book: you will be disappointed. not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace, it offers nothing more as it moves slowly (like character development, for example). some viewers could be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later in the film, but you could also watch a special show for the things they show in therese and isabelle - it's quite gentle and not at all imaginative.
