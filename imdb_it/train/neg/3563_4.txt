For the most part, this film seems like a "TV-made" effort. The direction is crazy, the acting (except for Fred Gwynne) is exaggerated and lathered. Denise Crosby, in particular, expresses her lines as if she were cold reading them from a cue card. Only one thing makes this movie worth seeing, and this is the moment when Gage returns from "Semetary". There is something disturbing about seeing a small child kill someone, and this movie could be more than anyone can handle for that reason alone. It is absolutely oxygenating. This film only does one thing, but this thing is outside the park. Worth seeing only for the last 10 minutes or so.
