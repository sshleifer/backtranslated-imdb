One of the worst movies ever. Not funny, poor TV-style cinematography, bad acting. Sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk, not to mention acting. The female lead Nancy Young cannot act. Terrible Sub-par direction with bad TV movies. The occasional faint beats fall flat. The basic premise of the film also makes no sense. They should somehow interrupt a marriage, but there is no logic behind their actions. The slow pace made me stop watching my wife, but I suffered. The old should behave as if they were young and horny, but it turns out to be pathetic rather than funny. How did they get the money to do this?
