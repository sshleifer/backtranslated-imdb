Actually, when it comes to this movie, this movie is not funny at all. Josh Kornbluth is the antithesis of the buffo, yet he thinks he is hilarious. The plot on the 17-letter expedition was fine at the beginning, until Josh's approach "look at me, I'm extravagant" started to infest every single scene. Judas Priest's joke may have been the least fun I've ever had to deal with, and that's quite a lot, since it has strong competition with all the other lines in the film. And as for the incredible excessive use of the "Debaser" by the Pixies, I have only one thing to say: what did the Pixies do to deserve a destiny like this? What did someone do to Josh Kornbluth to make him write / direct / produce / act in such a terrible movie?
