I was rooting for this film as it is a remake of a children's television series from the 70s "Escape into Night" which, although sometimes chaotic and pungent, was definitely strange, fascinating and disturbing. The acting in "Paperhouse" is wooden, involuntarily a joke. Overdubs did not add tension, but only reinforced the fact that I was sitting watching a mess. The casting exasperated the grim dialogue that led to relationships without heat, chemistry or conviction. Since in most of the lackluster films there are some good acts of support, these people should be comforted, comforted and reassured by the fact that they will not be held responsible. Of all the possible endings, the most unexpected was chosen ... more than I could have dreamed. <br /> <br /> "Escape into Night" deserves a proper remake, written by someone with life experience and directed with a subtle mind.
