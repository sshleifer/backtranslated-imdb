My first clue about how bad it would have been was when the video case said it came from the people who brought us the Blair Witch Project, a masterpiece compared to this piece of junk. The acting was in the caliber of an Oklahoma grade 6 production and the plot, as there was, is predictable, boring and inane. 85% of the script consists of four letters and countless variations. The mother F seems to be the favorite of the "writers" because it is used constantly. All 10 minutes must have elapsed to write this script in a last call dive. Thank God I rented it and I could almost jump all the way forward fast. Don't waste time or money with this.
