I read some comments on the internet about this film as "... more difficult than the hostel ...", "the camera never shuts down when it's getting really brutal ...". But none of them is true. The camera never screens because there's nothing to shield from. The same scene is repeated hundreds and a hundred times again. The women lie on a table, the killer women rape a couple of times, the killer cuts the women to pieces (you never see it throughout the film!). The police come and arrested him. The killer fools the jury. Finished film In Germany we would say: "Viel LÃ¤rm um Nichts". All in all, one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Absolutely not recommendable.
