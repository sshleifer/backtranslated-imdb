Richard Tyler is a little boy who is afraid of everything. He doesn't like riding a bicycle or climbing his tree house because he knows what kind of accidents could happen to him. So one day he is riding a bicycle and, as it is starting to rain, he decides to wait in the library until the rain stops. The whole story happens there. Experiment with all types of personnel and in the end is no longer afraid. But the whole story is incredible and even good actors like Macaulay Culkin couldn't make the story better than it is.
