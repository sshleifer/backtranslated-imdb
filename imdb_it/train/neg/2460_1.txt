I really wanted to like this movie, but it never gave me a chance. Basically it is meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme, but fails miserably. It always seems to have been written and interpreted by high school kids for a school project, and it is also the level at which humor seems to be aimed. There is no subtlety and, more damn for a mockumentary, it never seems like a documentary. And while the lines aren't funny, first, a dead-pan delivery attempt would have helped - surely, everything would be better than the too shrill we are subjected to. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to people who like "comedies" in the "Big Momma's House" or "Norbit" vein; people who think words like "ass" are inherently hysterically funny. Other people should stay away and not waste time.
