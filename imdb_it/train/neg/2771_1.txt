The film had to be shown here in Bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater, it failed miserably. <br /> <br /> Apparently the scriptwriter doesn't hold up. Absolutely something was missing. In my opinion, people must have a reason why they look at it beyond the historical look of the past. The accuracy of history is not what we look for in entertainment. <br /> <br /> The film lacks only substance. The only way to do this film well was to somehow make changes in a sort of legend rather than just a story. And a legend will have some elements that try to tell you something that people have forgotten over time, such as the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, etc. It's called the central theme. <br /> <br /> The movie can't be answered, why should I watch it anyway? <br /> <br /> At least some strange legendary flying elephants, psychic kings or eccentric kings like "King and I" would have been nice, something would have added a lot to the appeal of the cinema. I imagine there was no other appeal besides a simple vanilla film. <br /> <br /> Once we get the appeal, the story is the next thing we focus on. In terms of marketing, we call it "must see". After hearing the film's title, people would have said: Oh, I have to see it. Now, where is the appeal in Kingmaker? Why not just redo the title and call it, "How NOT to be a king?" and make a black comedy from the old Siamese days, in the style of "Dr. Strangelove". It would have been much more interesting. Narrative experiences of the king's weaknesses by first-person persons would have made the film extremely entertaining. <br /> <br /> Most films today have a "see" appeal, like Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If they don't have familiar characters, some other films like The Island have had an appeal when the ad asks "Do you still believe there's an island?" <br /> <br /> Or for the movie, titled "How NOT to be a King" could ask the question, "Do you still want to be a King?" <br /> <br /> Parhat
