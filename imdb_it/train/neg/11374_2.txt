I could not report to this film. He failed to involve me intellectually, emotionally or aesthetically. The dialogue was very dense and not involving. I can't connect and so I take care of some of the characters and I find it difficult to find many positive things about it. <br /> <br /> I have read that to understand it correctly it is necessary to be familiar with some of the most obscure aspects of Catholic theology. I admit that, as an atheist, I probably don't know many of the finer details of Catholicism, but I've also seen many films that deal with religious issues that touched me because their themes are still universal to the human condition and based on specialized knowledge or beliefs.
