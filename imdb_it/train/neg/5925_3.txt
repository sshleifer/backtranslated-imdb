Is this the "worst" episode of Star Trek TOS? Perhaps, at least you get my vote as below 5. I mean, this episode has absolutely no bad sense. Have you seen something that drives you crazy? Give me a break. This episode also has a different feeling, the music is intensified, almost forced to improve the feeling of anxiety, to the point that it sucks. Give me some Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, superior beings like Triskelion or something like Medusin's, these are very boring aliens to do an episode around. McCoy gets to say his famous phrase "He's dead, Jim". Spock puts on his protective glasses when he transports the ambassador away, but Kirk doesn't. They go through that horrible "barrier" now for the third time I remember, boring. The subsequent episodes of the third season would be "Specter of the gun" and "Day of the Dove" and others to follow, making Trek a decent show to watch in syndication in which to choose people like me as avid fans. Personal observations, Trek loved to use the purple color, his type of a pinkish purple, as when they are in the corridor outside the compartment, the catwalk that is normally gray is now purple. We never had a purple bridge but it is interesting to see, I noticed it in several episodes, it was done by a light filter and it works very well but in this episode, in the corridor of the ships it is rather lame.
