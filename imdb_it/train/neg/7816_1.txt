It doesn't matter that Superman comics are incredibly naive and their goal is ten years. What matters is that "Superman Returns" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, a question for You Dear Readers, how many of you really believe that Superman will be defeated by the bald Kevin Spacey? Anyone? Just like I thought. No spoilers here. Let us now turn to some important problems. <br /> <br /> First, this movie looks commercial (bar scene with Superman / Clark Kent drinking Budweiser is just a scene that looks like it should). Imagine the Superman ad, two and a half hours long. Let's be serious, this is not "Amadeus" or "The Departed". In reality, you feel that this film is too long. And the special effects are not so special by the way. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the scenario is stupid. Sometimes even if something is acceptable in the comic, it just seems stupid in the cinema. And so it is in this case. Obviously the dialogues are dishonest. I can't believe someone took the money to write them. How many times will we be fed with the villain making speeches? How many times will the laws of physics be raped? (Jesus, it's not just the question of Superman's strength, but also the resistance of the materials he has to deal with.) How many times will Lois Lane be deceived by Kent? How many times will Hollywood producers look for a story in a cheap comic book? Since it is difficult to make a good story, why have a weak story for an appetizer? It just doesn't work. Guys, take a hold. Try harder, please. Or stay in this attack forever, who cares. I have the impression that WGA is in constant strike. No offense. I'm not questioning the crooked money of those paid people, but the quality of the product they deliver. In this case there is no quality at all. (At this point you might ask: is it so ugly? Yes, it is.) <br /> <br /> Thirdly, acting is weak, which is rather a surprise given that Bryan Singer (Usual Suspects) is directing. Kevin Spacey is having fun, but he's the only one. The public is not in the mood for jokes. The fact is that the comic book hero can be developed into a real personality, with clear motivations but also with doubts, fears, a certain depth. In this case no one has done that job, and the characters are not really interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, the whole effort of the creators turns this film into a parody. The second unit is so bad that it attracts attention, since there is nothing interesting on the screen anyway. The more they try (if they try), the more fun it becomes (but it's not a laugh). <br /> <br /> Final conclusion? One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This particular film, ladies and gentlemen, is a field. Don't waste your time and don't waste your money too. Stay home, read a book.
