"The Second Coming Of Suzanne" is yet another of those surreal movies that try to look extremely sophisticated, yet all it does is put the viewer to sleep. Like other films of this type, there is limited dialogue. Everyone is much more interested in the aesthetic aspect of the shot. However, cinematography sucks, so there's really nothing to keep your attention. <br /> <br /> The video cassette states that this film is "one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen in the film". Yes sure. It's right there watching events as stimulating as a melting ice bucket or a turtle walking a mile. 1/10
