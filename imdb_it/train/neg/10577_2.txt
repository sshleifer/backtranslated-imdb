Some of the directors participating in this series have made some really great films, but they certainly don't show much skill with this series. Especially writing. OK, the first season was a little better but these new episodes they are creating are simply smelly. I'm a big horror fan and I think the vast majority of these episodes are total junk. Nothing new or really interesting. Few of them are visually creative. It's just a typical Hollywood shit invented, uninteresting, childish, ill-conceived and, in some cases, flat and ridiculous. Just like Tales from the Crypt, the only good thing this series has to offer is great nudity! Other then that this series blows hard. Sometimes I have the impression that they have hired a group of third-grade students to write the episodes. Maybe they did it.
