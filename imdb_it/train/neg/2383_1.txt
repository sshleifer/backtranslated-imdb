This is a candidate for the only disappointing cinematic experience of my life. Interesting title, excellent director (I saw "To Die For" and "Drugstore Cowboy" before this), and hey - Uma Thurman in the cast. How can you go wrong? Well, this is a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after seeing this turkey. <br /> <br /> Decomposed and not very funny in an attempt to be unusual, this is a dead zone of a film that should be avoided at all costs. His critical agitation was well deserved. Here you have one of those rare films that does not contain a single saving quality. Zero from ****.
