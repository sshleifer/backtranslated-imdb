Mostly dense street film with some comic relief provided by the excellent John Cleese (although he is actually sending his performance in Fawlty Towers). It seems to go from a slap to a blatant sentimentality with the drop of a hat, and the worst part of the film is that Martin and Hawn must "find themselves", who they are, etc. Look at your own risk.
