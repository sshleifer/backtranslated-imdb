* Can anyone tell me where the comedy is? !! <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) is a very weak comedian, (Thomas Haden Church) seems so weak (with him!), and the whole thing is so thick! <br /> <br /> * Have they tried to create a live comic that turned out to be a super bloody comic book nightmare and it wasn't even funny? Like the piano scene in the bathroom; he was so beautiful with his cinematic imagination, but there's nothing more .. except the pain! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland ??! Your relationship with your daughter ??! <br /> <br /> * This is actually a type of work that they did just to do it and earn some money from it, but it became such a crime when this money was robbed by us that we were deceived by such low art works and entertainment had absolutely NO entertainment at ALL! <br /> <br /> * Well, it would have been uglier if it had been a great production film and played by Brando in his golden years with a real star. <br /> <br /> * The Sheen family is here. Just be aware of this! <br /> <br /> * Anyone who found himself admiring this movie or -God Probid- loving it! Then you have to go directly to therapy before it becomes more dangerous and hurts someone else! <br /> <br /> * (Brando) is undoubtedly a genius but the film is not! And he didn't mean to be one here after reading this for sure !! But the main problem is that nobody else has ever worked in this thing trying, or wanting to, to be a little smart or even good !!! (Sorry, I'm crying now! The film's tortures are incredible!). <br /> <br /> * There is a scene in which (Brando) hits (Mira Sorvino) with his shoes! Was it so realistic !? Maybe he was seeing himself in her, so he was punishing himself for being so lousy! <br /> <br /> * For the time of the millennium: this could have been better (or worse!). The script, until the train hit, was pretty and I imagined that they would run away to have a chase like another (Smokey and the Bandit) but with (Brando) as the sheriff. In fact one of those chimeras was much more merciful than the one I saw! <br /> <br /> * Why hasn't this Razzie award been awarded ?! Do you want me to believe that there was a lower movie than THIS? I do not think so ! It's a situation where Razzie's supervisor must win one for his negligence !! <br /> <br /> * Martin Sheen is also here as a guest star perhaps to support his failed son but ironically his father was a failure as his son! and why is this?! Well ! Because I hate Martin Sheen, perhaps more than I hate comic films were not as good as his ambitions! <br /> <br /> * It's not a comic movie, NO .. It's a horror !, and I only hate horror movies, especially those that have been touted as comics! <br /> <br /> * Name good thing? Hmmm! Well, this compared to another monster movie by Marlon Brando (Dr. Moreau's Island - 1996) would be close to (Casablanca) !! PS: if you still want to know what the bad guys, the ugly and the horrible are in this movie .. pray your last prayers and go see it .. God help you!
