This movie is really wack. There is really nothing nice to say about it, in addition to the moral truth expressed in the climax of the film concerning the people of the neighborhood who participate in the fight against crime. Besides all this, the film has had nothing: no shots, no acting and no script. I give this film an F and a 2 out of 10.
