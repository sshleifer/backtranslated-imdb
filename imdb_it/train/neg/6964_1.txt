I usually go to see the MTV film awards to see a witty and entertaining show that offers a unique prize show (Chewbacca won an award as a career award). So this year was no different. While I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott has always been fun, so stupid, for me. I laughed at Stiffler in both the American Pie movies, and I also enjoyed it in Dude Where's My Car? But the MTV film awards were simply horrible. Nothing was consistent, fun or funny. Justin Timberlake should stick to singing and dancing; surely he can't act. <br /> <br /> I'm curious to know who the writers were for this show. Last year's performance by Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar was extremely entertaining (the Lord of the Rings solo parody was worth seeing the whole show), but this year was completely different. Someone understood Timberlake's comments on Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ("They're watching a movie together, but they never met! There they are ...") Where was the joke? Kate and Luca have just entered their lame dialogue, without ever referring to Timberlake's "joke". And Seann was completely wasted as a talent, he didn't even make me smile, but just laugh. And what was the point of Harrison Ford's headshots? Do they make sense to anyone? Perhaps the MTV writers imagined that the young viewers could only know the old Ford like Han Solo, Indiania Jones, or the president of Air Force One. I'm baffled. And would anyone tell me the deal with Adrian Brody? How old is this boy and how old do you think he is? The boy is 30, try again 19 ... forget it, show some class (like in your best Academy Award speech) and play your age! <br /> <br /> Give this show 1 in 4 stars, simply because of Gollam's speech for the best visual performance. This was very creative, extremely well done and caused the only real laugh of the whole evening.
