I read the novel "Jane Eyre" for the first time in 1986. It was at this time that I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was an excellent version and very similar to the book. Years later, I laid eyes on this version and was horrified. William Hurt is as unhappy as Mr. Rochester. Mr Rochester is a passionate character, where William Hurt portrays him as a block of ice. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. This is a story of love and passion, but I couldn't see it in this version. No, go back to the BBC version. A wonderful time is guaranteed
