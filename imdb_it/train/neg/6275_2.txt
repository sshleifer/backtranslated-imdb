Superfluous film with characters that act in such an unpleasant way that I didn't really care who would be the best (or was this the purpose of the film, to portray some people from the city of New York with a cool and casual heart?) , no comedy either. Acting is a very flat and very predictable plot. What bothered me most was this constant joke with quotes from classic films. Friend, don't you see that the more you quote, the less significant your movie becomes? Try to be original yourself! A small budget is not an excuse at all, not even the director for the first time. Bad, lousy, lousy. No wonder it only cost me a dollar ...
