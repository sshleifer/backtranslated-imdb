The Nut case is killing college students, can the new teacher stop the madness ?! <br /> <br /> Believe me, you won't be interested. <br /> <br /> With a title like Splatter University, one might discover that this film is not just high art. But worse than that Splatter University does not even qualify for funny garbage. Splatter U is created so badly - the plot is mindless, the characters are within range and the entire movie is devoid of imagination. Needless to say, there is no suspense, atmosphere or fear. Nor is this blow brave enough to introduce any nudity (for the most economical thrill of all). So everything around this infinitely imperfect slasher offers nothing in terms of entertainment (not even economic laughter) and becomes simply boring. Bottom of the barrel folk - even hard slasher fans will want to think twice before watching, let alone pay for this movie. <br /> <br /> BOMB of ****
