Documentary on nomadic Persians who make a treacherous crossing of imposing mountains to graze their herds. Looking at this silent, black-and-white feature, marked in part by an oriental music rhythm of twink and twink that couldn't have been used in the original show, is even more boring than it looks. The spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen and there is a total failure to establish any kind of plot. I loved Nanook of the North and March of the Penguins, but I despised this film, despite the similarity of the theme. Physical difficulties alone are not so interesting.
