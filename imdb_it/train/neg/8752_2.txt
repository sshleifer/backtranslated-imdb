I saw this movie very late last night and usually, if it's late, I allow myself to forgive the films. Even though I tried, I couldn't stand this movie at all, and the movie kept getting worse. Although I know it's supposed to be a comedy, but I didn't find it very funny. It was also a particularly unrealistic and tired portrait of rural life. In the event that this is what some of you think is life in the country, it is absolutely not so. I have to admit that some of the cast members were nice, but the French was really fake. I have to admit that he tried to have a good lesson in history, but in general my recommendation is that nobody over 8 looks, it's too annoying.
