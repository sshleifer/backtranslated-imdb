At least it is not full of senseless violence or fluff. Moreover it is not very full of thoughts or a fluid plot. This story had some potential but the director seems to have lost the site of the green. The story is separate and goes off in strange <br /> <br /> directions, without conclusion. Also, I don't think the director spent much time on a golf country club. Some of the depictions are absurd. Not very engaging.
