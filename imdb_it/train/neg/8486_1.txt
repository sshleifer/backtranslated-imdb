I can't believe someone thought that there was something original or interesting about this movie. I'm a fan of science fiction as much as the next, and I can also enjoy old movies with ridiculous premises until they are written by someone other than a monkey. (See, for example, my brilliant review of Altered States [1980].) <br /> <br /> A monkey could have better explained exactly why I should take the idea behind this film seriously. The problem is not that the producers had a low budget - it's that they didn't care. <br /> <br /> Now, to publicly humiliate the worthless magazines whose brilliant reviews appear on the box: <br /> <br /> Chicago Tribune <br /> <br /> San Francisco Chronicle <br /> <br /> San Francisco Bay Guardian <br /> <br /> (Actually, I enjoy reading the last two. Reviewing the credibility has passed for the audience, but I know that if I ever make a film with a camera at hand, a poor storyline and stupid effects, I'll show it to these reporters and remind them what they said about Conceiving Ada.)
