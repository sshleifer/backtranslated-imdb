Where to start? The best way to describe how awful this movie is ??? <br /> <br /> Let's start with campy hick humor. It's not very funny. Add a group of musicians who play actors: Meat Loaf is horrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Too bad Art Carney, who should have known better than this movie. <br /> <br /> And then there's the plot. A roadie whose life goal is to work on an Alice Cooper show that meets a girl whose goal is to become a groupie for Alice Cooper. At least they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> And then, just when the movie should end, they can't come up with a last more plausible scene than a ... well, I don't want to ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie. <br /> <br /> There are some actors who let you know that this will be a "B" movie or maybe worse. Gailard Sartain is one of those for me - and has a more important role. This is a sure sign that the film will probably not be very good. If nothing else, the film lives up to low expectations - it even exceeds them being worse than the poor. <br /> <br /> Let's say this. This is the movie against which all bad movies are compared. And nobody is worse than Roadie.
