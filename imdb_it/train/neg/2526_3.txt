I disagree with what was written and said about this alleged "masterpiece" of the German New Wave: <br /> <br /> 1) There are big flaws in simple exposition, in the basic communication of the critical points of the plot, like in relation to Mary's abortion and the secret contract between Oswald and her husband. How many viewers have realized that her husband has agreed, in exchange for a considerable financial remuneration, not to go back and claim his wife until Oswald died? <br /> <br /> 2) The ending is highly unsatisfactory because arbitrary and accidental. The original script asked Maria to commit suicide after reading Oswald's will, discovering that her husband had actually sold their marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only runs water from a faucet on her wrist in a suicide gesture. Mary is then summarily blown up, rather than having to face and live the consequences of her self-illusion and her moral compromise. <br /> <br /> 3) Fassbinder tries to forcibly superimpose the public on the private, on the politician on the staff Contrary to what the critics and "experts" say, I don't think it works. The mere intrusion of historical radio news or the sound of German reconstruction jack hammers in the soundtrack of the film's dramatic events does not make these historical events an integral part of the drama. <br /> <br /> The selfish ambition of Mary's ascent from poverty to prosperity aims to make the parallel to the so-called post-war Germany economic miracle. Maria is therefore understood as a specific and reflective woman of her time and place, but in reality she is not original and not specific. Women have affirmed their independence by using sex for self-development for centuries. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, there are several cases of unforgivable sloppiness and dilettantism: Fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and carelessness have had their effect. Unknown people speak off screen without ever being seen; music is awkwardly intrusive in places; and melodramatic postures sporadically replaces acting. <br /> <br /> Strangely, for a film that condemns a country for a collective voluntary holocaust amnesia, it never mentions it once.
