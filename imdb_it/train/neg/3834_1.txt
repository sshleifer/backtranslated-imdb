I saw this movie having enjoyed Gregory's Girl many years ago. This was foolish. The plot was vaguely disgusting with the teacher and his friend who pervaded 14 to 15-year-old girls in very short skirts. Previous commentators seem to think this does not matter, but I found it rather obnoxious. If you have children at school, the last thing you want is to think that every young teacher wants his students. We were surprised that the censor let him pass. Apart from that, the film was just a waste of time. The script was poor and John Gordon Sinclair was trying too hard to recreate his school image, slightly extravagant and off the wall. Because anyone who wants to want it after this performance is incredible. This film has failed on all fronts for me. Terrible. Please don't waste your time looking at it. Life is too short
