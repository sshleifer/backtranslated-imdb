This is really the most terrible movie I've ever seen. I simply have no idea how anyone has the audacity to put this in version. <br /> <br /> Production standards are atrocious. There is no pretense here in cinematography. The operation of the camera, the script, the acting and the sound are incredibly coarse. I think there is a plot, but it could have been done in 10 minutes saving us the time to look at it. The hysterical neurotic girls at the center of this piece have no credibility. <br /> <br /> I invite anyone to avoid spending time or money on this title. It's really atrocious. <br /> <br /> JDD - December 14th 2008
