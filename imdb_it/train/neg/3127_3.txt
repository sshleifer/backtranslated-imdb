An archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) accidentally stumbles upon an ancient 40-foot mummy, a well-preserved subsoil in the Nevada desert. They are determined to keep this secret and call a Jewish translator to help understand his story. The mummy, as explained at the beginning, is the son of a fallen angel and is one of the many giants that apparently existed in "those days". To save his son from a devastating flood that involved killing everything, he mummifies his son, burying him with several servants for centuries, planning to wake him for years. In our present, the fallen angels continue to walk on the earth and the mummy has risen and a ritual is expected to take place. Most of the film is slow, has to do with a lot of biblical crap and a couple of terrible aerial fights. The mummy is discreet in appearance but is not shown enough. He should have had more to do with this, but he dragged a lot, so ... eh. Do not worry
