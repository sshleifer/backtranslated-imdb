The first ten minutes of this film about the making of an international film in Belgium, are fine: you see a real chaos on the set, a producer on the margins of a nervous breakdown, the cool was-director (Mickey Rourke), the bad mood star , etc. You've seen it all before, but it's well done. BUT THEN! For the rest of the time the film repeats itself: the same ten minutes again and again. No climax, no dramatic development, no good acting, not even bad acting, it goes on and on and on. Mickey Rourke has a good two minutes when his character talks about his fucking career in a scene where reality and fiction meet. Overall, this makes 12 good minutes. <br /> <br />
