What a horrible movie. I can't believe I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this remake. Please tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer acted in this movie? Mehki Pfifer is big in E.R and Ving Rhames probably didn't know what he was doing. I feel terrible for them. The musical background I must say that AT ALLLLL did not fit the story and it is incredible how these directors can be found who have absolutely no life in creating a well balanced film. I hope that in the future no horrible director like this can ever distract such a classic film. This film should not have been made in the first place. A tip to all those who have seen it, please tell me that I am right because I could not be the only spectator who did not like. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! -10 of 10.
