[*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***] The reputation of this film precedes it, so it was with anxiety that I sat down to look at it in letterbox on TCM. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> The cast is superb and the production values ​​are top notch, but the characters are without depth, the plot is thin and everything goes on too long. For a film about alcoholism, family divisions, infidelity, gambling and sexual repression, the film is curiously flat, prosaic, lifeless and oppressed by clichés. An example is the representation of Frank Hirsch's infidelity: his rather heavy request to his wife to "go upstairs and relax a little" followed by her predictable plea for a headache, leads - even more predictably - to her connection evening with his secretary ("Hey, Nancy, I have the blues tonight, let's go for a ride"), all according to a well-worn formula. We don't think they are real people, but cardboard cutouts that act in a puppet game. Furthermore, the source of the obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never really explored or explained. Dave's infatuation with Gwen on-again / off-again is inexplicable in light of his fatuous inability to defecate or get off the plate. His subsequent marriage of desperation for the character of Shirley Maclaine / Ginny is, from the moment he was introduced to this viewer, however, obviously destined to fail, and it was clear - from the conventions of this type of soap opera - that he could solve it only from someone who is killed. By the time the jealous lover started running with the gun, I started a bet with myself about who - Dave or Ginny - would be killed. The whole thing was fake with a capital "P". <br /> <br /> Having said that, Maclaine's and Dean Martin's performances are the highlights here. But overall I find the film's interest is purely that of a period piece of Hollywood history.
