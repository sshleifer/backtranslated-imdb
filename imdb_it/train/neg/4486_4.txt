What the hell was that all about? I saw The Matrix and I was amazed. It was the most spectacular film ever made. What ever existed from the Wachowski brothers to make this film is beyond me. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, you can't argue with that. Basically this whole movie was a lot of talk, and don't get me wrong, I have no problem with talky movies, but all the talk in The Matrix Reloaded was a useless load of music. Then there would have been a combat sequence that lasted too long, then more useless drivvle, then another fighting scene that lasted too long and accumulated until the greatest anti-climax ever. A small guy with a beard who talks for 20 minutes about an incomprehensible bull. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Keanu Reeves still gives his worst performance. I knew he wasn't a good actor, but this was beyond the joke. If you watch his films in the order in which he was, it would seem that he has gradually gotten worse. God knows how his performance is in Something's Gotta Give! Keanu Reeves: The only wooden board that could ever become an actor. <br /> <br /> After the splendor of the first film, this was a huge disappointment. If you haven't seen the first movie yet, I suggest you watch it, but don't waste your time with this bunch of crap. <br /> <br />
