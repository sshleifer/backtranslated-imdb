In my eyes this is almost the perfect example of the Hollywood ego, beaten only by the new King Kong movie. Superman is the original superhero and deserves to be treated with respect even if he wears tights. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen, since the beginning of the film you just want to put a piece of kryptonite in his throat. It just seems silly wearing the costume. But enough for him, Kate Bosworth was a bad choice for lois lane, she should be an absurd reporter, but in this movie she looks more like a student. The plot was weak and predictable (WOW, he is actually a son of superman, he would have thought ...) and the acting was horrible. This film has a good idea and his name is Kevin Spacey. His portrayal of Lex Luthor was brilliant, but even he couldn't save this film. What this film needed was the cast of "Lois and Clark" (except Kevin Spacey of course) and a different story. I watched this movie after seeing "the hills have eyes" and I was fascinated by learning that there were worse films.
