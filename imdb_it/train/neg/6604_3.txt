The first was the best. The second sucked because the dialogue was terrible. Although, the plot was not so bad (in fact, all the stories are good and bad). Throughout the film, I dosed a couple of times. I know that Jackie Chan is a great martial artist, but not a good actor in Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker wasn't good either. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, a few lines, terrible acting (but this is based on his script). All the characters weren't so good. But some of the things I like in Rush Hour 2 are always the action and less sex scenes. I know that Jackie Chan doesn't do those things that are good for him.
