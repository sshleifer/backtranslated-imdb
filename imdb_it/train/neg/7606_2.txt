Beverly's wreath was born at the wrong time. She was an actress ahead of her time, bringing power and grace even to those lame gestures like Corman's films in which she performed. In Gunslinger, she is the wife of the sheriff of the city. He is fired, so she resumes her job to pursue her killers. It is better than the material it is working with, by far. The film is gray, prodded and mostly boring. There is a little (unintended) humor with tire tracks everywhere, people running behind a building to suddenly emerge in front of another (I've heard of false fronts, but this is ridiculous!), And the plot really stupid of the new widow sheriff falling in love with the boy hired to kill her. Even if he hadn't loved his husband, it was only a week or two since he died! And in the end he ends up killing the boy eventually, anyway. No luck with men, this one. <br /> <br /> The villain of the piece is another woman, the owner of the saloon. He is planning to buy a plot of land in case the railway crosses it and makes it rich. His plan of action, if not, is rather lame: he will steal as much as possible from the city and go up. Hell, it's just her and her army at the end against an entire city. Are you telling me these people aren't armed? Look what happened in the royal cities of the old West when bank robbers entered to rob the bank, then they were shot down in a shower of bullets by the armed and dangerous people of the city. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of useless chatter and rides, interspersed with a few lame ones. The ending is as bleak as usual in a Corman film, although luckily there is no moral proselytism at the end of It Conquered the World. The sheriff turns his badge over to Sam Bass and runs into the sunset, even though the film was so gray you never saw the sun.
