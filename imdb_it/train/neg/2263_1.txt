Okay, let me tell you I didn't expect a film starring Jerry Springer to be the gold of cinema, all I asked was that it was cinematic ... and it wasn't even that. It looked like they were bad home movies. Little recited, scripted and full of nudity of the least attractive people I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The "plot" of the film focuses on a low-level family that decides to go ahead "Jerry Farrelly Show" to discuss more business between a mother, daughter, stepfather and girlfriend of the daughter. From there, the film turns off and turns into a unique experience: white-trash pornography. Is there sex from redneck, interracial sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This film encouraged me to want to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision. At least it was mercifully short. Disgusting and degrading. African Americans and the American working class should be offended. (Howard Stern should be pleased, however, he did not waste his attempt to become famous for the cinema. His was intelligent, funny and fun) <br /> <br /> MY GRADE: F + (the daughter was warm)
