I saw 8 or 9 films of Herzog and none of them had any impact on me. I've seen several documentaries about him. Obviously he is an intelligent man, with a great knowledge of films and a passion for making them, but this makes him a good director. Absolutely not! A complete anti-talent. Can you make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits, but a film with actors ?? never! <br /> <br /> Can not direct or write. His scripts are full of badly thought out situations, and many situations / dialogues in his films are so childish and poorly made that they can't be hidden behind the word "art" in any sense. There's no way. Not to mention the non-skilled, so amateurish management. To say that he wants to direct this way and write crap like that is a lie. <br /> <br /> Like the scene where Scheitz is arrested and Storszek hides in the back of the store. WHO IS PLAYING? <br /> <br /> He is a crook; he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he needs to insert into the script to get their attention and empty the praises. No matter the rest of the script and the sloppy direction. <br /> <br /> Watch Julio Medem. If Herzog can make a film like Medem, then I could re-check his old movies and try to find talent in them.
