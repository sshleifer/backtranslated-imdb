Don't waste 90 minutes of your time in "Fast Food, Fast Women". It's an annoyingly episodic script with three lines narrated together it's ridiculously bad due to predictable writing, horrible acting, and even bad music. I found the main anorexic character upset to look at whenever he was on the screen. He needs fast food. <br /> <br /> Spend the 90 minutes you spend on this turkey doing something more exciting ... like cutting your toenails. You would have more value for entertainment. <br /> <br /> The only saving thing in this film is Louise Lasser, but she deserves much better than this tired script. He is as helpless as the old boy who woos in the film. <br /> <br /> VIEWER BEWARE!
