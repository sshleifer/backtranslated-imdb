This was the first sequel I saw (apart from the return of Jafar) and I honestly thought before looking at it that it would be close to the original. I was horribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The plot was, in practice, the first script with some more characters and the situation was reversed. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody who is not satisfied with life on earth. She wants to be a mermaid. However, Ariel kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her, and when Melody finds out she is angry and angry. And then he decides to run away, and she becomes a siren. So he's happy to swim around, and Ariel decides to find her - like a mermaid. <br /> <br /> The story does not seem badly written, but the clich√©s and repetitions of situations in the first film are just too obvious. And adding the fact that Melody is, on the whole, extremely annoying, and the film becomes almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of other new characters: Tip and Dash are two of them. They are not bad as characters in themselves - just try not to think of Timon or Pumbaa! The songs leave a lot to be desired, they simply don't have the same magical energy of the original songs. Obviously the animation did not have a full workload, in some parts it is nervous, and not much imagination is used for character movements. <br /> <br /> Another tip: try to forget the original Ariel character while watching this movie. The beautiful, rebellious and curious teenager has become "grown up" in a bland and boring wife and mother, and her red hair is all tied up. This is much more visible if you've never seen the original - you won't have anything to compare it to. <br /> <br /> However, all in all, it could have been worse, it's not as bad as some other sequels, like Cinderella II. But it is not in the same league as the original. But for your collection if nothing else, if Disney goes on like this, they will lose all the big fans.
