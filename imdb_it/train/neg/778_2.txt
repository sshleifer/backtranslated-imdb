What has Ireland ever done for film distributors who try to represent the country in such a pejorative way? This film begins as a primer for film students on Irish film clichés: unctuous priests, spits before handshakes, cattle markets in the square, country lawn cycling against anodine folk music. Quickly, however, it becomes clear that the main theme of the film is the great Daddy-O of Irish Cliches - religious conflict. It's about a Protestant woman who wants to decide where her Catholic father's son is educated, which would seem like a fairly reasonable desire, even if it's not for the villagers in the Wexford County of the 1950s with whom he has to live. Instead of sending them to a Catholic school, he decides to leave for Belfast, then in Scotland, where clichés are rare. While she is there, her father (who looks strangely like George Lucas) and his family are subjected to a boycott, which becomes very bad. I'm not going to give the final, not because I think people should go see this movie, but because it's not very interesting. One of the problems with the film is the central character: we should sympathize with her, but in the end we urge her to get a life. The villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be questioned, but traumatizing your children seems an inappropriate way to deal with them. Moreover, he assumes burdens that he stumbles under the wild point of view when he tries to draw analogies with the current peace process in Northern Ireland: the woman is told by her lawyer that "she must establish the preconditions" for her return. The film is supposedly based on a true story, but the themes have been treated in a much more imaginative way, and with less recourse to trite and worn clichés in the past.
