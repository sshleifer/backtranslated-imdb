this film is just an excuse for the writer to make a film about 2 failed scripts. <br /> <br /> his characters are just a set of characters with tragic or comic clich√© attributes whose sum total is a neurotic dialogue as only Woody Allen could write. the woman loves this because it is like looking in the mirror so they will enjoy this movie probably <br /> <br /> this movie was not appreciated by me anyway because there was no car chase and even the movie didn't have any combat. there weren't even drug lords or gang bangers. Not to mention the lack of snakes. This film has no snakes. It's not my cup of tea and maybe not your ether, so think about what I said before you find yourself watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Unless you look like a woman who has weight problems, the man loves sex and the city and mcbeal ally then this is meaningful to you.
