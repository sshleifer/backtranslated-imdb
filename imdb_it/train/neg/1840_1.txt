This must be the most brutally funny "comedy" I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Christopher Walken as a crazed bum CAN'T make me laugh? Something must be wrong with this picture. This is the only movie I've ever heard of coming out. I used the free passes and still felt like I wanted my money back. I can say with all my heart that the only film I've ever seen worse than this was HOUSE OF THE DEAD. The only. worse. movie. I laughed slightly at the carousel scene, that's all. Spending 2 hours in something advertised as a comedy should make you more of a laugh, right? I don't know, I guess the filmmakers thought "flan" was a funny word, or something. And the other bar is actually beating a dead horse - literally.
