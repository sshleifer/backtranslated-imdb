The version of this film I saw was called "Horror Rises from the Tomb". The horror in question is an evil medieval magician played by the Spanish horror legend Paul Naschy who looks like he is playing Abanazer in a panto of the church hall. He rises from his grave when a stupid descendant (I think he is a descendant, as he is also played by Naschy) returns to his ancestral home and brings together the head and body of the magician, who had been separated from the sorcerers who executed him, in one tries to stop him, er, rising from the grave. <br /> <br /> Obviously, once the head and body are back together, all hell breaks loose and many people die. Like all good wizards, Abanazer has a lovely assistant here. This is played by another great Spanish horror, the beautiful Helga Line. Like virtually every other woman in the film Line periodically gets her kit. There is a lot of nudity in this film, and not just feminine - we can also see Naschy's pot-bellied body, which is not a pretty sight, I can tell you. Most of the film's sexual angle is ridiculously free. There is a particularly amusing scene in which Naschy and Line discuss their evil plans and then suddenly decide they both have a bunch of the young unmarried blonde they owned. <br /> <br /> It is also quite gory in some places - in particular a Herschell The moment of Gordon Lewis in which Line throws his hands in a man's chest to take his heart out. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is the rather effective zombies that turn towards the end. However, they are quickly frightened by the fire and do not bother to go back. It's a shame. The scene in which the zombies rise, however, is the most amazing moment in the film. It all happens at close range, and we didn't have the slightest idea of ​​what's going on until we see some figures moving away from the distance. There are several moments of garbage like this, thanks above all to poor editing. When a worker falls under the hypnotic spell of Naschy's head there is a great close-up of his face that seems to last forever and has no purpose. <br /> <br /> All in all, not a great horror movie, but fun enough. Of course, the version I saw was a dubbed American version that was probably cut to pieces. As far as I know, the original Spanish version could be a masterpiece ...
