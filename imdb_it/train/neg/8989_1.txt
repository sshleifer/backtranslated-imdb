There are some positive things about the film. Music and cinematography are great. Alex Wilson is sexy and gives great performances. Even Ryan Bauer is hot. The production was very fortunate to have expressed them because they really give value to the production of the film. Even Jonny Vincent (Sean) and many of the non-speaking boys in the film are nice. Why is the actress who plays Amy not listed in the credits? Brandon Alexander makes a great comic performance like Clitarissa Pink. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the film is probably the star, James Townsend. He cannot act. He is also very thin, not at all nice to look at. His arms are like spaghetti. That's disgusting. They have no muscle tone. No wonder he has to make his film and throw himself into it. No one else would have thrown it into anything. James Townsend is not credible as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he behaves so gay. They should have thrown someone else into the lead if they wanted what's best for the movie. Then again, maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to launch a career in soft-core porn, definitely not real acting because he would take some acting lessons. Also, anyone who does porn is blacklisted in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the casting of a tan-skinned Latina like Devon's mother. Sonja Fisher doesn't look like an actress at all. All in all, this film is a soft-core porn and it's not better than something you'd see on Skinemax. I think Alex Wilson, probably the best thing about this movie, is also embarrassed by this and doesn't want to be associated with it. There is no photo on his IMDb page and nothing else listed, so Alex Wilson is probably a throwaway name. Also, I met him in West Hollywood once recently and when I mentioned this film, he turned and left. I see. If I had worked on this film, I would be embarrassed and I didn't even want to be associated with it.
