Lame's plot and two-dimensional screenplay make the characters look like cardboard cutouts. Needless to say, this made it difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters, especially the boyfriend; It looked and acted more like a cartoon. In short, I imagine you could say he was on par with the typical TV drama. It uses almost all the clich√©s in the book. The classic tortured musician who wants to burst and play salsa. The free-spirited girlfriend engaged in a "bean counter" personality who does not love. I won't list them otherwise it would be a spoiler because I would give away the whole plot. The dance was OK but nothing special. I've seen worse. 3 stars for good music. The band was really tense. I saw it on YouTube. Fortunately, I didn't pay a good price to see him in a theater. I'm still a bit shocked by how many good reviews this movie has garnished.
