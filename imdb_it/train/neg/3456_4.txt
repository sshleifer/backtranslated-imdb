Everyone in this film tells Raffy Carruthers how good she is, what a great director it will be someday, etc. I think they're just nice. Even Kimble Rendall, who directed this film, shows more talent than her. "The next Jane Campion", they call her; and, regardless of the fact that both are overvalued, the two have much in common. Both direct the films. They are both women. They are both Australian. (Well, give or take.) <br /> <br /> Yes: it's one of those movies where a character is considered brilliant, and we just have to swallow and accept it. But I'll say it for Carruthers: it's pretty. - And fascinating. Not really. Here are some thoughts on his lack of talent: <br /> <br /> (1) Part of a director's talent is dealing with people. Why are the Carruthers so phenomenal as to convince their crew to take notice? In order to make it easier for everyone to wander off the set and be killed, I expect. <br /> <br /> (2) Why is this one of the most convincing images of a film set I've ever seen? After all, it must have been shot on a REAL movie set. How could they be wrong? If Rendall's set was half of a mess under the table, it's surprising that he completed his film. <br /> <br /> (3) Carruthers - the imaginary director - has set himself the task of creating a new 80s horror film brand. Great opportunity. I doubt it could be done in these days. I suspect that Rendall - the current and most talented director - has given himself the same task, understood that it could not be done and was satisfied (sighing) with a parody instead. Of course, it is NOT ENOUGH that a parody functions as a parody. As soon as the cast and crew set foot in the isolated villa, the film spends most of its time hurting what the 1980s horror did ... well, thank goodness. <br /> <br /> (4) Yet, yet ... the film opens not with a parody but with an honest-good pastiche of the 80s horror, starring (too good to be true) Molly Ringwald . This pastiche is much better than anything that follows. (It's a bad sign when you find yourself wanting to watch the movie in the film rather than the movie.) Yet, this film was also shot in the late 90s. Perhaps it is still possible to do the horror of the 1980s. You just have to abandon the parody knowledge and believe it. <br /> <br /> (5) I would never have wondered what the 80's teen horror would have been if all the characters had Australian accents, but now I know. And strangely, I'm glad to know. A need I never knew I had was fulfilled.
