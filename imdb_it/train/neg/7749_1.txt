This film should never have been made. From badly made animation, to acting beyond evil. I'm not sure at what point the people behind this movie said "Ok, it looks good! Leave it!" I was enchanted by how awful this movie really was. At some point, which may have been the WORST point, a tooth generated by a gold tooth falls from the stabbed roof the idiot creator of the cats in the mouth ... uh, ooookkkk. The villain of the film was a paralyzed sabretooth who was killed a few minutes after his first appearance. The other two manage to kill a handful of people before being burned and torn to pieces. Then, there is a random waiting for victims in the jungle ... which scares me for one reason only. Will there be a second part? God, for the sake of humans, wherever I hope not. <br /> <br /> This film was pure junk. From the strength point of view, clear the credits until the end of the presentation.
