I'm writing this because I felt somehow believing that Dark Remains was a good movie. Although it's not the worst I've ever seen, it's certainly not good. <br /> <br /> A weak screenplay, weak actors and a weak direction. Even if they can't afford the cast of a big name, would it be too much to ask for a more attractive actress? It was painful to watch a simple actress in the film with her boring performance. The story was a clich√© and poorly scripted. The special effects were minimal. The "suspense" tricks used repeatedly here were hard to swallow. <br /> <br /> To be honest, Dark Remains is no worse than some of the Masters of Horrors episodes. But not quite on par with quality films yet. Dark Remains is recommended only for hardcore horror fans who don't want to miss any movies in the genre, even if it's badly done. As with anyone else, time should be spent on something more precious - which should be extremely easy.
