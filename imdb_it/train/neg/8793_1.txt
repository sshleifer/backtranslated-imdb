For those who decide whether or not to watch this film and are reading these comments by intuition, first of all I offer these four words: Don't waste time! "Chungking Express" was shot badly, quickly slapped and it looks like it was conceived in its entirety by someone in a row at a Kong King in Hong Kong. I don't remember ever seeing a movie with an assortment of one-dimensional characters trying to make their way through such a trivial script! It is an absurd effort with a philosophically ridiculous dialogue (a man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers the extraordinary revelation that "tears can be dried with a tissue, but water takes time to dry"). The same character is also seen with a deep and meaningful relationship with his towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, etc. The flickering, wandering, freehand photographic work was another annoying feature that I could have done without. And if this isn't enough to make you throw up in your popcorn, let's hear the old 60s "California Dreaming" by Mamas and Papas that resonate on the soundtrack again and again during a particularly long sequence. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through his company Rolling Thunder Productions, although I can't for the life of me understand why a man with his talent would care. He was known to have observed, "I'm happy to love a movie so much." Many of us, however, hope that he will focus on making his audience happy with other discoveries worthy of being useful in the future.
