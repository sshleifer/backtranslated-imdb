Manoj Agrawal after the failure of PARDESI BABU (1998) is back with this film <br /> <br /> The film has Govinda in roles 8-9, as his father, mother, grandfather, sister and later also has disguises < br /> <br /> In short, he is a useless detective who sends a friend to a case to get evidence against his wife, whose photos he misses at the airport while he flirts with Rani <br /> <br /> He disguised himself as Sardarji in the plane and again as a girl The fun part is how easily and quickly does it? <br /> <br /> Then he disguises himself as a French singer and enters a TV to get rehearsals lol and then as a maharashtrian (yes in the TV itself) <br /> <br /> The rest of the film has the same mistaken identities and ends with a predictable note There are some funny scenes like Govinda being hit by an African and also many other portions <br /> <br /> Manoj Agrawal's direction is ok Music is ok <br / > <br /> Among the actors, Govinda proves to be one of the most watchable actors. As usual he is a tastic fan but he played in these roles before he fits too well into all the roles and interpretations, even if the long-awaited roles 6-7 are not part of the film. Rani looks fat, teams up with Govinda who is She is nothing exceptional and kept doing this kind of role. Among other things Nirmal Pandey is as usual Johny Lever is too loud at times and funny in places in 1 role and irritates while the old Tinnu Anand is ok Satish Kaushik is fun, Paresh is ok Tanaaz is ok
