** Possible spoilers in advance ** <br /> <br /> Jason (a.k.a. Herb) Evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who, together with his wife Virginia Leith, is involved in the most insignificant car accident ever seen. Leith is beheaded and the doctor takes his cut pumpkin in his villa and rejuvenates his head in his laboratory. The exterior of the villa was supposedly filmed on the Lyndhurst estate in Tarrytown; the lab scenes were apparently shot in someone's basement. The banded head is kept alive on "laboratory equipment" that is cheap enough for Ed Wood. Part of the library's music is the highlight of the film, then he appeared in Andy Milligan's THE BODY BENEATH. Leith's head has some heavy metaphysical talk with another of Ever's misadventures, a mutant chained in the closet. Meanwhile, the good doctor turns his joints in search of a body worthy of his wife's gabby noodle. The finish, in uncut prints, presents a splatter and a dismemberment in advance when the monster with the pumpkin head comes out of the closet to bring the film into a welcome closure. This thing took three years to be released and then, the public gave him the bad reception he widely deserved. Among these, PLAN 9 FROM THE EXTERNAL SPACE and a few others, 1959 should have been declared the year of Turkey.
