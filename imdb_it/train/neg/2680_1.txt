Brokedown Palace is not the kind of film I'd like to see. Furthermore, I didn't like the film when some Australians smuggled drugs into Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of drug smuggling. I wouldn't go to that country, no matter what after seeing this movie. In fact, this film stinks. I prefer to visit Germany to meet beautiful single women. Germany is the country I tolerate. I'd rather stay in the United States. After seeing some of the movies in the theater, including the false drug smuggling charge, I left the theater and got my money back because I can't tolerate this movie. If you go to Thailand to meet someone who could be a drug dealer, forget it!
