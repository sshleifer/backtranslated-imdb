I'm sorry, but this may have been scary in 1978 when it came out, but in modern times it doesn't hold water. The only interesting scene in the entire film is the opening scene in which Michael kills his sister, Judith, who wears his Halloween mask. The most surprising moment of the whole film is when his parents tear off the mask to see his son kill his daughter. The film descends from there and does not resume until the last fifteen minutes, but it is too late, the audience has lost all interest in the story. There is barely a development of the character, and people are always enthusiastic about the fact that Laurie is an exceptional heroine, when there isn't really much for her. I'm sorry to disagree with everyone who is terrified of this movie, but if you want a great horror movie go see The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. These are the two best horror movies ever made. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. I can't believe that Roger Ebert gave four stars, because it is not possible that this film could ever deserve such a high score.
