Well, I'll start by admitting I'm not a fan of John Ford. (I saw "The Informer" just because I'm trying to open up a "big" list.) So if you are, go ahead, because you don't agree with me. /> <br /> What a boring and dated stupidity this is! I will say that there is a good idea for a film here (it made me think about how few films there are on the Irish revolution) but, as usual, Ford is determined to bury it under excessive and inexpensive sentiment. I suppose it's a bit interesting to watch for a while to see the transition that was far from fluid from the "talkie" silences - the acting styles of some of the major ones have that quality of overbroad endemic to early films and films feel like they could play better with the title of a spoken dialogue. (Obviously, the title cards would prevent Ford from repeating every single emotion six times). Usually the dialogue has a "I'm always behind me Lucky Charms!" quality that is compounded by the fact that every actor seems to have been allowed to use their own version of an Irish accent. Of course, as bad as they are, the accents are useful in reminding us that we're in Ireland because the sets seem to have been drawn from a piece of German expressionism filmed on the next stage. (It feels as if, with the eye of an eagle, some villagers could be seen setting fire to Dr. Frankenstein in the background.) <br /> <br /> The techniques change. Tastes change. So I don't want to say how crazy it is that this movie was so acclaimed in its time. But it's not one of the classics that hold up - plus simply a "fair warning" about the over-simplified kind of malarkey that Ford would have dedicated his career to.
