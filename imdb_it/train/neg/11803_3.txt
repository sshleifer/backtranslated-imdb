When someone remakes a classic film, the remake is always unfavorable compared to the original. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the remake is so radically different from being too unfamiliar to the public. <br /> <br /> Well, the 1973 TV version of "Double Indemnity" has scenes and dialogues almost identical to the original of 1944. The main difference is that the remake seems to have no energy. Fred MacMurray was as good as the greedy and contemptuous insurance agent Walter Neff in the original; Richard Crenna seems tired and tired of the world. Edward G. Robinson brought great manic energy to his role as head of MacMurray, Barton Keys; Lee J. Cobb, a good actor, seems almost bored by the proceedings. Samantha Eggar is completely wrong as Phyllis Dietrichson, conniving and with the last stabs; while Barbara Stanwyck was superb in this evil role, Eggar is overly polite and polite and really seems out of place. Robert Webber, in the old role of Richard Gaines as head of Robinson Norton, and John Fiedler taking the role of Porter Hall as a crucial witness, bringing some life to the film. In particular, Webber recreates the role of Norton in a context of the 70s. <br /> <br /> However, after the film began, the whole thing is right there, with no life or electricity. This is a film that should never have been redone.
