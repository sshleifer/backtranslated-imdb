The first question that comes to mind after seeing this garbage is who ever gave these idiots the right to use the name of Omen in this movie? It's a pathetic, embarrassing, pathetic attempt to carry on the Omen franchise. When the film starts, the supporting music seems to have been raised directly by a Bugs Bunny Cartoon and from that moment on the film gets worse! I don't know who wrote the script, but I bet they received an E - that's why they picked it up to show their teacher! After a while it is difficult to understand if this is a comedy because what happens is so funny and so not faithful to the original Omen that generates belief. The acting is ridiculous, especially from the protagonist Faye Grant. continues to pull stupid faces or find it hard not to laugh? It is difficult to say. The worst sequel I've ever had the misfortune of being a witness. 1 in 10.
