Great western, I hear you all say! Brilliant first effort! Well, I'm not sure about the movie you saw, but it must have been different from what I saw. Great western movies or even good films of any genre have characters you can believe in and this movie didn't have any! The acting was nothing short of poor and I didn't care about any of the characters, making the whole movie useless. the story was too big for the creators and maybe they should have tried to make the waste of cheap television drastic, as seen in those "FACT OR FICTION" programs on science fiction. <br /> <br /> Please, if you are looking for a good movie, a great western or even an hour and a half pleasant, please look elsewhere.
