When I read the back of the DVD case, I thought it sounded really interesting ... so ... I had my mom put in the stack of movies in the "4 for 20 dollars" section of Blockbuster. When we got home and went down in the movie ... after twenty minutes, we found ourselves shooting "this sucks, we put something else". I have to admit that some of the jokes from friends at the bar made us smile a little. But come on, at least get some decent actors! Every once in a while, if the acting is bad and the movie is not going at a painfully slow pace and actually looks interesting, I can gut it and have a few laughs about how they ended up (or not) making their lines. But I can only take so much. The crying scenes seemed as if the actors had hysterical laughter, there was no trace of their lines ... the amateur didn't approach acting in this movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone who came here to say that this movie was good must have been on some REALLY good drugs while they were watching the movie. It's the most useless thing I've ever had the displeasure of looking at. DO NOT LOOK OR BUY THIS MOVIE !!!!!
