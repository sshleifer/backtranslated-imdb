The plot certainly seemed quite interesting. How can a brutal murder in real life turn into a really boring movie? Well, you can see "Wonderland" and find out. I had heard of the Wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an interesting story about some genuinely sadistic people. Unfortunately, the character development is zero, so we never have the chance to understand why nothing was done or to have a good sense of the interrelationships between the characters. The rhythm of the management was very boring. This leads to an extraordinarily boring film. <br /> <br /> Given that Dawn Schiller - a central character like Holmes's girlfriend - was an associate producer and that Holmes's wife was a film consultant, we should have had the opportunity to get a real view of the characters.
