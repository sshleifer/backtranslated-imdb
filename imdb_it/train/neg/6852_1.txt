This movie is really amazing. I've seen so many cheap trash movies, especially a lot of "Full Moon" -Pictures, but "Dollman" is really hard. So much joins: the laughable story, the actors always on the margins of parody and special effects! How long could I talk about it! It's a really bad film, but also one of the most fun. If you are a fan of bad movies to laugh, you have to see it. And don't miss Dollman vs. Demonic Toys'. It's really more fun and worse.
