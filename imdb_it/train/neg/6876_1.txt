Yes, this was an incredible condescending babble. We know that the French often have a distorted idea of ​​the United States, they are Puritanism and opinions about sex. As an American (Hoosier) living in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. And while some of these preconceived notions may be true, NOT AN ELEMENT of the Midwestern city portrayed in this film has really played. A man who never had sex because he was told at school 20 years before his penis was too big? Where in the world will you find it? A jukebox in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass? A city with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from Chicago, but without big service stations, no TV at home, no McDonalds, no children ... A population that knows the intimate details of the other and that meets inexorably like a big family that hates each other. Do adult males plant cushions in local cafes, have farms but don't collect, kill the guy they don't like in front of everyone and seem to get along and all with the same emotions? The freed French girl who will ruin the 17-year-old virgin because of her sexual generosity, the too-big meat guy who goes from cornfield to the simple breath of an Illinois breeze to help deflower this same boy from years? HELP! I am so baffled and amazed by the absurdity of this film that I am not expressing clearly how ridiculous it is. Go see it for the A to Z primer on what to avoid. Damn, I hope I didn't ruin it for you!
