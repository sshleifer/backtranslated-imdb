This movie is really stupid! I saw him as an 11 year old, and even then I thought it was pretty ridiculous! I would recommend this film only to children under the age of 12. I didn't care much, but I think it answers some very good questions that children need to be aware of, such as: 1) Does money buy happiness? 2) Should I lie (to my parents) about things that I think would not approve? 3) Does money buy friendships? 4) Is money everything? 5) Shouldn't I tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me? Of course, these are very unrealistic situations, but I think that if the parents discussed these problems with their children, maybe they should also watch this video, in order to show / scare their children that lies have the potential to hurt you .
