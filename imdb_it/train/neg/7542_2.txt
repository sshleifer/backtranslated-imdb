This film should be a mysterious, serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl. However, 30 minutes into the film, it turns into a fun and unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes. I can't imagine anyone not laughing when Cate casually kicks that blonde girl or when she "bears" that old lady. The lines, the characters and the acting are all badly done from the beginning. I've always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but this year he made some terrible films; this is by far the worst (yet ...). <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see an intense thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, go and rent the original. However, if you're going to watch it, be prepared to laugh about some of the lines and the final scenes rather than taking them seriously; it's the only way to enjoy this movie.
