In my day as a usher "Private Lessons" he played on the 4-plex I was working on. It was a dormant success selling off Friday and Saturday nights for several weeks. I've never been able to see it but I saw it was on cable last weekend, so I decided to try it. What I saw for the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies I've ever seen and one that made me terribly uncomfortable to watch. <br /> <br /> The basic story is a teenager who wants her sexy maid (Sylvia Kristel). She also seems to feel an attraction towards the boy, but for more sinister reasons. Then we see scenes of the boy watching her undress and she invites him to watch. And it goes from there. <br /> <br /> Eric Brown, as the teenager, must be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. His "scared" reactions to whenever Sylvia takes off a dress or when she touches it is horrible. I didn't laugh once during this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> And let's not start with the maid's subplot and the driver who plans to extort money from the boy. Let's just say it's about pretending a death, burying a body ... I could go on, but it gets more ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes are the worst I've ever seen. Even though Eric Brown was older then, the fact is that he looks like a child. He seems to have no idea how to kiss a woman (if THIS was acting then maybe I should think back to my criticisms of Brown) and he got too close to the border with child pornography to be erotic. I've never been so upset by a sex scene, even though Miss Kristel is pretty nice with and without clothes. <br /> <br /> ** NOTICE SPOILER ** I must mention the last scene. For me it is simply sick, but I can remember the exultant public while the film freezes and dissolves into credits. Our hero returns to school and begins a flirtation with one of the female teachers. He asks her out to dinner and she looks at him as if Tom Cruise had just asked them out. He nods affirmatively and walks away, smiling at the camera as a sign of triumph. GIVE ME A BREAK! Yes, I'm sure teachers everywhere would risk everything just for a simple-looking boy. <br /> <br /> I will never understand the appeal that this film had in 1982. It certainly was more than nudity because there were many comedies for teenagers with nudity that they bombed at the box office. And to think that these same teenagers who cheered that film 22 years ago are now working on company scales and perhaps helping to manage this country. THAT is a scary thought.
