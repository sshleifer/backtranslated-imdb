My first question after seeing this film was "Why is the title LIAM?" If the intent was to tell a story from the boy's point of view, it was not performed well. Of course there was the formidable use of camera angles in the boy's scenes, but much of the crucial action took place outside his field of vision. Having a "main" character unable to speak (obviously suggesting the mute and helpless position of a child) makes it difficult to give that character much depth. <br /> <br /> Melodrama is defined as: "dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotyped characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simplistic morality and conflict" LIAM adapts this definition to a T. The spectator is hit in the lead with the typical stereotypes of the Catholic Church of fire and sulfur in the school of stern marm and the well-fed priest who squeezed money from the parishioners. (A stereotype that is becoming very boring.) Furthermore, Jewish characters are money lenders and factory owners! <br /> <br /> Much of the film was predictable ... Who didn't think we would see Theresa cleaning the toilet after her mother told her "No daughter will clean another woman's bathroom!" I'm a fan of British realism if it's done right. In my opinion, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
