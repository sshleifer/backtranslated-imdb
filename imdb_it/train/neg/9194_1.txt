Ok, first of all, I'm a big fan of zombie movies. I loved all of Romero's films and I liked the reconstruction of Dawn of the Dead. So when I heard all the critics criticizing this film, I was still optimistic. I mean, critics hated Resident Evil, and although it might not be a particularly good movie, I liked it, if it weren't for the fact that it was just a funny zombie with a decent storyline. This however, is pure shit. Terrible dialogue, absurd plot and video game scenes included in the film. Whoever is right thinks it was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the term freely) that I liked is Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name casts originality out the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he is in a terrible film and that he could even make the best of it. Everyone else behaves as if they were doing Shakespeare. And very bad I could add. Basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you.) You're a great zombie and you have to see every zombie done or b.) I like playing MST3K, the home game. Watch it with friends and get ready for tons of involuntary laughter. <br /> <br />
