If ever there was a movie that deserved a big zero score, it's this shit pile. I love zombie movies and even the bad ones usually have something to do for them, but not this atrocity. Actually I started feeling angry watching this movie because it's so insultingly poor, I can't believe the people responsible for this would think it was acceptable. <br /> <br /> There is no plot and the plot is not cut with scenes of sadism and spanking. People do not react, act or resemble human beings in any way. The entire film is also shot in two rooms decorated in a way that vaguely resembles the places they should be. The whole thing is a useless mess, it's not going anywhere and when the zombies finally appear they look like garbage and don't do much. <br /> <br /> I could make a better film than this, so you could and so could someone who had never seen a movie before. It is pitiful and undoubtedly the worst film of all time. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the worst movie of all time. You will notice that the only positive reviews give a 10/10 and urge you to BUY the DVD. I can't imagine that nobody is neutral in thinking this is a good movie, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> 0/10 and this is generous.
