I gave this film a high rating of 2 stars, as I personally appear in the 42 and 43 minutes of the movie .... the side street bar scene in Russia. In this scene the film's director offered me the immortal line - "50 dollars ... drink and talk", but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak with a more convincing Russian accent than I could, so I refused to take this talking part. I was a little extravagant because this was my first film experience ... and who knows ... these lines could have ended up there with phrases like "I'll be Back" and "Quite Frankly My Dear, I Do not Dare a cursed one ". If I talked about a line, my name would appear in the Rancid Aluminum credits like "Heavy 1" instead of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /> <br /> As time goes by, I feel fortunate that my name is in no way related to this movie. <br /> <br /> Even though I spent a whole day on set, in South Wales Hot Spot, Barry Island, no one could tell me what the real storyline was. The restaurateurs and the lady of the wardrobe all agree that there seems to be bad words and nudity ... things could certainly be worse if I ended up naked in this terrible movie .... <br /> <br / > Still ..... On the positive side .... I chatted with Rhys Ifans during a break. I had no idea who it was, since "Notting Hill" had yet to be published, and not a suspicion that it could be Welsh. I made several inappropriate comments about how horrible the Barry Island pit had been since my childhood visited there in the 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen appeared that I realized I was in a quality production ........
