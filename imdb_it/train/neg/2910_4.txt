The highlight of this film for me was undoubtedly Tom Hanks. Like Mike Sullivan, he was definitely against the type and showed he could handle a non-traditional role (for him). Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - what you like, admire and cheer. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. It is true that in the context of this film he appeared somewhat noble - his aim was to avenge the murders of his wife and younger son. Even so, he was already a gangster and a murderer before those murders. So Hanks played a role I never expected from him, and he did well. <br /> <br /> Apart from the good performance of Hanks, however, I certainly can't call it a funny movie. After an opening that I would describe as enigmatic (it wasn't clear to me where he was going for a while) it turns into a very gloomy film, on the complicated relationships that Sullivan developed as a gangster - largely relieved by Rooney (Paul Newman) , which is a kind of mafia boss, and is trying to raise his two children and keep them "clean" so to speak; isolated from his business. After the eldest son witnessed a murder, the band tries to kill him to keep him silent, gets the wrong son (and mother) and leaves Sullivan and his eldest son (Mike, Jr.) on the run. It becomes a strange kind of father / son bonding film. <br /> <br /> Even if it ends with a slightly promising note (at least in the general context of the story) it is really very dark everywhere, that mood is reinforced with many scenes shot in the dark and torrential rains. I must confess that while I enjoyed Hanks' performance, the film as a whole didn't let me in. 4/10
