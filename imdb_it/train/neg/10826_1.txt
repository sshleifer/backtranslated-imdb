I can't say that this is the worst film of all time, but only because there are still some films I haven't seen yet! This must be the most pretentious attempt to make a film of all time! The director suffers from the same problems he had with "There Will Be Blood" (even though it wasn't so bad in that movie. The whole movie looks like you're looking at a guy trying to impress beyond his abilities. It's like if he sat in his little director's chair and thought "how could a great director handle this scene?" He didn't really have it in him. I don't know if this film could be saved by a great director. that could have been polished, but nothing was brought to maturity. The scene in which all the characters are singing was the worst moment in movie history, one by one as we see the characters sing, and I squirmed in my place I kept saying "please, PLEASE, don't let the boy die about singing too!" Of course, a serious mistake!
