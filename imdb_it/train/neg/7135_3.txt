I'm sorry to say that there really is no way, in my opinion, that an Enzo would really be able to keep up with a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The advantage of weighing in power owned by the S7 would simply be too large. S7 has a power: weight ratio of 3.93 lbs / hp while Enzo has 4.61 lbs / hp. Even the low-end S7 is much better. Sorry Ferrari fans, but Saleen did a lot better. <br /> <br /> As for other parts of this film, I just have to say that it is so poor as to be pathetic. The story is too weak. Acting in this lemon is worse than daytime soaps. <br /> <br /> I can say that, although it is a treatise on negative psychology, it is a kind of gem. This film is nothing if not a glaring definition of what narcissism and sociopathy are. It's all thanks to these rich punks who leave behind while showing only traces of mock remorse for all the innocent road users who also cause injuries or death. <br /> <br /> I can't give the film a "1 star" rating because it didn't force me out of the theater. I also think having an incredibly beautiful brunette with murderous blue eyes as the female protagonist avoids him from being completely abysmal ... even if it's not possible that his singing style puts her on the cover of 'Variety'. <br /> <br /> ps: the guy who plays Jason is SOOOOO the skid row version of James Vanderbeek.
