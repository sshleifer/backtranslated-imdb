Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow is a typical adolescence of the 50s in the turbulent film. It's not a horror or science fiction movie. The plot concerns a group of teenagers who are about to be thrown out of their "hot rod" club because they can't meet the rent. Once hunted, they decide to try an old haunted house. The only redeeming feature of the film is that the "ghost" (Paul Blaisdell in the costume of She Creature) turns out to be a monster of a jobless movie starring Blaisdell.
