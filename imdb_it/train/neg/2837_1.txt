The Derek 80s produced some decent offers to get the title of "worst movie of all time", and this is probably their first result in these episodes. In fact, this film can be considered as belonging to the "so bad, it's good" category, right there with the products of the likes of Edward Wood Jr. or Doris Wishman. This explains IMDb's voting model for this film with some people giving top marks. Anthony Quinn made a strange shady film in his day, but this ghostly performance is incredibly bad, he has to be seen to be believed.
