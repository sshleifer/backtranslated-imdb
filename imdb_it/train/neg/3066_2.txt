This is a terrible remake of a marginal but well-liked film from the early 1970s. I saw the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20-minute film "packed" in 2 hours or whatever the execution time. Style plot, which, by the way, is completely different from the original. The main government involvement was far-fetched. There is no flow from one scene to another. In the original one could go for a beer or go to the bathroom and keep up the pace. <br /> <br /> It took only a few hours to film the oil sump on the machine. It takes many times longer than that in real life. The car guys notice this stuff. In addition, the fool or fools who chose to destroy a 1968 magazine and abuse a 1970 Challenger should be hit with bullets. The fact that they are not "people in the car" is painfully obvious and their disappearance will not be pained. <br /> <br /> The actors had no emotion, everything was cut and dried. A step above a monotone. A barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic. <br /> <br /> Last but certainly not least, the radio DJ made the statement that the Challenger hit the 180 or 185 (??) bulldozers. This is total garbage. Can you tell the aerodynamics, or the lack of that ?? Hahahaha !! This film is a joke. Don't waste your time watching this.
