Primal Species comes from the B Legend of the movie Roger Corman and as such all those who watch this must realize that this is a Low Budget B movie and knows it. <br /> <br /> A group of high-jack terrorists a truck and kill an entire army by doing so, they believe it may contain uranium, but No ..... Contains two Dino with a taste for Human Flesh ... Then a Crack team, which could also be called Delta Force, is called in. <br /> <br /> OK, this is not Jurassic Park, and yes I Dino's are never seen clearly because it is obviously a guy in costume who is not very different from Barney the dinosaur - only slightly LESS scary, but come on guys this has about 1% of Jurassic Park's budget and as such does what it can. <br /> <br /> Does this deserve to be in the 100 fund? .... HELL NO !!! I think almost half of the voters who give this 1 - are too hard, it's much closer to a 4 ... actually it's much better than a series of other films not in the Bottom 100, and has a production value similar to a production of Sci-Fi channels. (again Film that gets an excessively hard time from the critics here on IMDb) <br /> <br /> The acting is as expected in a B movie, even though neither of the actors takes it seriously, nor the script <br / > <br /> All in All is a pleasant film B - Not for Snobs movies <br /> <br /> ** on *****
