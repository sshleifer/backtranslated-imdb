Imagine turning the American national anthem into a cartoon. Throw a couple of cute animals, some terrible word games and a pair of roller skates and you'll end up with an almost exact replica of this movie. I remember seeing him when I was younger; I made my mother rent it from the video store about 5 times. The story itself is not bad, it is just that every Marxist who looks would certainly have something to complain about. <br /> <br /> If you don't like America, you won't like this movie.
