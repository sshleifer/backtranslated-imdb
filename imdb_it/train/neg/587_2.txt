This film differs from the documentaries "wonder of the human body", courageously interpreting, if bizarrely, the choice to arouse disgust in the viewer. In one scene, the camera closes on a giant fifty-meter zit while a teenager squeezes the pus and liquid from it. In another, the camera is semi-submersible in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid while parts of a pasta salad fall from the esophagus and fall into the goo. In a last tour de force, the camera takes the viewer into a heartbreaking race through a forest of ... armpit hair as a teenager. Unfortunately, I'm not doing any of this. See this movie if it's necessary, but: bring your bag for vomiting and you've never eaten pasta salad.
