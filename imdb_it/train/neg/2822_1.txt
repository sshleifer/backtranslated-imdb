OMG this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen so much being a film student. I don't understand why Angelina Jolie would be in this movie? Did he need money so badly? I love AJ and have seen almost everything that has ever been so I saw this one tick another one out. It was SOO bad! Not bad either, just bad. He had 1 or 2 little funny moments but all in all it was bad and a waste of 101 minutes. I can't even say that AJ looked good in this because he didn't. The plot is predictable unless you expect a re-narration of Romeo and Juliet, so it's not like that. All in all disappointing. Maybe if your 12 could be a good movie, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.
