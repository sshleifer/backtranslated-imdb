First of all, let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie: "This film had to be dared. You know, like, 'DUDE, BET YOU MIGHT NOT MAKE THE WORST MOVIE EVER' With this film, they made an effort to achieve that title. The effects are, of course, poor. The plot / dialogue is like a collage of bits stolen from every horror B movie ever made. The actors, I suppose, should be in college. However parts of it (especially in the beginning) make it seem like they should be in middle school or above. It does not make sense. The Scarecrow that goes around killing people is not funny at all. (SPOILER: In the end, when they recite the name of Lester and reappears, the black boy and Scarecrow are both laughing, probably for the relief that they were in their last scene, and the cheese dialogue.)
