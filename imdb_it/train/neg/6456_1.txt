Well, what can be said of this disaster? I watched it because it went on a cable. I'm sorry for wasting my time, but at least I didn't waste money. <br /> <br /> The creature is the most cheerful you can get! Please, you must be very generous not to get angry with the ECONOMIC Halloween costume. Oh well, there are also horrible acting shows, f / x and dialogues. The comparison with the creature is incredible, you can't get a more pathetic scene. <br /> <br /> This is the worst you can get from movies directed to videos. "Creature Unknown" makes FULL MOON PICTURES movies like "Halloween". <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs, please. The only "positive" thing about this junk is sexy women.
