"Her Cardboard Lover" is Norma Shearer's latest film. He left the films and, I believe, joined the MGM Board of Directors. It was a good move on his part. "His cardboard lover" was a bit boring and partly boring. It was obvious that there were only a handful of actors with speaking parts, so they had many dialogues to keep this turkey afloat. <br /> <br /> The story was a good idea of ​​a rich woman (Norma Shearer) hiring a man (Robert Taylor) to make playboy girlfriend (George Sanders) jealous. I'm surprised the director, George Cukor, didn't cut many of the scenes that Mrs. Shearer and Mr. Taylor talked about. Mr. Cukor served Ms. Shearer well in "The Women" but not in this film. <br /> <br /> The best interpretation of the film was given by Robert Taylor. During Mr. Taylor's career, he was given his best comedy role in this film and "When Ladies Meet" in 1941. In 1942, he gave his best comedy in "Her Cardboard Lover" and, until then, the his best dramatic performance in "Johnny Eager". He had a busy year. I think of all the actors of MGM, Mr. Taylor worked with all the major and minor actresses of the lot. Furthermore, MGM gave Mr. Taylor all kinds of films to make - many of them have been successful. That's why MGM kept it for 25 years. <br /> <br /> Mr. George Sanders was very good as a socialite heel. He played a similar role eight years later in "All About Eve" for which he won an Oscar for a secondary role. As for Mrs. Shearer, this was one of her worst performances, it wasn't fun and dramatic for this comedy. It is strange that he made a great comedy in 1939, "The Women", and gave his best performance. It was obvious she was too old to look for her younger men in "Her Cardboard Lover". Also, it didn't help that some of his clothes were horrible. <br /> <br /> Too bad you and Mr. Taylor didn't make another dramatic film like their latest film together, the superb "Fuga". The same comments on this film can be said of another film, "Personal Property" that Mr. Taylor made in 1937 with Jean Harlow. He was too chatty, boring, and the actress looked old. Mrs. Harlow became ill throughout the film and no one in Hollywood realized she was telling her to go to the doctor, so in 1937 she died at the age of 26. What a waste! She was becoming a good actress and played better roles.
