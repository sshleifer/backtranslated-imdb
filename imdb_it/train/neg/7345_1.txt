I absolutely hate this program, what kind of people sit and watch this junk ?? OK, my father and my mother love it, but I make sure I'm fine out of the room before it arrives. It's so depressing and depressing, but the worst thing is the acting that doesn't bear all the detective programs like this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless. What happened to investigative programs with real mystery ??? I mean, who wants to know what happened to fictional characters that we don't know anything about what died more than 20 years ago ??? I wish the bbc put more comedy on bbc1 so now that the vicar of the end has finished, there is more room for crap like this.
