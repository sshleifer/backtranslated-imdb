"Iowa" wants to be "Requiem for a Dream" for the Midwest meth, but looks like a "Reefer Madness" with a hard R rating. <br /> <br /> Yes, drugs are bad and meth is horribly pernicious, like an addiction and how it destroys people, families and communities. But these characters who are dumb or ridiculous and the plot with open eyes will not teach that lesson to anyone. <br /> <br /> While screenwriter / director / star Matt Farnsworth has a certain charisma on the screen, his partner Diane Foster plays an innocent foolishly stupid and corrupt by the drug was already satiated by Susan Sarandon in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show "". I felt really sorry for her for all the totally useless nudity she had been subjected to. It was not until the end of the film that I realized that I had to think that these two were recent graduates to explain some of their naive, because we are bombarded by the photos of their school, but if so, they also seemed older than the people on "The OC." While they have good chemistry on screen, they are a pale imitation of a "Badlands" type couple. br /> <br /> Guest stars are misused, Michael T. Weiss, who was so good at "The Pretender" on TV, is completely ridiculous as a corrupt word officer and his brutal violence is simply crazy, since his character practically ruins all social significance for the film. Rosanna Arquette must be even thinner than she did with David Cronenberg as a very low Livia Soprano rent. John Savage even put the old baby boom excuses into my mouth about what I did, but that's worse. A Goth chick comes up with the strange explanation that she is a stripper in Des Moines. The obligatory Latin drug dealer appears - in Iowa? <br /> <br /> With a limited budget, the inner vision of using meth is represented quite vividly, with rather terrifying hallucinations. We definitely see them going crazy. <br /> <br /> While Iowa locations are used very well (including a fun scene of a propane gas robbery), the accents and quotes from the church confuse Southern Baptist. The guns seem to be used by the law to dwell and to break the law here more than in any drug center city movie. <br /> <br /> The songs of the famous bard Greg Brown of Iowa are used in everything, but strangely they are not listed in the credits. I hope they were used with permission. <br /> <br /> I took it during its commercial run in New York because I missed it at the Tribeca Film Festival where it received considerable - and inexplicable - buzz.
