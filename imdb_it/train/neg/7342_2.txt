"The Man In The Attic" is a film set in the '10s. It is inspired by a true story. Unfortunately, it's a story that doesn't really need to be told. <br /> <br /> Looking at the box, the people responsible for making the film did their best to make this film flashy and erotic. They use terms such as "illicit passion", "forbidden deal" and "unlimited pleasures". They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris (little Doogie Howser, M.D.) holding a gun! <br /> <br /> The story involves Krista, played by Anne Archer. She is unhappily married to a gentleman who owns her own business. Edward (Harris) is an employee of her husband's company. Krista and Edward end up falling in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The seemingly "shocking" part of the film is this: Krista's husband discovers the relationship and prohibits them from seeing each other again. So what do they decide to do? Krista ends up having Edward live in their attic. Wow! Krista ends up seeing someone else and Edward becomes extremely jealous. So on and so on. <br /> <br /> "The Man In The Attic" does not cover any new territory. It's an original photo of Showtime, which explains why the stars are a couple of B-list actors and both appear briefly in buff. <br /> <br />
