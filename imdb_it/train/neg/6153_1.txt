So let me tell you that I saw this film as part of an agreement. I really got bored one fine day in 1997 and so I switched to the movie rental store. I asked the salesman what the worst movie he had in stock was. Without hesitation he accompanied me to "Lucky Stiff". He told me he would give up the $ 1 rent (he said it would be wrong to charge more) if I promised to watch the whole movie. So look, I did it for free ... <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. God-terrible even. I don't need to go into the details of the plot, read the other reviews. The jokes make no sense. The acting was terrible. I know it had to be a comedy, but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting. You could try to see it as something to laugh about, but it's so ugly that it's not even funny that way. To avoid!
