This film is not like "Office Space" except in the premise. Office Space was fun. I would not recommend this film to anyone, because I didn't laugh once during the whole movie. Mr. Cornbluth's self-indulgent tirades quickly become more annoying than Jason Alexanders in the same room. If you decide to watch this movie, use a free rental or watch it at someone else's home so you can leave if necessary.
