With the runaway success of "God's Army", every Mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a movie now. In the case of the recent "The Other Side of Heaven", this was not a bad thing at all. That film, although not exceptional, was quite good. "The Singles Ward", however, is not. <br /> <br /> Telling the story of a young divorced Mormon brought back to single life, the writing and script style of "The Singles Ward" is, in many ways very similar to the 80's play "Ferris Bueller's Day Off ". However, the similarities end there. While "Ferris Bueller" was fun, original and well acted (with regards to the most stupid comedies like this), "The Singles Ward" is completely the opposite. Try very hard to be funny. However, 90% of the gags fall flat or are clich√©s and jokes you've probably heard a million times before. The other 10% seems to have been thrown to fill the time. And acting, even if not terrible, is at best a love. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, if you are neither a Mormon yourself nor very, VERY familiar with Mormon culture, you will have almost nothing at all. While "God's Army" and "The Other Side of Heaven" were attractive to a wide range of viewers, both inside and outside of Mormon Church, this film is definitely a big joke, and even if you understand it, it is just not so fun.
