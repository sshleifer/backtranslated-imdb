This is the third parody of the films of fear and, hopefully, the last. This time the parody is mainly about The Ring, Signs and 8 Mile for some strange reason. In my opinion this film was very useless, useless and not even fun. I've laughed maybe three times and it's not enough for a play. I really liked the first two, but this was just stupid. If your jokes consist of corpses being beaten and people constantly throwing stuff at each other, then this movie is for you. In my opinion, if you are smart enough to stay at home and save your money and please stop making this kind of film, it will continue to get worse 3/10.
