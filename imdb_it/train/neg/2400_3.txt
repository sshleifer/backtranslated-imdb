No, this was not one of the ten worst films of the 80s, but it certainly turns the bottom 100 somewhere. This film seems to have been put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981. How else could you explain the special features "An American Werewolf in London", the disco is still considered cool, and Ronald Reagan not is the 40th President of the United States? While we're at it, we don't neglect those hairstyles of the 70s in the 50s and 60s. I've seen more here than in "Happy Days" and "Laverne & Shirley" put together. <br /> <br /> The only woman who elevates this film to the "so bad, it's good" category was the end, great Elizabeth Hartman, but barely. Biff plays Miss Montgomery, the insignificant high school teacher who becomes a sexpot, a stereotype that was made to death and that is still churned out today by Hollywood, but also as a "hot chick" retains its mouse qualities. His request for help is proof of this. She also looks much better as Miss Wimp. "Seven dollars at the beauty salon, hit yourself in hell." He wasn't kidding. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that there are no good parts elsewhere, they are only few and far between, and I'm not saying it just because I like Hartman. Incidentally, "Teen Wolf" was better than this. "Teen Wolf Too" was better than that, and it wasn't even that good. <br /> <br />
