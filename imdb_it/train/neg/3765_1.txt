I've always been interested in something about Bigfoot, so when I was browsing for a movie to rent, this caught my eye. It was the WEIGHT $ 4.50 I've ever spent and I want my money back! Please don't waste your money on this !! This was one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The whole movie was so incredibly boring and I found myself rolling my eyes and I didn't even look at it. I just got bored. The acting was horrible, the effects were horrible, everything was really bad and tasteless. All in all it is a really bad film, boring and a total waste of time and money. I hope that one day they'll make a good movie on Sasquatch, but until then, I'll have to sit among countless economic smears like this to find the true masterpiece.
