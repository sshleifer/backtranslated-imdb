I'm pretty sure this was the worst movie ever made. If you can't make a 13-year-old boy with silly humor laugh, you should give up playing forever. Unfortunately Joan Rivers chose differently. The film is full of predictable gags (some of them are racist) and very funny jokes. Particularly memorable is the scene in which the doctor tells the protagonist that the rabbit is dead and pregnant (as I write this, I cannot believe that this was actually a scene from a movie). The man rushes to a dead rabbit on the doctor's desk and tries to mouth him. ROTFLMAO! NOT! The dividing line that can tell you how bad things are in this film is "I knew I should have been at the top". ha ha ha ha ha ugh ........
