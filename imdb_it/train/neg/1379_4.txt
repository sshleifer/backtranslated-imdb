Monika Mitchell's satire of the show has laughter and some premeditated violence. I wouldn't say soaked in blood; but there is insult and injury. Max Matteo (John Cassini) is a character who has a strange adaptable presence on the screen, but has a terrible experience of being chosen for the parts that follows. There is always the grandson of a producer or a seemingly trivial reason for not having received the role he seeks. Well, the best thing to do is get rid of the competition ... Max becomes obsessed with such thoughts. The rewarding career is just a swing, push and shoot. Other cast members: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh cameo. Well, this is the entertainment world ... or is it?
