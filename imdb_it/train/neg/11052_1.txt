The Deadly Wake is THE PERFECT FILM for film students ... to learn how NOT to make a movie! <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what did the crew do in this movie? Worst musical mix Worst editing Worst script WORLDWIDE WORST Worst acting Worst choreography Worst cinematography Worst sceneries Worst sceneries Worst lighting Etc. Let's face it, if this "film" had been in ultra-high contrast in black and white, And silent ... it would still be terrible. All the scenes are dark (the enlightened people call it "black"), often, the musical score stifled the sinuous dialogues, which was fine because nobody had ever uttered two whole sentences without long pauses due to effect. The "bad" robot was hilarious ... what was it? Jazz dance? Oh ... I guess he should walk tactically or something. I'm sure it struck fear in the hearts ... of the poor publishers. And how do you change so many garbage shots? Not possible. Garbage is rubbish, no matter how you configure it. How come someone managed to get this dailys ??? <br /> <br /> The bottom line is - I couldn't stand to watch more than 15 minutes of segments, it was so bad ... but I saw the whole thing (with lots of breaks) just to see if had ALL the good parts in all. NO! NOBODY! <br /> <br /> A perfect example of how not to make a film ... a must see for EVERY serious film student !!!
