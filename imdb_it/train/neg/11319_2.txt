The vampire cyborgs rule the world and use the blood of humans as fuel, but there will be a shift of power thanks to a renegade android (Kris Kristofferson) and a warrior woman (Kathly Long) as they face Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels the cyborgs in this ridiculous film) Of all the questions left unanswered by this terrible film, the most touching is the idea of ​​Who was to launch country singer Kris Kristofferson in the role of a cyborg warrior who is able to give the best he gets. No, don't get me wrong I could see Kristofferson as a vigilante or something but not as a cyborg. Strangely it is suspected that it was written for Dolph Lundgren, however Lundgren must have had the wisdom not to do it. However, despite the disastrous casting, Kristofferson is easily the funniest thing in the movie. It gives a much more human performance than the inexpressible Kathy Long. (And Kristofferson is playing a robot), despite the miscasting, Kristofferson offers the few moments of interest. Lance Henriksen is staggering and Gary Daniels is wasted but basically Knights is a baffling failure. You're horrified again wondering who the hell thought it was even a good idea on paper. (This is a film in which a dismembered Kristofferson is fighting robots in a backpack) Worst of all it ends in a sequel, if fortunately this has yet to materialize even though I still have nightmares about proposing the verisimilitude of such an event. br /> <br /> * out of 4 (invalid)
