It is considered fashionable to highlight every social evil as a consequence of patriarchy and male domination, even though it may seem an illogical "logic". However, within the plot and theme of the film, there is no gray area and the woman who should be called the antagonist of the film, is the "villain of the story". In no case what he did is justified. Women's sexuality is only exaggerated in this case and has nothing to do with current events. It is betrayal of the ultimate type. Man has ended up spending his resources and time in the wasteful growth of another man's progeny. Finally, the weakest of the arguments raised by the 3 female characters "freed" in the climax is pathetic. A woman's sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and worse, there are no other children. So basically his life was wasted. In some societies where justice still prevails, such situations result in the execution of the unjust.
