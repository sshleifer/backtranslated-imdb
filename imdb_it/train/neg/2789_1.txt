Savage Island (2003) is a lame film. It's more like a home video shot with minimal lighting and horrible acting. Not only that the plot and script were unhappy. I don't know why this film was made. I have seen many movies of my time and the ones I really hate are the films that make me angry. This made my blood boil. The situations were very bad at most. If I made a film like this it would have been short. Really because those backwood "idjits" wouldn't have been in the picture. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover of D.V.D. I'm a passionate observer of bad cinema. But this film is practically unwatchable. I don't care that the movies are shot on D.V. but if you do it will make the movie fun, not a little tired rebuilt of higher horror movies (without Wrong Turn). <br /> <br /> I must not recommend this waste of disc. If you happen to come across this in the rental shop, pass. <br /> <br /> Movies that make your real angry 1.
