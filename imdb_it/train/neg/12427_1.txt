I hated this movie It was absolutely horrible, poor, poor, PITIFULAR acting, REAL REAL VERY stupid criminals who weren't even the VERY NEED funny (unlike the first 2 movies alone at home that were very good). all boobie traps are weak, pathetic excuses for the badly copied ideas of the first two, which meant that the people who wrote this film were simply lazy because their salary did not exceed $ 20 a week. This film is absolutely bad, not even worth renting. In fact I don't even look at t.v. Go use your eyes in a more useful way when you see the first two! I TELL THIS 1 (out of 10). Trust me when I say, if you liked the first two, and you're not a completely stupid person, you won't like this movie, don't watch this movie !!!
