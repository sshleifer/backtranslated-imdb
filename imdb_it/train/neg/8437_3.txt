As a big fan of David Mamet's films and plays, in particular his first film House of Games, also played by Joe Mantegna, I expected great things from this film. Instead, I found myself annoyed by the superficiality and lack of credibility of the film. Racist insults are insinuated without any feeling or meaning behind them, in the hope of creating a racial tension that has never materialized for me. Identity is totally re-evaluated and men become "heroes" for no apparent reason. Because of his oaths taken as a policeman, the main character categorically refuses to perform a relatively small action that would not harm anyone and could save lives, and yet he does another action that is very violent and VERY illegal, but still refuses the least action. Furthermore, an incredibly incredible subplot involving a man who killed his family is introduced only for the sake of a point in the plot that was advertised only with skywriting, and the policeman's reaction to that event lengthens the credulity beyond any reasonable limit. Needless to say, after expecting another exciting David Mamet thriller, I was extremely disappointed to say the least. 3 out of 10.
