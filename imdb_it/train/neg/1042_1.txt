First of all, write the script on a napkin. Who needs more? After all, we're not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> So take amateur actors. It will be good for the clamor of the festival. After all, who needs people who have spent years refining their craft? So hire a cinematographer who does not know how to illuminate. You see, if it's well lit, it won't look "real" and people won't like the festival. Who should still have a professional level photograph? So hire a ten-year-old who has never held a camera to be your operator. It will give your film a completely amateur touch that the festival's screenwriters will exchange for "reality" and will guarantee that even if you empty the seats of real people, the critics and a small fragment of the over-intellectualizing audience will shout "genius" because they won't believe this was a simple amateur hour. <br /> <br /> Once you've done that, buy your ticket for the Bad Movies Festival, called Sundance. <br /> <br /> sad waste.
