An absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children's book. Rough and inappropriate humor, some frightening parts and a ruinous story about the mother's boyfriend who wants to send the boy to military school to get him out of the way makes it totally inappropriate for children who would most likely want to see him because of the book (3-8 years). Don't waste your money, your time or your good judgment.
