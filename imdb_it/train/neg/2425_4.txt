### Spoiler! ### <br /> <br /> What is this film offer? Out-of-control editing and cinematography that match a terrible storyline. It is sad to see that the talents of Denzel Washington go to waste like this. We have certainly hinted at how Mexicans cannot save themselves, necessary external forces, perhaps militarist, American. And we know that the father is a shady character, after all he is a Mexican, unlike his wife who appreciates Creasey the most because he is American. He killed them all thinking he was dead. And she? Of course, he won't, he's a little girl and you shouldn't hurt the sensitivity of the Hollywood fan. The trade off was the only thing that prevented me from classifying it below the "implausible success" (as one critic pointed out) "Taken". The nausea of ​​these films will take some time. It is in the evaluation of these films that we must doubt the credibility of IMDb.7.7 for a film like this and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho. Go figure it out! Mine will be in the range 3.5-4.0
