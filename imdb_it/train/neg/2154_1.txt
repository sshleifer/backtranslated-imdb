Let me confess. I found this video used and bought because Guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on the jacket. But inside was another story. Besides the fact that the film was basically a parody of the special effects of the "invisible man" genre (highly visible strings and other similar instruments), the script did not waste a chance - in fact it was done in four - insulting all the non - WASP races and real or imaginary homosexuals. Any insult to a person in the script was homophobic or racist or both. He begins to scratch your nerves, along with the shaky sound, candid style photography and melodramatic story. However, the end is somewhat of a surprise. But when you get there, you don't care less. Too bad, it could have been a pretty good movie.
