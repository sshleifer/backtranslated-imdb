While I was watching this movie I was thinking, OK it will be fine every moment ... I was wrong. The best part of this film was when it was over. A complete waste of 92 minutes. Apart from seriousness, the best part was when in the end the Wendigo appeared which was at the end and you couldn't even see it so well. And even the tail was really stupid. There were too many sections in the movie that you thought something would happen, but it was a disappointment. The worst part is that there was more talk on Wendigo, then there was Wendigo. Because the creature is so bad, you can't possibly say that with this movie.
