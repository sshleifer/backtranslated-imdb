For some reason, TV Guide gave it two and a half stars, as well as Faye Dunaway, so it definitely looked like something to see. My, oh, my, this could be the worst movie I've ever seen. Never. From his horrible acting (every time the girl asks the boy what's wrong with him, I screamed at the TV "I can't act!" When she asks him what he needs, he screams "I need acting lessons ! "To the incredibly bad dialogue (" Give me back my organs! "). <br /> <br /> And also the finale of Brian DePalma, everything went beyond terrible. always And the production values ​​were pretty good. <br /> <br /> But wowzers, that made me laugh, LAUGH!, most of the time. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about curiosity either , that was my first mistake, being with him was definitely my second, third and fourth.
