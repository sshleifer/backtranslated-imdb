The smash of Ira Levin's Broadway comes on the screen without almost flesh on his bones, a mysterious plot with few tricks and twists, but none of which is worth taking care of. The frustrated writer Michael Caine plots to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass him off as his; his ambiguous plan could include the murder of the talented boy, who has Caine's loving bride in arms. The first act in which everyone is introduced is atrociously dead, with Caine doing everything an actor can to keep up the pace. Dyan Cannon is a disbeliever as his wife (he is too intelligent and intelligent to have passed as a ditz) and Christopher Reeve (in the central part of the film) seems extremely uncomfortable as the best writer. These three characters, and Irene Worth's annoying neighbor, are so undefined that what happens after the set-up is barely recorded until after the start of the second act. The director of Sidney Lumet is dull and indistinct, the scenography is not convincing and poorly lit, and the ending is a total disaster. The actors struggle to give the script a certain substance, but with such a subtle material all we see are their laborious efforts. * 1/2 from ****
