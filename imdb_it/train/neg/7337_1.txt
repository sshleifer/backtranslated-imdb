Painful. Painful is the only word to describe this terrible interpretation of a Shakespearean game so fun and interesting. I gave it a shot but I was terribly disappointed and I couldn't bear to even finish seeing it. To the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this shot of Much Ado was, I pity you and your bored brain. May your fictions about young spectators be raised without pay. Please don't even bother yourself with this compelling and disgusting excuse for an exhibition of an acclaimed Shakespeare play. You will be forced to induce vomiting and you will need a comfortable cabin near the TV set with which you choose to watch this shit because an involuntary defecation will take place.
