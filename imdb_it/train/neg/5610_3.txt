This documentary begins with an interesting premise: it makes an intriguing and convincing discussion that the story of Jesus as commonly believed is probably a myth. Unfortunately, however, after making us fall in love with this, the film completely changes gear and becomes little more than a non-stop attack on Christianity, and practically focusing on easy targets. <br /> <br /> The writer / director clearly has some problems with the Church (he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legitimate anger) and this film seems to be his release form. It would be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded, but overall the film is disappointing.
