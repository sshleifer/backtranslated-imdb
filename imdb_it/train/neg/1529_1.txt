If you see this turkey listed in your TV guide, AVOID THAT YOU LIKE FISHING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> A large steaming pile of fetid kidney dingo does not. Let's begin to describe how bad this movie is! There is only one funny scene (the scene of the memory eraser), but even that one evaluates only .001 on the risometro (out of 1000). Anyone who has written this turkey should be prohibited from writing another film for life.
