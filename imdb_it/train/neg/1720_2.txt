A handful of non-professional actors are terrified of a prehistoric creature. This creature appears in about thirty seconds of marginal stop-motion animation, but oh how you would like for that margin when for the rest of the film the animation is replaced by production assistants floating around an inner tube with teeth. There is no time for terror when this film is hijacked halfway by these funny boat charter proponents, who suddenly become the protagonists; but again you have to admit that watching them try to be fun is better than trudging after the sheriff. Only at the end one of them is eaten and the other sits on a rock crying tears of loneliness - it's not fun!
