An unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and horribly assaulted by a group of two-dimensional psychopaths during a nightly meeting on a forest road in Shropshire, England. The man and woman who attacked the plan and carry out a revenge attack against their attackers ... <br /> <br /> Absolutely repulsive piece of voyeuristic garbage, somehow masked by a "stimulating" drama, while in reality he runs into sub-Michael Winner cr * p (you only know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would have been plastered if he had been created so easily in the 70s). What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is terrifying and devastating, yet Dan Reed somehow manages to rub the viewer's nose into every last sphere of his sexual wickedness. His camera lingers on Anderson's naked body during and after the assault, while the script leaves almost all the characters struggling in a turgid sea of ​​two-dimensional clichés. The script obliges his characters to behave in such a way as to further distance the viewer from the "victims" by pushing other horrible situations in the face (Adams' attempts to post-crash Sophie and Alice; Alice's assault on Heffer AFTER his suicide -test the confession). <br /> <br /> The dilemma derives from the interpretations of the central protagonists - Dyer is a horrible actor, incapable of lights and shadows like the young male victim of the initial assault (he will end up in Eastenders, mark my words), but Anderson It is extraordinary. Although the atrocious script forces his character to behave in a depraved and ridiculous manner, he somehow offers an extraordinarily compelling and complicated characterization as an arrogant and self-indulgent hedonist who encounters such horrors and needs revenge. <br /> <br /> A vile and useless film, therefore, almost, but not entirely saved by a compelling central female performance.
