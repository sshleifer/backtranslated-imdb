but there are not too many. Probably the worst "major release" movie I've seen in my life. Definitely the worst for this year. It makes no sense to comment on the plot, the cast or the acting. The problem is beyond all. It lies in the absolute stupidity of the annoying type (not the funny type) of everything that happens on the screen. I don't know why I gave it a 2/10 instead of 1/10. Probably, thanks to Steven Martini. He really tried. Bottom line - 95 minutes washed in the bathroom along with some brain cells. Avoid at all costs.
