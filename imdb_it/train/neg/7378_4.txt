Friend of Steven, remember when you said this: <br /> <br /> "Try to find the path of least resistance and use it without harming others, live with integrity and morality, not only with people but with all beings ". <br /> <br /> you did not do it, you mortally wounded your fans and their morality with these "films" I would not worry even if I didn't know that you are much better than this, I have seen videos of you that you are teaching, you are much better than this because because brother because ... <br /> <br /> steamroller productions has been steamrolled I promise you brother I am not afraid of you I will tell you truth on your face so we can fix it. <br /> <br /> well I like some others have fallen asleep at 90%, but to be honest I was tired and I had a big meal just an hour before the Sensai hand, what are you doing. 12 million? really? do you have any idea what we could have done with $ 12,000,000. It could have been in the theaters and a huge success, if I wanted, we could have donated money from the huge profit to a homeless shelter or something like that. These post production people are robbing you of the man the choreography was non-existent, we can make a better man, the eye that was flashing was from the men in the black movie, I almost waited for smith to appear or Tommy Lee Jones to say they were gills not the eyelids. <br /> <br /> Seagal you are an Aikido master, why are you doing this to yourself, to us? when you came on the scene, you had such a fresh direct style, and it is obvious that you are a teacher because of the way your moves were so clear and crisp, watching your first three films I felt like you were teaching me something , now I feel like I've just been robbed or something I feel I need to save you friend, this time you're the one who was killed and I'm going to take revenge for you helping you make the best movie ever. brother, I know who you really are, I know the truth about Nico's film. let's talk. <br /> <br /> contact me man I have fresh ideas I am a stickler, I swear you will not be disappointed by my attention to detail and we will do it for the fans, your fans deserve better, we are holding on, but the beach is to shoot. I swear I won't let your movie out the door with one mistake. I'm still trying to figure out if that was the worst dubbing ever, or you have laryngitis, but I promise you I can make a better impression of your voice than the lame **** he hasn't even tried. I really hope you kicked it in the dice as a payment. I can invent a story and a plot that can be combined with your revenge of the death of your student / daughter / wife / dog / house niche plant and I promise you that we will bring you back, I promise, I also want to go in the direction, that makes thinking about people, if you let me in, I promise you that we will make a film that people will leave and that will have to discuss it, an experience that alters perception and perception. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal This is my official in writing to allow IMDb to publish my contact information for the purpose of resurrecting one of the best martial arts heroes I've ever seen, for the non-Italian record , hes Irish and jew call it acting badly i call it terrific acting, because you believed for 20 years that Seagal is Italian :) a little changes your perception, doesn't it?
