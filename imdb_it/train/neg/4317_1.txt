My bride and I found this film very skeletal. It started well, but it soon became unbelievable and ridiculous. Most of the acting was poor, with the exception of the little girl, Abbie, who was really formidable. Moreover, the dialogue was predictable and lame - especially Gideon, the angel. Moreover, without giving anything away, when one of the characters has a tragedy, he seems almost indifferent. At first we thought it was "shock", but then we realized that it was just a terrible script. We love almost all Hallmark movies and their heart-warming stories, but this film is not up to the task of being one. There are so many fantastic ones - don't waste your time with this horrible movie.
