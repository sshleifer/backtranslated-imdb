<br /> <br /> Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes is a "parody" of evil monster movies that ends up being worse than spoofing movies. The story (very scarce) speaks of tomatoes that rebel against those who treat them badly. Basically, they rotate and growl (yes, they growl) and the next thing you know is that the person is covered in ketchup. Actors are names that have never made films after this, so it wouldn't make sense to call them. There is a boy who is hired by the government to try to stop the threat of tomatoes. He is accompanied by a black boy who is the master of disguise and a girl and a boy who dives. However, there is another woman who spies on the first guy who works for the government. if this doesn't make much sense to you, you understand. This film would never have been very good in the first place, but it also lacks the fun of laughing at stupid attack scenes. The film is horribly cheeky, which, although crucial, really hurts what may have been a (fairly) funny movie. At one point, a giant wax tomato "slides" on a wooden board untreated with wheels on it! Perhaps I would have recommended the film if it would have had a pleasant field value, but even this is devoid of this terrible film. 2/10
