After Harry Reems's teenage girlfriend was raped by Zebbedy Colt (The Night-Walker), Reems becomes discouraged and consoles himself by having sex with some lesbians. Meanwhile, Colt, wearing a cane and dressed like a magician, violates other women. In the end, Reems decides to track him down and end his criminal madness. Despite being shot on film and marginally bad, it looks like any other porn from the 70s and is perfectly executed. The rape / abuse scenes are surprisingly contained and the attempt to cash in "Death Wish" is ridiculous. R. Bolla ("Cannibal Holocaust") plays a policeman. Colt, who is usually exaggerated, wears wigs in a couple of scenes, but is too well-mannered for my money. This roughie could have been much rougher.
