This is a fragment of choice dialogue delivered by the evil assistant of a famous scientist to his maid before attracting three incredible university girls into a villa for behavior modification experiments. Meanwhile, at the local bar, people drink and dance to sing 80s rock songs. A punk biker has sex with a little dog on a table football in front of a crowd of people, then he tries to rape scientist Jessica's virginal daughter (Debra Hunter ), who is in love with another motorcyclist (Dale Midkiff, from PET SEMATARY), who, in turn, is in the cohort with the assistant! Back home, sorority bimbos swim, shower, change clothes and have sex with the men in the bar. A small silver ball (part of the experiment) flies into the victims' mouths and turns them into drooling and murdering zombies! <br /> <br /> If it is not enough to entertain you, there is a hilarious theme song ("Nightmare Fantasy"), roller skating, some serious daisy duke and a hand puppet (!?) that warns " DANGER! DANGER! "Just like the LOST IN SPACE robot and recommends hitchhiking as one of the best ways to pick up men! <br /> <br /> This mess filmed in Florida is so terribly scary that more views are recommended to wet it all in all. And, hey, isn't NYPD detective Blue Jill Kirkendall turned CNN journalist Andrea Thompson into one of the most naked bimbos? Sure! Presumably this was started in 1982 and the new video was added later for the release of the video in 1985. <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10 (and I mean in a positive sense!)
