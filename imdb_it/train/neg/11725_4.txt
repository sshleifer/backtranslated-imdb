STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> James Dial (Wesley Snipes) hides on his ranch in Montana after having failed to capture a notorious terrorist. He is then contacted again by the agency to go to London to make another attempt. His goal has been stopped there and is subjected to heavy police protection, but they don't want to simply capture their man - they want him to shut out. Everything is fine, but then the mission gets hurt and when an elderly police chief, Windsor (Charles Dance) is killed, the fault falls at the feet of Dial. Hunted like an animal, he takes refuge in a neighboring house and befriends a young girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett) who is dealing with his own problems and becomes his unwitting helper as he goes to clear his name and figure out who he cheated. <br /> <br /> This latest Snipes adventure directly on DVD came out of nowhere, with a minimum of advertising even for something so short (I don't remember seeing any ads or trailers for this anywhere.) With this in mind and after the Snipes story of duff DVD efforts, this might seem like one that Snoop Dawg would tell you to drop as it's hot. But I felt compelled to try it anyway. It is not among the worst, but it does not reach any level higher than the standards of some of its best (The Detonator, 7 Seconds, says it all, really), either. <br /> <br /> This is, at best, moderately suspenseful, with a minimum of action, all in a cold dialogue and Snipes not exactly at its best in the lead role. Likewise, in a major supporting role, it is quite clear that Dance has also presented itself for payroll control and this is generally one that none of the casts are about to shout about in the hills on any of their CVs. <br /> <br /> It is said a lot that in the end the only 'contract' that interests you is when Snipes will finish with Sony and with it the end of every other action DVD movie of SUB sub. **
