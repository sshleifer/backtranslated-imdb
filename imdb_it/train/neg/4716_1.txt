This show is boring, lame, and in practice tears away all sorts of various things to make it "original". First of all: the animation is so bad ... Johnny is horrible ... and everyone is boring. The twins resemble the teenage Desters of "Dexter's Lab" and Johnny is almost a smarter male Dee Dee (also from "Dexter's Lab"). Secondly: the plots ... are painfully lame, making them difficult to follow. The gags are trivial, and nothing really makes me feel compelled to laugh a little ... especially when trying to be funny. I saw only two episodes, but those alone excluded me. <br /> <br /> Third album: the whole theme song starts to rip the tune to "American Idiot" by Green Day. And, although I'm not a big fan of that band, I find it really stupid to take same opening melody, and then subtly replace it, to make it its own. <br /> <br /> Case to the point ... it's a big ugly and boring. 1/10
