When you choose a film, do I hope that a factor that you will consider, the actors of the film who use their fame, influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way? This is not a political declaration, this is a moral issue concerning society. When a comedian / actor makes sexual and racist curls on a teenager and his father we should ask ourselves (I want to support this behavior)? In this case, Mr. Foxx has tears in his eyes about the social fabric that teaches our youth from evil, good behavior from evil that loving-kindness is better than hatred. Mr. Foxx should remember that it's just fun and there's a lot of this out there for us to choose from. To say sorry does not put him in difficulty. It will not weaken the pain or remove the bad behavior it spreads to our youth. One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it. They no longer see anything they belong to. We can't change them but we can stop the fame we give them.
