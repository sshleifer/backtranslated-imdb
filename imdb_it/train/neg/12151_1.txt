this is perhaps the worst acting I've ever seen in a movie ... ever. and what happens with the casting. the protagonist of this film has a sort of dis-figuration of the nose and it is almost impossible to watch for any period of time without having fixed on her nose. you could go to your grocery store on a Sunday afternoon and easily find 50 more qualified and better women. I made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a "cool" DVD case. This film seems to be just a class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college. I would have preferred to spend the hour or the time when this film was watching public television ... at least the special effects are better and the people there are more attractive than anyone you will see in this film
