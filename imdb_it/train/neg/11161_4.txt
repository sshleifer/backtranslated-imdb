"Nacho Libre" (2006) <br /> <br /> Directed by: Jared Hess <br /> <br /> Starring: Jack Black, Ana de la Reguera, Héctor Jiménez and Darius Rose <br /> <br /> MPAA rating: "PG-13" (for an approximate action and humor including dialogue) <br /> <br /> Say what you want (I know some people who despise him to no end), but I always thought that "Napoleon Dynamite" was a funny movie - not the brightest brick on the wall, but still a fun movie. Jack Black is also a very funny man - irritating at times, yes, and massively overrated by a teenage audience who worship him practically, but amusing. There was rarely a Jack Black comedy that I didn't like very much. So, I was very happy to know that Jared Hess, the writer and director of "Napoleon Dynamite", and Jack Black would collaborate on a film about a Spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage. My only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin. Unfortunately, my only reservation turned out to be the bane of the whole movie. This plot, if it had been used as a skit for some shows like "Saturday Night Live" or maybe even "Mad TV", would have worked perfectly. Unfortunately, the plot is too thin in the approximate hour and a half time and this comedy from a beat falls flat. <br /> <br /> Nacho grew up in a Mexican monastery and became a devoted man of the Lord. Feeling avoided by the whole monastery, Nacho (black), now a monastery cook, decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler. While the monastery's finances are at an all-time low, Nacho decides to join a wrestling tournament so he can win the prize pool and provide good food to the monastery's orphanage. This plot looks so sweet and thoughtful. It looks like the perfect movie for Jack Black. See what he did with "School of Rock", after all. Well, to my regret, this plot is almost completely ruined by an offensive and gross humor that takes away from the heart of the film. It is once again Hollywood's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand jokes and stupid humor, of course, as far as I know, maybe this is the general thought of adolescents, as many seem to like this movie. Watching an obese woman run away like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh, but don't expect to get a prize for putting it in your film. A seven-year-old could invent the same joke. <br /> <br /> The performances in "Nacho Libre" are actually good. Jack Black proves once again that it is absolutely exhilarating and that it can do even the most idiotic and useless jokes in terms of paper comedy. Unfortunately, this film was not enough for him. He gave him nothing to do and the only reason he joked was because of him. I had never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera, but now I can say that not only does she have enough talent, but she is also one of the most beautiful women who has ever embellished my sight. He just clicked into the role and it worked wonderfully well. Héctor Jiménez, who plays Nacho's clumsy partner, Esqueleto, made me laugh all the time. He did a great job and was very effective when he worked with Jack Black. Darius Rose, who plays an orphan named Chancho, didn't have many lines, but, what can I say, I simply enjoyed myself. He was adorable. The rest of the cast did its job. It's a pity they were wasted on a movie like that. <br /> <br /> "Nacho Libre" does not work. Its texture is too thin. The heart of it all is tainted by moralistic humor and disgusting jokes that simply don't work. I rarely laughed and, if I did, it was because of Jack Black or another cast member. And this brings me to the positive side of "Nacho Libre": yes, the cast. This cast was really good, for lack of a better word, they were up. They all clicked, had excellent chemistry together and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script. After Jared Hess's "Napoleon Dynamite" kept me completely amused for the whole film, I was surprised to find myself so often bored by "Nacho Libre". Something has been lost here and I still have to figure out what it was. All I know is that "Nacho Libre" is not a good movie and yet, due to its cast, it is completely useless. There is a small reason to look, if only to see how Jack Black works. But if you're not a fan of Jack Black, avoid this movie like the plague. I like Black, but I'm done with this movie and with this review. <br /> <br /> Final Thought: Yikes! This is the surprisingly disappointing sequel to Jared Hess to his hysterical "Napoleon Dynamite". <br /> <br /> General Evaluation: 4/10 (C +)
