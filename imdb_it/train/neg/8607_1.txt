<br /> <br /> The film "Slugs" is unique because the titular parasites are actually the good guys in this gruesome story of nature gone wrong. You see, these poor snails have been mutated through the pollution of evil humans and do not intend to do anything evil, they are just snails - snails with sharp teeth that eat meat and expel poison, but slugs nevertheless. The real villains are the humans, who actively try to destroy our beloved snails, or overreact when they meet them. <br /> <br /> For example, take the scene where the boy wears the glove full of bullets. They were simply hanging in a comfortable work glove when this gigantic hand came from nowhere, and they reacted instinctively, defending themselves and biting the boy. Now, instead of looking for a doctor for his bite, this guy goes around his greenhouse screaming like an idiot, pours highly volatile chemicals, lights a fire, throws a bookshelf on himself and cuts his own hand, then the fire and the volatile chemicals mix and his house explodes. How can you blame snails? <br /> <br /> This film depicts a portrait of humans that is not favorable. The characters in this film include the stupid sheriff who hates everyone, the drunk who is bad with his dog and the lumpy companion whose wife is at least forty-five years older than him. There is also a series of drunken teenagers <br /> <br /> who are attacked while they are copulating, and we must see the genitals of the little fingers with long, thin hair. Meanwhile, there's a guy who looks like a demonic Leslie Neilson screaming "You don't have the authority to declare a happy birthday!" for some reason. Finally, this parade of disgust is completed by the guy from the classic MST3K "Pod People", whose face explodes after eating a lace salad (another easily avoided destiny blamed for the useful and harmless snails). <br /> <br /> Humans are portrayed as greedy, stupid, racist, alcoholics and, in a nonsensical scene, as potential rapists. In the climax of the film, evil men try to burn slugs that are helplessly cowering in the sewers, well, since they're idiots, humans can blow up the entire city. They do more damage on their own than snails ever did! <br /> <br /> If you hate humans, and know I do, you will appreciate "Slugs". If you are a fan of bad cinema, you will also appreciate this crapfest by the director of "Pieces" and "Pod People". There is enough bad acting, stupid dialogues, illogical twists, paralyzing special effects, useless scenes and poor dubbing to attract your attention.
