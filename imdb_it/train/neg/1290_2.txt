This film was two hours and a fourth atrocious. Someone, please tell me what was the point? <br /> <br /> I mean, I understand the historical setting. It should be about a group of confederate (terrorist?) Pranksters on the Missouri-Kansas border, who take revenge on all the northern supporters and abolitionists during the American civil war. But apart from the gratuitous violence there was really not much of a point in this film. Maybe it was a political statement? Is that war really nothing more than gratuitous violence? If that was the point it was done quite well, but I don't think that was the point. I think the producers really thought they were making a film worthy of note here, but as far as I was concerned there was a complete lack of plot. It seemed I was watching a pocket novel come to life, with the characters resembling what you would see on the covers of these novels. <br /> <br /> This film should be burned along with some of the cities of this flames band!
