When converting a book into a film, it is generally a good idea to preserve at least some of the tones or concepts conveyed by the author, rather than ignoring the author altogether. While it is clear that the director had access and followed the advice of the children of Elinore Stewart, it is important to note that the children believed that their mother was a complete liar about the positive, enriching and strengthening experiences of her land ownership. . The book tells his life about her and her husband's adjacent farms on the vast Wyoming frontier; tells the daily adventures with his many friends and acquaintances, although they lived tens of kilometers away. The film, however, assumes a standard position for the moment it was created, portraying the experience of this woman as tough, ruthless and almost useless. Perhaps the director was bringing some of his experiences in Vietnam with him in this film (as some movie buffs said), but it seems to be a bad excuse to take all the joy and beauty of the book and turn it into a sad, hateful landscape no friends or hope. Don't waste your time with this movie; read the book instead.
