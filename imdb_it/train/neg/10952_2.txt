I hate how this movie has absolutely no creative input. I know they are going towards realism, but to be honest I don't want realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see everyday life, I will live. Tell me an interesting story and we'll talk. I can fucking handle low production values, they suck for low production values, but at least I work on some good ideas. The management only manages to grab a camcorder and walk a little, but of course I should dig because it makes things much more realistic. Hitchcock used to say that drama was essentially life with boring bits cut off. I can only conclude that this is not a drama, not a long one. We see Rosetta going to a place, Rosetta working in a bakery, Rosetta eating a waffle, Rosetta carrying bags far, Rosetta coming home, Rosetta walking somewhere ... not so funny . There is not even a deeper meaning. I got so bored that I started looking for life's thoughts in this film, but it's simply realism, the most overrated quality in the business world. I think I should love him, but come on, there's nothing in there.
