This was discussed at death by critics when honestly not so nice. Of course, "CAOS" and "INSIDE MAN" are literally the same film, only with variations of suspense. But I found the "CAOS" more pleasant because it was as fast as the silly "Swordfish" movie. The reason why this film is more popular is because it was released in the United States and "Chaos" was broadcast worldwide at foreign film festivals and theaters, but has not yet found a distributor in the UK and in the States US. <br /> <br /> It is true that this film pays homage to classic films such as DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films, but that does not mean that it is a pleasant film to watch. <br /> <br /> Watch it if there's nothing else on T.V., but after a while you'll probably get bored.
