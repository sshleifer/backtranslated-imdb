In San Paolo, the middle-class adolescents Cristiano, Chico and Gabriele just joined the university and on the eve of the opening lesson, they went to a party with drugs and alcohol. The next day, after class, Cristiano's date on the previous night arrives at his house and the three friends rape the girl. The girl dies, she panics and decides to get rid of the body, but Cristiano's mother arrives, jumps with Gabriel and rolls the stairs, breaking her neck. The trio decides to unload and burn the bodies in a garbage dump, but other tragedies occur during the night. <br /> <br /> The controversy and shameful "Cama de Gato" is a specious shit overvalued on the alienation of youth, and it is certainly the worst Brazilian film I've seen over many years. The superficial, tragic and obscure story is actually a black humorous comedy of bad taste. The script is not funny, with stupid lines and dialogues, and boring, manipulative and silly movies with interviews with idiotic kids at the beginning and end. The acting is terrible, apparently with many improvisations, but without talent, and I was disappointed by the presence of the promising Caio Blat in this garbage. The camera, the framing, the cinematography and the edition are amateur and of very low quality. The sound is terrible and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are talking about (probably an advantage, given that this film sucks). The gang bang is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre film in a very poor sexual exploitation marketing. My vote is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cama de Gato" ("Cat's bed")
