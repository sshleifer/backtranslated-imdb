And this is all. This thing is slow. Actors have skills, they just don't seem motivated to make the effort. The plot is not so big and is further hampered by the slowness of this above. The accents, when there are any, are British. Uh, many of these people should be Danish. OK, OK, accents aren't that important. But the language is. I don't think they used words like "yes" and "OK" on Beowulf's day. And that apparently cold weapon that his king gave him? Have you ever reloaded that thing? Have you ever seen it? Or was Beowulf just a bad goal? Well, its purpose corresponded at least to computer graphics used to generate monsters. Even those were pretty out. Bad special effects Clear point? Only one that I can think of. Marina Sirtis has held up well over the years.
