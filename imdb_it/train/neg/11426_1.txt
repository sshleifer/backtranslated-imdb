Heather Graham could not play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it. Who do they think the film's producers are? the ABSOLUTELY WORST movie, most of the UNREALISTIC I've seen as long as I can remember. This film is so ugly that I felt compelled to sign up for IMDb and make sure that the evaluation of this "movie" fell. <br /> <br /> omg I'm Heather Graham, I just kissed a drunk girl, so While she fainted I'm REALLY going to walk around my room for HOURS frantically asking myself "WHAT DID I DO ?!" .. Jesus, erica, overcome it and grow ... and I would like to send the same sentiment towards idiotic producers ... and while there are, instead of this film, it's all a pathetic excuse for a story that comes out, maybe it would have been more suitable to focus the plot on a character who is mentally unstable. .. like your so-called "lesbian" character ... after all, I know the first time I had gay sex, when I left the next morning I jumped in the sky for excitement in the middle of the road ... honestly b * tch, take a hold ... <br /> <br /> WHAT A JOKE! and please note that there are many many other flaws and incredibly stupid aspects for this lame film, but I'm so sick of thinking about it again. In conclusion, if you are an intelligent person you would hate this movie, and if you are not an intelligent person, then you will like it ... it's that simple.
