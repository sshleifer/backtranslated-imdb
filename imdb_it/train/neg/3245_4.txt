David Mamet's film debut has been hailed by many as a true film of a thinking man, a film that challenges you all and everything. I saw it for the first time recently and I couldn't understand what should have been so beautiful. <br /> <br /> The film is about a psychologist named Margaret who is also a successful author. Margaret was disappointed with her profession and her inability to really help anyone. Try to solve the problem by helping to pay off his patient's debt with a shark named Mike (played by Joe Mantegna, which is the only reason to watch this movie). He discovers that Mike is actually a professional man of confidence when he is almost a victim of a scam he pulls right after he meets her. Intrigued, she returns to find him and asks him to show her how scammers work (she thinks of using it as the subject of a new psychology book). Then he falls in love with him and accompanies him for a long time with him and his collaborators. <br /> <br /> I don't want to go into details, but at the end of the film it is revealed that the events of the entire film were developed by Mike and his cronies to deceive Margaret out of $ 80,000. <br /> <br /> First of all, the big turning point towards the end was VERY predictable. Every scene in which the scammers were operating was made very obvious by theatrical acting and outlandish readings. Not only that, but the public (and the main character) knows that they are dealing with scammers, so is it really such a big surprise when we find out that Margaret was deceived? Furthermore, Margaret is supposedly an intelligent psychologist who is an expert in reading people, yet she lets herself be fooled too easily - and remember, she knows perfectly well that Mike is a scammer. <br /> <br /> Secondly, we are led to believe that Margaret has been scolded from the beginning, yet, in order to make the scammer work, he had to do several things that the scammers could not have foreseen that she would done. First, he had to decide to help pay off his patient's debt, allowing her to meet scammers in the first place. If he didn't, the whole scammer would have failed. I just have to say that it is quite unreasonable to think that a psychologist will take care of himself to pay off a patient's gambling debt. Not only that, but what are the chances that the scammers will be in the right place the same evening they decided to show up? Did they just show up at that bar every night, hoping he would come to see them? Another thing that had to happen that could not be foreseen was that Margaret had to go back to see Mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade. What are the chances of this happening? Yet the whole cons is based on this premise. <br /> <br /> Another problem I had is with the ending. Margaret finds out she was scammed and decides to take revenge on Mike. At first, Mamet leads us to believe that she is about to face the scam, but this fails, so the final ending is her lightning Mike in an area of ​​the airport's luggage. Somehow, it seemed like a clumsy and inept way to finish a movie about the scammers who practiced their trade. Not only that, but he didn't even recover the money he stole from her. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film leaves you distracted and unsatisfied. And if you, like me, predicted ahead of time that Margaret would be cheated, you will find this revelation equally unsatisfactory.
