Watching this stink is a cruel and unusual punishment at the hands of Sandler. Truly a slow and painful death. <br /> <br /> 'Bought the DVD in the $ 5.88 basket at Wal Mart. But the thought that continues to echo in my head is, "How can I get my money back?" <br /> <br /> The most inexcusable thing about the film is that the boat DOESN'T SLOW! <br /> <br /> Best constructive suggestion: Mystery Comedy Theater. Get to know this show on the SciFi channel where a guy and his muppet machines get into the most awful horror movies (Mystery Science Theater). IMMEDIATELY, start a comedy program and make this movie. Without a good humorous parody of this railway disaster, I fear that spectators can actually start following Sandler with icebreakers and chainsaws. <br /> <br />
