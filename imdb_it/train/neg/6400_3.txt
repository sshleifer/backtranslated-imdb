The comic power of Pryor and Gleason could not save this fabric-thin dog, the weak script, the sad acting and the ridiculous continuity in assembling this mess together. It has very few memorable moments, but the well dries quickly. As a child, I remember that this was a hot vehicle for the two actors-comedians, but there was always something strange about the flow and feeling of what was being transmitted in each scene and how this link with the plot as a whole. Looking at him again after many years, he screams schlock-a-mania. I don't care much about racial controversies, because I wouldn't mind seeing a movie dealing with the problem a little lightly. The most obvious flaw for me is that the scenes are arranged as a confusing and unrelated series of comic bits of the 2-minute situation (some not very good), which were stapled together by the editor after a night of the local watering hole. The characters change feelings and motivations in a coin, without nursery rhymes or reason, between the scenes and within the scenes, making it feel as if no one had any idea what to get out of the script. Not that it was a gem to begin with. I am sorry for the two actors whose legacy is marked by this disaster that should never have been done. Maybe my sense of humor has become too refined ...
