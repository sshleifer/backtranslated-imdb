Not only are the characters wrong, not only do the voices suck, not only are the writers seriously needing to get girlfriends, not only are the drawings really rough, but it seems to have been created mainly for 1-6 years. The only episode I've ever seen of this show that made me look, was "A Mattter Of Family", because I liked the character of Robin. And sometimes I think it's just a general copy of Batman The Animated Series. Example: in BTAS, Bruce is a friend of Harvey Dent, yes? During a story of two episodes, it turns into the unlikely villain, TwoFace. In the "Show" Bruce is Friends with that boy from Ethan, and in a story of two episodes, he turns into the unlikely bad ClayFace. That was just a small example (it might not even be true), but in short, this is the worst attempt on a Batman series. And this is saying something.
