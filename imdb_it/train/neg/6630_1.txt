This so-called remake is terrible. I went to see him tonight .. the first day, because anticipation and exaltation were too much for me to handle. But within the first half hour, we knew this was a disaster. Not only does it not match the hype created but it also insults the original blockbuster. The script had gaps, the editing was messy several times. Mohanlal, who is an excellent actor, did a good job. Amitabh was fine ... the director wanted to describe how evil his character was, but he went a little overboard, which resulted in an act of force. Also Ajay, who is particularly kind in this kind of roles, was a disappointment. We don't even talk about the new Prashant boy ... he wouldn't be proud to start a career with something like that. Rajpal Yadav, who was thrown in for some laughter, failed to get a smile from anyone because of his strong mood and high-pitched voice. Nisha Kothari has proved to be one of the worst actresses we have today. All in all, RGV, which I thought was one of the most talented and gifted filmmakers, India had ... failed miserably. He took on a challenge and a responsibility so great as to redo what is known as the best Hindi film of all time and made it a mess.
