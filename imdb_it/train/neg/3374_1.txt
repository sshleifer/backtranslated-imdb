This film is considered a classic by some - I have no idea why. It's terrible to the point of being ridiculous. The only thing you save with this film is the delivery of malicious lines that are so awkwardly awkward toes that you have no choice but to laugh at them. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of good songs and good choreography in this film, but SO WHAT! There is no plot, it is set in a theater with no change of scenery and Michael Douglas is depressing as always. My brother once forced me to watch this movie because he said I wouldn't believe how bad a movie could get! He was right. <br /> <br /> Normally with such a terrifying film I would suggest that people shouldn't watch it, but in this case I think people should, since it will fix all the negative films you've seen in perspective.
