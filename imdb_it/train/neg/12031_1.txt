First of all this film is not a comedy; Unless you really try, you can't laugh. Secondly, the film is slow and boring. The acting is not bad but it is not special. There's a Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with a big nose and one with big ears) fighting in a small town ... you'll laugh a lot more if you read it instead of wasting time with this movie. Religions and dogmas are not the best source for making a good play and this film does nothing but confirm this rule. There is a similar comedy "Home teachers"; this has had some good moments. My last comment is: don't waste time and money watching this uninspired and boring movie.
