this film was a fantastic and fantastic movie all scary to die for. and I mean that it scared me as much as my wrist and IT and the hope, etc. but with a great film comes a crap end it? RIGHT! the end of this film was pathetic stuff. I mean, a ghost has gone back in time to a house of chicks and thinks that now I have done that means I can call her and it will be the right time because she thinks it is. right? mistaken. my ass! I don't care if the ghost is Satan, it just doesn't happen. it's a film, yes, but the worst movies or films praised like this are meant to make sense but it's not. He just showed us what I just said and people don't think about it. can someone please tell me why all of you didn't notice that pathetic part. the film ended up in the hospital for me and that's it. take a look at the number 3 his extra kick
