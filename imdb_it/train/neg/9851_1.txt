Even worse than David Lynch's worst "confusathon", "Brain Dead" makes absolutely no sense. Shamefully wasted talent (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton), it bounces like a Tom and Jerry cartoon on acid. There is a negligible development of the character. Simply begin to climb the "strange scale", until it reaches its climax in total chaos. Don't get sucked in by this because of the excellent actors mentioned above. He is not given anything to work with, and you must be wondering what will happen during the whole, unbearable 85 minutes. I highly recommend avoiding "Brain Dead" at all costs, unless the brain is lost in total absurdity. - MERK
