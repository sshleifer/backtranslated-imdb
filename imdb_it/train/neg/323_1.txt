This movie was so bad that I couldn't sit down and do nothing else. There was no plot and no points. I was completely bored and for a film about a comedian, I couldn't remember a joke or a funny joke worthy of the description. Politicians without charisma who speak technical jargon could not be less amusing. <br /> <br /> So how was it done? Is there no quality control in the film? Watching girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience. It is hard to imagine that Adam Sandler, who became popular and appeared in beautiful comedies, managed to survive after this type of exposure. It wasn't funny at all in this movie, so it shows that writing is so vital in an effective comedy.
