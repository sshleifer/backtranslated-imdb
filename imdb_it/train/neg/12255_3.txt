... which is not exactly a swirl of approval. Overall, "DinoCroc" was a much better film. Of course, in that movie Matt Borlenghi played a complete wuss-bag that spent the entire movie crying that his little brother had been eaten by DinoCroc. But the special effects in "DinoCroc" were better, the lines were better and the acting was better. Here are the problems with "Blood Surf" - 1) the killer crocodile looks like a model for children with a retractable jaw. 2) the plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. are shipwrecked on a desert island, where they encounter a rabid group of ugly Filipino inhabitants trying to impose themselves on the women of the group. That was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film. And 3) there is not enough crocodile time. There are a couple of rescued qualities of "Blood Surf" - the actresses are quite attractive and Matt Borlenghi is eaten by the croc towards the end of the film. But if you're on your deathbed and you only have time to watch a killer crocodile film Matt Borlenghi, skip this and turn on "DinoCroc" instead.
