Not that I want to be bad, but this film really surprised me a lot. Throughout the film, I was like ... um ... what is this movie about? I don't have animations at all. Probably this film will be suitable only for those who belong to the 80s. During the film, there is a group of people who came out. After the film, many people said: "Everything is here?" Frankly, I can't believe this film was awarded as the best children's film. If you are thinking of watching this movie, I strongly advise you not to do it. You will regret it. I'm not kidding. You'll find you're just wasting your time and money going to see it.
