Let me start by saying that this film has 1 funny point in the beginning with the exchange between the narrator and George: Narrator: Huh? Wait a minute! Who the hell are you? George: Me new George. Study too cheap to pay Brendan Fraser. Narrator: how did you get the part? George: New George is just lucky, I guess. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only fun part of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was still fun ... But then again, I'm easily entertained ... <br /> <br /> I wouldn't say this is the worst movie I've ever seen (the title goes to Disaster film terribly little fun ...), This movie falls # 7 in my list of 15 below ... <br /> <br /> If you are a small child who easily entertains, you will like this movie. If you are a movie watcher who wants a nice and funny movie, you will end up shooting yourself in the middle of this ..
