I really tried to enjoy this movie but it didn't work for me in the end. I saw most of the Kitamura output and found it very variable. Vivo, like all his films, has an interesting plot, some ingenious sequences and a good dose of creativity. However, these qualities are painful in Alive. The plot is beautiful, if not entirely original, and could have made a good ace movie. Unfortunately, the pace is painfully slow and the film takes an age to move forward, before reaching fairly predictable places. The action is almost passable, with the final fight rather interesting, and the previous one on OK. The former is also ruined by excessive camera-work, making it less consistent. There are some curated visual effects and some interesting ideas that float through the dialogue, but the film still drags on badly. The characters are neither well defined nor well acted and the setting and the general scheme of colors are monotonous and boring. The film is not completely terrible and has some points of interest, perhaps a judicious use of the fast forward button could improve it. With twenty minutes of delay, this could be a sci-fi thriller. But the full-length movie is boring. Recommended only for very patient and determined Kitumura fans.
