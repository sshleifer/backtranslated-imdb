This film describes the experiences of a couple of assassins (one of them Burt Reynolds), a prostitute and two drag queens over a few hours in a night in Miami. Convergent plots will eventually bring all people together in one place and time. The film was pleasantly amusing, but the big problem was that everything happened at night and many scenes were literally under-exposed to the point that it was impossible to see what was happening. In some scenes you can actually see where they tried to "stretch" the development process to save images. Some did not know how to operate a camera. Unbelievable that this film has even been released!
