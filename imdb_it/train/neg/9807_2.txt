Very rarely do I make less enthusiastic reviews about a show or a movie that I don't like on IMDb, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is so terribly terrible, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't mind if it was an animated series - it would have been better that way, I think, but as a live show, it means the terms "cheesy" and "campy". Of which Power Rangers is. Five multicolored boys wearing spandex fight evil using their martial arts skills. The costumes are horrible: they look like something that recalls what athletes and gymnasts would wear. The acting is painful, and the choreography of the fight is so terribly ugly and so lame to watch, makes Jean-Claude Van Damme, like Bruce Lee, which is in itself an understatement. In fact, they look like they jump and dance; as if it were a version of the "Nutcracker", or they were doing ballet, rather than fighting. Also, there are some cartoons that heavily characterize martial arts, yet it is done in a fun way, but not so substandard, which makes it silly. <br /> <br /> Entertainment for children or not, this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity. And even though this version is set in America, you might be forgiven for thinking that while watching some of the combat sequences that weren't filmed in the US, but rather in Japan; so the fight and the "fake" movie were borrowed from the Japanese version, only to be juxtaposed to the American version. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of thing, then stay with Sentai, the Japanese equivalent.
