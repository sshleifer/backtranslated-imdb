With the exception of the FAMILY, this new season is worse than the first. I can't imagine what they're thinking. As a horror fan, he can tolerate a lot of cold and upheaval, but this series gets worse with every release. I can't imagine how daunting it must be for the actors and the crew to go to work every day, struggling to churn out such crap. HISTORY! Is it too much to ask? CHARACTER! How can we not care about the fate of NONE in these stories? If we are not engaged, who cares if they are engraved or otherwise? Almost all the episodes conclude with letting go of blood without meaning, going into a gross shock with no sense of revelation or conclusion or REASON because we have been subjected to an hour of bleeding. Even Dante's effort this season has had some disturbing sexist violence and has wandered towards a useless conclusion. Ironically, production values ​​and performance tend to be in step with speed, while the content is completely absurd. I have high hopes for VALARIE UNDER THE SCALES of Garris of Exec Producer, but we'll see.
