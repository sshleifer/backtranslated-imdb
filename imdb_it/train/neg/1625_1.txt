When I went to school I was making a film about a couple that was walking in the trees and talking and I realized halfway through the editing that this was not just a failed aesthetic strategy but a clich√© of Canadian cinema: soaked lyricism married and vacant, stabs burdened with social commentary. But whatever the defects of my own film, I feel much better after seeing this ... this ... thing. First, mine worked for 20 minutes, not for 85, and it had more content in this: every useless business here ended up four, five, six minutes nonstop. The male protagonist is simply incredible, an insinuating, open-mouthed asshole given to explosions of dramatic class improvisation amid philosophical insights gathered from the U of T pub, and he is given a lot of space to make us hate. Of course, if it were not such a hole, then the third act would make even less sense, given that a couple of boys show themselves to provide distant and absolutely useless echoes of "exploitation" values; but it does not make it easier to look at the whining caged "please" in the foreground until the magazine runs out. I resume what I said about AUTUMN NATO, which at least has the courage of its illicit lust: this film crater is and will remain the worst Canadian film of all time. At least, I really hope so.
