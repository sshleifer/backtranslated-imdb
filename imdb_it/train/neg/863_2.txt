I realized from observing the European horror, in particular the films made by the cult luminary Jess Franco, that you can't expect a plot that makes much sense. However, Franco went overboard with this film; and despite the surreal atmosphere and the film's reputation as one of the director's best - Succubus is unfortunately a really terrible film. I must admit that I saw the cut American version, which runs about 76 minutes; but unless it was just the logic that was cut, I'm sure the longer European version is just as boring. The plot has something to do with a woman who preaches; practice S & M and talk about junk, and it's all really boring. There is no blood and sex is boring, and most of the execution time is occupied by boring dialogues and despite the fact that it is a short film; I had trouble doing everything until the end. I must say that the locations look beautiful and Franco did a good job using his surreal atmosphere; but the positive elements end there. Jess Franco is certainly a talented director who has made some classic trash films - but he seems to be one of the ones he made for money, and in general I recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director's most interesting works.
