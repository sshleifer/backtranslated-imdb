Revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films because, in fact, most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events. Unfortunately, what this film lacks in the drama is offset by an overabundance of boredom. It doesn't matter to whom wins, loses, dies or lives - just finish it as soon as possible. This is largely due to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology. The scenes of Paris and the French countryside have a cardboard quality on them. They could be better done on a bare stage and left in that direction. One cannot expect the surprising effects of "The House of Flying Daggers" or "The Golden Compass", but, after all, this is a digitally managed production in 2002. The characters seem to enter a scene to enter a scene, so much so that the count of the number of times the character enters and leaves the rooms is lost. From my point of view, this film transforms the French revolution of the 90s into the "papier-mâché" revolution of a "papier colle" world.
