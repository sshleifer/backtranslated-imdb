The humor of Who's Your Daddy is such a taste that I actually closed my eyes in certain scenes. Sperm tops are not fun! No one thinks they are. People get nervous when they see something so coarse and to hide their nervousness, they laugh. Watching who your dad is gave me a disgusting nervous feeling.
