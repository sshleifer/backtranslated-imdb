I agree with the previous comment, what a disappointment. I rented it thinking it would be a good movie since Mira and Olivier were inside. I was surprised by their performance, I expected more since they are good actors. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a slow start but it got worse. I even laughed at the bad stunts !! when it should be a mysterious film. You can also guess who the killer is in advance !!! <br /> <br /> For what really happened ?? <br /> <br /> Sorry to say, but don't worry about wasting time or money. <br /> <br /> Boring !!!
