I noticed that most people who think this film is true were not born before the moon landings (1969-1972), or not big enough to appreciate them. I think it's much easier to question a historical event if I didn't live it. <br /> <br /> I was a young man at the time of Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was happening. The whole world has followed the moon landings. Our families gathered around the TV to watch the launch. The headlines screamed the latest news every day, from launch to landing, from sidewalks to the take-off of the moon, to the splashdown, in a multitude of languages. At school, some lessons were canceled to watch the main events on TV. During Apollo 13 the world prayed and kept its collective breath as men limped towards an uncertain destiny. You couldn't go anywhere without someone asking what the last one was. The world was truly one community. <br /> <br /> Now with an odd 30-year buffer after the fact, it is easy to claim fraud because the enthusiasm and interest of the whole world have diminished. We stayed with our history books, and anyone can say that the story is wrong and try to "prove it" with a bunch of lies and invented facts completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence that proves the opposite - not to mention the evidence who dwells in the souls and memories of those who have lived these wonderfully intoxicating and fantastic days.
