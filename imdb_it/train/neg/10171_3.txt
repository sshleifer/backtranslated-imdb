Comparison with American Graffiti is inevitable, so save time and money by renting this timeless classic. Speaking of current events, there was an episode of Cheers in which Norm and Cliff competed on who can find the most anachronism in a film. They would have loved this movie all from some of the songs and some of the clothes were wrong. There were shrewd references like "paved the paradise to build a parking lot". The filmmakers hoped to make us smile, but basically they made me moan. <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are incredibly politically and socially astute for teenagers. Almost as clever as the people who were about thirty and forty when they wrote the damn movie. Very little of what the characters said was credible. Combines bad writing and bad acting this film completely fails. Although there were two exceptions, Kelli Williams revives things as the future child of flowers and, despite what another reviewer said, Rick Shroeder was pretty good. Showing that brooding feature that would come to a boil in his eventual appearance in "N.Y.P.D. Blues".
