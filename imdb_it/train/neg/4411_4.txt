Michael Rooker is a decent actor, but he has no leading role except in a low-budget film. He doesn't have much charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has much more presence on the screen and, unfortunately, he is not the main character. Most of the time spent on the screen is dedicated to the brick-faced Rooker. <br /> <br /> Danielle Harris (from the Halloween movies 4 and 5) plays her daughter, she's pretty and funny but she's also not that intelligent and one of her stupid mistakes killed one of the main characters. Comedians Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait and Stephen Furst are here in interesting roles. Just looking at what happens to these characters is priceless. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schiavelli plays the Advise to the godfather of the local mafia, and it is difficult to say whether he is working on the film as a comedy or not. Tim Thomerson is also in this film. It seems to be in every action movie directed at the extremely cheap video. Thomerson is also present in some low-budget comedies. Seeing so many comedians and comedians in this film made it seem like a parody. Is it a parody of a Yakuza movie? In some places it is difficult to say. There is certainly very little Yakuza action. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast of Thugs and Goons is threatening and melted. Some of these films have Thugs that seem to work in the local Comic Book Store or as Piggly-Wiggly warehouse workers. Overall this film is very irregular. At some points it looks like a comedy or a parody. Then in other places it works like a good action movie. Then he spits until the end. Without the contribution of Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibashi, this film will evaluate a zero in my humble opinion.
