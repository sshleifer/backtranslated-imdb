Universal Soldier: The Return is not the worst movie ever made. No, that honor would have had to go to a film that tried to make some sort of affirmation or to realize some artistic feat, but failed in a pathetic or offensive way. However, perhaps no film I have ever seen has tried for so little and managed so completely as did Universal Soldier: The Return. <br /> <br /> This film is a sci-fi / action disguise that has virtually nothing to recommend. The acting is as bad as any movie I've ever seen. The plot is terrible and predictable. The special effects are pathetic. In short, anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of itself. United States: The Return makes Van Damme's previous kitchen look like revolutionary cinematic masterpieces. Some movies are so bad, they're good. Believe me when I tell you this is not one of them. I'm not really sure what else to say here. I doubt that many people were considering seeing this movie if they hadn't already done so, but just in case: don't do it.
