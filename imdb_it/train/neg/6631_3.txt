Ram Gopal Verma proved to be a very innovative and competent director. He had made a remake / reworking of the Godfather with Sarkar, and he succeeded tremendously. Ditto for Lolita who made like Nishaabd. <br /> <br /> Sholay was the film that repeatedly says it inspired him the most. Unfortunately, he managed to make a disappointing and eventually boring remake. <br /> <br /> The acting ranged from decent to very good, with Amitabh Bachchan being appropriately threatening like the bad Babban. <br /> <br /> The songs were horrible and forgettable. The song Mehbooba Mehbooba turned out to be a second music video. <br /> <br /> The worst part was the rhythm and the dialogues, which were forgettable. <br /> <br /> Watching the film in a theater, I found myself waiting for the break, and then the finale. Some viewers were wise not to wait, and were seen leaving for the duration of the film. Ultimately, one of the worst films made by Ram Gopal Verma.
