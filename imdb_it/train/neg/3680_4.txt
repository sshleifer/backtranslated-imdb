I remember a certain Tuesday, the morning of 6/18/02 to be precise. I had dozed off, trying to convince myself to get out of bed when there was a terrifying explosion. I went to the kitchen, where I have a view of several neighborhoods in the southern part of Jerusalem and saw a column of smoke rising from a distant point, the sight of the smoke was followed a minute later by the buzzing of the sirens. I remember rushing into the bedroom, taking out the binoculars, running into the kitchen and seeing the image of a shattered glass bus. The bus was still near the pickup station where a terrorist boarded it and with one click on a TNT device, killed 25 passengers, many of whom were going to school. The wife of a dear friend of mine sat on the back of the bus, a seemingly arbitrary and meaningless decision that saved her life. I'm sure every Israeli has at least one terrorist related memory he wishes he never would have and it was only a matter of time before someone made a film about it. As it turned out, the film was about to become his repressed memory. <br /> <br /> The film is about a game-writing on a dry track, Haim Buzaglo (played by, hmmm, Haim Buzaglo who also wrote and directed the film) who spends most of his day conducting competitions staring with its blank word processor page. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, a field journalist for the Israeli commercial channel, decides to do a piece on a former debt-led army officer. Buzaglo, bored and a little paranoid because of what is medically known as the "what the hell this hot girl is going out with me" syndrome, asks a private individual to conduct a stakeout on his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> As a detective he progresses in his investigation, his observations are permeating in the game and later, in the life of his actors. Meanwhile, the metamorphosis drama from a comic game into an accusation against the detachment of Israeli society. As for the film, well, the film becomes a frantic editing exercise, hidden among its petty characters in cardboard and unreliable dialogues as it moves away from miles away from the subject he was supposed to face in the first place. <br /> <br /> When I say "cartoon characters" I refer to the characters who, under the writer's / director's obsession with a "meaningful" film, lacked genuine dialogue and every shred of reliability. I won't talk too much about it. Suffice it to say that I'm sure the homeless barefoot prostitutes rarely go to the theater. With the intention of seeing a play, this is it. <br /> <br /> This film, according to Haim Buzaglo himself is the first part of a trilogy of the current program. I sincerely hope that the other two films will derive from experiences like the one I wrote at the beginning of my review with respect to the isolated world of characters that are anything but existing and a plot that is anything but compelling. <Br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter. <br /> <br /> PS This film was a landmark in austerity. It was shot in ten days, all the cast worked for free and the entire cost of the film was around $ 12,000 (no, I didn't omit a zero or two, twelve thousand dollars). You wonder why it took $ 34,000 to complete the Blair witch project.
