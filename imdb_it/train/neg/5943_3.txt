This film reminded me of the Sopranos and not in a positive sense. <br /> <br /> David Chase's mafia work has never failed twice, the most shocking and inexplicable instance of which took place in its fourth season, when Junior Soprano went on trial for his life. Rather than pursuing this line of compelling (and fundamental) plot, the writers preferred instead to ignore it completely, focusing instead on the constant whining of Bobby Baccalieri on the frozen pasta dish of the deceased's dead wife. <br /> <br /> When something of genuine interest happens in Notorious - for example that first, mysterious attempt at murder on Tupac Shakur that triggered the entire East Coast / West Coast feud in the first place, and ended up provoking the death of both Tupac and Christopher Wallace - the film treats it as another piece of plot to go. Why exactly was Tupac so convinced that he had been sold by his own people? Has he cultivated his next affiliation with Suge Knight by himself? And was it the transformation of Lil 'Kim from the drone of the first office into a vampire diva obsessed with sex as trivial as it seems here? <br /> <br /> None of these questions are dealt with fleetingly by the film's screenwriters, who are much more interested in portraying Wallace's turbulent love life with zero dramatic thrilling success. These sequences (including an indescribable group indulgence in a hotel room) are so corny and fiercely manipulative that the only real comparison to make is with a TV network movie. <br /> <br /> The narrative, in both structure and content, is simplistic and trivial. But more fundamentally, like a biographical film; as something designed to celebrate its subject and educate the uninitiated about the complexity of their life and their work; the film is almost completely useless. The dependence on the meat and potato genre plot, combined with lifeless musical performances (an area in which a film like this should surely rise) is translated into a film that seems to have been designed only to satisfy the whims and demands of those involved, leaving Wallace's questionable status as a giant in his field as the easy-to-persuade and previously converted reserve. <br /> <br /> And the last twenty minutes, in which the posthumous cultural identity of Wallace is largely painted in a similar way to that of a saint of recent days, frankly made me feel like vomiting. <br /> <br /> On that score, like any other, Notorious is coarse, calculating and compromised.
