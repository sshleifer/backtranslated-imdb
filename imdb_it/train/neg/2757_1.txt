I'm a boy, who loves kids movies ... I couldn't wait to see a dragon fight with the army with fantastic special effects. All this happened, however, this film was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The story was standard, but the portrait of the story was terrible. Scene transitions were the worst I've ever seen. Why would you go to the beach to relax if your life was in danger? The same actions as the dragon dragon were written very badly ... and the attacking ability of the snake dragon varied widely in the film, many times the main characters should have died. <br /> <br /> The director tried to infuse a love story in the middle of the film during the most stressful moments, this film was obviously not seen after it was made, I love movies, but I have had to force me to finish looking at him, thank god I didn't buy it, I borrowed it from a friend. <br /> <br /> Don't buy this, don't rent it, just look at the discovery channel ... much more exciting.
