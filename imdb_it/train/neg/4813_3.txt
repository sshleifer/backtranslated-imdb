I gave up trying to figure out what version of this I'm looking at. Copyright eventually indicates 1983. And although this is not the important point of my objection to this film, I will say that watching a film obviously made in the Aquarian Age (including long-haired hippy chicks and hateful station wagons ) but with a The soundtrack of the synth of the 80s is shocking. Extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> My main objection here is HOW TO GIVE FILMAKERS BURY CUTE-AS-A-BUTTON PAMELA FRANKLIN ALIVE. Seriously it's all lovely and stuff but in the two movies where I saw her - this crapfest and otherwise excellent Legend of Hell House - they kill her. <Br /> <br /> I would like to point out the film industry. Pamela Franklin apparently retired from business, but if she ever decides to make another film and some director's bad luck tries to kill her, I ASK HIM OUT. <br /> <br /> NO BEATS ABOVE PAMELA FRANKLIN AND IT GOES AWAY. I AM A QUIET CROSS. THE FURY HAS BEEN DISCONNECTED. <br /> <br /> For fans of B movies looking for a crapfest, you could do a lot worse than that. On the plus side, this is not a film that involves Satanism in a peripheral and circumspect way - this film is a satanic film. <br /> <br /> Satanic wall-to-wall ceremonies, baphomets, hallucinations, a ridiculous attack on the rat - what else could you ask for. <br /> <br /> This excellent stuff is almost ruined by the amazing 80's synth soundtrack, which has no equal to a movie like it can be. The soundtrack reminded me of something you would have heard on The Equalizer. It's really bad. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, they made Pamela Franklin crush her charming English accent, which was also rather rude, if not cruel atrocities (against the viewer) as it could be covered by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I say we have the right to hear Pamela Franklin speak with her own voice. Who's with me? I could forgive the rest of this film if they didn't violate Pamela Franklin. And so I launch the gauntlet, gentlemen - WHO WE ARE MADE WITH PAMELA FRANKLIN MESSE WITH ME. <br /> <br /> ALSO IN A FICTIONAL CONTEXT. <br /> <br /> GOOD DAY, SIRS.
