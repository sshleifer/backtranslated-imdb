Not worth the video rental or the time or occasional efforts. <br /> <br /> * A trick a child can do. * The acting was over ... bad direction. * The editing was very discontinuous ... many things made no sense or simply seemed free. * The sound has been dubbed. * Music was highly inappropriate. * The casting was extremely off ... it had to be in crack. * Zombies who speak for themselves ... drive, dance, work ... it pisses me off. * And the bad guy ... Holy Crap! As horribly chosen as he ... it was the most beautiful zombie of all. Which doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> The Cover Art was good but very deceptive ... as was the main DVD menu ... great works of art and music. <br /> <br /> DON "BOTHER!
