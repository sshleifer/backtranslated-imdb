This was the worst acting film I've ever seen in my life. No, really. I'm not kidding. Apart from "based on a true story / historical references" aside, there is no excuse for such bad acting. It's a shame, because, as others have posted, the sets and costumes were fantastic. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was typical "Asian style" music, although I could not understand where the "modern" was, the love song came in when Fernando was lying in his bed thinking about Maria. I don't know who wrote and sang that beautiful song, but it's as if suddenly Norah Jones was transported in 1500. <br /> <br /> Hershey's blood syrup to Phycho was more realistic than the ketchup sprayed during the Scene di battle of Kwik-n-EZ. <br /> <br /> But acting. Oh, so painfully sad. Lines delivered like a bad junior run. If Gary Stretch had worn a Potato costume for the County 4H Fair, it would have been more credible. Towards the end he looked more like a Little Italy street hooligan. Sometimes I almost expected him to shout "Adrian!" or even "Do you want a piece of me?!". <br /> <br /> Preferred line: when the queen tells her lover (after vomiting on the floor) "I will have a baby". Answers "A child?" I expected her to answer "No, asshole, a chair leg! Duh."
