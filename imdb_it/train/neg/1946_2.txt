As a mother of 2 young children who are or should say they grew up with the many reincarnations of Scooby, I feel well positioned to comment on the historical and current version of Scooby. <br /> <br /> If as a family we had never seen episodes before Shaggy and Scooby understood that perhaps we liked a light weight, no special Saturday morning cartoon. But this is essentially the problem that is in its current format so light that it will not have the longevity of the "old" Scooby and the gang. I'm sure it could succeed in a quick monetary return, but I'm sure the long-term purchase of old and young people is in serious danger of being lost. My 6 year old son was really unhappy to see the new version and without any suggestion he said it looked really badly and because it was nothing like the last series (Where are you). <br /> <br /> Scrappy Doo was an anomaly but still infinitely better than this. We hope to get a clue by the way with reference to the producers.
