I noticed with some amusement that in the closing credits, the PD in Detroit was thanked for their participation. The police chief also has a speaking line that sounds itself (and boy, can you say he can't act). The reason for the fun is that in this film the police shoot first and ask questions later. Not the kind of PR, I would think a police force would like. Apart from that, this is your standard movie of guards and thieves dressed for the 70s with a racial angle. Alex Rocco is given an ungrateful role of a lurking policeman who cannot go on and is joined by a mentally ill wife. He takes care of this by attending the local brothel. Hari Rhodes is his charming partner who has a harmonious wardrobe and who loves to chase suspects by wearing a trench coat. The film goes on until the penultimate shooting that makes absolutely no sense (why do people who are just guilty of robbery take on an entire police force?). Not only do we see a shooting but since there are four villains, we can see four. Then there is an ending that should hint at what would have happened, but he just let me think about how stupid he was. Seeing that director Arthur Marks was also behind the brain "Friday Foster" and "Bucktown", I shouldn't have asked.
