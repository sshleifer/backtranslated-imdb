so ... she's really sexist and classist, and I thought it might not be in the early stages of the movie, like when Stella tells Steven that she'd really like to change herself and start talking right and tell her not to change. Well, he certainly changed his music, and it seems that other reviewers have followed suit. what at first seems to be a love story actually involves social inclusion and women as sacrificial mothers. the end of the film doesn't make her a hero, it makes it all sad. and it's sad that people think he's a hero. perhaps this is the comment of the film that people should take away. positive reception reflects continuous patriarchal currents in social consciousness. how disgusting.
