I saw this movie on the mystery science theater when it was called "It is alive by night". That title is much less misleading than "Batpeople". Actually it would be more precisely called Batperson. This film is about a doctor who studies bats that I'm thinking because he wants to make a better cure for rabies. This is not very clear. What is clear is that he and his wife take a ride in a cave and he is bitten by a bat. Because a scientist needs to take a tour to study bats is beyond me. He shouldn't be able to go alone. Well, after being bitten, he and his wife go on their honeymoon where they start taking tricks. They go to the worst doctor ever. The boy stays in the hospital and kills a nurse. Eventually the boy kills 3-4 people and his wife is at his side and you are supposed to be cheering for him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders.
