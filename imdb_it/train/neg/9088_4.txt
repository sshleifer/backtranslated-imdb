It has been said many times - not least by me - that watching an Eric Rohmer movie is like looking at dry paint; it seems that Monsieur Rohmer regrets this (he does not deny it, but how could he, he only resents himself) so much that his new film, which could also be his last Inch Allah, is set so back in time that it is like watch the woad dry. Those wonderful people who gave you the Nouvelle Vague, the Cahiers du Cinema have already defined it one of the best films of 2007, so you should give yourself an idea. The reality is not at the top of Rohmer's agenda, so that in fifth-century France we have at one end a castle that would not be out of place in the Loire valley while the only other dwelling we see is a cursed wooden hut. The story involves nymphs and shepherds and, as often happens, Rohmer launched it with unknowns that went out of fashion so that the general effect is that the annual lesson in a school for special needs students was captured by chance in a movie. It is almost tempting to say "Godard returns, everything is forgiven" but even this painful production cannot make me say those words.
