Great cast. Great acting. Unpredictable plot for the first time <br /> <br /> about. I really wanted to know what would happen to each of these unredeemed characters and how their seemingly disparate lives would be intertwined. But when <br /> <br /> the writers removed the glue to start connecting the players, they mistakenly used super glue and blocked the movie <br /> for the last two hours. I kept thinking that it would improve, but only <br /> <br /> it got worse. Don't believe the reviews. This is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Think about it - Tom Cruise has become ugly - why? The magnificent hunky bartender <br /> is wearing braces - why? I know it had to do with the <br /> <br /> plot, but without them, at least there would have been an attractive cast member <br /> <br /> to remember.
