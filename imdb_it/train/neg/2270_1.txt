The only thing that kept me from vomiting after seeing this movie was the fact that these are just actors and not the strange show that usually appears on the TV show. This is also the main reason why TV show fans will not appreciate the film, but not the only reason. This film has as much entertainment value as getting a main channel. It gets closer to the abyssal depths of the bad movie, and then it gets even worse. I will not waste your time describing this film in more detail; suffice it to say that I feel pity for the poor photographers who have had to suffer looking at this c ** p the first time.
