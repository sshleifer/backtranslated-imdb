Introduced in 1955, THE COBWEB is an all-star cast that ranges from the silent screen veteran LILLIAN GISH to the offspring of Actors Studio SUSAN STRASBERG. Set in an exclusive psychiatric hospital, what is the film you wonder about ...... high drama? Doctor-patient relations? Shock therapy therapy? No, this screamer talks about who exactly will manage to collect the drapes for a psychiatric hospital! Do you think I'm joking? You won't believe your eyes while you are watching this incredible storyline that has been turned into a movie! Progressive head shrink Dr. McIver (RICHARD WIDMARK) wants to involve all hospital patients in the design, selection and execution of the new necessary drapes. McIver's wife, played by Bocca di marmo GLORIA GRAHAM, wants to get her 2 centime in this monumental task. This is what the long time staff Miss Inch (LILLIAN GISH) does. Directed by VINCENT MINELLI, you're wondering if he really became too involved in the smallest details because of his marriage to WUD JUDY GARLAND. Talented actors like LAUREN BACALL, SUSAN STRASBERG, CHARLES BOYER and JOHN KERR are wasted on this hockey story. What were they thinking?
