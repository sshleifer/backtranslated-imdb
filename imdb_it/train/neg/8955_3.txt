As for the film, it's a science fiction movie OK. It has a lot of interesting things and some quality scenes. That being said, it's not so nice, and some of the things are pretty far-fetched ... <br /> <br /> As for calling this other movie-cube it's total and complete bullsh! T. This is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original film ... The whole feeling can somehow be translated into the core of the first, but the introduction of people / androids as part of the "team" behind the cube itself is a bit of a stretch ... <br /> <br /> I gave this 3 *** because of the stab behind the original. This should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the film that there is no place or time to mention them all ... <br /> <br /> Watchable for those who have not seen Cube and Hypercube, but it is not recommended for fans of the series ...
