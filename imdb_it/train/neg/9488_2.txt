I've seen some terrible horror movies in my time, and while this isn't the worst of the group, it's certainly in the lower half. The script starts OK. A young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern, hoping he can turn it into a better job for him and his future wife. Cute eh? The film then goes directly to the bathroom when you notice that something is killing the patients. It turns out that there is a demon in the basement that is gathering people's souls. It is the duty of the 1 doctor, 1 nurse and 1 security guard of the entire staff of the hospital to drag this mentally ill person downstairs, to perform a ritual that practically requires only the removal of the tongue, and thus allow the prop of the haunted house of a demon going out and stealing his soul through the magic of special cheese effects. At this point the film becomes so ridiculously stupid, I was asking for it to end. There was still an hour to go. The episode of "Tales From the Crypt" seemed to take half an hour and in some way it stretched to an hour and a half of shit. From Tiny Lister who plays his best performance of John Coffey (The Green Mile) to Tracy Scoggins who plays the stereotypical Nurse Ratchet fryer, this film fails at all possible levels. I gave this 2 stars only for two reasons. 1) Her boyfriend is pretty hot, she has eased the pain a little towards the end and 2) The film actually looks OK, much better than the current trend of horror movies made with Wal-Mart quality cameras. <br /> <br /> In the end, avoid this asshole even if you have the Blockbuster movie pass (which I do, and I still felt cheated). As a bonus game, you and your friends take a shot whenever Matt Stasi (Dr. James Bishop) shakes his head while talking. You will be drunk for 15 minutes in the film.
