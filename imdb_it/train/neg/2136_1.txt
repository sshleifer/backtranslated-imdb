Most likely the worst movie I've ever seen. When did Hollywood ever make a hit film that attacked Republicans? Why don't they learn Dixie chicks no. These left-handed people live in their own elite bubble that interacts with each other; oblivious to the fact that most of America has a much higher value than they are. <br /> <br /> The best Hollywood productions are not partisan and are rarely political. <br /> <br /> The imitation of Dan Akroyd of Cheney was bad. <br /> <br /> I would have thought Cussack could have made better films. <br /> <br /> It wasn't fun.
