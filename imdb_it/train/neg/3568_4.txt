The truth is that a film based on a novel by Harold Robbins will not win any prize. This is not an exception. "The Lonely Lady" is a pure B image in terms of budget, cast and execution. Technically, it looks like a movie made for TV. The acting is very irregular. Joseph Cali is particularly terrible. Anthony Holland is an embarrassment. As a review of a certain performance by Katherine Hepburn said, her range goes from A to B. Ms. Zedora manages to reach G. The rest of the cast is solid (and wasted in their respective roles). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserved better. However, it can all be a lot of fun in a scruffy way. As befits Robbins, everything revolves around sex and nudity. If you're looking for some fun ... and you're not too sober ... this could be for you.
