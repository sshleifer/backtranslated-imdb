This is complete and absolute rubbish, a fine example of how a BAD film is, this can't be appealing to anyone, not even b-movie fans. Not, I repeat, DO NOT waste precious time of your life on this piece of junk. Bad acting, bad direction, horrible (but I mean really horrible) script, and complete lack of an idea about what entertainment is (of any form). I bought the DVD for $ 3, I swear I could almost pay someone to get it. Burning would not be enough for what this film did to me. I like the b-movies, the killer toys, the strange monsters of the lagoon, but this is not at all close. Do you know those movies that are so bad that they are funny? Not even. Simply old, pathetic.
