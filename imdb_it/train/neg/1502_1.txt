The Ballad of Django is a meandering chaos of a movie! This spaghetti western is simply a collection of scenes taken from others (and much better!) Films apparently linked together by "Django" which tells how he brought several outlaws. Hunt Powers (John Cameron) brings nothing to the role of Django. Skip this unless you only have to do all of Django's movies and even that may not be a good enough excuse to see this !!
