There are so many stupid moments in 'Tower of Death' / 'Game of Death 2' that you really wonder if it's a parody. At times, I felt like I was watching a sequel of Kung Pow rather than a Bruce Lee movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie has to do with "Game of Death". If anything, it's more of a sequel / remake of "Enter the Dragon", which incorporates many elements of that movie, especially the actual movie. Bruce Lee's character Billy Lo (apparently) investigates the sudden death of his friend and encounters a piece of film that has remained with the man's daughter. When the body is stolen during the funeral (!), Billy is also killed and it's up to his rebel brother to avenge the death of both. <br /> <br /> Tong Long plays brother Bobby Lo and doesn't really have the kind of charisma to bring the movie. His fighting skills are still very good. Obviously Bruce Lee shows up thanks to (no longer) deleted videos simply to collect the inheritance. Saying that, overall, the movie is actually modified for the better than in "Game of Death" but does not prevent the film from being a disaster. <br /> <br /> OK, so the fights are actually a lot of fun (dare I say amazing) and make the movie at least watchable. But there are so many stupid elements in this film that tests your patience. First of all, is there the alleged villain who lives in his lavish estate ... or is it a mental institution? Seriously, the nutter eats raw venison, drinks deer blood, carries a monkey on the shoulder and owns some peacocks and lions (?!). This attempt to make it look tough and smart makes you feel sorry for him - you expect someone to escort him back to his room. <br /> <br /> Actually, this central section is terrible and when the scene involves A naked prostitute and a lion suit arrived, I turned it off. Anyway, I finished the film and I was happy to have done it because the fighting scene towards the end (very similar to "GOD") was the whole reason to watch. While the story is embarrassing, the action is very good and contains excellent choreography. <br /> <br /> But the ending also disappoints if the premise is something to follow. What we have been told is that the "Tower of Death" was an upside-down and underground pagoda. It looked great, like a breakthrough in Bruce Lee's original idea with different fighting styles on every level. Could this be the "Game of Death" that was originally planned? No! The film should have been called "Generator Room of Death" because it is so far to the tower. Of course, there were indeed one or two "different" styles ... there were grunts dressed in foil, a leopard-skinned henchman, and a stupid monk. It is as if Enter the Dragon had never been created, with the plot as a bad imitation. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at the fast-paced fight scenes once, but sometimes so stupid as to hurt. If this was intended, then it's fine. Congratulations, however, for recreating the projector room scene from "Enter The Dragon".
