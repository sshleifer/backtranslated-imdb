Jeux d'enfants or how the film was incorrectly translated into English Love me if You Dare is a film made by stupid people and stupid people. I just don't know how I could expect something worth looking at a movie with a story like this: Two stupid ignorant boys make a bet that each of them will do something (surely extremely idiotic) to prove to each other (wtf?) That they are "cool dudes". I know I've exaggerated on some aspects, but that's what the whole movie is about. They grow old ... and instead of realizing that they are just a couple of strange aliens they continue to do their crazy things, thinking they are fantastic people. <br /> <br /> We could expect a Hollywood movie, but France? It is even more offensive to watch the film from the country that created Amelie a couple of years ago, which, btw, the film tries to look like but is far away, extremely far from. <br /> <br /> Avoid. To avoid. To avoid.
