This youthful and banal film is reserved for adolescents in the bodies of the old, desperate to relive their teenage orphan years. Such as ? Burning gas and equating a fast and reckless car (or plane) with freedom. <br /> <br /> The plot borrowed heavily from the Mister Rogers neighborhood (if run by an oil conglomerate) and Logan's Run (if it was heavily sedated and lacked a clear sense of style. <br /> <br /> Interpreted by Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith, this film is set in a world of post-gas crisis in which an omnipotent government does not want (* ahem *) to drive your car and burn gas. current government of Enron-and-Bush, which captures the oil, which drives SUVs. <br /> <br /> This juxtaposition alone makes the film ridiculous, but wait ... there's more. set in the future, we are not shown any signs of future technology, in addition to the return to bicycles, golf carts and horses, you believe the future appears ... exactly like today: same clothes, same suburban houses, same green lawns as today and when the film was made There are no solar panels, no windmills, no concessions for alt Hernizing energy. <br /> <br /> The acting is flat and tasteless. Even the scenes that could have been gritty or moving, buddy-flick, honor, romance, horror ... all fall flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase. <br /> <br /> Lack of continuity: the jet piloted by The Burgess character Meredith changes color and configuration from moment to moment, while filmmakers insult our intelligence with uninterrupted footage again and again. <br /> <br /> The plot is equally astonishing and just the exciting half of an episode of Dukes of Hazzard. <br /> <br /> Even tough car-movies and science fiction fans should avoid this movie as a month-long roadkill, unless you like Exxon executives trying to make an empty film like the tank of the hero's gas.
