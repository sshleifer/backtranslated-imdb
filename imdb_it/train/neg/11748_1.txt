This movie must be one of the worst I've ever seen on DVD !!! The plot could have been taken if the film had more funds and writers who would have cut the senseless and sick scenes of which I greatly admire the parents ... But the plot is like a wandering madman. If there was such a thing as a drive through movie maker, this would have resulted from this. It reminded me of a lot of fast movies that were put out in the 60s, badly written screenplays and shootings. <br /> <br /> The only sensible characters in the whole film were the bartender and the beaver. The rest of the film could have been easily realized by middle school children. I give this film a rating of 1 since it is really terrible and left my entire family with the feeling of being scammed. My advice: don't watch it !!!
