Unfortunately for me, the first Busby Berkeley movie I've ever seen was "42nd Street". Then I expected all his things to be so good. I found out that it wasn't necessarily so, even here, with my all-time classic actor James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Oh, the musical numbers are spectacular as usual at the end, but the story is like many others and rather boring. They always seem to involve producers of screaming and unhappy shows. In this film, it's Cagney who ends up screaming so often that he gives me a headache after a while and his character wears out ... fast! <br /> <br /> Even the songs here are close "" The 42nd Street ", songs you could sing for years and years - decades, I should say. The songs in this movie are not memorable. No, this is one a few early Cagney films - and Berkeley films - I don't like at all and I was very disappointed when I watched.
