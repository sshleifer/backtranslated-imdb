Although unfortunately you think you are (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately this film ended mercifully quickly. The script makes little sense, the idea of ​​the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trivial, and John Lydon shows us all, in the space of a film, why he should never have freed himself from music. His performance is monotonous and irritating. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing to say is that Harvey Keitel is able to deliver a good breakthrough. His next bad lieutenant would show how good actors can be, but fortunately his performance here is contained.
