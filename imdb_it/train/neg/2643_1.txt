This, for lack of a better term, the film is very bad. Where do I start ...... <br /> <br /> Cinemaphotography - This was, perhaps, the worst I've seen this year. The camera seemed to be thrown by a cameraman to the cameraman. Maybe they just had a camera. It gives you the feeling of being a volleyball. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of scenes, at random, thrown without continuity. When they made the 'split screen', it was absurd. Everything was crushed, it seemed ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The color tones were far away. These people need to learn how to balance a camera. This "film" is badly made and badly done. <br /> <br /> The plot: you're kidding. If I were an SS agent, I would sue the producers. they looked like the Marks Brothers with radios and pistols. Sutherland was in his '24' mode - I can see it for free. Eva Longoria would have been better with a little less, and much more. As a child of action it was not much. <br /> <br /> I couldn't see a real storyline, except that Douglas scolded the Presidents' wife. I never said why the mercenaries were trying to kill the pres I don't see the President of the United States running for his life in the utility tunnels of a building, like a mouse in a maze. p-l-and-a-s-e. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This film is the proof. I like "the big screen". Since I was a child. Many other "movies" like this and I'll stop going. What's the Hollywood problem, made so many chicks movies, forget how to make a real movie? If I owned a theater, I would start directing old movies. The one with real actors, good narrative lines - and good Cinemaphotography. <br /> <br /> This 'film' is a dog. Don't waste your time or money on it. I consider this 'film' a zero! Douglas is not suited for this role. I can look beyond his age, but his is just a great subject to carry it forward.
