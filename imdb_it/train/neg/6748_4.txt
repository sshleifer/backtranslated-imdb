Let me tell you that I followed him by watching this video looking at Saw and after Bleed, Saw looked like the horror movie of all time, even though I thought it was just good enough. Bleed is pretty bad. The best part is seeing the naked female cast. The blood is very fake and too finished. It has its fun parts but is extremely predictable and I didn't want to stay and watch the horrible final. If I could, I would ban these actors and actresses, the only reason is that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) has been in over a hundred other videos and I've also seen two other cast members in the same or worse films. They should not allow this madness to continue.
