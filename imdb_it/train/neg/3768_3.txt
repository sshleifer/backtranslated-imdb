Quite right. A film written, directed and produced by Fred Tepper and family. (Fred should have known, having worked with the sets of "Titantic" and "Dogma".) <br /> <br /> So, the plot. There are some scientists, some forest guards and a sexy girl with huge fake breasts. They are all very bad in their work, including the hot chick (which I think should be a photographer, but who cares because he is wearing a bikini). One of the forest guards comments that scientists are "professionals", which is good, because it would be horrible if they were professional larvae or jellybeans or Ewoks. <br /> <br /> They are hiking through the woods in search of some strange monkey-like bones, and no one even mentions that the bones could be those of the infamous Bigfoot. They wander and one of the rangers blatantly hits the bomb. We all hope he will die soon (along with his sister who is destined to be pretty and naive, but really annoying). Then they, * pant *, find a Sasqu ... I mean, Ape-like Animal Burial Ground. Of course, it's not said that they could be just Bigfoot bones they're joking with ... I guess scientists and rangers don't think about this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> So Sasquatch and his tribe get angry and kill all the people we don't like, kick the other losers and bury his great-aunt Muriel and cousin Josh (who died in an unfortunate trout accident) again. <br /> <br /> Tasteless, boring dialogue (I disappeared several times), an unheard-of plot, unlikely characters, bad CGI (a man in a monkey suit would look better), and acting that wasn't very good add up all to make a movie that I won't watch again. <br /> <br /> You check it though; okay for some involuntary laughs.
