I entered the theater with the intention of spending a pleasant 90 minutes having fun if not illuminated. I left neither entertained nor enlightened. This film cannot decide what it wants to be and ends up being no more than nothing. There are some funny lines and some incredibly pretentious cinematographic references (The 400 Blows - for this character? While none of the characters is treated with much respect, the over thirty homosexuals have the worst: all predators, fat, sad, snotty. If you are of the right mood for a movie about gay relationships, take a look at Parting Glances, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Over the Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia. You will thank me. <br /> <br />
