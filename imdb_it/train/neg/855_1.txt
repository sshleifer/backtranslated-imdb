It is not the best movie to watch today. I read many reviews on Shining and expected it to be very good. But this film disappointed me. The sound and the environment were good, but there was no story here. There was not a single moment of fear. I was expecting a horror thriller movie, but there was no horror, no thrillers. The only scene in which I was afraid was during the chapter change scene that showed "Wednesday". There are many fragments in the film. Most things are left unexplained with nothing to link to anything. History does not tell us about women or other scenes that are shown. It could be a good movie to watch in the 80s, but not for the 21st century.
