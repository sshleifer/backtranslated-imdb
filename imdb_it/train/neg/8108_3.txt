After reading the book, which meant a lot to me, the film gave me none of the sensations that the book conveyed. This makes me wonder if Kaufman also liked this book because he managed to turn it into something else. Either that or he is simply bad. More importantly, where is the lightness?! From the first scene, the music suffocates most of the dialogues and feelings, and this continues through the film. I think the producers thought that having a cheerful music that reproduced the whole film, this would make the story light - yet they completely failed here. Instead the music manages to give everything that "feels the film", in order to dramatize the events so that we dwell on them, so that everything is really heavy. <br /> <br /> Another example of how this adaptation fails is to beautify the plot and make it more dramatic. In the film we see Franz passing by Tomas in the street, who is going to see Sabina. The introduction of this casual encounter / passage, which certainly didn't happen in the book, gives Tomas' story more meaning than it makes it clear. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed, for the worse, however this may have been done because the book simply does not convert well into a movie, like the style of Kundera. This makes us wonder if all the generous reviewers of this site were writing thinking about their book AND the cinematic experience rather than just writing the film. A film that is long is not interesting. For those who have not yet read the book, I recommend reading it. For those who have, I must say that you will only be wasting your time and will probably end up writing warnings like suspension.
