I was shocked by Tigerland's incredibly incredible storyline. It was a liberal fantasy about what the army should be like. Dialogue was hard to swallow along with stupid things Colin Farrell's character was authorized to get away with his senior officers. I kept thinking, "Hey, there's a reason the training camp is hard. It's supposed to condition the soldiers for battle and turn them into a unit. There's no room for arrogant attitudes and men who they won't follow orders. "I was rooting for Bozz to get kicked because he was a danger to his fellow soldiers. I would not fight with someone like him in the war because he was more interested in people's feelings than in doing what was necessary to protect his unity. <br /> <br /> - <br /> <br />
