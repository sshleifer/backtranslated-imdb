When I rented it I was hoping for what "Reign of Fire" didn't offer: a clash between modern technology and mythical beasts. <br /> <br /> Instead I got a "standard hunt for stupid people in remote construction" with bad script, bad music, bad effects, bad plot, bad acting. Bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did it a 2 is that in theory there could be worse films. In theory.....
