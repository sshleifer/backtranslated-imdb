What I think you'll probably like best about the new Star Wars movie, "Phantom Menace", is that it will probably wipe "Titanic" out of the water, if you forgive the pun, when it comes to pure devastating box received office, and then delete it from the first place. Whenever I hear someone say that "Titanic" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, I think to myself: "You don't see many movies, do you?" What a parody. You could make 50 good movies that are much better than "Titanic", and for the same price. <br /> <br /> "Well, he won many academic awards, many people really loved him," as some might say in his defense. Well, many people like the Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald's, but that doesn't mean it's high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans can be wrong. <br /> <br /> I will be the first to admit that that part of the problem for me was the mega-hype of the movie. I waited about a month to see it and in the end it didn't live up to the expectations set on it, which simply called more attention to the terribly stupid romance. True, "Phantom Menace" will probably suffer a similar fate. but. <br /> <br /> "Titanic" by James Cameron is. a) a poor action movie disguised as a serious vintage piece. b) a three-hour epic that has its best moments given in the trailer. c) a sweet love story beyond imagination or entertainment. d) something went better for the documentarians, which I would have appreciated much more. e) a movie with arrogance up to the level demonstrated with the real ship. f) a 3-hour robbery that I will never return, therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine that I can think of. When I meet someone who hasn't seen it yet, I say, "I wish I could exchange places with you." g) a slap in the face to any real hypothermia victim. How long should we believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences? h) fortunately a film that was not recognized for any Oscar-winning acting. i) a technological result in the cinema and little else. <br /> <br /> The only reason he posted it as an anonymous comment is that I DO NOT accept the refutation of 10,000 Leonardo DiCaprio fans of thirteen who undoubtedly come to his defense, and I'm not very interested in hearing defense of history, acting or the length of the Titanic.
