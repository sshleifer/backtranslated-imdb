It is simply useless to try to glorify any part of this film. <br /> <br /> It was a real garbage. At first you might think you're in for a visually stunning piece of cinematography ... and then shortly thereafter you'll be struck by a big FAIL bag! The fight is barely martial, the acting is poised at the limit of the par, and the music is not worth being described. There is only enough of a story to have created an excuse to make this movie. The decisions made by the characters and the way in which they deal with situations are weak and have done nothing but frustrate me. I think the only reason this movie was born was like doing some fans using Yumiko Shaku.
