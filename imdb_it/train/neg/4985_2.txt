In 1993, "visitors" had a huge success in France. So the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately, this sequence is among the worst ever made. <br /> <br /> This is a film that does not keep its promises. Indeed, he should tell only one story. Jean Reno must go into the twentieth century and bring Christian Clavier back to the Middle Ages so that time can normally take its course. The problem is that Clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century, and therefore making him return to the Middle Ages is quite difficult ... Instead of this, the film continues in many other stories without managing to follow the main traces. As a result, the film sometimes becomes confused, sometimes a bit confusing. <br /> <br /> But the film also suffers from the performance of almost all the actors. Reno and Clavier fall into the trap that they could still avoid in the first movie: they're going beyond the lines and becoming annoying. So why did Jean-Marie Poiré, the director, involve Muriel Robin in the female lead? He made a mistake because he looks uncomfortable and is utterly pitiful. The other actors are no better: Marie-Anne Chazel is non-existent and Christian Bujeau, unbearable. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film contains some good moments with efficient gags but often falls into vulgarity and ease. Some sequences and dialogs are affected. It also appears empty because Poiré takes up elements that have ensured the success of the first film. Thus, a girl takes Reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her marriage. <br /> <br /> A tiring and disappointing following. However, what is the interest of this otherwise commercial film? <br /> <br />
