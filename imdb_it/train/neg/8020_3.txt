it had beautiful poetic pieces but in reality it is only an artistic and crazy launch - together without direction or resolution. how do these people get past film school? who gives them the money to make this shit? it could have been much more, a good leading actor, and I always like Fairuza Balk, but come on, the alt-rock metaphor of just looking fixedly unable to find something irresistible is just so tired, and it's definitely not good films. the director needs to go away and live life for quite some time and not go back to the camera until they really have something to say. this is like the school of art of spaghetti shooting, juxtaposing a bit of seriousness of images and hoping to hope in the hope that poetry emerges. which can work, if the director actually has some kind of vision, or has a brain that knows when it is in the presence of potential, but here it is only a filler of space, without consequences. I heard the lazy ending coming a few moments before it hit, and I was screaming "you're lazy bastard" on the screen when the closing credits appeared.
