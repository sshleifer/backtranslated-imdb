The sequels have the bad habit of being disappointing, and the best credit I can give is that it maintains that old tradition. These three stories are nothing good compared to the original Creepshow. <br /> <br /> By far the best trio is a wooden idol that comes to life to take revenge on the thugs who killed its owners. The second story is about a lake monster that seems to be nothing but a lot of floating slides, it makes you wonder how someone might be afraid of it. The third story includes a Stephen King cameo as a truck driver, but apart from that it is a rather inadmissible story about the victim of a car accident returning from the death for the person who killed him. <br /> <br /> Look at the original Creepshow instead, or if you've already done it, be happy with that.
