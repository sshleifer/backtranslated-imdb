Two sisters, their perverted brother and their cousin have problems with the car. They then happen on the home of Dr. Hackenstein, who conveniently needs the body parts of three unmarried young women to use in an experiment to bring his dead lover back to life. He tells them he will help them get home in the morning, so they spend the night. Then the good doctor gets to work in this low budget horror comedy. <br /> <br /> I found this slightly amusing, nothing really really to do in your way (I came across Vista Instant of Netflix and streaming on Xbox 360), but better than I expected for a movie acquired from Troma. Most of the humor doesn't work, but it's still some parts that made me smile. Moreover, the great Anne Ramsey has a small part and has always been a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Bambi Darro and Sylvia Lee Baker got topless <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
