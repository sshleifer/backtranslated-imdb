I didn't really like this movie. He wasn't very funny and in some cases he was just stupid. Rob Schneider is certainly an extremely talented individual and, even though his acting was good in this, it seemed like a real waste for him to play. I mean that there were some parts that were okay and a bit funny in a nice way but that's by the way. The only thing that caught my attention throughout this hard test was the presence of some very beautiful-looking women and I'm not the only one to watch a movie for this, but in this case it was the only one corner where even the smallest case of redemption could be found. All in all it was a couple of notches below an average movie! <br /> <br /> Final Query: <br /> <br /> Theaters: I'm glad I didn't waste too much money on it. <Br /> <br /> Purchase DVD: Ummm, let me think .... no! <br /> <br /> Rental: If you have a sense of prehistoric humor, then why not.
