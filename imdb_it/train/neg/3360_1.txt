Somewhere in his non-fiction book DANSE MACABRE, Stephen King suggests that a secret to writing scary stories is to avoid showing your readers exactly what horrible thing is waiting behind the door to get them. If at the end the door opens and an insect three meters high staggers, the reader may be a little scared, but he will also think: "Well, I can deal with it. At least it wasn't a hundred meters". There is nothing more frightening than what is hidden, unseen and unknown, just on the other side of that locked door, waiting to catch you. <br /> <br /> THE HAUNTING is so completely wrong that the director Jan De Bont more or less starts his film by opening that door metaphorically and shouting: "Look, everybody, look! It's an insect five feet high!" It's not that?" The law of diminishing returns immediately begins. At the end of the film, the director is, so to speak, jumping up and down, banging the pots and pans in CGI madly and shouting hoarsely: "Look, look, look! Ten bugs hundreds of centimeters high! .. And now, here comes a hundred bug of thousands of meters! "<br /> <br /> The filmmakers apparently believed that the special effects alone could make up for all the other shortcomings in this enterprise (and there are many) . They cannot and cannot In fact, however impressive, the special effects are so insistent and intrusive that the inattentive viewer ends up fixing them - with admiration or annoyance - instead of being immersed in a story. <br /> <br /> For me, the nadir of the pure stupidity of this film comes when a statue, with "blood" flowing from his mouth, tries to drown Liam Neeson (like Dr. Marrow) in a fountain. The filmmakers clearly didn't know what to do with this supposed idea once they did, so they only have Neeson hanging around in the water a little, waving their arms and making glu-glug. In the next scene, the good doctor apparently dried and, bye, he forgot all about the annoying incident. <br /> <br /> Shirley Jackson's novel seems to have been ridiculed in this ridiculous script by a committee of adolescent drug addicts with low IQs who thought that the way to scare people was to make every effect bigger and stronger : "Okay, later, let's do the ceiling, you know, looks like a scary face, and, uh, come down on her ... and all these thorny things, like, the trap in the bed." <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves of THE HAUNTING is that in the end it becomes so terrible that it's actually fun. When Owen Wilson (like Luke Sanderson) fell to the ground and then went on his Magic-Carpet Ride O 'Death, I almost fell to the ground myself, laughing. <br /> <br /> Badly built, mindless, grotesquely ambiguous, absolutely incredible and full of awkward dialogues and useless scenes, this vacant HAUNTING is a textbook example of how NOT to make a horror movie.
