This program is really overrated. A detective like Danny Pino's hot-headed character would have been transferred to the "team of rubber guns" years ago. The whole team is made up of brave hegemons who judge people whose actions date back decades by 2007 standards. Every Vietnam veteran who ever had turned out to be the murderer, unless he was another Vietnam veteran. There was only one black killer, and he was put up by his white boss. The only Hispanic killer was a "traitor to the race" who killed another Hispanic to frame a Hispanic street boy for a crime that (naturally) two rich white children committed. What a bunch of propaganda. Hey, screenwriters: even minorities and poor people commit murder. Only in this show are most of the upper class white killers. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the arrests of people between the ages of 70 and 80 and 90 for the crimes committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. No real DA pushes for murder because it means the state will be stuck with its naive medical bills until they take the kick. The state would do their families and insurance companies a favor. The prosecutor will only beg them for manslaughter and will not need one day. The only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized criminal figures or former Nazis, whose high-profile beliefs increase DA's careers.
