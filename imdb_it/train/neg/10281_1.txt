Carly Pope plays JJ, a new food critic promoted with the flaming and overbearing mother who moves in with her. JJ, stunned by this turn of events, then covers the restaurant owner, Alex, to entertain his mother in exchange for "maybe" seeing his dying restaurant again. Alex predictably falls in love with her daughter as she warms up with her mother. There are numerous problems with this film, the characters are universally two-dimensional. JJ is a selfish and hateful character, his superficial and superficial mother. JJ's colleagues at the magazine are weird and opportunistic. The basic message of a woman over 50 who cannot make it on her own without male assistance is bad, bad, BAD. The acting is uniformly opaque, the script uninspired. The films only save the beauty of New York City. I would NOT recommend this movie.
