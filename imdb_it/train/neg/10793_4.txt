I saw this movie at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Based on a novel by science fiction author Brian Aldiss, this film tries to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howe, joint twins who are torn from their family by an entrepreneur to form a rock band. <br /> <br /> Almost deliberately misleading, the film is also half as clever (if you forgive the pun). Mixing genres, styles and moods, the directors (whose previous film was the excellent documentary Lost In La Mancha) lose their way quite quickly. I was never sure if I wanted to take it seriously or not. Flashbacks, dream sequences, it was all a bit too much. Also, the promising rock and roll didn't move me. I was reminded a little too much in the moments of Hedwig and Angry Inch, a film that I found original and moving. But in this case, the songs weren't as good, nor were the main characters nice. A more unfavorable comparison would be the disappointing disappointing Velvet Goldmine.
