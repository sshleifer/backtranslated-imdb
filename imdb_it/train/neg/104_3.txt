Traveling to a small town that is off the beaten path (but which seems suspiciously close to a freeway), a female journalist meets a strange hiker who agrees to help her head towards her destination. The strange man then tells a couple of gruesome stories related to the area: in the first story, an adulterous couple plots to kill the woman's husband, but in the end he suffers a much worse fate if attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of campers interrupts their holidays when an outlaw doesn't take care of having his sleeping grave. <br /> <br /> The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes to make a zombie-themed anthology a nice idea, but with just two stories, it falls sadly short. And this is not the only way this low-budget gore movie fails to deliver: the acting is bad (with Joe Haggerty, like Ebenezer Jackson's story, which offers one of the strangest performances I've ever seen) ; the positions are not inspired; the script is depressing; there is a sex scene with zero nudity; and the ending .... well, the belief of beggars. <br /> <br /> To be honest, some of Sykes's creative photographic works are effective (although the deceptive technique used as characters through the woods is a little excited) and Joe Castro's cheapo gore is thrilled: an ear is bitten, the eyeballs are torn, a face is removed, the brain is crushed and there is a disorderly beheading. These positive aspects make the film almost bearable, but know that The Zombie Chronicles is not a walk in the park, not even for experienced trash viewers z. <br /> <br /> I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but I generously raise my score to 3 because I couldn't visualize the film with the advantage of 3D (although I suspect that an extra dimension wouldn't have done a big difference).
