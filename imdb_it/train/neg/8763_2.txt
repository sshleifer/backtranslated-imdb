I thought I'd read somewhere that this was the last Monogram production, but whether it's true or not doesn't matter, because if it wasn't, then it should have been. It's a deadly boring story played by John Carradine with some gray hair in his hair to make himself look like an older scientist who is experimenting with the help of his young apprentice (Robert Shayne) in bringing the dead back to life. Every time their subjects are revived, they seem to have a whitish face like marble while they are lying tied to the laboratory table (a big problem). Carradine succeeds in bringing his faithful dog back to life after he has died, and the mutt acquires an unusual ability to walk through walls ghostly (wooooooooohhhh). This is all he wrote. <br /> <br /> For an ultra-economical quickie monogram, this uses at least a more imaginative laboratory configuration than is usually assigned. The funniest joke in the movie is that the "old" doctor Carradine constantly refers to his "young" assistant Shayne as "m'boy" when, in fact, Carradine was 40 and Shayne was 45 when they did it!
