I anticipated the various Sci-Fi type films and thrillers this summer, but I was so disappointed with this particular film. While some people came out of the film, I decided to stay, just to laugh with the other spectators of the acting, lack of suspense, ridiculous ending and difficult plot to follow. I found myself almost confused as the main character in the film. The only redeeming quality of the film was the soundtrack. This is one of those emerging films that will later regret having done. In retrospect, I wouldn't even rent this, let alone pay over $ 5 to see.
