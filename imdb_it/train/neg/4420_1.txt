"All a great documentary could be" ?? Yes, if one is deaf, dumb and blind. Everything except meaning, wit, visual style and interesting topics. A part from that. . . <br /> <br /> Really, volken. This is a completely inauthentic film. A doc adventure without adventure, a war doctor with no feelings for war, a campy feeling without any trace of spirit. It means nothing, it makes no sense, and carries the implicit message that nothing matters at all. No wonder he has so many IMDb fans! Of course, entering you you know that a movie starring the great Skip Lipman will not have culture, intelligence, intelligence (apart from a corrosive adolescent joke) and no recognizable human emotion ?? only adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a movie - it's a panic attack! To avoid. There are too many real documentaries and too little time in life to waste it on building toilets like "Darkon".
