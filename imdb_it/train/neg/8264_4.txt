This is a film in which the actors are all right, particularly Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in a film in which each of the three couples meets in a situation that feels forced to be pretty or to set the story in motion. In other words, it looks like they are artificial movie scenes, not like real life. Although the women who work in the peep-houses always go out with one of their clients, it does not seem at all as realistic as it is written in this film. Also, when one of the characters meets the overweight woman in the film, it looks artificial, the way they look at each other after they have quarreled. Once again, the actors are all good, and the moments of this film are beautiful, but on the whole another indie that could have been used to rewrite the production before the production continued.
