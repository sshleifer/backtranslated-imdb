The campaign on one sheet and in the newspapers suggested (as they often did) a much more dirty and violent piece than it appeared on the drive-in screens. Claude Brook is actually an Americanization of Claudio Brook, who has worked in films for years. This is quite difficult to find anymore; I'd like to see it again to compare it with other international horrors of the day, but I don't particularly remember when. It is likely that it was a shredded version that arrived in US cinemas and videos. But oh, that sheet ... still a gem of my next horror collection.
