Frankly, they seemed like seven hours of boredom. What is that? What is it about Will Smith that I can't stand anymore? I guess it seems too busy to be taken seriously and get an Oscar. I understand how this is a prejudice, but unless I undergo some new acting lessons I can never see it winning one. It is a huge name and is therefore generally confused by being a talented and different actor. He is not. I give him credit for having tried so much, and for being able to cry at the drop of a hat. That's all. <br /> <br /> The seven pounds were a sort of eyeroller for me from the beginning. The 911 suicide call didn't intrigue me in any way. I wasn't curious to know why he was calling in his own suicide. There were absolutely no surprises. The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson have had a fair amount of chemistry on the screen. Also, I don't know his name, but the Hispanic woman did a great job with her role as a scared and defeated wife. Woody Harrelson had a very limited screen, but I'd say he stole the show every time he was on stage. <br /> <br /> All in all, just an extremely original plot of the mill. I couldn't help but wonder why I really cared about these people. I never felt sorry for "Tim / Ben". Did he kill himself with a jellyfish? Was he the only survivor in an 8-person accident? Geewiz..did does not see any of this ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 is quite generous.
