Being an independent director and a huge fan of Edward D. Wood Jr., I purchased this documentary believing that this would finally set the record for how talented and genial Ed Wood was. <br /> <br /> What I got was a disappointing, self-centered, conflicting, contradictory compilation of unripe self-pity. <br /> <br /> Where do people remember Ed Wood Jr., do people actually remember the second-degree cousin of the dick who knew someone who was on Plan Nine From Outer Space? <br /> <br /> It seems that, at the very moment when there is a renewed interest in Ed Wood, these people leave the "Wood" job! Just to take witty jokes to someone who actually gave them a chance when no one else would do it! After 50 years I would suggest that many of these people should let go of the fact that they did not receive the $ 75 they had been promised! <br /> <br /> Ed Wood was a brilliant creative director who knew how to entertain. In reality it was all he lived for. You could laugh when you see Ed's movies, but somehow you know you're laughing with him, and not with him. <br /> <br /> But I digress ... Return to the film at hand. If you expect a movie about Edward D. Wood Jr., you won't find it here. If you want a film about old irritable actors, this is the movie for you!
