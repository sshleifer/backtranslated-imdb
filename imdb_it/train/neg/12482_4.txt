Deathstalker is directed by John Watson and recites Rick Hill, who is a kind of body builder and famous about this, if I understand correctly? The plot follows while Deathstalker (Hill) tries to get something from the evil lord, and must travel to the lord's cave. He meets many dwarves and monsters during his journey, and the settings are very close to Tolkien and, of course, Conan the Barbarian. This is a rip off of Conan's great success, and although this is a very stupid film, it has many good rubbish merits and is recommended for junk fans and tolerant of movie junkies! <br /> <br /> There are not many cinematic merits in this film. A couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating, but what Deathstalker focuses on to show are the naked females and the huge muscles of Hill. Females are usually helpless and even very stupid victims, so this is a very macho film and therefore many feminists may not like it! The fighting scenes are nothing special and rather boring, and the monsters are nothing special. And all the other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and ill-made, but what did you expect from a low effort like this? This tries to be as big as Conan but fails rather miserably. As I said, this may appeal to fans of cinema in Turkey, but nobody else. This belongs to the category is so ugly is fantastic! <br /> <br /> Deathstalker is still not as bad as it could be, and like a turkey film, I appreciate it almost as much as the other turkeys, the pleasant ones of course! If bad movies are your cup of tea, try this and have fun, but if you don't understand "pleasantly ugly movies", then stay away. And if someone cannot bear large amounts of nudity, then he is also at large. Here there is more nudity than violence and, because of these scenes, the film has an R rating. Otherwise this could be a safe film for PG families! <br /> <br /> 4/10
