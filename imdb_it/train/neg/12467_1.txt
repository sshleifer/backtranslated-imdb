This film was slower than Molasses in January ... in Alaska. The man who added the preview to togeather should receive a reward for the ability to enter all the 30 seconds that were present in the preview. I had to wake up the people I was watching with several times. After it was over, I felt bad for waking them up. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is filmed hoping that something really happens, but nothing ever does. It was easy to lose track of people's motives, and the characters were flat and uninterrupted. At the end of the film, you hoped everyone would die. Everyone runs or is contemptible, mean or pitiful, and usually all three. <br /> <br /> And worse, we watched a minute or two of the added features, just for the kicks and laughter you understood, and all we saw was that people were pleased with how socially aware they were. If they had spent time on the movie they hit each other on the back, it would have been worth watching. <br /> <br /> I was brought forward to the excitement of "24". I had a conference on social awareness through the eyes of the sandman.
