Koen Wouters is a Flemish singer and presenter. In the early nineties he also tried his part on films. But this incredible piece of cianfrusca ended his acting career once and for all. She also ended her acting career with the Dutch Nada van Nie, who became a football wife, television presenter and programmer. Actually I saw him in a theater (almost empty) because I was a fan of the Koen Wouters band, Clouseau. I'm so sorry to spend money on this. It looks cheap, it's a terrible story and it's done poorly in every way possible. Some people think it's so bad that it's fun. I'm not one of them. I just found an incredible waste of time and money.
