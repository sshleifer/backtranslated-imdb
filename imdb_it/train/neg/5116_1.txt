I rented this movie today thinking it could be a good football movie, since I'm a big soccer fan. Boy, I was wrong. This film is too religious and preacher and is REALLY unrealistic. This film says that if you are a Christian you can easily get everything you want in life, like becoming a great football player! You do not become a great football player by becoming a Christian and asking God, you do it through practice and hard work. All you have to do is ask God and he will give you anything ... puh-lease. This is not true at all, duh. I laughed several times because of this embarrassment. The only funny part was when they were stupid (Shultz the cartoonist? No, the kind that flew over the Atlantic, etc. Etc.), But in reality this film wasn't great. I do not recommend it, especially if you are not a Christian, lol.
