... because 99 out of 100 times, the producers lied tightly (or someone else) to let you rent or buy their * mercifully censored *. <br /> <br /> Shock-O-Rama Cinema proves that the truth about this once again with the release of "Feeding the masses", an entry perhaps well intentioned but absolutely inept and sad in the zombie genre. Folks, this is not just low-budget movies, this is a very low budget film from a group of people who - I'm sorry, I know they have families that love them - will never be, never in Variety in any way significant. This is a baaaaaaaaaad mooin 'pitcher, folks, and not just because it's cheap. <br /> <br /> Acting is mediocre, but I don't blame the actors; they had no direction. They had no direction because the script was a semi-riot zombie fantasy with no sense of true cinematic storytelling. The characterization is subtle at best, no thanks to a weak dialogue and soporphic direction. Did I mention that the script and direction are pretty lousy? They are. There is no drama, no tension, no great moment of the character, nothing. The whole premise of the suppression of the government by the media is squandered by the "commercial interruptions" of the second year and by a non-dramatic plot that challenges rational analysis and awkwardly drags itself into its ridiculous ending. Syd Fields would not be happy. <br /> <br /> How could the government suppress the truth of a virulent zombie epidemic when its reality would be evident everywhere? Why should they give him more than a superficial attempt? In this day and age of mobile cameras with wireless access, what could they hope to achieve for more than a day or two at most? Now, if they were covering something, like their own guilt ... but "Feeding the masses" never explores such possibilities. Instead, it focuses on absurdities and ill-planned events to look for laughter and / or meanings, praying that the public does not notice the almost total lack of production value beyond the basic equipment for film production. Has anyone in this film been paid? I hope the actors did it, even if only for their time lost in the blind alleys of a career like this; at least the technicians have had legitimate work experiences. <br /> <br /> Even zombie fans will find little to gain from "Feeding the Masses". The gore is remarkably domesticated for the non-budgetary of its degree, and there are no distinctive scenic elements or memorable effects. They are all eminently forgettable, in fact. KNB has nothing to fear. <br /> <br /> Even the garbage like the Australian birth "Undead" was miles away from "Feeding the Masses". Sorry, guys, go back to the artboards and take your misleading marketing with you.
