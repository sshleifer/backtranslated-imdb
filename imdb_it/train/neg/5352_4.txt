The Honey, I Shrunk the Kids franchise was a great deal and not to say very famous. I loved Honey, I restricted Kids when I was little. It was an original story and had such an exciting storyline! The sets were so incredible and the cast seemed to enjoy each other's company. Now Honey, I blew up the guy was pretty stupid, so I think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone loved. <br /> <br /> Basically, Adam is a little older now and mom is going on vacation to leave their husbands with their children. But when Wayne's favorite object is threatened with garbage, he wants to reduce it and keep it, but he and his brother get in the way. But when the wives return after forgetting to give their child some medicine, they are also caught in the car, leaving the children at home alone! <br /> <br /> The plot is silly, but like I said, it was just a family movie that I think can unleash. The original honey, I Shrunk the Kids is the best, I think everyone could agree. The third was not so bad, I would recommend it at least on Honey, I have films on Blew Up the Kid, it was at least a little more fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
