The problem with "The Killer Elite" is that only by searching for this film, and investing time to watch it, are you putting more effort into the experience than many of its principals, particularly director Sam Peckinpah. <br /> <br /> The already volatile Peckinpah was heading for bad weather with this movie. According to at least one biographer, this was the moment when he met cocaine. Add to this its binge drinking, and it's no wonder things went to pieces. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because the concept behind the film is good, and the first ten minutes promise a lot. Mike Locken (James Caan) and George Hansen (Robert Duvall) are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the CIA. They move fast, live well and look like best friends - then something happens to smash their brotherhood. <br /> <br /> An opening scene shows that they blow up a building - because we are not told, for the course in terms of the dark motivation of this film. But the implication is that these guys hurt people and they don't care much - the antiheroes very similar to Peckinpah's Wild Bunch not long ago. An opening title tells us that they work for ComTeg, so he adds with obvious irony "... the thought that the CIA can employ such an organization for any purpose is, of course, absurd". This is a smart enough way to let the public know that all the bets are gone. <br /> <br /> Add to that a traditionally strong Peckinpah backup cast, including Burt Young, Gig Young, and Peckinpah regular Bo Hopkins as a plum of a madman who can't give up an opportunity to shoot at $ 500 a day, and you just want the writers, including the famous Sterling Silliphant, to try to do something more with the story rather than turn it into a platform for a lazy-liner and bad chop-socky knockoffs. An attempt to inject a dose of liberal social comment is awkwardly worn. "You're so busy doing their dirty work, you can't tell who the bad guys are," someone says to Locken, as if he or we need it underlined. <br /> <br /> Worse still is Peckinpah's clumsy direction and slow pace. We are 40 minutes into the film before we get our first battle scene, a completely chaotic collection of random shots in which a group of people we've never seen before have been seen fighting at San Francisco Airport, the their battle encounter with a conversation in an office suite. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, what's left of the cast is having a battle inside a fleet of Victory mothballs, ninja escaping in the open to be killed while Caan pulls away a liner which eliminates any hint of true suspense. "Put me from seven to five, I'll take the little guy", he has two ninja warriors beat just before a climate samurai duel - from China, which we all know is the land of the Ninja. (The battle takes place in San Francisco, but surprisingly no Mounties come to break things.) <br /> <br /> Caan is much better in the smaller scenes, like when Locken, recovering from some bad injuries, is told by one of his bosses, played by a quiet Arthur Hill, who was "Humpty-dumped" by the organization. Caan refuses to stay down, and his recovery scenes, despite the impact of the film, show an acting by him and Amy Heflin, Van's daughter, as a solidarity nurse. Caan was one of the best actors of the 70s, and his laconic Heflin, Duvall, Hopkins and both Young albums give "Killer Elite" a real incarnability. <br /> <br /> But don't look at "Killer Elite" thinking about it. You look at it thinking about the movie that went away.
