This film is really horrible, the eye-candy that plays Ben is able to make up for all that is wrong with this film. <br /> <br /> The main writer / director / producer / actor etc. He probably had a good idea to create a film that deals with the important issues of gay marriage, acceptance of family, religion, homophobia, hate crimes and almost every other issue concerning a gay man these days, but trying to branch out every problem in a film so little conceived little justice to any of these causes. <br /> <br /> The script is mediocre, casting is very ordinary, but dialogue and acting are simply painful. The hateful brother is played by the most enchanted actor and there is absolutely no connection between the two main actors (I think I saw more passion in a cornflakes announcement). The acting is rigid and the dialogue forced (a scene in which the brother is feeding the detective his jokes was the highlight). <br /> <br /> I am pleased to see that the creator of this train has not pushed any other garbage into the distribution, and if he is thinking of doing it, I have some advice: DO NOT DO IT.
