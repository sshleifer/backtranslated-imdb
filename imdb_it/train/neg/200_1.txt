That reviewer liked this film surprises me. The plot is a disaster. The characters are wooden. Michael Bowen spends most of the film spying on other characters and judging everyone badly. No one has any redeeming qualities or points of interest. This is not an angular job. It is not imaginative. It is not ironic. It's not smart. There is nothing true in this boring job. What is missing from the theatrical release is no surprise. The fact that "this network" will go on the air decreases that venue. I strongly recommend that you contact a replica of the Garden Smart show on PBS or even a good informative material if you encounter this mess on late night television. If you meet him on daytime television, take a long walk. Even if you walk in the smog, you will feel better not to have suffered from this disaster. Life is short. This film is long
