This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't care what the critics say, it's bad. I think the problem is with Kundera's novel. It is not that he is adamant; it is just like 99% of his work, he is pretentious and upset. He seems to be in love with himself, his characters come out to look at the navel, and his novels as a whole are misogynistic. I read many of his works (even his realist socialist poems: it was really terrible) - I don't really understand what it is. The characteristics (such as self-absorption) in his novels infuriate reading. In a movie, all the things I don't like about Kundera have been amplified. Maybe I missed something, but I don't think so. On the one hand, I can't believe this is a Criterion Collection DVD. In no way is this film essential.
