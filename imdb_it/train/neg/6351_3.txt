Possible spoilers. <br /> <br /> Although there was good acting - especially Chloe Sevigny and Radha Mitchell in the play - this was simply not a catchy movie. The passages between the comedy part and that tragedy were embarrassing or sometimes not obvious. This viewer was initially confused by the fact that the supporting cast differs in the two halves; I thought with the way things were arranged in the opening scene that the people around Melinda would be the same people, reacting differently (more than a premise "He said, he said"). However, what we have are two totally different stories and two totally different women, both of whom are played by Radha Mitchell. <br /> <br /> The two playwrights in the opening scene - the comic and the tragic - presumably Take the same premise and go from there, but the two stories are only lightly related. They do little to support the topic of discussion, which is almost everything to look at as comedy or tragedy. Nice cast, but a disappointing film.
