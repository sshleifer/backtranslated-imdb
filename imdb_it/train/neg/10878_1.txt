This film is a real scam of the "demons" of the masterpeice and this is the only thing that makes the film worth seeing. The acting is terrible, the action scenes are accelerated, the script is almost painful and the budget non-existent. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is good then you haven't seen a real horror movie, skip this and get a copy of the movie's demons.
