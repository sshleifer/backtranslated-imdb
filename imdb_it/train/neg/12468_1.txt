The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, he is captured and then warns the prince (why?)

The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and keeps him around, because, nobody knows. and they blow up a ship. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while, I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged, I didn't laugh or cry, I didn't get an understanding nor was I forced to learn more or take a cause.It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst that can be said about a movie.
