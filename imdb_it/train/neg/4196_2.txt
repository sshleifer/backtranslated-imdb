This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Not just the story, but the acting is terribly bad. The dialog box looks like someone is reading the news. <br /> <br /> This is valued as comedy / drama / romance, not of those things! It is a small action, it is so. There is really nothing comedy or drama. <br /> <br /> If you went to the cinema to see it, I'm sorry for you. I would not recommend it at all. Virtually anything else you choose to look at will be better. This is practically an action / crime film. The action scenes were sucked in and part of the crime story was very predictable. <br /> <br /> If you are not really interested in a good story or good acting. And you simply want to watch a "foreign" movie for the charm of being a foreigner. Then this could be for you.
