I haven't seen this, and I'm not going to see this movie or anything else that includes Lindsay ...... unless & until "poor little rich girl" straightens her life for a period of 2 years starting most recently arrested in July 2007. <br /> <br /> In fact, I don't know anyone who went to see ANY of Lindsay's recent films. I imagine rather that 2007 will be the high water mark in his film career, until he cleans up his act. All the recent publicity has only hindered his film career, if he has other aspirations to make other films <br /> <br /> So far, film producers have actively sought Lindsay for roles in their upcoming production. Now, Lindsay will probably have to go to the auditions and actually compete for ANY role. His reputation is currently "poisonous" and quite possible could have a negative effect on box office sales on any film in which it is found. <br /> <br /> Sooooo .... now Lindsay will have to deal with "not being wanted" ..... will he be able to handle it? <br /> <br /> I wonder if even Jay Leno will want to have Lindsay on his TV show? <br /> <br /> All of the above is just my OPINION. I have no inside information.
