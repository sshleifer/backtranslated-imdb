Spoiler warning. <br /> <br /> When the main character's sister is pushed down the stairs, the killer breaks a glass of vodka next to her, to make it look like she has been drinking. But just before she is killed, she tells her sister's partner (Teri Garr) that she has not had a drink in 4 days. Yet the police never mention the results of a toxicological report! And the characters talk about being drunk when she fell down the stairs. Eh? Really bad mistake in this film, which is rather horrible, overall. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly bad, considering the excellent cast. Some faults: the writing is not very good, the music is made for TV badly, and there is no tension because we already know the answer to the mystery from the first scene of the film.
