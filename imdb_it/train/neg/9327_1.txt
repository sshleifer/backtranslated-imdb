This has been the worst movie I've seen in my life so far, and I've seen some really bad movies. I saw this movie in my local video store, and the cover looked like a decent horror movie. I didn't know that the cover would be the best part of the film. Where to start? Filming was scattered and boring. At one point, there's a one-minute scene where nobody talks, just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day. Nothing happened, they just drove in silence. The whole film is boring, with annoying and incredible dialogues and virtually no plot to talk about. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it could be a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, run.
