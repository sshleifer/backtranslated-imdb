SPLIT SECOND may have been a good movie. A story about a murder of the "road of anger" has a very young Clive Owen who offers a rather good performance; BUT ... but .... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the filmmakers beat their movie with an idiotic camera and a really horrible montage. The camera jumps all creation into an unsuccessful attempt (I suppose) to reflect Owen's stress from business, family and traffic. What it actually does is give the viewer a headache. <br /> <br /> As filmmakers didn't mind making a good movie, but just impressing each other with their idiotic photography, you shouldn't waste time on this disguise.
