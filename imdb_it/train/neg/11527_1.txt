<br /> <br /> The film begins as a normal film of comic heroes. It's about the guy who's chosen, has no parents and is madly in love with the school girl # 1. No surprises in the film, there's nothing you can't imagine in the movie. Toby McGuire shows us that he is not a good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this. Perhaps children over the age of ten can enjoy the film, but it is a bit violent for the younger ones. You can't stop thinking about movies like X-men, Batman and Spawn. All these titles are better. I almost left the last 20 minutes! One thing that could have been good was computer animation, but even that is not something to put on the Christmas tree! So my recommendation: don't see this movie even if you get paid for it!
