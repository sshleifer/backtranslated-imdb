These were over 80 minutes of semi unexpected boredom. First, I was wondering how it is possible to produce something like this. Then, arriving at the 70th minute, I became convinced that only a few minutes passed, and I lasted until the end, of which I am a little proud because I consider this film as a great test for the patience and tolerance of humans. Is it worth looking at everyone? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, try it and if you are determined enough, you might even get to the end ... The film lacks coherence and it seems that the characters have no common sense at all. All the events of the film, you can be sure you've seen somewhere before, and seem to be put into this movie just to fill the movie.
