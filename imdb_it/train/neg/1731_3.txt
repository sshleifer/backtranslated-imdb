The Twilight Zone has reached a certain mythology about it - very similar to Star Trek. This is because there are many devoted show-lovers who do not care what they think each episode was a winner. They are those who total every single show at 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show. For this reason, a while back I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad) because the ratings and overall reviews were simply too positive. Now, it's time to do the same for The Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> While I have scored many episodes 10, this gets a 3 simply because it was bad. The writing was indeed awkwardly bad. Two people from opposite sides in a great war are seen wandering for the whole episode. After a while, it is clear that they are the only two people left on Earth - while learning in the really stupid and totally unconvincing conclusion. Usually the turning point in the end makes the episode fantastic - this killed him!
