I ordered this extremely rare and highly overrated movie on eBay with very high expectations. I think I paid about $ 50 for this movie. Being an eternal horror fan, from the nonsense American Slashers to the European zombie movies, I told myself it would be great! I can't tell you how wrong I was. First of all, I thought it would be more angular than it actually is. After all I heard of this movie, I was almost afraid to see it. Murders are boring. Acting ... forget it, there's no acting! History, even if we don't care, is incredibly bad. They seem to have tried to get your attention with some strange sexual scenes and naked girls, but unfortunately in this case it doesn't help the film. Why? There is no atmosphere, and this is the worst thing about this movie. It's just bad movie making from point A to point B. Although it's extremely fun and fun to watch with your friends and lots of beers, don't make any effort to get your hands on it. There are so many movies in this world, don't waste your time looking at Necro Files!
