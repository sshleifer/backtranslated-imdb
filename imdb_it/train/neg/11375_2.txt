Are you talking to me? (1987) is a pretty bad film played by a guy I've never seen before or since I play as a neighborhood boy trying to become an actor. He has strong jones for Taxi Driver as he tries to use that trick to make it big. When he learns the concrete facts of life, he does what everyone else does, he changes his image! Go from good boy to surfer all night. His friend can't believe the change (but marks with Faith Ford and gets a nice concert for a fee). Can this young punk keep his way credible as he grows up? <br /> <br /> This is a real lame movie that tries too hard to incorporate too many things at once. An interesting idea that falls apart due to poor performance. Who knows, maybe someone will take the ball and run away because this time the directors have ruined the ball. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this movie. Unless you want to see Faith Ford and a young Bubba from Forest Gump. <br /> <br /> xx
