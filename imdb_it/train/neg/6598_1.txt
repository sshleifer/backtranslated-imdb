This "film" is a parody. No, wait - an abomination. NO, WAIT - this is undoubtedly the absolute WORST film ever made with beloved characters created and established by other actors. <br /> <br /> I thought of "Inspector Clouseau" with Alan Arkin (!) Instead of Peter Sellers it was ridiculous and sacrilegious, but also the courage to "redo" Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are donkeys and money weeding. <br /> <br /> Laurel and Mr. Hardy died, respectively, from 1957 to 1965. Because anyone could even begin to imagine that suitable updates for L & H would be in the personality of Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain is beyond me . I tuned myself in completely expecting to be horrified and embarrassed and it certainly didn't disappoint me. All those involved in this pathetic, cruel disgrace, should be deceived by anything associated with Hollywood and cinema. AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS - YOU HAVE BEEN DECLARED.
