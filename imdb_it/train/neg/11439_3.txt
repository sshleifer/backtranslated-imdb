It was obvious that this film was designed to attract the audience of Chick Flick, whom I watched for quite a while and appreciated the most. However, this was a very irritating attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan (who became boring to die for). His acting was exaggerated and he seemed to be too anxious about his colleagues who were relaxed in their roles. This film could have been more, as there was an adequate budget for settings, actors and a decent plot. My wife and I both agree that this was "Muck" at the end, as the film ended with a painful embarrassing high! Better luck next time, I hope Miss Graham will stick to the kind of movie she belongs to as From Hell.
