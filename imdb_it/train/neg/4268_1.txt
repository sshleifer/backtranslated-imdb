I remembered this show from when I was a child. I didn't remember too much about this, just some little things about the characters. for some reason I remembered that it was very intense. also it was really very early in the morning in PA. In the end, after looking around the web for a long time, I found an episode. the first episode is no less. Criminey! This show was so horrible. was obviously created to show children playing tag and have fun while having fun. the show opens with bhodi li telling his mom "my names are not Christopher, they are bhodi li-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" we are therefore forced to watch children playing tag lazer at the song "foot loose". and not just a little fast, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhh, my brain hurts just thinking about it. oh yes, and as if you couldn't get worse, you can't even see the laser beams from their guns. it is as if they were simply running towards the whole song "foot loose". later, after bhodi ascends into space or where ever, they have a disgusting laser gun fight for the Phil Collins song "su-su-sudio". ah, believe me, you don't want to know the rest. what can I say ...... THE LIGHT SHINES !!!!!!!!!!!
