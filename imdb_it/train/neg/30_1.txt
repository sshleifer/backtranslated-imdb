I did not like the idea of ​​the turtle since 1987, we knew that the TMNT had to be four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies and each of the four brothers bears the name of the great artists like Leonardo, Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello so here Venus it has no meaning or plays an important part and I believe that the old TMNT series was much better than the new one that contains Venus As a female turtle will not add any action to the story that we like the story of the TMNT we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but having a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action, we want to see more new ones of the TMNT series but just like the same characters we knew in 1987 without that turtle female.
