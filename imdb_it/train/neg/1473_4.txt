A thematic theme of cinema since its inception is that genre that involves seductive women whose tricks and means attract sensitive men not only in their arms but also in terrible circumstances that typically will only result in danger for male victims, along with uncertainty about whether the temptresses will not be forced to take their medicines, and here Susan Lucci acts like a mermaid, even though her acting recitations from a soap opera record are inadequate to make her performance credible. Isabelle (Lucci), inconstant wife of venture capitalist Stewart Collins (John O'Hurley), starts a love affair only for fun with yacht salesman Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), simply a bagatella for her, but a serious matter of heart for Richard, apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardor by engaging him in a risky plot that will turn into a pattern of murderous intent. When Davis becomes convinced that Isabelle is the victim of physical abuse administered by her husband, she desperately tries to free her from what he considers a marital trap, so that she can marry herself, coming to believe that the only clear solution to her situation will be found in a rudimentary essay on hiring a professional murderer who will have the alleged violent Stewart. In the wake of the assassin's attack on Collins, a couple of police detectives, played by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott, become increasingly curious about Isabelle's possible involvement in the crime, while at the same time the reality arises about kidnapped Richard who could have to pay a heavy price in exchange for his in love maneuver. Lucci and Kasnoff are duly engaged as a valid pair of conspirators, each of which gives a reading that creates a boring rather than fascinating set of lovebirds, but O'Hurley and McDermott offer strong transformations in a film that suffers from a banal scenario as well as non-inventive direction and design elements. Released on a Fremantle DVD, this largely lucidity-free affair that portrays a man beneath a seductress's spell benefits from the highest visual and sound quality, and even if no extra functionality is provided, the quality of the superior production the efforts of filmmaker Robert Primes and composer Stephen Edwards are increasing.
