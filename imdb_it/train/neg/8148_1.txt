Did I miss something here? This "adaptation" has everything that the first Brookmyres novel has had. All except history, laughter, black humor, political intrigue, characterizations, plot and some semblance of meaning. <br /> <br /> Spoiler; <br /> <br /> Godamnawful, from the beginning to the end. They made fun of the plot, they had a love story between Parablane and a policeman, and what it was, Dr. Slaughter was portrayed as a spectator, and who the hell was Annette Crosby to be? <br /> <br /> It seemed they had made a three-hour adaptation, then they cut it to 90 minutes. (Although the 90 minutes seemed to last forever.) Please, please, don't do it with any other of Brookmyres's books, (especially "The Country of the Blind").
