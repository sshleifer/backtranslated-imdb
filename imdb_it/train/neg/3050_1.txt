Just when I thought I'd finish a whole year without giving a single movie a "Bomb" rating, a friend took this notorious asshole to my house last night. I feared that the worst knew his reputation, and it was terrible as I expected. This is a Mexican mess, nicknamed in English and produced by K. Gordon Murray. It has terrible series and effects, and presents a rather frightening Santa who does not work at the North Pole, but instead from a cloud in space, and who has no small elves to help him make his toys, but rather all the different groups children practically from every country there is. The opening sequence, in which St. Nick chuckles heartily as he watches the monitors showing all these hard-working kids singing terrible holiday songs in a variety of languages, seems to go on forever and without stories. Obviously, THIS Santa Claus does not observe the laws on child labor! <br /> <br /> Eventually we get some evil and slinky devil apprentice in person who travels from hell to Earth, just to make little kids bad and turn Santa's Christmas Eve into a nightmare. Watching this movie is a triumphant and convoluted experience, and it is meant to scare children and keep them away from Santa and holidays forever. Strangely, the name of Jesus Christ is mentioned often in this Christmas movie, which somehow makes everything more disturbing in the context of all the bizarre things that are happening. This easily makes my personal list of "the worst movie I've ever seen", but I'm sure it's nothing unique.
