This semi-horror Italian film begins very similar to a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has few or many facets to be good, and the fact that it is rather boring makes this film quite unwatchable for my taste. The only thing that is really worth seeing is the many boobs that spread throughout the film. The story has a boy who at the beginning of the film attracts the girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon, going crazy and apparently killing them. They show nudity, but they never really show the murders at this point in the film. Then the boy finds a beautiful red head at a party and proceeds to go out with her and marry her. He has a thing for the redheads you see as his beloved ex-wife Evelyn was also one, she also died in circumstances that were not meant to be public affairs. After a lot of scripted murders begin to unfold involving snakes, foxes and so on. At this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what is the reason why there is a meaningless ending where everything ends badly. This film didn't work for me, it left me many questions and the last third of the movie didn't have the boobs of the first two thirds of the movie. Explaining Evelyn's death would have helped the film as it would have done some sort of final in which Evelyn would have risen from the grave. It is true that the title is not entirely misleading since he left the tomb, but not under his power. The gore is very light for the most part because there is a scene with foxes and a scene at the end with some blood. I just thought that for the most part this movie was a bit boring.
