*** LIGHT SPOILER ALERT *** The story looks good and if you've read the novel, you're probably expecting an intense and profound film that can offer some insight into some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationships. <Br /> <br /> True enough, the script tries to do it, the director tries to do it, but the main cast fails miserably. Maria's acting is so dry that she lacks any feeling, her most intense moments seem almost comical. Sometimes it seems to be nervous because of the camera. His only truly sentimental scene is near the end where he is dumped by his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Ioana seems even more tense than Mary and, worse still, does not seem natural at all. Maria had the attitude, although he was artificially pushed towards the obvious, but she had and her character received a certain credibility. And to make matters worse, we don't have a vision of her: where does she come from, how was she involved in the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship evolve? We get only a few bits from his parents and their relationship just seems to be there: it has a content and an end, but no beginning. Just like her partner Maria, she has only one scene that is truly moving, the scene in which she downloads the character of Maria Kiki. <br /> <br /> Tudor is the only person in this film (in addition to the hostess, excellent acting there) who can demonstrate an acting talent. He has the attitude of his character and looks good on him. Only once or twice does it seem to falter (the scene at his parents' meal, tries to be obvious when it was not necessary at all). <br /> <br /> I love history, Tudor Chirila is OK there, the hostess actually acts and Puya delivers her two lines in style, but this does not save the film. Too bad, the whole setting had enormous potential and Romanian cinema could have used a film on this theme. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no-background no-feeling (well, Maria's spoken interludes are a good proof in this direction) Maria and Ioana's lesbian relationship . I'm pretty sorry for spending money on a ticket, I'd rather have seen it from the comfort of my room.
