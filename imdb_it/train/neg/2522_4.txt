What a horrible movie! The idea of ​​the robots fighting each other is strong, but the plot is ridiculous, the real laughable human action, the action of non-existent and special effects (from which, this type of film must depend) are archaic. I thought it was created around 80-84 and I was surprised to see it was from 1990. This is 5 years after the Aliens! OK, many people said it was good considering the low budget, but I think 'what's the point?' it looks absolutely amazing. I wouldn't mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely rewritten story because I still like the idea of ​​huge robots beating each other.
