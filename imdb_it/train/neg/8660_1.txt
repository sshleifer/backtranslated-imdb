This is probably one of the worst movies of giant killer animals I've ever seen. Following is the typical premise of a laboratory experiment gone wrong and a giant crocodile with rapid chemical growth escapes in it. The monster looks very much like a dinosaur, with large Tyranosaurous hind legs, when it should look like a huge crocodile. Everything about this film is not original and constantly exudes "clich√©", minute by minute. Why are there always two drunk deer hunters out of the darkness that separate? Furthermore, there is always a boy and a girl who share a lame, obvious love interest while in life-threatening situations. For a long time it has already been said by me and I feel like I'm wasting my time writing this ...
