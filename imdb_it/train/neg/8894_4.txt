This film is embodied in falsehood, an 11/10 straight on the phonosity scale. The falseness of the accents and the tightness of the spandex cardigan trousers are simply disconcerting. Yanks, even if the real Scotland could be just as colorful, if you ever go there don't expect to have the chance to "dance" the controversy with the locals. Also, don't try to influence local opinion through the art of the diadem. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of contagious singing and dancing scenes, but the plot is too rough and linear, and the dialogue is often too weak. I also doubt that anyone would want to be stuck in an eighteenth-century Scottish village imprinted in time in the boondocks rather than in gay New York. Maybe it wasn't such a big sacrifice for that priest leaving Brigadoon, maybe he was just trying to get out of that dump. <br /> <br /> Watch it for the beautiful alternative-reality view of what a Christopher Streed Day parade in Scotland would be like LSD. Other than that, I would only recommend it to Hollywood completists.
