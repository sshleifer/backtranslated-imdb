This is a 30 minute joke show. The joke, the Cavemen are not treated fairly. Hahaha !!! He is unable to call a phone because he is a Caveman. Cavemen are not as intelligent as humans. Oh man, those Cavemen are so unsophisticated. There is no humor in this show. They can only escape this joke for so long and already have Geico commercials. This show does not deserve a time slot on the T.V. national <br /> <br /> This show tries to be fun, but it is not. Watching this show, I was thinking that I was trying to be like a "Bachelor's Gone Wild Show". It means they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women. The weeping caveman is annoying. The caveman with glasses is too smart to be a caveman (HAHAHA !!!). All three have personalities, but I can't understand why I don't care about them.
