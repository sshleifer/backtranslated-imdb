Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friends Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) have made their way through college. When the creepy Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) discovers their secret, he scolds them for helping him score points with the beautiful and good student Angela (James King). <br /> <br /> Stupid and incompetent "comedy" - much more lament-inducing than laughing-inducing. The film tries to attract its target audience with its disgusting gags - but NONE OF THEM WORK. Furthermore, it is full of useless and unattractive characters - and Schwartzman's character is so repellent that it is one of the main obstacles. The film even tries to use the 50/60 actress / actress Mamie Van Doren in the most exaggerated scene in the film. YUCK !!! <br /> <br /> Further lower your absolute predictability and waste (once again) of veteran comedian Joe Flaherty - when this guy will stop accepting any role that will come and do something <br /> All in all, the only thing I liked was James (aka Jaime) King, who was very attractive and deserved better. <br /> <br /> This one doesn't have more than one in ten from me.
