Sometimes, creating something strange and contemporary doesn't always work for everyone's benefit. While I will admit that the film's set design and concept were quite interesting, the execution of these ideas in a congruent story did not work. This film was so horribly slow and useless, not even Robin Williams could save this garbage. It is obvious that Barry Levinson's dream fell on his face, but he should have warned the rest of the world about this slop.
