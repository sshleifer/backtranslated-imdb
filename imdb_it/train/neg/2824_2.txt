I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the best star of this movie. Haim, the star child now in the grip of drug abuse in the 1980s, is insipid as usual, and commenting on the back by minor characters / actors would be useless; needless to say they were all very average. It's a fantastic film like a journey into the memories of the 80s - with some strange clothes, some good shots in the background of Colorado and a very harmless plot, albeit perlomente. <br /> <br /> All in all, please don 't waste time looking at this unless you love 80s movies, Corey Haim, or like me, to love the old school of Porsches (this one in particular looks fantastic) because life is too short to watch bad movies.
