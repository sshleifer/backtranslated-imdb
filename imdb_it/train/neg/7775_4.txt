I'm not familiar with the trilogy, but arrived on this film last night on Showtime. The film seemed very well done with set design and cinematography, but the script was in wood and drawn. The acting was pretty bad, the two female derivations were useful. You never really believed in something that the secondary actors said though. There were stereotypes, the biblical, the reverend without a hint of nuance, the authoritarian Captain, the hot-headed soldier, etc. I am sorry to say that based on these shortcomings I immediately calculated it as Canadian without knowing it was so ... The credits of Telefilm Canada gave it away. I know I'm a horrible person. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something at first, but the hostility towards girls is never explained. Here they are besieged in a werewolf fortress and men are wasting time and energy in brutalizing two young women for no reason. FOCUS people. There is a little more than a pressing situation beyond your walls that if these girls are lesbians - this is just my inference for the hostility towards them. If they can aim and shoot with a gun, you can also like them. The question of their "immortal soul" can be resolved later. <br /> <br /> Also, I think this refers to the rest of the trilogy, should these girls be the protagonists? One of them killed the Indian guy in the end who saved one of their lives. I imagine one is just a victim of his condition that cannot necessarily be blamed for his actions, but the other is just a murderer who does not deserve his happy ending.
