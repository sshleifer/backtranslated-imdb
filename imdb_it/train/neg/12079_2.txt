Poor Will would have turned upside down in the grave if she could have this adaptable German-TV adaptation of her classic drama. It is obvious that very little money was spent on this. A stage upright, a walkway and some randomly arranged columns pass as a set. The film was dubbed dubbed into English, with English voice actors sometimes mumbling their lines. The whole production had an incredibly dark and sad atmosphere. And where was Fonterbras in this movie? MST3K gave this excuse production the treatment it deserved. <br /> <br /> To be or not to be? I wish this film had never been in the first place.
