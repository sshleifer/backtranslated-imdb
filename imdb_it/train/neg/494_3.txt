Inconsiderably direct and witty comedy that presumably parodies the "classic" films of the '50s "alien invasion", but in reality it is not better than them, except of course in the purely technical department (good make-up effects). And any worse parody of his goal is bound to fail ("Casino Royale", "Our Man Flint" is worse than almost all James Bond movies). After two hours of listening to the shrill voices of the aliens, you will pray for some peace and quiet. (* 1/2)
