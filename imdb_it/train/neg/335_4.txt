Michael Jackson would claim a place for the most famous character in THE GOLDEN CHILD and because he loves children. This didn't work (and why should it?), So we have Eddie Murphy to save the world by saving "Kid Midas". I would strongly advise all future screenwriters to delight in studying the actor's inane dialogue in this extravagant fantasy-adventure comedy that is a step forward towards ISHTAR. Whatever Murphy says or does can be better appreciated, but don't get me wrong with his exquisite comic talent; he does not belong to this film, and the same went for DR. Dolittle! Violence and combined images are reasons to print it as a cult classic, and this would have made no sense given that movie and Hollywood fans continued to cash the boy. Speaking of images, they were incredibly good surprises at the time of Ronald Reagan's presidential fame. Murphy is far better in COMING TO AMERICA and 48 HRS, but this stale film is not my touch of golden honey for a sweet and crunchy taste.
