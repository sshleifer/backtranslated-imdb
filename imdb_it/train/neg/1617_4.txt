What an unusual film. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no concession to "special Hollywood effects" or entertainment. There is no background music, no special effects or improved sound. <br /> <br /> Facial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the Spanish language is a strange monotonous vibration that sounds the same whether it is in the middle of a battle or talking about a bonfire. <br /> <br /> I saw these films (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience, not really something to go to and entertain me. It's quite long and in boring places. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that given the lack of any plot development, I don't think it's very educational. <br /> <br /> It is also difficult to perceive any story from the dialogue of the film - it would be a good idea to read a little about the story so that you can understand the context of what is happening, since for some reason the director did not consider it appropriate to inform the public why Che's band was moving in the way they did - as a result there seem to be groups lurking through the woods for no particular reason why they shoot. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to give this movie more stars for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing the depth of the character, but somehow all the characters were still strangers to me in the end. The stars he gets are for realism and show the difficulties of guerrilla warfare.
