The creatures of the title devastate a small and quiet city in the desert. This is basically the whole plot of this movie, and although the scenes dedicated to the Munchies are a bit funny (in a sense), everything else is just about filling and bad coverage. From the hero, who is a painful aspirant of Woody Allen, to the ultra-stupid policeman of the city, it is difficult to choose the most irritating character in the film. There were times when almost everyone was on the screen together and I was thinking, "OK, at least the girl is pretty, but why do we have to put up with the rest of those morons?" The film is also full of pop references (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which probably made it already dated in the early 90s. (* 1/2)
