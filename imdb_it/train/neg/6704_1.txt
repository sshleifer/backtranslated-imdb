this is just a terrible "comedy" - it's really a bad movie. there are no funny elements, no jokes that are fun. I don't know how some people can say that this sad film could be "smarter" or "quality". maybe if it's the only movie a person has seen, you can make that statement of the brothers. but, I've seen thousands of better films: namely leonard, part six (now, it's fun)! I don't know how the brothers are considered fit to be listed in the Internet movie database: it's more like a home video than a real movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, skip this movie. a root canal is more pleasant than this nonsense disdainful material.
