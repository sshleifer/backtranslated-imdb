Now I've seen a lot of bad movies. I like bad movies. Particularly bad action films. I have seen (and appreciated) all of Jean-Claude Van Damme's films, including the one in which he is his own clone, both in which he plays the twins, and all three in which he is a cyborg. I really own the one in which he plays a fashion designer and he fights in a truck full of toughs. (Hey, if anything, he has a nice ass and you can almost always see it. With the DVD, you can even pause and zoom in!) That's why you can trust me when I say this movie is so bad, it makes Plan 9 similar to Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Everything about Snake Eater is bad. The plot is ugly The script is bad The sets are bad The fights are bad. The stunts are bad. FXs are bad. The acting is spectacular, very hard to beat on earth, most likely showing the worst performance of any so-called cast actor, including Lorenzo Lamas, and this is really saying something. And I would bet that everyone involved with this film is bad in bed. ESPECIALLY Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> <br /> It can be unintentionally funny, so it's not a total loss. However, you should only watch this movie if you are a congenital or very, very stoned idiot. I was able to sit alone because I needed to look at something that distracted me from rinsing cat urine from the laundry. <br /> <br /> It was not very helpful, but it was better than nothing. A point for Ron Palillo's cameo as a gay arsonist.
