This is without doubt one of the worst EVER films, I stress, EVER made. What's worse, my old hero Dolph is in and he's playing it. Jesus ... The story is actually pretty good, but the way it was made also hurt my body. The combat scenes for beginners are just as choreographed as a fight between two drunks who hit her in the eaves. The actors, with the exception of Dolph who also sucks, behave so badly that they can't help you, but they wonder if the reason they are there is that they are all friends of the director, who by the way had to be absent more , if not all the time. This is 12 million euros spent in an unimaginable way, because from the appearance of effects and landscapes, the cost cannot be higher than ยง 1000.
