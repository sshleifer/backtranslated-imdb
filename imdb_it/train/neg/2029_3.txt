I don't see enough TV shows to understand the attraction of SHOW ME THE DENAR, but I suppose it arouses a bit of appeal for an undemanding audience. Apparently a quiz show, it offers competitors huge sums of money to answer some simple questions. However, his quiz elements play only a small part in the process, which I find tortuously complicated. For example, before answering a question, a competitor selects which question should be asked by choosing from the random choices "A", "B" or "C". Does this serve anything besides slowing down the game? It would be much easier to simply start with "A." Contestants can submit questions, but they must answer one of the three questions in each category. <br /> <br /> After answering a question, the competitor is then asked to "block" the answer - another delaying tactic. The competitor's next task is to name which woman from a dozen go-go caged dancers is to reveal a card that indicates how much the application is worth. A correct answer adds the dollar amount of the card to the competitor's partial total; an incorrect answer subtracts the same sum. This time-consuming step actually has a certain entertainment value, as it allows the public to take a close look at dancers dressed succinctly and uniformly. Meanwhile, the competitor is reminded that an unfortunate selection of the "killer card" will immediately end the game. This naturally causes the competitor to sweat and cause further delays while the nervous competitor contemplates the sudden loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. My suspicion is that the possibility of a sudden disaster is the main attraction of the show's audience. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the whole process has slowed down even more by a lot of empty lines between host William Shatner and the competitor, along with occasional routines by the caged dancers. All these delays burn so long that it may be possible for the public to forget what the original question is when the correct answer is revealed. <br /> <br /> A typical 30 minute JEOPARDY episode often crosses as many as 60 questions. The first 30 minutes of SMTM I saw only received six questions (many of which were related to other TV programs). No one in their right mind would watch this show because it's fun to play by answering questions at home. This leaves three possible reasons for watching the show. <br /> <br /> A. To see how a competitor responds to being on the verge of winning up to a million dollars, only to lose everything in one fell swoop. <br /> <br /> B. Look at beautiful young women who perform sexually suggestive dance routines. <br /> <br /> C. Enjoy the sparkling lines of William Shatner. <br /> <br /> My choice is "B", but women are not in camcorders long enough to justify suffering for an hour of this show.
