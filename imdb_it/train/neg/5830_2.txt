Drawing Restraint 9. dir: Matthew Barney. <br /> <br /> How do you know when you're in the middle of a pretentious art movie? Is there only 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of film? Is it when Bjork wears what looks like a giant hairy pita on his head in a pseudo-Asian ritual? Perhaps when mammoth assholes and spinal columns are used in a whale fat experiment. Or, when are you ready to kill the composer for making a minimal and still annoying version of a Philip Glass score? In any case, Drawing Restraint 9 is among the most pretentious of modern art films. At 135 minutes, it adds to its claim to be boring to boot. I would define the use of color stunning and the interesting opening sequence, but the rest of the film seemed to have been shot for a Discovery Channel documentary. That is until they seem to be trying to film their version of P-ss Christ, but this will happen later. <br /> <br /> Actually, the portions of documentary-esquire were the best parts of it. The surface plot is about a whaling ship, and then there is a ritual on creating whale fat. Then, there are guests in the form of Bjork and Matthew Barney who are greeted on the ship through a ritual of humiliation that includes the shaving of the past head (think of the kids' jokes), nicotine patches and giant hairy pita hats. Then there is a mutual evisceration, cannibalism, and let's not forget the giant asshole. <br /> <br /> Matthew Barney wrote that this is "the relationship between self-imposed resistance and creativity". It's almost like saying "if you don't understand it, then you are not creative in your interpretation, so go there because I am an artist". Oh, wait, this is the POST-modern interpretation of that sentence and what the movie would say if it were POST-modern. But, it should be modern art. Which concerns the art itself. <br /> <br /> So, let's start with the whole interpretation, right? The following lines are only 3/4 series and should not be interpreted as a realistic attempt to interpret the film. <br /> <br /> The first half hour concerns the pearl lovers and the construction of a giant ramp. Obviously, the ramp is symbolic of the need for self-elevation at whatever level is held dear, and the subperla are looking for pearls of wisdom. Then, on a whaling ship, they build a box that appears to be in the rough shape of a whale. Obviously a raw element of prefiguration. <br /> <br /> On the ship, they make the whale's fat in the shape of the whale and pull out the part of the fins. They replace this with a spine and then a giant asshole. These should be the states of the film itself. When he's fat, it's fun but bad for you. When it is the spine, it is the "important" part of the film, or the spine, so to speak. Then, the giant asshole is the gut of the film, or when the movie sucks. <br /> <br /> Bjork and Matthew Barney arrive on separate ships, are put into strange humiliating clothes that ARE NOT YET WELL MADE OR SYMMETRICAL, it is suspected that they ran out of money and Barney was trying to quit smoking. SO they put patches on his head. They go through a ritual and learn about the ship from a Japanese sage, who tells them that the ship has been scarred since another ship hit it; an accident or an intersection, if you want. This inspires Bjork and Barney, who are different on the outside, to start cutting each other's legs and eating them so that they can turn into whales themselves and be the same person. They intersect. Oh, did I forget to mention that this was done in a Robbie Williams video? Then the pearl divers return with their mouths full of pearls of knowledge that they drop to make a stupid diagram of Venn. Barney has arrived at the geometry of the eighth level, of course. Or, maybe at least some social studies. <br /> <br /> Oh, and did I forget the soundtrack of Bjork that makes me want to kill? Sometimes it's hypnotic, but in others you just want to murder it. <br /> <br /> Art cinema is one thing, but when you launch all sorts of symbolism in the hope of getting a reaction from people it becomes a self-destructive joke. When do you cross the border between becoming a joke in terms of art? Dali and Bunuel often made surreal pieces of nonsense but were more consistent and / or funny than this piece of junk. A Chien Andalou had the sensitivity to cram as much symbolism as possible in less than half an hour. <br /> <br /> So can I recommend it? Only if you like HIGH ART boring movies with a lot of symbolism and flat images. <br /> <br /> D +
