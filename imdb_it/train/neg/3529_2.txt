I heard that this film was much more stylistic than the director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch) had directed before, the problem is that maybe it's too stylistic. Basically Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released from prison after seven years in solitary confinement, and in two years he bets a lot of money. He is ready to take revenge against the violent casino owner who sent Jake to prison, Dorothy 'Mr. D 'Macha (Ray Liotta). Meanwhile, the doctors tell Jake that he has three days to live while he is dying from a rare blood disorder, oh, and Macha puts him hired assassins. Loan sharks Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr√© Benjamin) are asking Jake to return their money and do some work for them. The film is full of Jake telling through some flashbacks, and during his last three days before coming to the big revelation about Zach and Avi, and Macha, well, I assume that's what it was. Starring Terence Maynard as French Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as Sorter, Francesca Annis as Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Elana Binysh as Rachel. The sequences involve a bit of animation, repeating the lines twice in different perspectives, and changing speeds for the moments, and all these are irritating to the point of confusion and boredom, making it a stupid criminal drama. Poor enough!
