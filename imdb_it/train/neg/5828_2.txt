I could not agree more with another reviewer who mentioned Jodorowsky. <br /> <br /> Barney seems to be absolutely boring and uninspired "with regards to content". It can produce eye-candy (and I like candy), but its pretentiousness and its fundamental artistic void do nothing but diminish joy. <br /> <br /> I am afraid that many people make no distinction between Jodorowsky's similar (but only surface) works or even more linear film directors like Tarkovski or Kubrick (I love Odyssey in 2001 and was never bored by the scenes finals ...) That kind of art like M. Barney's creations adds confusion and rejects viewers who might otherwise start to appreciate experimental cinema. Typical empty post-modern "conceptual" art. And check his interviews. I just don't buy it, I'm sorry. And so boring. <br /> <br /> I never got bored seeing Alejandro Jodorowsky's films, while Drawing Restraint 9 was a total disappointment. Especially while offering the possibility of being something, of saying something in a non-linear non-linear way (like the beginning and the great choreographic dance and the preparations for the ship to set sail. The ships "meet" on the sea ... Ideas of feces as a valuable object (if it was feces). "Pearl" underwater ... Everything could build a surreal movie with some content, but it wasn't, and those horrible pretext scenes of dressing and fake tea ceremony ... How much can be vain and fake and philosophically pretentious but empty? <br /> <br /> I have picturesque scenes, but the whole film has become so boring and pretentious, completely empty and fake that it made me physically sick. <br /> <br /> And he doesn't have a good time. I like slow-moving movies, but in some scenes it was boring - because it was pretentious and fake - so I was forced to see it prolonged scenes of artistic vanity ... <br / > <br /> That kind of film only kills art and spir ito in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowsky !!!
