This is a problem I have with movies that come on television, when there is nothing else to watch. Somehow I got sucked into really bad movies. <br /> <br /> But this was quite watchable. The concept of being the only ones left on Earth after a comet, then discovering the zombies I'm around makes me laugh. And that's why I gave this movie a 2 instead of 1. The story was stupid ... but this way it makes you laugh (too stupid> funny). <br /> <br /> I think I only saw him because the Star Trek boy was the protagonist. I was surprised to see him as a younger guy ... and he was the only funny character anyway.
