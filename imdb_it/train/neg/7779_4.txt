"True" story of a late monster that appears when an American industrial plant starts polluting the waters. The funny monster movie, though not quite as good, has many people trying to get the monster and find out what's going on but not in a completely engaging way. Give him points for giving us a giant monster that they have clearly built to scale for some scenes, but take it away as it looks like a non-threatening puppy. A fun exploitative film is fun and silly in the right frame of mind. (My only complaint is that the print used in the version of Elvira is so poor that it looks like a copy of a well worn videotape that had gone unnoticed 20 years ago.)
