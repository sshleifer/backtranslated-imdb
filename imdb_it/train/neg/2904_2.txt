If, in the first 10 minutes of this film, you don't realize that the main character, who writes a column of advice on life, will have the tables - oh-so-radically-transformed and will learn some valuable life lessons, then probably is something wrong with you. The set up is so predictable as to ruin the film, even if the rest of the film was good (which it isn't) <br /> <br /> There's almost no lead chemistry, and Steve Carell's stalker- ish the behavior is embarrassing, not funny. It is hard to believe that the character of Binoche has an interest in him. Then in the end it's all so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after. It's not that big America!
