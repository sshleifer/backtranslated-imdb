There is no way to describe this film really, really, really bad. It is a pity that I actually sat in this film, this very tiring and predictable film. What's wrong? Acting: there is no performance that is even remotely close to being even below par (at least they are very beautiful). Soundtrack (songs): "If we get Orgia on the soundtrack, everyone will know they are watching a horror movie!"; Soundtrack (score): Okay, but anyone with a keyboard can make a good soundtrack these days. Don't even get me started on "What the hell?" Moments, here are some: Killer can move at the speed of light - the door opens the actress turns, no one is there, comes back, there's something sitting in front of her. Out of here, where the killer shows up with a really big electric drill! The filmmakers get points by at least connecting it, but I can really believe that the killer has found the time to find the socket to connect it. I feel like one of the guards at the beginning of the Holy Grail and I want to say "Where did you get the electric drill?" I could go on talking about how bad this movie is, but I only have 1000 words. I will give this 2 out of ten stars. One star to make me laugh and another star for the whole neckline. Seriously, don't waste your time with this.
