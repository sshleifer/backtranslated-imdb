It's not my fault. My girlfriend made me watch it. <br /> <br /> There is nothing positive to say about this film. There has been for many years the idea that Madonna could act but can't. For years I've come up with the idea that Guy Ritchie is a great director, but he's just mediocre. An all-round embarrassment. <br /> <br />
