Dolph Lundgren is a Templar who comes to New York when a key that unlocks the anti-Christ is found by an archaeologist, obviously the demon is only a couple of miles behind Dolph and is not killed as easily as it moves from body to body . (Like Fallen without the suspense) Obviously Lundgren is out of his element and the film is completely unwatchable. I admit to being a fan of Dolph Lundgren, like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, I try to watch his films whenever I'm on TV. I caught The Minion and the boy was always disappointed. This film is absolutely terrible. With action sequences so poorly staged and badly modified, you can barely make sense of coherence in the arena of combat. The worst thing is Lundgren's unfathomable perfection in the role of a robust priest (!) All of which made it worse than the film is such a rip off of Fallen (which was good) and End Of Days (which was bad but better than that) this film is the worst movie I saw from Dolph Lundgren. It literally has nothing to recommend. It's horrible and it's the lowest point in Lundgren's career. I saw Cover-Up, The Last Warrior and Masters Of The Universe. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * Out Of 4 (Terrible)
