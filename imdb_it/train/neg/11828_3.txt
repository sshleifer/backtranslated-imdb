A few months ago, I was involved in a debate with another IMDb poster (Hey, Kmadden) on this film. The poster insisted that if I gave "Flushed Away" a chance, I'd like it. Based partially on this topic, I agreed to watch the film. <br /> <br /> 'Flushed Away' has good intentions (At least from Aardman), but the strength to bring everything together is lacking. His best strength is the sewer rat / boat captain, Rita (played by Kate Winselt), who, IMO, should have been the main protagonist of the film instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is cool, tenacious and interesting, while Roddy spends much of his time on the screen. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothered me most about "FA" is the repetition of jokes that are not fun to start with. When Roddy is hit in a squatting position, the film causes him to be hit five more times immediately. "My name is Shocky," says one of Rita's brothers, who then electrifies Roddy at least three times. My tolerance for cheap painful gags is at a record low. <br /> <br /> I will not waste time complaining about Katzenberg's kleptomaniac tendencies towards Pixar (A similar film is a coincidence, five are a rip-off). but I will say that I am disappointed by Aardman. They can do (and have done) much better. Try harder next time, guys.
