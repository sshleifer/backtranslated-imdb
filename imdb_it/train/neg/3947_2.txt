In the comic, modesty is strong. Alexandra Staden who plays Modesty Blaise looks more like an anorexic fashion model. He has neither the moral nor the personality of Modesty in the comics. Modesty would never give a woman advice to show more skin to earn more money. I can't see any resemblance to my comic books with Modesty and this movie. It's like a Mission Impossible movie that would involve Ethan Hunt locked up in the high school detention room talking to the caretaker when he went to middle school and Hunt would have been played by DJ Qualls (in Road Trip). So, if you're a Modesty fan, you don't see the movie that you get angry with. If you don't know much about Modesty comics, rent another movie, don't waste time with this. I can't understand how Quentin Tarantino can put his name on it. I will request a refund from my DVD rental shop tomorrow.
