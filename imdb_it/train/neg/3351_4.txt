Effect (s) without cause is generally not possible in the real world but in the world of Hollywood remakes, not only is it possible, it is required. The Haunting was given computer treatment courtesy of a first-class filmmaker-director who had once promised (Jan de Bont-Speed), but has since produced a number of large amounts of junk (Twister, Speed 2). > <br /> Actors are superfluous in a film of this type and seem to realize it. Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones behave as they would like to be everywhere, but in this film. Lili Taylor makes an attempt to add something to the process, but whatever may be something is unknown because the script seems to be half missing. Events happen, good and bad ghosts appear without nursery rhymes or reason and the story ends with a more unsatisfactory non-event, intended to end the previous 90 minutes of madness. <br /> <br /> There's really no reason I don't even see it for the effects since we all know that everything can be put on the screen now. Why not look at the effects in the service of a good story instead of just for their own interest?
