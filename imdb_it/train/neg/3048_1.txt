This is perhaps the most frightening performance of Santa Claus ever entrusted to any medium, be it a book, an image or a film. Santa looks like a pervert looking down on children and the twisted story of bringing Merlin to help him defeat one of Satan's minions, Pitch, doesn't make it any better. It's ridiculous to say the least, with negative effects, even by the standards of 1959. If a child were to watch this film, he would have nightmares and never wanted Santa to visit him. They would be marked for life. Imagine the boy in "A Christmas Story" when they start screaming after being put on Santa's lap. Here's how it would end if the kids saw this movie.
