There seems to be a surprisingly high number of 8-10 star reviews here from people who have never written an IMDb review before or after. Given the very low average score given to the film by other people, I think you can draw your own conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad film. I admit, I thought the concept was nice, and I was glad to see the actresses who played Eve and Harmony on Angel while they were working, but it didn't take long for the incredible beauty of this movie to become known by itself . <br /> <br /> Acting: did the contacts seem quite competent, but everyone else? Terrible. <br /> <br /> Plot: Chock full of holes big enough to drive a truck. <br /> <br /> Direction: non-existent. <br /> <br /> Humor: did they really think that people would laugh? Oh boy. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: OK. there were some really nice women in this movie. Not only the three main female characters, but at all levels. It was as if the producers hoped that the scenario would keep viewers so distracted that they didn't notice how terrible everything else was. If so, they failed miserably. <br /> <br /> In the right hands, this may have been nice, but darkly funny, classic. He wasn't even close.
