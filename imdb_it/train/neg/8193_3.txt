Ok, during this last thanksgiving break, while all together the family decided to go and see a movie, and since the Fred clause was voted by majority, this is what we went to say. <br /> <br /> To start the film he had so many holes in the plot that he was pathetic. The simple explanation of why a certain event was happening was empty. example; who the hell is trying to "close" the clause of Santa Claus? Is it a kind of society? A little explanation would have been lovely. <br /> <br /> Second: The film has thrown you fragile characters who have not aroused your feelings or actions example: the little elf named Willie and the only tall girl in the elf village. they see each other twice and then they are a couple and I could care less because this film didn't worry me. <br /> <br /> Third: I suppose this should be a family movie? His score was low only to PG. For a family movie there were several suggestive conversation articles. It didn't bother me, but if I were a parent I could see a problem. <br /> <br /> Throughout the entire film, Paul Giamatti seemed extremely bored with his role, but honestly it was the only one worth watching in the film. Vaughn had some funny moments, but he played the same character he has for the last two movies. big brother boy. (nothing against Vaughn, he was good at other movies) <br /> <br /> so this movie gets 3 out of 10 stars from me, just because someone had to commit to produce, film and release this movie. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I would definitely pass this movie, or if I see it, save it for a rainy day.
