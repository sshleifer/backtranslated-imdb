This was a disappointing film. People seem to have no substance, the protagonist Martin Cahil has zero values ​​of redemption, in fact everyone, including Jon Voight, embodies fashion. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Violence is disgusting, although it is done artfully. Filming is black, at least the print I've seen fits this category. A delusion.
