Watching "Der himmel über Berlin" as a teenager in the late 1980s was a profound experience for me - "so this was what movies could be". Together with "Paris, Texas" and "Until the End of the World" it still holds a special place in my heart and mind - a testament to the genius of Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately in the following years he saw a steady decline in the quality of his work with "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Land of Plenty" hitting a terrible low point. Gone are the captivating photos or music. No research or visualization of great intuition. All that is left are subtly veiled characters and political statements, which boil down to nothing but clichés, and frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audience. <br /> <br /> Is the well dry? Whatever the reason, it's time for Mr. Wenders to say hello or stop it altogether.
