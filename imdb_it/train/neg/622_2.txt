This film is so compelling. The main character is 35 and I saw the lean beanples with more balls than this guy. The twists and turns are so predictable that it's not even worth looking at the humor factor. <br /> <br /> Even some of the worst dialogues I've heard in 3 years, "let's go look for a small animal to torture". <br /> Ugh ..... I can't even continue, don't look at this pile of garbage, it was done in 8 days. <br /> <br /> The only strong point is the drunk Tizio who calls the main character a fennel to draw photos. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, unwatchable
