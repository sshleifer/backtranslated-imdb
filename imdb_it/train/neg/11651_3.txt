Given that this film was put together in less than a year, it could explain its lack (81 minutes - including the end credits, so about 76 minutes of real movie). But what he can't explain is his lack of humor that the previous film had. <br /> <br /> Gags are fast and sometimes not even fun. The only fun parts are the quick parodies on Nike's basketball points, the portrait of James Vans of the Max Van Sydow character in the Exorcist and fragments scattered throughout the film. Very little fun was the take-off of Charlie's Angels, who like the first Scary Movie and the Matrix spin-off scene, recreated the scene without much humor. <br /> <br /> Today's youth may not be able to relate to the playful gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70s such as the exorcist and perhaps the 80s' Poltergeist, et. to the. <br /> <br /> We hope that Scary Movie 3 needs some time to put together the spoofs. <br /> <br /> One thing though, the film presents more than the latest of promising young actress Anna Faris (who I will admit seemed to me exceptionally warm in the sequel). Just for his casting and acting skills, I give this film a "3" on "10".
