Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. However, I feel that he was sold out to get his first starring role. Foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have seen all their talents wasted by producers of stereotypes who think that black males who commit crimes are a funny concept (See: Money Talks, Blue Streak). <br /> <br /> Ok, I laughed a couple of times and I allowed all of these comedians to continue taking hilarious roles, but I'd like to see these guys side with the portrait of Marlon Wayans in Requiem to a Dream. Or in the films of Living Color Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans that move in the satire of Spike Lee, Bamboozled.
