Although in some aspects Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some of his narrative styles, Gabriele Muccino's project is rather mediocre. The film becomes more and more mushy and manipulative as it moves towards the end: human and emotional hearts, physical and metaphorical eyes. Seven Pounds is more an amateur imitation of Alejandro González Iñárritu Amores Perros and 21 Grams, with many and many flashbacks. The problem is that the story is quite predictable from VERY easily through the film. Too bad, because Seven Pounds could have been genuinely "good" if Ben and Emily had been put in the right hands.
