The film starts with a beautiful song It looks like a thriller, with Arbaaz Khan suspiciously walking but then suddenly we are forced into a comedy With stupid routine idiots like GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal behaving like grown-up children their scenes are pretty funny first and then they get boring There is a sneaky plot of Tanushree's brother being killed Towards the end the film tries to become serious with the villain who kidnaps our heroes but here it becomes even stupid Then a long orgasm beating straight out of HERA PHERI and waiting, there's also a long hunt in Payal's house <br /> <br /> The film is so boring that you fall asleep <br /> <br /> Priyan's direction it's very bad music (Pritam) is routine except the first song <br /> <br /> Cinematography is bad, the film looks cheap in everything <br /> <br /> Rajpal Yadav is good at his premiere scene where the rent goes to pay or and I was happy that the actor was not as loud and exaggerated as other films But No, Become the usual himself and get irritated most of the times that Tusshar shouldn't talk in a movie, his delivery dial is terrible Sharman is the saving grace, He is the only actor who behaves very well in this film Kunal Khemmu tries in his first comedy film as an adult, But it doesn't impress much Tanushree is bad as always Arbaaz Khan gets less visibility and it is normal that Payal is a Murli Sharma is not a terrible actress
