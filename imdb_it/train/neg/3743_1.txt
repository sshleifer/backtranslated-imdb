Jared Diamond pointed out in the first episode that other peoples of the world did not have animals to tame, but Europeans did, and this explains why we were able to manufacture steel and invent complex machines. <br /> <br /> But then in the third episode he says that when Europeans in South Africa went too far north they came across Zulu people and other tribes that * raised cattle and grew crops *. So what explains their lack of technological, economic and artistic results if they have the fundamental things that the author claims are necessary for success? <br /> <br /> Diamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox (brought to North America by black slaves) were our greatest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 non-military South Africans can defeat 10,000 Zulus * without a single incident * in either case, then I think we must conclude that the germs are irrelevant. With or without germs, we would have succeeded. <br /> <br /> He says that Malaria has prevented Europeans from further colonizing the North, killing "thousands" of Europeans without affecting Africans. (I'd like to know real numbers but don't say.) Then in the end he says that today malaria is killing thousands of Africans and that's why they can't reach us. So what is it, Jared? Did malaria help Africans by stopping Eurpeans or injuring them? And why did Europe go well despite the enormous plagues of our history? <br /> <br /> He also seems too eager to say that the reasons why Europeans have been successful have been for a stupid fortune. Sometimes, when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his ramshackle theories, he is reluctant to admit that perhaps Europeans have succeeded because they have worked for it. It is sad to see this obvious neo-Marxist contorting reality to try to prove its point.
