but Thomas Ian Griffith does not have the polish that an actor of large numbers has, since it was made more than 5 years ago. Some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make not only the action, but also the comedy. And how do you get KC out of Katia Koslovska anyway? The character of Plummer was so rude that he would have adapted better to a Bullwinkle fight. Personally, if the action movies show the skin, I would have liked to see the same time between women / men, otherwise I wouldn't show any.
