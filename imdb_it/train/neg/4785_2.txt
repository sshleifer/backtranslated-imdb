There is so much wrong with this bad wet fart of a movie that it's hard to know where to start. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is an incredibly unpleasant scary film, even by American standards. Dialogue is a clich√©, the characters are two-dimensional, the writing is ho-hum, and the little story that exists is neither coherent nor remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> We meet the following stereotypes in order: Balding Loser Boy (probably divorced, but who knows? This film does not tell us) with a brave heart, the Young Hero (who does absolutely nothing heroic), Brave Little Kid (with a homicidal strip one mile wide) and Black Bad-Ass Bitch (with more brain muscles). These guys are struggling all the time with the Scary Reaper man and his evil Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is full of little evil metal spheres that move around menacing people. Given a chance, they perform an impromptu brain surgery on those who do not have the mental capacity to dodge when they come to them. Booh! In fact, one of them is haunted by a good ghost (but again, it could be a deceptive specter) who seems intent on helping our Brave Contagonists recover their kidnapped young friend. <br /> <br /> There is no background of characters or even an introduction to any of the characters. It starts with a sort of summary of the ending of the previous film, but this doesn't explain much. If you've seen the first two movies, fine. Otherwise you don't know who these people are, how they are connected, why they are not at school or at work, or why you should care if they live or die. As a result, you don't. The only point of interest becomes any splatter effect. And there aren't enough to keep you awake. <br /> <br /> Of interest and fun are the three Raider Punks, stupid and evil, who threaten our heroes. But they don't get much screen time. They are launched almost immediately. Then they are buried (because anyone should take the time is beyond me), then they appear again as Evil Raider Punk Zombies. The rest of the film seems to consist mainly of Caspar the Friendly Ghost appearing and disappearing, looking for places, and Balding Loser trying to score Bad Black Bitch Booty, using pick-up lines that would embarrass a teenager with mental retardation . No dice there; not even a free sex could have saved this film, so the good thing is never there. <br /> <br /> The bad boss, called the tall man, fails to scare anyone over the age of 3; howling "Booooy!" it's not enough every five minutes. Because he, with his incredible telekinetic powers and his incredible upper body strength, does not simply crush our heroes as bugs is not explained. Instead, he delegates the work to his lazy little inept servants, who never manage to kill anyone before being shot in hell. <br /> <br /> Films that love masterpieces such as "Friday 13th Part XXXXVIII: Jason goes to college" may find some entertainment. The rest of us, who have developed pubic hair, will be bored by our skulls.
