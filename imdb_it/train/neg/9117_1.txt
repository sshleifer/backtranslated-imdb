... or maybe it's just that bad. The plot is an economic rehash of the first, which is strange, since it should be a prequel, not a sequel. Virtually the whole film looks like an economic remake of the first, with scenes that mimic the things that happened in the first, only much more ridiculous and unlikely. Where the former has had an exceptional cast, this is composed of B-list actors and discards. The acting is mostly horribly bad. Half of the good jokes in the film are taken directly from the first, like almost all the main characters, including those who weren't in the first movie. I realize that this was made by a pilot episode of the TV series, but it's not an excuse. They didn't have to turn the (bad) movie into a movie. Only one thing is marginally good, and these are the erotic sequences. However, since these are nowhere near the height of those of the first one, this one is not raising it above the score of 1. If you have the chance to see it for free, and you're a straight guy, it might be worth check, if you want something erotic that isn't porn. Otherwise, avoid at all costs. 1/10
