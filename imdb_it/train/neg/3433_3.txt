It's such a strange film, you can call it horrible or if you sit down with friends it can give you a killer-athon laugh. Strange comes to mind again and again. Amateur shot, he acted even worse and the directions, maybe none. The special effects are fun but the music that accompanies a flying demon child will surely be the greatest success. Watch him if you have time to kill. But don't do it, don't even try to take it seriously. It should be a tribute to the Porno, Holocaust. Since I haven't seen it, from the tribute I can assume it's so bad. I should have given him 1/10, but he gave me a good laugh or two, so you get a 3. Blood spill, the only thing someone worked on. Stay away from me if you are picky, more angry than laughing. I wonder if the producers laughed doing it?
