It took 9 years to complete this film. I would think that in those 9 years someone would have said, hey, this movie is terrible. I've seen acting better in porn movies. The story is tired and played. The abused child turns into a serial killer. How about something new for a change. What about an abused child who becomes a florist? At least that would have been a novelty. Why do all those who have a camera and a cinematographic idea (especially non-original cinematographic ideas) think they can be a director? I admire the fact that they remained loyal to this film for 9 years to complete it. This demonstrates tenacity and spirit. We hope that with this type of guide the next time they can focus on a better script. If you want to see a failed experiment in the independent film of a Michigan writer / director, see Hatred of A Minute. If you want a good movie from a master writer / director from Michigan with Evil Dead.
