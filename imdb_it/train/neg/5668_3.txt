First of all - there's absolutely no flirting in this movie - with Anthony or anyone else. These people don't flirt: they just do it. Your first resistance test is to go through more than 15 minutes of intense sexual violence and perversion. This wouldn't be so bad - hell, I like violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer, but without a context to put it in, it's repulsive. So you do it through torture and chaos. Then we meet Donna and the film turns into something completely different - not better - simply different: a film without heart. There are lame comedy attempts thanks to cameos - widely written and widely played by broads such as Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole (and even some prostitutes and drag queens). They all deserve better. Photography is deliberately disorienting, so if you have car sickness (or ANY kind of illness), this film is not for you. Come to think of it, I'm not sure who this movie is, apart from maybe the gay and bisexual S & M fans who like badly written and badly written movies.
