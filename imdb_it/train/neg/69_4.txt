I thought it was a very clumsy and non-addictive version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good at their roles and gave their characters a certain personality; but all seemed forced and mechanical. <br /> <br /> The beginning could have been much more engaging; maybe starting with a shootout, and then coming back for a summary of how they got there or that kind of thing. And I felt like every scene was ordinarily predictable and reported, like a bad TV soap. <br /> <br /> I really couldn't wait to see this movie, and hope for something much better. The only thing I can say in his favor is that he beats Mick Jagger's version, but not by much.
