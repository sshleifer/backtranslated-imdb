Was this movie stupid? Yes. Did this film depth? No. Character development? No. Trace twists? No. This was simply a film about a highly fictional Springer show. Show the lengths in which some people will go to get their cups on TV. Molly Hagan did a great job as mother of Jaime Pressly. Jaime is .... well ... GORGEOUS! This film was not made to be a "revolutionary" film; indeed, it was destined for life in a trailer park (I live in a trailer park and ours does not resemble that of this film) where everyone sleeps with everyone else , all the girls get pregnant by different guys, and all the guys drive the '66 Ford pickups (exaggeration, of course, but this is the image that everyone sees when it comes to "trailer park"). Some people overwrite movies (case-in-point: Star Trek fanatics). I watch films exclusively for entertainment value; not to mention that the girl wears a different shirt in a different scene (read the word "Goofs" on Connie's shirt). Could it have been better? Sure, but it was fun to die for.
