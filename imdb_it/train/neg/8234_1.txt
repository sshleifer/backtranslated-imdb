The writers and producers of this small tour have brought down new depths of depravity. The writer's block has established itself so much, or the ideas have dried up so much that they were forced to include a disgusting scene in which a young woman defecates in the back seat of a van, and then promptly throws excrement to the car behind at least this sums up what this film is worth). We had already been treated with one of the other women who urinated on one of his friends under threat, in addition to numerous episodes of graphic vomiting; once it would have been enough ... we received the message! This is really bringing toilet humor to another level! If the script and the acting had been better then I could easily have forgotten that I was watching a movie shot entirely with low budget videos. This was a fairly original plot, with an intelligent (the only) piece of direction in which we always had the opportunity to take the point of view from inside the van; so as to make it seem much more real. We have never been able to see inside other locations, such as the store or field where many women have disappeared, and this could have added so much tension. <br /> <br /> The script was terrible. Lines like: "I don't feel too well ... I want to go home" after one of the girls was chased by a psychopath; subjected to a rape by a screwdriver and shot, it looks a little raw. <br /> <br /> The acting was diabolical (apart from the maniac). All the 5 main actresses in this have learned to act by taking a correspondence course during a long postal strike! The sound was so bad that I had to watch the whole movie with subtitles. <br /> <br /> The director seemed to have an easy job at this. It seems that the only direction he must have given was: "Scream girls". <br /> <br /> AND FOR HOW MUCH SCREAMING ...... If you look at this, make sure you have some paracetamol ready!
