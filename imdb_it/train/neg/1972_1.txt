This really doesn't do justice to the blues. Starts badly with images from the voyager probe and blind Willie McTell (or was it Blind Lemon Jefferson? Someone blind anyway) who seems to tell from space (?) And tell us the life stories of various blues musicians. Although trivial, this could be the most visually interesting part of this documentary. Later, the only thing to see are the actors who incompetently interpret the classical melodies, shot in a fake black and white disc with the likes of Beck and Shemekia Copeland who rape the same songs later. This is a good device to show us why the great old men of the Blues were really fantastic, but not for a compelling vision. There is almost nothing here that can justify the making of a film and not a radio game. No one should be forced to see these badly re-enactments. It's a pity for Wenders, Scorsese and above all for the Blues. Avoid at all costs.
