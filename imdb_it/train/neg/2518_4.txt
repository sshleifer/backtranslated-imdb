Think of a darker version of one of those kids like "Power Rangers" and you have this 1990 movie, "Robot Jox". A film in which you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and whoever comes out of the country wins. The robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of those shows, mainly because they are less colorful, so while this film is not good, it is not bad to look at. As a reminder, there are two robot clashes in this one, one that ends badly and the final clash. There is a twist in part while a traitor is revealed, but in the end the plot is nothing that will stick to you for a while after the image is finished. The same fights look like giant toys on fury, but still a little fun to watch. This film would also generate a couple of other films with similar plot devices like giant robots and the tournament. So it's worth trying once, but probably not more.
