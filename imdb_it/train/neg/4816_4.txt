I imagine that the young people involved in the making of "Necromancy" (aka "The Witching" plus a bunch of other titles) must have felt a bit strange being on the set of a horror movie with the man who: participated with John Houseman in the production of a proletarian work ("The Cradle Will Rock"); people scared to think that the aliens were invading ("War of the Worlds"); and directed and acted in the greatest film of all time ("Citizen Kane"). And now Orson Welles has starred in a third-rate film about a satanic cult. <br /> <br /> There is practically nothing creative in this film. A lot of nudity, but the background music is always very distracting. Although the film was not particularly predictable, it was not worth seeing. How low Welles had collapsed. Fortunately, in the last thirteen years of his life, he narrated the documentary "Bugs Bunny Superstar" (in the 1940's Warner Bros. comics) and hosted the documentary "The Man Who Saw Tomorrow" (su Nostradamus). I recommend those two, but not this one. Just avoid it. <br /> <br /> Also played by Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean.
