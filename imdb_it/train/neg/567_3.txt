This film is one of the most terrible films ever made. How can Jon Bon Jovi play in a movie? He is a singer and not an actor, what? Is he killing vampires with his guitar? And what about the terrible plot? Oh my God, this movie really sucks. In the end she is the vampire queen played by the eternal vampire Arly Jover (Blade) surrounded by an army of vampires, but when the "fantastic" hunters arrive there are only 4 vampires left !! What happened with the other 10-15 vampires? Run outside in the sun ??? And what about the "Grand Finally" when Bon Jovi blows his head off with a gun ??? This is really a "NOT". In "Buffy the vampire Slayer" in 100 episodes a single vampire isn't killed with A SHOTGUN ??? This is really a lack of originality!
