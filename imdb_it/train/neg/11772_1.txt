I'll be brief ... This film is embarrassing for everyone except for its director of photography. The very fact that it is a criticism of the sex tourism industry seems valid until we are "treated" for a persistent dance scene. The plot is ridiculous, no one except the fiercest BAD horror fan will get something out of it. And for God's sake, please stop saying that this film is a story of lost innocence or even of women's emancipation because it is clearly not (maddening childish girls, what the hell?). this was by far the worst movie at the Edinburgh festival (which I saw anyway), someone even collapsed in the middle of the film, probably because he couldn't take it anymore. this may seem an overly critical outlet, but honestly I can't find a saving feature of this film, except maybe if you take it as pure comedy. In short, this film is best viewed on a cocktail of class A drugs.
