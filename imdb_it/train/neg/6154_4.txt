Portly's cute boyfriend falls in love with a sensual blonde; she likes it too, but not for the reasons you might think. The short-sighted black comedy of the writer Pat Proft offers excellent performances by Joe Alaskey and Donna Dixon, but does not have a lasting impact. It's just a quick effort, directed by Norman Bates himself, Anthony Perkins. Even at the level of B-comedies, the "Raoul eating" in some similar way is a better bet. There is certainly a fun set here; unfortunately, the photo has no place to go in its second act. An interesting test, but fails. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
