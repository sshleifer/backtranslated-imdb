The plot of The Thinner is decidedly thin. And gross. An obese lawyer leads the gypsy and the Gypsy curse causes him to lose weight and lose weight ... to the bone. OK, the Gypsy curses should be fun, but did the weight loss go wrong? No. Except Stephen King thinks so. And also Michael McDowell, another horror author and screenwriter of this abysmal film, does it. The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible, he is fat too, haha! The Thinner is like an immature piece of shit for a person who moans like he / she has never seen anything so disgusting of fat. Hey, I can only say: well, look at the mirror.
