"Tyson", a very ordinary TV product, tries to be a serious biopic while lengthening moments of anxiety by effect, quickly forwards through the esotericism of the corrupt boxing sport and confusing the sensationalist stuff that is the only thing that makes Tyson even remotely interesting. A lukewarm watch at best that is more likely to attract public attention than boxing fans.
