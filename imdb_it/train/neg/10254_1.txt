Spoilers <br /> <br /> Wow, END OF THE WORLD is a singularly overwhelming cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Here is the complete story: a scientist receives messages from space (to LA INDIPENDENCE DAY). The messages say that things like a huge disaster are about to happen and then the scientist hears on the radio that a huge earthquake has just happened in China. He begins to think that messages have something to do with disasters around the world, so he is trying to figure out who is receiving messages (and who is also sending messages in space). He and his wife end up realizing that the messages come from a convent. They visit it. Everything seems normal, including the priest played by a bored Christopher Lee. But the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages arrive and reach that convent. So he and his wife sneak back to the convent where they are caught poking their noses by aliens, disguised as priests and nuns. They are held against their will and the alien played by Lee forces the scientist to get something they need to get them back to their planet. Once the alien gets the special element, the aliens all start one by one on their home planet in a sort of scruffy-looking transport platform. Lee, being the last remaining alien, tells the couple that the land will be destroyed due to some sort of alien decision. Lee enters the transporter and is gone. The couple, looking at the monitors that show footage of natural disasters occurring around the world, decide to follow the aliens. Since the earth is doomed, the couple sees no reason to fall behind, so they walk in the teleporter and disappear. The last shot of the film is a papier-mâché exploding on the planet earth. The end. <br /> <br /> Done. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a film so boring in my life. It's the most overwhelming film I've ever seen. The scientist and his wife are two of the worst heroes or protagonists ever put on the screen. They don't care. They see the disasters of the earth on the monitors and decide "what the hell, who needs land anyway?" They don't even try to stop them or do something to make things better. This kind of story could have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of ruin for everything, but the action and atmosphere are non-existent. The actors and the people behind this boring movie are going through their steps, so much so that you can almost hear when they punched their cards when they came down and got back to work. I didn't expect much with this film because it's a Charles Band production, but I didn't expect it to be so bad. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee was once asked which was his worst movie he had ever made and quoted INVASIONS OF STARSHIP. Well, I'm sorry, Chris, but STARSHIP INVASIONS was actually silly fun. STARSHIP INVASIONS is terrible but terribly funny. END OF THE WORLD IS VERY, VERY, VERY Worst: it is beyond boring and inert, without any entertainment value.
