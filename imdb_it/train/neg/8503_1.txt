with all the European studies involved in this, you'd think you'd have at least a good photograph; but the local color is reduced to a minimum. <br /> <br /> Irritation # 1 is Mira Sorvino using a Russian accent to play a Spanish cop - WTF? The story is hopelessly confused. There is a supposed romantic story that is intentionally confused - is she or isn't she a lesbian? - has no purpose. The film cops are the stupidest to have honored a serial killer for a long time. There seems to be a message about the Spanish civil war of the mid-1930s. But since practically all of those involved have died, there is no point in it. <br /> <br /> Despite the background of the bullfight of a part of the narrative (which part? who can say it), you never get a good view of a bullfight. Earnest Hemingway would have hit the director in the nose - with my blessings.
