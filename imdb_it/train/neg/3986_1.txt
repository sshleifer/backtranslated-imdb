When I refer to Malice as a film noir, I don't compare it to masterpieces like Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or The Maltese Falcon, nor do I talk about director Becker with Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bunuel. I'm simply registering a protest against the darkness that pervades this film from beginning to end, to the extent that most of the time you can't understand what's going on. I can understand darkness in night scenes, but this film was dark even in broad daylight, for what reason I'm at a loss to understand. However, it wouldn't have made much difference if director Becker had shot him in total darkness.
