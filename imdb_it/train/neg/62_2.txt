SWING! it is an important film because it is one of the last films produced and performed in the 1930s. Many of these films have simply gotten worse so badly that they are unwatchable, but that's pretty good. It is also a good opportunity to see many of the talented Black performers of the period just after the golden age of the old Cotton Club - a time almost forgotten today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has good performances, it is also a mess. The main plot is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of the time - including a first woman about to ruin the show and the unknown surprise that appears nowhere to save the day. However, the writing is sometimes terrible and a bit shabby - and projects images of Black America that some might find a bit humiliating. This is because before the plot really begins, you are treated with a vagabond without an account who lives with his hard-working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he is caught by a slut (which, by the way, totally overplays this role) , have a fight that looks like a WWE Smackdown scene! And, the only lady wants to cut the other woman with a straight razor - a really scruffy scene! Later in the movie, when the first woman behaves abominably, her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him! It seems that the film, at times, wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator of the public, plus, but they can't even do it well - with some of the worst recitations I've seen in a long time. <Br /> <br /> However, if you can look past a bad production in almost any way (with scruffy characters, bad acting and directing and bad writing), this might be worth a look to sing and dance tip tap - as well as for a glimpse of the forgotten black culture. Don't say I didn't warn you about acting: it's really very ugly!
