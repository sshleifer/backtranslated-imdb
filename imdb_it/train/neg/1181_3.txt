this film has been shrouded in scandal for so long that it has become a much sought after object ... indignation, mystery, etc. it had everything to be a great piece of film, but ultimately fails to any extent. it's a terribly bad comedy, a pathetic horror film, an erotic and limping film. <br /> <br /> the 2 disc DVD includes a wonderful booklet with frames, interviews, essays on bestiality, etc. in addition to an in-depth interview with the director rather than pretentious. for those who have heard about it but never seen it, the package will look fantastic until you actually see the movie. disc 1 contains the modified film, poorly translated into English but with good visual quality. disc 2 contains the director's cut, in a terrible transfer, in French. <br /> <br /> What can I say about the current beast? a puppet of Kermit the frog would have been more effective and shocking.
