There isn't enough here. There are some funny points, but not enough. I was very disappointed because I love stupid movies. I expected this to be a hidden gem. IT WAS NOT. It was a hidden asshole. <br /> <br /> All the time I was watching, I was thinking, "Geez, I could do better than that and I'm an idiot." Don't believe the few good reviews. I was sucked into them. At no point did I laugh out loud. Perhaps this was fun or cutting edge in 1987, but the man fell flat today. This film had a promise, it just didn't work. Maybe if they rewrote it a couple of times. I don't blame the actors. They weren't the best, but they didn't have much to work with. This film failed because of worn writing. SORELELY disappointed.
