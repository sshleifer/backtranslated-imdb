Did the filmmakers even preview it before they published it? The script jumps from one place to another without giving much explanation. The beginning does not clarify whether it is a prequel or not. It starts with the beginnings of Superman on Earth and then jumps to a point after the last film - but it doesn't really alert the viewer. Very confused! Superman himself is weak and needs Prozac. He is portrayed as a potential domestic destroyer, a stalker and someone who is clearly depressed and confused. This type of character is rarely an interesting hero. The finish is absolutely ridiculous. Superman who ends up in the hospital made me want to kill him alone. I'm seriously waiting for an SNL scene in which Superman appears on Maury Povich and Maury says: "The results are - in the case of the child, Superman, you ARE the father." To summarize: OK acting of this Superman and Kevin Spacey, but HORRIBLE script. The film is essentially unwatchable.
