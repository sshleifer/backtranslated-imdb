Dewaana like a movie goes through the usual clich√©s. The man and the woman fall in love and get married, the husband is presumably killed by a family friend who wants the fortune of his family, the women remarry and the surprise surprise of her husband n. 1 reappears. The film is reminiscent of Yash Chopra's Chandni and countless others. Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan perform well. Amrish Puri as a villain follows the movements and is nothing but a bad Bollywood standard. Nadeem Shravan's music is superb, all the songs were exceptional. My favorites are Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Dewanna is a normal film that goes through the scenes.
