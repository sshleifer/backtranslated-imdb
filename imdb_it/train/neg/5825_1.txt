This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! There were people who left the theater, others fell asleep (ok, it was a late night show) ... This is a nonsensical film, one of those that can make you want to never see an image out of the mainstream. I would like to witness the making of this film as I am deeply interested in what happens to the authors of such rejections. Do they laugh when they create all these ridiculous things or do they really think they are doing something interesting? I wonder ... The soundtrack is horrible apart from some instrumental things that remind you of a previous Bjork album. Even if you're a fan of Bjork's music, stay home. It's the best thing to do. The small, tiny pieces of good music have no reason for you to go out and submit to this torture. God!...
