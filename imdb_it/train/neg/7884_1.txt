The things I learned from "The List". <br /> <br /> A decent filmmaker, a sexy girl who can act and Malcolm McDowell couldn't stop this movie from sucking. <br /> <br /> Blockbuster won I give you your money back. <br /> <br /> Even when he reads the script and says "Ugh! Really?!", Malcom McDowell tries again. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington is in desperate need of acting lessons. <br /> <br /> Rent a writer. <br /> <br /> Even Jesus hates me and punishes me by making me pay $ 5.50 to see this movie. <br /> <br /> When you make a movie, you don't need an ending. Leave everything inexplicable, unresolved and uninteresting so that the public falls asleep BEFORE the finale. Genius. <br /> <br /> Every casual owner can cure death by simply drawing a cross on a window. So make friends. <br /> <br /> Your maid can give you life. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington still needs acting lessons. <br /> <br /> Your roommate will hate you and tease you if you bring this movie home. Apologies will not be accepted.
