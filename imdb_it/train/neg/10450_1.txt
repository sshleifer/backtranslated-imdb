This film was the worst movie I saw from "Date Movie". I was laughing all over the movie instead of being scared. It was funny how the snakes looked for a particular section of the passenger body to attack, for example, the eye, the tongue, the ass, the breast. If we have seen a national geographic channel, we know that snakes will not cling to the body after biting. For each particular scene the snakes bite the passengers and remained on the body to bite the person. I believe the producer has not studied his information on snakes and their behavior. I can't believe I wasted my money on this movie. So I don't recommend this trusted movie, just wait for it to be at the dollar theater or rent it.
