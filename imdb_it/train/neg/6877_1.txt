I sat down to watch a documentary on Puerto Rico, and ended up watching one on Nuyoricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I can't see the 50% who live in poverty. When I see people in difficulty, they are usually Haitians, Dominicans or Cubans who have recently arrived on the island. There is no such thing as spanglish ... or you speak Spanish, or you don't ... and from what I've heard ... you don't. Pedro Albizo Campos IS NOT MLK for me. MLK was a great man. Campos is a great man for those who want independence which is 1%. For the rest, he has a position like Osama bin Laden. Puerto Ricans who want independence are a bunch of fools. If you want a test for all of you dreamers of an independent Puerto Rico, see Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Bahamas, all of Central and South America and Mexico. It worked wonderfully for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this documentary was about Nuyoricani and their struggles. <br /> <br /> To the person who reported that there was not enough Africa on display ... he had to be on Puerto Rico ... not Africa. Denzel will shortly make one for you. <br /> <br /> In conclusion ... to all those ignorant whites who think we need green papers to come to the United States and want to know how the prime minister handles things, this is not a good documentary on culture of the Puertorican. Tell your children to pay attention in Geography and in the History class. <br /> <br /> *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonite ... "doc." he spoke of Nuyoricans. He promoted it as if it were how we all feel. It should have been titled ... "yo soy nuyorican ... lunche ... I can't speak Spanish". PLEASE, USING PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA OR ANY OTHER ASSOCIATED PARTY WITH PR WITH THIS NUYORICAN LESSON. God forbid they do this on the island.
