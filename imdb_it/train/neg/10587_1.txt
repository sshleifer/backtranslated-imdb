There seems to be an overwhelming response to this film but no one with the intuition to criticize his methodology, which is extremely imperfect. He simply continues to propose journalistic style analysis, that is, he plays out of the lack of knowledge and prejudice of the public in order to evoke an emotional emotion and an explosion of negative diatribe. <br /> <br /> Journalism 101: tell the viewer some, in fact, only to prepare them to draw predictable conclusions. for example, the idea of ​​civil war, chaos, looting, etc. were all apparently unexpected responses to the collapse of the government infrastructure following the disappearance of Saddam: were they not all symptomatic of an already indigent culture? doctrinal internal struggle as symptomatic of these veins of Islam itself, rather than a failure in the police force to curb and protect? would they prefer the United States to have declared the marshall law? I'm sure the newspapers here would have exploded with the accusations of a police state and fascist forces. <br /> <br /> apart from the analytical idiocy of the film, it takes some sideliners and leaves the rest by stating that "some of those refused to be interviewed ..." yet the questions they would have asked are without doubts have already been resolved by the hundred questions that individuals have already received. As a vice president, you would like to be interviewed by a first time writer / producer who surely has already expanded to distort your words. they couldn't roll Condi's tape to show his opinion and answer some of the logistical problems with the questions, maybe they never saw her listen to it. <br /> <br /> this is far from a neutral look at the situation on earth there. this is another biased, asinine approach by journalists - which are, in principle, unreasonable herds. <br /> <br /> Anyone wishing to comment on the war should at least base their ideas on things that are a little more reliable than the NBC coverage and CNN comment. these interpretations have the same vitriol that simply creates a further bipartisanism of those who want to think and those who want to be informed by the media about what to think.
