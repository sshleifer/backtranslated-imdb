Russell Hopton acted in many films until his death in 1945. He directed only 2 and "Black Gold" was one, (the other was also from 1936). Frankie Darro had an on-screen presence that was sometimes abrasive but a good guy was playing in this. Obviously it was very popular in the "quickie" circuit - it made so many movies. In this he plays the son of an old oil rig who believes he will soon hit oil. <br /> <br /> J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) is trying to convince the old man to sell himself because he knows there will be oil hit at any time. A geologist, Henry, enters the scene and helps "Fishtail" dad. It also convinces "Fishtail" to go to school regularly. Henry's eyes are on Cynthia, the pretty teacher. This was Gloria Shea's last film - he started his career as Olive Shea in "Glorifying the American Girl" (1929). "Fishtail's" father is killed when the rig is sabotaged and Henry is determined to bring Anderson and his cronies to justice. When Henry is kidnapped, Anderson tries to persuade "Fishtail" to sell his oil lease. Everything ends well with the oil hit and "Fishtail" going to the military school. <br /> <br /> Good for a rainy day.
