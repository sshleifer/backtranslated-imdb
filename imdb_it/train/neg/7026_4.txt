On his birthday a child tells his mother that he is not his son, and that he wants to go home to his real mother. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Comedy De L'Innocence seems to come from another time in the cinema, perhaps from the 60s or 70s. It certainly reminded me of Losey's Secret Ceremony (1968), and Full Circle by Richard Loncraine (1977), both of which deal with loss, pain and relationships between "lost" parents (curiously both films are protagonists of Mia Farrow). > <br /> All three films are populated by non-sympathetic characters who behave in strange and inexplicable ways. All three films look cool, both emotional and literal. All three films focus on mother-child relationships, and in the end all three films pose the question: "what is real, what do you imagine?" <br /> <br /> Beautiful but imperfect, it does not offer easy answers and leaves much suspended, inexplicable and strange.
