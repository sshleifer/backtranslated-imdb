. . . And this is a bad thing, because at least if it had been a Troma movie, it would have had unbridled violence and a greater sense of anarchist abandonment that could have increased my rating a little. <br /> <br /> Then we have instead a very tame budget (PG rated), barely warm, low budget (Roger Corman produced it with an unknown director who remained unknown later) Gremlins (1984) / Critters ( 1986) -wannabe with almost exclusively flat humor, small of the logic that made Gremlins work so well - logic of fantasy or no, no suspense, no sense of adventure, and no violence or nudity to compensate. <br /> <br /> Although I'm sure some of the problems with the film are inherent in the script - let's face it, nobody could express these jokes so that they were funny - it seems that the biggest blame should fall into the director's lap, Bettina Hirsch. In more capable hands, Munchies could have been fun. <br /> <br /> After all, it starts like many great adventure films. Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are in Peru in an archaeological excavation. Simon is a bit of an extravagant archaeologist who is always at the base of theories about the connections between ancient sites and alien civilizations. For example, think of seeing the evidence of laser cutting on ancient stone. So I'm in Machu Picchu looking for more evidence of Simon's theories when they happen in a secret chamber. Inside they quickly find the animal they later call "Arnold", one of the titular munchies. <br /> <br /> They take Arnold home to their small desert town in California. Simon, who thinks Arnold is probably an alien creature, has to go to a colleague's conference, and plans to tell his colleague he finally has an alien specimen. Paul and his extremely pretty girlfriend, Cindy (Nadine Van der Velde), are left in command of Arnold, but since they haven't seen each other for a long time, they leave Arnold unattended as they jump into the sack. > <br /> Meanwhile, Simon's brother, Cecil (also played by Korman in a dual role), owner of a successful snack company, is eager to buy Simon's house and land - they are adjacent to his . Simon doesn't want to sell, so Cecil hits a pattern to steal Arnold. Things gradually get out of hand, and the crunches, which have a vein to follow with their cravings for junk food, begin to invade the city. <br /> <br /> Which reads better in a summary than the screen does. The best shots of the film are those with natural landscapes in the background, such as when the characters drive to the outskirts of the deserted city. The interiors, with the exception of Cecil's house, tend to look like poorly decorated and inexpensive sets and, more importantly, tend to show that Hirsch is not very good at locking and preparing shots. Strangely, given the scarcity of the overall production design, Cecil's house is a real gem, imbued with an eighties style exaggerated to the smallest details, and Cecil's stepson, Dude (Jon Stafford), was a fun counterpoint . Too bad, therefore, that he came out of the film so quickly. <br /> <br /> However, Korman is a fun actor, but he comes across much better here like Simon than Cecil. Unfortunately, Simon ends up taking time off most of the movie. Cecil, who is physically distinct from a ridiculous wig and facial hair, is not only the film's "bad capitalist", is one of Korman's classic and reckless classic characters - it was one of his specialties, often capitalized on "Carol" Burnett Show "(1967) skits. Unlike" The Carol Burnett Show ", which tended to succeed because the directors Clark Jones and Dave Powers had a studied way of pushing the skits right on the brink of chaos, Hirsch guided Korman so too far away, and the character Cecil does not do it <br /> <br /> There are many other problems related to the director, not least his mess and his editing, which let glimpse every possible suspense or dramatic impact of the film. the scenes that were supposed to be shoes to expand the drama - like when the appetizers are harassing an old lady on the road - are put together too strangely to have much effect. <br /> <br /> There are though re logical problems with the story as it is. Where does the munchie in Machu Picchu's room come from? The movie trailer seems to show an answer to this, but it has been modified by the final cut. A more serious problem is that, unlike the gremlins, there is no clear reason why the munchies go from tender and cuddly plushies to menacing monsters. It just happens. Furthermore, since Munchies has been held PG, and the violence remains subdued, when the creatures are in their monstrous phase, they are never very threatening. They are also easily shipped, at least temporarily. <br /> <br /> Of course, the essence of the film is not suspense, horror, compelling drama or any other stuff, but humor. It is intended more as a parody of Gremlins and the countless rip-offs that derive from it. The only problem is that the film is not funny at all, even though I giggled a couple of times. A surprisingly high percentage of jokes are bland clich√©s. Too much of the remaining material consists of non-sequitur. Given Hirsch's bad timing, everything collapses. There was the possibility of making a film that, while being a parody, was at the same time funny and frightening, exhilarating and disturbing, of style and full of suspense at the same time, wing Killer Klowns of Outer Space (1988). Too bad, then, that the Munchies don't get anywhere.
