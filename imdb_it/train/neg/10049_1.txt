I love the frequently confused "Masters of Horror" series. Fans of horror live in constant lack of nourishment. Projects like this (and the similar "Greenlight Project" that "Festa" gave us - like this or a lump) are fertile ground for wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of the directors with a horror determined to develop and bring food to maturity for we would love to have dinner in horror. <br /> <br /> This started with a really kool idea kernel and it worked ... right on the edge of "where do I go to the world with this? !!!". <br /> <br /> I don't know how to ruin the spoiled but "SPOILER AHEAD" All of a sudden ... no, there was that light that wandered in the night sky before ... we have long luminescent aliens from the hair ( huh? ... HUH?) men who pierce the brain and ... yes, I understand but ... well ... the worst curse of the narrative - a stimulating and promising staging without a satisfactory reward. <br /> <br /> Cue to storytellers ... your accumulation must have a payoff that exceeds the accumulation. Not the other. Storytelling math 101. <br /> <br /> End of Spoilers - Big Oops!
