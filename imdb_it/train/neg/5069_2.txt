I have a serious problem with this show, many actually. A simple list will suffice for now, I'll go into it later: superficial characters, laughter and boring humor. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to look at the rest of this review and I'm just reading it to make you feel superior (as if you saw something on this show I don't have) to a teenager who is often Irish from Canada. friends suck, not only because it's not funny but because TV audiences are destroyed for new, good shows (Arrested Development, Dexter etc.). Friends are so much to blame for reality TV, "Two And A Half Men" and "The King Of Queens" as TV executives. Now then, get on with the review. <br /> <br /> These characters have no soul, they are exactly the same in every way (outside the genre and hair color). They react the same way in boring situations and are completely safe in their own bodies. Where is the conflict and the resulting humor? Why doesn't Rachel rush to Monica after Monica starts dating Rachel's enemy? Why doesn't Joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take it seriously? Oh right, because he is the dumb and he is at ease with that. This is the curse of having perfect characters: lasting conflict and (God forbid) personality becomes an impossibility. <br /> <br /> Laughter is the only thing that should have become extinct immediately after its birth. Every show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of the fun one. How can I make such a broad generalization? When a show that claims to be a "comedy" requires laughter from someone BEYOND THE AUDIENCE, that means the audience won't laugh without it. Laughtracks destroy humor by preventing rapid returns. Humor becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity (see The Office, Arrested Development). <br /> <br /> This leads to my next point: humor is boring. There is no way to make a perfect character more than a little humorous (without a seemingly laughter) simply because our daily humor comes from the recognition of our faults. What if Monica had a 17 year old? He immediately recognizes that what he is doing is not right and breaks with him. There must be some kind of conflict rather than an immediate solution. Maybe his mother finds out or one of his friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him. It would be great, it would be like a battle for custody! So now I have provided evidence for my position. Many of my friends love this show because they never heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development, many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. <br /> <br /> I have seen very little of "Friends" in my life, but I have looked enough to find huge flaws that make the show, in my opinion, completely unwatchable. If you've read this far, thank you, and I hope you at least start looking at some of the shows I mentioned.
