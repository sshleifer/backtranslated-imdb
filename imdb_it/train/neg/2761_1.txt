Everyone does things that they will regret later. Things they wish they could blame for drugs or foreign possession. Things that, while at the same time appear to be rational, later turn out to be invitations carved into suffering and endless recriminations of stupidity. <br /> <br /> For some people it is signing the note for the new Hummer, for others it is taking on a homicidal hitchhiker, for others it is sending information of its bank account to third world millionaires mysteriously linked for money. <br /> <br /> For me it was a movie. <br /> <br /> D-War: Dragon Wars In retrospect, I should have imagined how eco-friendly and well-recycled this film would be with its repeated stuttered title. But with my voluntary suspension of intact disbelief, and a naive faith derived from the cool-looking poster in the lobby, I really wanted this movie to work. Unfortunately, when the old man in the pawnshop explained the whole past story, fifteen minutes from the photo, I had the sudden and sinking revelation that comes from knowing every point of the plot of a film not yet seen. And worse: I knew how bad every point would have sucked. <br /> <br /> Let me be perfectly clear here, the English language lacks sufficient nuances and depth in the field of extreme evil to correctly describe how bad this film really is. <br /> <br /> As for knowing all the twists of the movie, I was wrong. In the spirit of the old Godzilla movies, whose scales are not worth filling, he conveniently created additional sub-frames whenever the main characters were threatened by the specter of meaningful dialogue. <br /> <br /> infested with close calls, miraculous escapes and concentrated deposits of ill-explained anxiety. <br /> <br /> This movie is what would happen if you had access to the national defense budget to the producers of the powerful Morphing Power Rangers. And a lot of liquor. <br /> <br /> Let me try to explain. <br /> <br /> Imagine being able to grab all the best pieces of action movies of the last decade: First take the Rasta Amphibian Army from Star Wars Episode One and remove their Prozac until they are not ready to beat the Navy Seals. <br /> <br /> Go ahead, take the approximations of Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise (you can even call it Ethan as a "thin" mention of the Mission Impossible franchise.) and give them a lot of film noir, so no one gets confused while trying to follow the depth of their thoughts. <br /> <br /> Finally add a villain with a hoarse voice with pointed armor worthy of a yard of Lord of the Rings and a pair of giant cobras, angry about having deleted their scenes from the last edition of King Kong and have them all out without a particular order on the modern day in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Now run to the pharmacy to find something for your sudden headache. When you return, purify these ingredients until each neglected sign of originality dissolves into a homogeneous mass of cheese and serve semi-gelatinous. <br /> <br /> At various points during this photo, I found myself saying aloud, "Let the bad movie end", and burst into tears. <br /> <br /> To call this a movie B would give him an undeserved promotion. After summer school and a lot of physical therapy, you could go for a C-level movie if you could somehow sleep for most of it. In short, if you ever find the cells to burn and the need to punish you for horrible and unspoken sins against humanity with money and brains, Dragon Wars could be the right movie for you.
