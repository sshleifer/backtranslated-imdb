The actors did a great job interpreting their roles, especially the mother. However, as the film progressed, I discovered that I was looking at it more for their acting and not because I cared for people at all. And at times, I felt irritated by the irresponsible and passive approach to parenting shown again and again. The daughter is a shallow skay of seventeen whose main ambition in life is to tame famous men and become a dancing nifone (complete with a lot of "shaking booty"). The son is a boy with low self-esteem who seems very desperate for a relationship and friends - so much that he throws a late drug party into the movie. The husband and wife are both bored, but rather than putting the energy into their stale relationship they would rather look for new partners (even if the wife chooses badly, since the man she "throws" with is gay --- OOPS! ). I just heard that ALL the characters needed to grow and had difficulty caring for these superficial jerks. I think the author's attempt was to demonstrate the absolute banality and laceration of the capitalist system. However, since these characters are NOT typical of the average Western family, it seems unreliable.
