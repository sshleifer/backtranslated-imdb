Okay, so, somebody, somewhere, a few years ago, thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie on some flies that stood out on Apollo 11 and went to the moon. So they did. Someone, somewhere, was an idiot. <br /> <br /> I want to give artists props to do homework on hardware. As far as I can tell, the rockets and launch hardware were perfect. The graphics in general were pretty good - the rocket launch gave me the creeps, as it always does a good rocket launch (my blood of flying machine gears of my popular mechanics is still strong) and 3D was pretty effective. The CG was not of Pixar quality, but in general it was good. The flies were somewhat mediocre anthropomorphic, with some semi-assumed characters of the late 1960s cast by color (hippie flies, African American flies with giant afros and black shades, etc.) and the larvae looked more like larvae with human nipples ( even if they made picky and overwhelming noises. <br /> <br /> The writers certainly didn't do their homework, relying on offensive and obsolete clicks (genre politics of the 60s including mostly useless female characters, stereotypes racial, bad Russians, fat fly that just wants to eat, level 2 coarse humor.) In a film directed for IMAX, they took the opportunity to sneak into some educational content on physics and space travel - they didn't have their right physics (zero-g in the lunar module during landing burn?) PLEASE. t be also taken the trouble to read the original radio transcripts between Houston and the astronauts, all of which are of public domain or, instead they wrote their own dialogue, which looks like crap. <br /> <br /> But we liked the worms. <br /> <br /> So they get a point and a half for rockets and worms. Uh, yay. 1.5 / 5.
