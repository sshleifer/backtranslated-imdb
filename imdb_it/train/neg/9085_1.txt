One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Acting was terrible, both for children and adults. Most of all the characters showed no, little or little emotion. The lighting was terrible, and there were too many messes about the time of day when the film was shot (in the river scene where they just destroyed their boat, there are 4 shots: the sheriff and dad in the evening on their boat, Jillian and Molly swim in the evening, the rest of the children during the day * when it is scheduled in the evening * on the bank of the river, and the doctor, Beatrice and Simonton at night, but not in the evening descend from their boat acting in the film was probably from the sheriff, Cappy (Although there is a nuance of character when the pulse detector * Whatever it is when people die, it emits a beep * shows that Cappy is dead, still moves while he can still hear a beep, and while the extra nurse checks his wrist manually, then he shows his pulse again, and then eventually dies.) I guess it won't be perfect, since it's an independent film, but it could still be better not worth watching honestly, even for children. You could also look at something good, like The Lion King or Toy Story if you see something you will remember.
