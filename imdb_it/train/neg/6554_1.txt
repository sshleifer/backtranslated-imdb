I wouldn't rate this film, it's not worthy. I only saw him because I'm a fan of Pfieffer. I love her and I would watch whatever she did. Even in this disaster, he did not disappoint. Every scene with her in it, kept the viewer looking ... waiting ... for something to happen, but nothing she ever did. He had good stories but ended abruptly as soon as he started. Some of the other characters had the potential but did not become anything. <br /> <br /> Pfieffer was 29 years old when he made this film and its most adorable appearance. The wardrobe and set were surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> I can watch almost everything and rarely come across a movie I can't find something I like, but this was a real disaster. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> Worst of all this, in the end he had a big crutch. He had a final scene that woke you up and say wow, this movie is finally going somewhere, then the credits come out. Good grief <br /> <br /> I agree with the review that said .99 would have bought 3 cans of cat food and watching my cat eat would have been more exciting. Well said. Actually, that comment was more fun than the movie because it sums it up so well. I too lost 99 cents on this dud.dud.dud.
