I have been familiar with the fantastic book of 'Goodnight Mister Tom' for centuries and I was only recently when I had the chance to see this adaptation. I have heard many positive comments about this, so I had high hopes. Once this movie was finished, I was horrified. <br /> <br /> This film is not a good movie at all. "Goodnight Mister Tom" was an extremely poor adaptation and practically 4.5 / 10 of the book was lost. In particular, I discovered that many of the characters and some great scenes from the book were not in this. There was not much dialogue, he was rushed and too fast, but I was mostly troubled by the fact that you could never see the bond and love between William Beech and Tom in this film that was a real disappointment. The casting wasn't that good. I thought this could be really good, but it was so different from the book! Extremely poor adaptation, one of the worst I've seen. This deserves a decent remake that would be better to be 1000 times better than this pile of junk.
