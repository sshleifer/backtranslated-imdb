I saw this movie a few months ago in the city that appeared as Greendale in the film, which is the only reason I went to see it. Another local who was there just sent me a repetition email because the first one had run out and the people had been sent away. His editorial comment in his speech is a good summary: <br /> <br /> "Yuk." <br /> <br /> Unless you are a Neil Young fan or live in / near "Greendale" (if the latter knows the real name), skip this movie. It is above all a journey of the ego for the director. It has no recognizable plot, the music is just OK, and too much of the lyrics are incomprehensible making it impossible to follow those little shreds of plot that could be there. <br /> <br /> I don't need to insert a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give away. <br /> <br /> I would give a 1.5 / 10, but it's just for the fun value of seeing movies made in a movie. It wasn't worth the $ 6. I could rent a video camera and go around "Greendale" and make a better film out of me. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a * good * movie with environmental messages without plot, go rent Koyaanisqatsi.
