This film limps from the self-indulgent moment to the self-indulgent moment, promising to turn into something worth clinging to. But is not so. It is flat, self-conscious, unimaginative and boring. <br /> <br /> A series of images and fixed backgrounds do not make a film, they make a calendar. This kind of bad pseudo-dramatic socialist documentary ("It's REALLY REALLY successful") not only fails to entertain, fails to convince, so it doesn't even work as a social story. The clich√©s mixed with bad acting make this film very difficult to finish, the fun factor that vanishes quite quickly. The characters are one-dimensional, they never develop to the extent that it is felt for them. The director's ego is the biggest character in this film.
