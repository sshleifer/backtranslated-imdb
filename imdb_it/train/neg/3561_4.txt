The adaptation of Stephen King (scripted by King himself) in which a young family, newly arrived in rural Maine, discovers the pet cemetery near their home. The father (Dale Midkiff) then discovers Micmac's burial ground beyond the pet cemetery that has resurrection powers - only obviously everything that is buried there returns not exactly RIGHT. <br /> <br /> On average "horror" image starts awkwardly, offensive and inept, and continues like this for a while, with the absolute worst element being Midkiff's worthless performance. It gets a little better towards the end, with a really scary ending. Actually, the whole movie is really scary, and that's why I can't completely reject it - at least it has SOMETHING to make it memorable. Fred Gwynne's decent supportive shows, like the wise old neighbor, and Brad Greenquist, like the disfigured spirit Victor Pascow are not enough to really redeem the film. <br /> <br /> King has his usual cameo as a minister. <br /> <br /> Followed by a sequel also directed by Mary Lambert (is it any wonder that she has not worked in mainstream cinema since?) <br /> <br /> 4/10
