This is the sound of Stan and Ollie running in their graves. <br /> <br /> I will not bother to list the fundamental flaws of this film because they are so obvious that they go without saying. Little things, like this "The new adventures of Laurel and Hardy" despite the stars have been dead for over thirty years when it was produced. Little things like that. <br /> <br /> A bad idea would be to have actors playing fools called Laurel and Hardy. As bad as it could have worked. For a bad idea, try throwing two actors to play the duo. Ok, they could claim to be grandchildren, but the end result is the same. <br /> <br /> Bronson Pinchot can be fun. Ok, forget about his extravagant foreigner "Cousin Larry" in Perfect Strangers, and watch it in True Romance. Here, however, it stinks. Probably not all his fault, and, like the director and the supporting cast - all those who are better than the material - he was probably just desperate for money. Some say that Americans find it difficult to master an effective English accent. This cause is not helped by Pinchot here. What is Stan? Welsh? Iranian? Pakistani? Only in the whim of Stan's brand is approaching, even if the yelp is exaggerated to the point of having nothing to write about at home. Gailard Sartain does a bit better as Ollie, even if it's like saying what's worse: stepping into the dirt of dogs or a football in werewolves? <br /> <br /> Do you remember the originals with their split times, intuitive teamwork and innate kindness? Well, this is completely absent, replaced by two stupid old men and jokes, so they can't park a bus through the empty spaces. While the originals had textures that could be summarized in a couple of panels, this one has a mummy mess (and what a lousy title!) That mingles with the scenario of the boys' brotherhood. I can't claim to have seen all of Laurel and Hardy 108's films, but I think it's a safe bet that their nadir was also ahead of this. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main problem is that the originals were like playing, or at least using their own accents. At least it seemed natural and not forced, unlike the invented caricatures that Pinchot and Sartain gave. And since when has Stan made malapropisms and so many in that? "I wanted to give you a cremation on your feet"; "I would like to marinate my friend." Stop that! <br /> <br /> Only a noteworthy moment is a reference to Bozo the Clown, the cartoon character who shared Larry Harmon's L & H comic. Of course Harmon bought the copyright name (how disconcerting it is to see an Â® after Laurel and Hardy) and was co-director and producer of this disguise. <br /> <br /> Questions abound. Would Stan and Ollie fart if they were alive today? Would glass mummies with broken bottles? Did Stan get hit in the genitals with a spear and end up with a big CGI finale? We hope not. <br /> <br /> I laughed once, but I think he was incredulous of how terrible it is. Why was this film made in the first place? Who thought the producers would like it? Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen, an absolute aversion, I felt tired of looking after only the first five minutes. Fun as much as having your head trapped in a vise while a hot poker and stinging nettles are forcibly inserted into your back passage.
