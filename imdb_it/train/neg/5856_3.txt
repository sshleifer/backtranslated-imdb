T. Rama Rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s, but he seems to be a filmmaker who cannot mature with the changing times, styles and fashions. It's like he has the same old-fashioned cinematic style. <br /> <br /> Actors are not bad, not even good. Anil Kapoor generally convincingly interprets his two roles as father and son, but the flawed script often makes him fun and pathetic. Rekha is good, but then - she is always good, and here is nothing more than that. It does the best of what is given to it, but it always does. In conclusion, nothing exceptional. Raveena is OK, which means normal, not bad, not good, nothing. <br /> <br /> This film is melodramatic, sometimes stupid. Maybe it's a late movie? Well, even then it would still be below the standard. The script is terrible, the film is exaggerated and the story is not going anywhere. It looks like a movie made in the early 90s, but the script makes it look even older, the style is similar to that of the 50s. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend it, unless you are a big fan of the main actors.
