I read this Thornton Wilder play last year in eighth grade. I was also forced to sit on this weak translation of it on the screen. Let me tell you, it's not a fantastic game, it's easily passed, but the man deserves a much better shot. The acting was really lacking, the scenario - honest of God - seemed drawn in cardboard by a group of three-year-old children. As if it could not get worse, the sound quality is very bad ... there is this nightmare "buzz" every time an actor speaks ... and even I couldn't help but notice that the chemistry between George and Emily, well, it's non-existent. The actors all look very uncomfortable about being there. There is no music. It is in black and white, which would be good, but it enhances its character even more. In any case, I think that if you're going to see this movie, which I really don't recommend, then don't put your hopes on top. The game, however brave, is probably better.
