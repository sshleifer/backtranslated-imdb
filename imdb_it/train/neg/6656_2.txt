This becomes a two because I liked it as a child, but it became so redundant that I just started to hate it ... I can't give a descriptive review because it would be resizing one thing after another, I probably wouldn't do it. others have not already said. <br /> <br /> The only other thing about this show is that it is rather obnoxious, with the baby boiling with that babysitter twisted at the stupidity that runs around and around it. I have a cousin who loves this show and is the strangest and most stupid person I've ever met. This show should be pulled from the air. It's always the same thing over and over ... They have to put better shows on Nick. I'm really getting tired of things like this.
