Fairly mediocre by Monogram standards, this mystery (a remake of The Sphinx) has a strange plot that is not unraveled with much effect - you will see it after about ten minutes. The two protagonists have a nice, breezy dialogue at the beginning, but John Hamilton is hopelessly boring as the villain (the cast of Lionel Atwill gave rise to the role) and the enigma of Warren Hymer is rather annoying. However, it is worth waiting for five minutes from the incomparable Mantan Moreland as Nicodemus the keeper, who prevails over the defense attorney during an exhilarating courtroom appearance. You must hand it to Bill "One-Take" Beaudine; he wasn't a great director, but he would always punch a routine programmer with some stupid vaudeville.
