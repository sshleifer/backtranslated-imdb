I'm a big fan of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard. And besides them, Charles Butterworth (a very funny supporting actor) was in this movie ... so why didn't I particularly like it ?! Well, despite a good cast, this is one of the poorest written and most cliché "Photos" I've ever seen. Given the talent and money spent on making this film, it's as shocking as it was writing. I knew the film would be boring when, at the beginning of the film, I found myself expecting EXACTLY what would happen next - and I was always right! And this is not because I am a sort of "film savant", but because almost no imagination or effort has entered it. In fact, it seemed like the movie was just a long series of clichés put together! Also, I found it somewhat annoying that Fred had abused Carole throughout the film, and yet, true to the conventions, he eventually came to him. Uggh! There is a bit of suspense in a Lassie film ("will you get people to save Timmy or the rope hanging from a break?"). Despite the very, very tired and trivial script, there were some positive aspects of the film. It was nice to see Fred look like a lush crack at the end of the film - it was pretty believable and it looked like he hadn't eaten, shaved or slept in a few days. Furthermore, Charles Butterworth's "talker" provided some slightly humorous moments. But all this was not enough to make this movie look different from a "B movie". It's a shame ... it could have been a lot better.
