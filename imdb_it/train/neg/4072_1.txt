I watch ugly movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good enough to be a bad movie. Not an ounce of humor, not an ounce of talent everywhere. <br /> <br /> I AM LAZY. <br /> <br /> Usually, I see a bad movie and a curse. It was so bad, I did a review to try to save others from the completely boring casino that I was a victim of. <br /> <br /> I'm destroying my copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> It is too difficult even to use a free room. So boring. Watch 'Bloodsucking Freaks' or 'Shock, shock, shock' for absolute shit that has some merit as entertainment. This mud looks horrible, it's horrible, and whoever did it should feel bad.
