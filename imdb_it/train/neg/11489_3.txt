In the United States, very few films have been made about Rome that were not set in the times of Julius Caesar or shortly thereafter. The epic of sandals and Hollywood sandals mostly have a Christian theme, which makes it difficult to enter the previous Roman history (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule, and met some resistance in Hollywood because it had no Jesus in it). /> <br /> It is interesting to see at least one photo that does not take place before the times of Caesar and Christ, but is set when Rome was just one of the many cities of the Italian peninsula and had just ousted the hated King Tarquin and formed the Republic. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a historical film; it is peplum, and while the production values ​​are not the background, the acting and the characterizations are made of cardboard. I can only imagine what the dialogue was like in Italian, but with English dubbing it is very campy. At first I had some good laughs. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many such films, having lost most of the Hercules films of the 60s. It's funny up to a point, but as the movie goes on, it gets a little boring. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain: if I had seen this movie when I was ten, I would have loved it. At that age, I fought with Romans and fought with swords. So, at least, this movie has brought back some childhood memories.
