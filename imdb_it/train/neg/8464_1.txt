I'm very tolerant of really bad science fiction and horror movies - I've watched them since I was 4 or 5, so I've seen really bad things, but I take care of that. I've even seen a lot of SciFi Channel movies, so I know I don't expect much, a usually promising movie that has no end to talk about. Hope is born eternal, I imagine - or the triumph of hope over experience, as they say. Unfortunately, this is a dog from the beginning and I knew it, but like a flame moth, I kept thinking about something, anything interesting would happen. It is not so. All actors give a decent performance - given the script, I don't know how everyone kept their faces straight. It has something to do with the collagen-hungry worm parasitic creatures that are slowly taking over the human race, one body at a time. There is an evil plastic surgeon who works with the enemy giving them the outward appearance of humans ... don't worry, get what comes from him. The same snail people don't really know where they came from, they think they took a ride on a meteor landed on the ground, but ... somehow they know about the members of the slug royalty among them - the princess of the snails has managed to breed with a human being who knows he is the queen of worms and loves her for herself ... oh, do I have to go on? Please, I beg you, don't waste 2 hours of your life looking at this ... anything would be better ... think of the worst, least fun way you can spend two hours ... it would be better than that.
