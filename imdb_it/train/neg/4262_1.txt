This is simply the worst movie I've ever seen. It goes from about 2 hours, and the box art was totally misleading. My friends and I rented it because we thought it would be a poor 300. You know, to laugh and tease. No. There is nothing funny about this movie, only pain. So the movie starts, and they are talking about some sort of different language. We think, 'Oh it's just the beginning.' But no, from there the film precipitates and becomes more of a super boring book you had to read in elementary school, where nothing literally happens for hours, and the battle scenes rival those of 2 children fighting in a playground. Omit cinematography and this film belongs to the waste compactor. Movies like this will bring the world we see in Wall-E, which by the way was a good movie.
