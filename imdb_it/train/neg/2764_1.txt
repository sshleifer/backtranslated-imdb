First of all, I have no idea how this film came to the big screen. It's not even the low-cost movie on the SCI-Fi channel, it's just awful. Me and my friend who love action movies, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. They went to see this movie expecting this movie with Transformers with dragons, mindless entertainment. All we got was an hour and a half without mind. The CG wasn't as bad as I expected, but the plot is so terrible with acting, it made up for it. It is basically a Chinese dragon with legs that returns every 500 years ... Does it look like a good remake of Rain of Fire? No, the plot tries to be deeper than what should leave not only the holes of the plot, but with magic, and a very small war between dragons (rather large snakes) becomes ridiculous. The director has tried to add some humor to the failing film. My friend and I laughed at the whole thing (along with all 5 of the audience), and I can't believe we spent money on it. The short trailer on TV makes up for most of the action, while the rest sucks. I've seen many B movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider and others, but I have to say if you want a non-stop laugh for an hour, look at this. <br /> <br /> Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I don't drink ... but it would have helped me before watching this movie
