Where to start? OK, don't compare this movie to fight the club for a start - ridiculous. If it was also a patch on fight club, violence, blood, blood etc. They would be much more obvious and realistic. Secondly, this film is not a football factory - which is much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby seem embarrassed). Fairly correct, the plot is pretty decent and the fight scenes are well choreographed - with a decent finish that I could add. But the film as a whole is poor, seriously poor. How people mentioned accents shouldn't ruin a movie - I disagree - or a simple casting mistake, or a lack of effort in coaching voices caused the film to be irritating to the end - it was obvious from the scene one of an American / Geordie was playing the role. Don't get me wrong, good-looking guy, who looks great on a skin head - but he's not a soccer hooligan. I could go on and on about how ridiculous the football scene was - the 'fake steward' situation. Also, when the GSE will play north, they will get on the train expecting only 3 of them - it makes no sense - this is a real gangster and hooligan organization, which is portrayed in the movie to be a bit of a mickey mouse cult of about 5 people. In terms of accuracy, haven't West Ham and Milwall played in the league over the past two years? Hmm, ten years OK. And I'm sure 'Bother' would be able to enter a Milwall pub. In essence, a very poor film that people will like if they have little knowledge of real football and hooliganism. If you really love football and are fascinated by the hordes of hooliganism, you will simply feel like this movie has insulted your intelligence. Ross George
