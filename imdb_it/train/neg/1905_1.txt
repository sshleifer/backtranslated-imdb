I'm one of the biggest fans of dumb comedians and I've probably reviewed more Buster Keaton movies for IMDb than any other person. Every film you made from the beginning of your career until the early 1930s with only two exceptions I reviewed, so you can say I'm a big fan. This is why I found this episode so painful and difficult to watch. I loved this man's movies and I kept thinking "Buster, how could you ?!" Well, now that I think about it, I guess I can understand why Buster Keaton starred in this terrible episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE. He had lost much of his fortune after a disorderly divorce in the early 1930s and his film career as a protagonist had long since passed. Now, in the 1960s, Keaton needed the money and loved his popularity in rebirth, so he proclaimed himself with anyone who was willing to pay - appearing in the Beach movies and in this mess of an episode of a big series. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the episode is that it's written terribly and Buster deserved much better. The show should be fun but it is not and instead of a tribute to silent films it is painful to watch - in particular with Keaton who staged that stupid travel helmet in time and all the poorly executed farce. Do yourself a favor, SKIP THIS ONE - it's a pale imitation of the greatness that was once Keaton's career !!!
