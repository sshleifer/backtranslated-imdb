A previous review said that the film is not so bad. What?!?!?! The film glorifies child molestation. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was naked, so let's give 5 stars out of 10. Why not a whole 10? Since the filmography was "dying", the child's looks of shock were "unrealistic" and the fat friend was "irritating". Nowhere in the review does the reviewer express outrage at the fact that an American film in 1981 played scenes of a child having sex with an adult woman. I happened to take this steaming loaf of a movie while staying at a hotel that had Showtime. For me, even if the fat friend had acted on a storm and was worthy of an Oscar, I would still have had to give the film only 1 star. The fact that Howard Hessman of this television series starred in the film at the same time as he appeared in the WKRP is particularly ridiculous. But don't trust my word!
