OK, so Chuck Norris somehow found a way to get this product sequel. I have a question: why? Who read this script and said: "The sound is fantastic! Original!" This film is a regurgitated shit that wouldn't dull me with my gut. Obviously it's another story, following the tradition of MIA, Invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force and so on, in which Chuck Norris, of course, is the only man who can make America himself with some villains. Most of the time you don't even need a gun. It's a stupid patriotic jargon that stages the mind. Great surprise that the only one to direct these Norris films is Chuck's son, Eric. Eric Norris worked mainly on all his father's films and TV shows. Does this not affect anyone as a sign that he has no directing talent? After all, he directs the same people as before in the same stories as before ... the only difference is the names of the characters. If this should make me be patriotic and a fan of the United States, our country is in a much worse condition than I ever imagined. I hope this will be the nail in Chuck Norris's acting coffin.
