Carrie Fisher has stated on more than one occasion that she made this film during a period of her life when she had a serious cocaine problem, and doesn't remember much about it. This would explain why he made this film, but he doesn't explain why no one else in the cast or crew did; I can't believe EVERYONE had a coke problem. This must be one of the worst films ever made, and this is saying something. The fault cannot be attributed to the feet of the "director" Tim Kincaid or of the "writer" Buddy Giovinazzo, as it is obvious that this photo was not written or directed by anyone. Apparently it came together spontaneously, as there is little evidence of consistency, coherence, design, plot, sense, intelligence or anything else. What is really surprising is that there were some professionals who were involved in this glop. Co-star Robert Joy did a good job in other films, and composer Jimmie Haskell and filmmaker Arthur Marks are both industry veterans, Marks was also a director and not a bad guy. Because they were involved in this steaming pile of offal is beyond comprehension. Tim Kincaid, the alleged "director", has made quite a few cheap science fiction and horror films, and having seen most of them, I can tell you that not one of them is good. This, however, is by far the worst thing I've ever done, and this is an important achievement on his part. Everything, absolutely EVERYTHING, is in 12th place on this film - at most. The cinematography is terrible, the acting is ridiculous, the "special effects" make "Plan 9 From Outer Space" seem like "Spider-Man", the story is banal, derived and stupid. Don't waste your time even looking at the cover of the video box, let alone renting it. A complete, total, annoying, total disaster.
