After waking up at 3:30 am and not being able to go to sleep, I decided that I could be entertained while suffering from sleep deprivation. This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch it. What a mistake! <br /> <br /> Here's the plot (potential spoilers, if you're even interested): a neurotic man with a candy addiction (Josh Kornbluth) works as a temp for some ridiculous company. Suddenly, he is offered the chance to "go away", which seems to be the favorite phrase of this film. But with a safe job and a secure income at hand, Josh decides for any stupid reason he doesn't want to do it. He desperately challenges several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt. His inability to send several "very important" letters within a given period of time should be exhilarating, but it is simply stupid. Josh meets and deceives a woman lawyer and they end up in bed together (obviously a fantasy of Josh in real life, as such a thing would never happen). A lot of other things happen, but it's too trivial and insignificant to enter now. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film is classified as a comedy, I only laughed twice during the film; the first time was Josh Kornbluth's first shot (my initial reaction was a suffocating fear) and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman (yes, right). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying person I've ever seen in my life. He is an unattractive, overweight, and bald Jewish man who I should believe has sex with beautiful women. I do not share Josh's character at all. He is lazy and unmotivated and I do not appreciate the failed attempts at humor. Jump, even if your life depends on it.
