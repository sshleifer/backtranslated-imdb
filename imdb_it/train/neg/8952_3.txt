After listening to George Orwell's prophetic masterpiece all my life, I'm 37, but having never read the book, I'm totally confused about what I've just seen. <br /> <br /> I am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel, as I am sure most are, but only through rumors and quotations. Without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery, and even with it I am not even more educated on the history of 1984 than I was before seeing it. <br /> <br /> The positives. .. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is incredible, Hurt & Burton offers excellent performances and the general atmosphere of the film is wonderfully sad and desolate. The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark film. <br /> <br /> Now for the downsides, and there are many ... <br /> <br /> There is a war going on, (at least as far as propaganda goes), but why and with whom? Nothing is explained. There are a couple of banned names (Eurasia etc.), but they mean nothing without explanation. <br /> <br /> Who is Winston? what does he do? Where is he from? where he works? why is the news changing? why is it not at the forefront? Why don't you eat food in the cafeteria? What is that drink you are drinking throughout the movie? Why is he so weak and sick? Why didn't you brainwash like everyone else? What is the problem with his mother and sister? What happened to your father? A little past story would have been pretty, spotless, essential for those like me who haven't read the book. Without it, this is just a confusing and difficult to follow art film that keeps you constantly alert to what's going on. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was disjointed and badly modified and the constant chatter from the Big Brother screens flood the dialogue in places making it even more difficult to understand what is happening. I accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it is very annoying at the same time. <br /> <br /> Also, I know this has already been mentioned before, but why all the nudity? It seemed totally free and it looked like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage. <br /> <br /> Personally I can't tolerate the way Hollywood feels that it has to explain the words of the story lines for the word these days. We are not all simple idiots who have been brainwashed, but this is a little too far on the other side. I can only imagine that it is totally based on the fact that you have read the book because if this film is really the "literal translation" that I have seen many people say, I would find it very difficult to understand why 1984 was acclaimed as the classic is. <br /> <br /> There is no denying that they were light years ahead of his time and practically predicted every change in our society to date, (maybe this was some sort of bible for powers that are?), but many science fiction novelists have done the same without leaving holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> I think I need to do what I should have done from the beginning and buy a copy of the book if I have to make sense of it. <br /> <br /> All in all, very disappointed by something I've been waiting for years to watch.
