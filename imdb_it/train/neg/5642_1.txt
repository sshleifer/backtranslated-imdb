This title seems more like a movie shooting exercise that should have been published to be seen by the public. For Dafoe and his wife it must have been fun to work together in a film for the first time, without taking into consideration the fact that people could actually watch it. I felt like I had lost 90 minutes while I was waiting for the plot to develop, or even start. <br /> <br /> Try inserting this film into a genre and you won't, because there is no beginning, half or end. I've seen 'arty' movies before and this doesn't even come close to being arty, abstract or original, it just seems completely useless. <br /> <br /> I think you talk to yourself when the only people who rated this movie at 10 were the under-18s. No doubt due to the constant unnecessary erotic scenes that the film insisted on launching. This is if you can call it erotic. He certainly had no taste.
