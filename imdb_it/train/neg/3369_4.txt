Well, my God, I'm disappointed. When I first heard the news of a remake of Robert Wise's 1963 film, "The Haunting", I feared it would be ruined by an abundance of summer-sized visual effects. But, after all, I had faith. Surely, with such an intact talented cast ... De Bont and the company will not ruin a film, who is original was a fantastic and scary film that understood the delicate art of subtlety. Well, subtlety, where are you now !! ?? My fears came out ... a promising film went wrong. Yes, the scenography by Eugenio Zannetti is stunning; the film is beautifully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith will NEVER ever do wrong. But the script tests his talented actors ... asking them to make that kind of dialogue that is written only in movies. In the end, the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only interpreter to escape with a certain dignity ... and this is just it. But the crime of all crimes is that we are shown horror. We can no longer use our imagination, feel that horrible fear of fear of the unknown. No, we get some visual effects to show us what we should fear ... and you know what? How wonderfully made as they are ... visual effects turn out to be a kind of fool. And the climax is a phantasmagorical mess ... but things had gone terribly wrong much earlier. <br /> <br /> Everything in The Haunting is exaggerated and exaggerated. I fear there are no shivers or real squeaks in this old monstrosity of the haunted house ... only moans. Check the original instead. <br /> <br />
