Spoiler: group of passive-aggressive people with family reunification. The script tells them that they are doing things that people would never do, at least someone with a modicum of decency. The hero falls in love with a woman who sees his soul mate in a bookstore on the day of the meeting, unaware of being his brother's girlfriend during the meeting. He tries to postpone his brother's request, but she, knowing that our hero is clearly infatuated with her, teases him mercilessly wearing sexy clothes and acting like a stripper, rubbing his brother in an excuse of the ruse that she is showing how to stretch. At one point, she strips and takes a shower with him. Try to cover his eyes. His heart is breaking. He thinks it's funny, until he suddenly decides he doesn't want his brother and leaves the meeting. <br /> <br /> The film really drags on. The public coughed and fussed over the long term. The writing is unintelligent and incredible. We almost went out, but we kept thinking that something would happen that would revive things, but nooooo. All the good reviews must have been written by shillings to pay, to trick the poor Indians like me into seeing such shit. Comparing it to Little Miss Sunshine ??? Jeez. Shame on them, the screenwriters, the actors, the producers and the theaters for letting everything that is ugly come on the screen!
