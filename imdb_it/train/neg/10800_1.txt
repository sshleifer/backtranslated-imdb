What was the point of this film? What was the plot? I do not know. Shaq can't act, people don't know how to manage, and I'm Kazaam! A genius who kidnaps? Come on. Maybe Eminem or Linkin Park will be in a movie like this. I remember seeing him just to kill time. I didn't really care. I just remember thinking, "Who put Shaq in this movie ???" Even the whole story seemed stupid. It made absolutely no sense. I imagine an unrealized moral of this film is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen. I can't comment much more because this film is so terrible that there is nothing worth commenting on. "I would like" this film to go away.
