The film uses a cutting-edge title for a lame story. Kill Kill, it would have been nice. The film incorporates taboo scenes to bring the viewer back to the chairs. The scenes are useless and moves. The film is something that an inexperienced screenwriter could have evoked. Just a waste of movie props and money on the net. I have to write 10 lines of text to criticize this film when it's not worth 10 bars of my time, but I have to push to let people know about avoiding the sense. If people are counting on you to choose a good movie for movie night, choose something else. If you have a soul, do not damage it by subjecting yourself to this dirt.
