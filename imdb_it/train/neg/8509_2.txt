I saw this film for a variety of reasons, including Mira Sorvino. With her in the cast it couldn't be so bad. And he also seemed to have a bit of mystery and Olivier Martinez was her boyfriend at the time and he was pretty good at "Unfaithful". The plot is set in Spain, so it could be an exotic entertainment movie with one of my favorite actresses. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of the same thing, I warn you: this is really terrible, uninteresting, boring film. The only adjective that comes to mind is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The plot is created with secondary storylines that add nothing to the narrative. They try to build a slasher / thriller with a look at fascism in Spain, but they fail horribly. The plot twists have no credibility and the so-called investigation does not lead anywhere. <br /> <br /> The characters are very thin! I didn't care about anyone. More than that they are irritating and rather hateful people. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious. What is wrong with you? Why did you aim? You are an Oscar winner! Keep a little dignity! His character was weak but not an excuse for such a horrible performance. It seems to be sleepwalking throughout the film. Come to think of it, I really think that I saw his eyes slowly close in some scenes. I thought that woman was sexy. Well, she's not here. If you want to look at the skin, try Romi and Michelle because there's nothing to see here. And that accent? My god ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is also the worst. It is too painful to remember his interpretation to describe it here. I'm sorry but I can not. Ive suffered enough with this garbage. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is depressing! It is so ugly in every way that it is a wonder how it was done. A lousy team to produce a horrible script and earn money for the actor's name. Don't fall in love. <br /> <br /> Avoid it! <br /> <br />
