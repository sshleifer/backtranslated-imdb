Whatever happened to the British TV drama? From John Major to Tony Blair, the core of the genre seems to have moved from social realism to fabulous stories centered on women about the domestic problems of small middle-class professionals. <br /> <br /> (Or maybe TVNZ doesn't 'Buy the good things? Please let it be what it is ...) <br /> <br /> The writer's long career in soap probably explains because the dialogue is mainly composed of stale clich√©s. Niamh Cusack's performance is strong on significant looks, each of which supports the director for at least half a dozen longer beats than they deserve. Baleful's looks, however, are a bad substitute for the depth of the character, if the writer failed to provide this material for the actors to work with. <br /> <br /> Obviously this is theoretically a thriller, about a murder investigation; but it is not as important as the bankrupt marriage of the central character and its related problems. Is the husband of Cusack's character a complete bastard? Will your child be completely traumatized by the dissolution of the marriage? Making these themes central is not a sign of intuition - it indicates a profoundly narcissistic identification of the writer and director with a character who should go on with his work. <br /> <br /> Lynda La Plante knows how to write this stuff so that it feels like it counts and involves viewers other than the housebound neurotics; Apparently Paula Milne is not up to the task.
