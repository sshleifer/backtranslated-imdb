It is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life, but changed things to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives have beautiful models and have no problems catching them. You look more like a millionaire filmmaker than a detective than a detective, do you? The entire film was written by Peter, and shows that he was not in contact with real people. You should write what you know, and did it, really. And it leaves the public bored and confused, and jealous, after all. This is a curiosity for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was killed right after the shoot. But Patti Hanson, who would have married, in real life, Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is much better and has a larger part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. It doesn't have much to do with the story, which is rather complicated to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is someone with whom very few people can relate, unless you are a millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful top models invoked by you. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snoring festival. This is what happens when you are out of the world. Entertain your few friends with internal jokes and bore everything else.
