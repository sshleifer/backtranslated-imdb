And some more "no" ones. Voodoo Academy is, without a doubt, the least ambitious film of all time. What exactly are you trying to do? Tell a story? Obviously not; as has been pointed out, most are just little legal boys who rub themselves. Could it therefore be an attempt at subversive homoeroticism? Well, maybe, except for the fact that it never goes beyond the most harmless and non-threatening forms of male contact. (Which is, to anyone's delight, repeated about eighty thousand times.) Well, it's kind of a horror movie; are you trying to scare us? No, unless the director intended to do it through tedium and the emptiness of his "work". <br /> <br /> I never liked a film less in my life. This is the most boring and useless thing I've ever seen. It is as if the Voodoo Academy took the genres of horror films, zombies and gays, put them in a grinder, then passes them through a coffee filter - only instead it is the type of coffee filter that filters the coffee beans, it is the type that eliminates everything that is vital, angular or otherwise interesting. The result is 74 minutes of exciting movies like a glass of warm water - only without the ability to rehydrate you after 10 days of gin binging that will inevitably hit you if you observe this abomination of human effort.
