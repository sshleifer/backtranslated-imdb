Slow and riddled with inaccuracy. Over-looking its flaws this is still an interesting account of Alamo's famous and heroic siege during Texas' struggle for independence from Mexico. James Arness as Jim Bowie. Brian Keith as Davy Crockett. Alec Baldwin in the role of Col. Travis. Raul Julia in the role of General Santa Anna. This TV project also features David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler. Excellent original music by Peter Bernstein.
