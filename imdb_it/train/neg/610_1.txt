I bought this movie cheaply in a sale, after reading the back of the DVD case and assuming that in both cases I can't lose, if it was rubbish then no loss, if it was good then bargain ... <br / > <br /> Then I looked at it ... <br /> <br /> I'm normally a fan of Christopher Walken, but in this film he commanded very little presence on the screen, seeming not to do much, even the death of the his close friend at the beginning who unleashes "action" in the plot seems to interest him very little, and his eventual revenge is boring and not very dramatic. <br /> <br /> Normally a film that has themes such as the revolution and revenge are able to capture the public and trap them in trying something for the characters, however watching this film was more like seeing a series of confusing, almost random events that are linked to each other at the final conclusion ... <br /> <br /> At this point I cried ... <br /> <br /> I thought this film was the most horribly painful piece of vision that I had The scene in which the pilot sacrifices himself by refusing to jump out of the truck loaded with explosives because of not wanting to kill any civilian is not so tragically sad as dangerously horrible and painful, even if not as bad as emergency surgery on the injured girl. The acting was poor in the round, the script and the story were weak, the "action" was even weaker, and the "images" were not visual at all. To summarize there are films that do well, bad movies, movies that are so bad that are good, movies that are terrible ... <br /> <br /> And then on a whole new level is "McBain"
