Isabelle Huppert is a wonderful actor. The director of "The Pianist" understands it, providing the viewer with long lines of Huppert's face, and these are a pleasure to see. Huppert is not an animated actor - he records the emotion with the smallest of an eyebrow or the flicker of a smile. <br /> <br /> In addition to the pleasure of watching an experienced actor excel in his profession, there is nothing in this film makes me want to recommend it. (Well, if you like self-mutilation, sado-masochism and bizarre behavior, "La Pianiste" might work for you. Besides these attributes, I didn't find any ransom value in it.) <Br / > <br /> Buried in all this strange material, there is a core of truth. The people who compete at the highest levels - musically, athletically, whatever - start off as strange people, and are shaped into strangers by the competitive environment. <br /> <br /> It's not worth going to a cinema to re-learn this life lesson. <br /> <br />
