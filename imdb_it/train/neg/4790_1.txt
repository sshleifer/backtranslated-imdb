I hated this movie. The original Phantasm had such a wonderful atmosphere and mystery. Like many horror films of the 70s, it seemed and looked like a disturbing and incomplete documentary. Phantasm II, since the end of the 80s, has enhanced the action, but has kept this beautiful attention to mood. Unfortunately, Phantasm III is simply horrible. He tediously explains all the strange events in the previous films, which diminish instead of expanding their power. He shamelessly forgets the images of the first Phantom as an economic re-enactment of the original. There are so many flying spheres in this film that they seem more parasitic than families than threatening spheres of death. Hundreds hang from the ceiling like Christmas balls swaying in the air current. Had anyone, the general manager, the director of photography, the publisher, the director, ever noticed or worried that they were so poor? Worse still, Phantasm III presents a banal and not funny joke after another. It is different from the intensity of the first film. The original Phantom used humor to alleviate his incessant attention to death. Phantasm III uses death to invent innumerable cheap jokes about Reggie's greed: many refer to the "flying balls" of the film ha-ha, oh I understand, balls. Perhaps the crew enjoyed these jokes, but they are on us.
