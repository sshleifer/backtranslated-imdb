For years and years ago (so it was reported) this television meeting of two of the most beloved characters in the history of the sitcom started badly - and from there it went straight downhill. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) meet in New York after a long departure and meet each other. What an original concept! But sad to report, it is worth nothing to talk about (let alone make a movie about) happened to one of them in later years. So, instead, the script merely launches an old and old storyline device after another (most older women in the workplace), while the charm and refinement that made the original show a winner is completely missing . The supporting cast is immediately forgettable, the humor is non-existent and the chemistry that Moore and Harper have had together is gone. Moore allegedly blocked this project for years, waiting for "just the right script" before committing. If this was what she considered "right", what the hell were those she refused? It is not the age of the characters to do so (for the inevitably marching time), but the almost total lack of imagination combined with a clear disregard for the elements that made the series functional. At one time this was intended as a pilot but, obviously, it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors. Or for that matter, in a potential audience. Quickly and mercifully forgotten, the film is a parody and an insult to a classic.
