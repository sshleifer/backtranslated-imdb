"Gray Matter" AKA "The Brain Machine" but the videos have thought better; the screen says 1972 but IMDb says 1977; it's that kind of movie. The government has a sort of priority interest in this "brain machine" project that has sketched four people - which turn out to be, roughly, a philosopher, a horny priest, a burst veteran and a patriot who has aborted a small room with a computer that can read their hideous secret thoughts. Eventually the government takes control of the lab by force and everyone dies. Here is a film that is incompetent in every important way; MY s *** has better production values ​​than this. I was interested, however, only to see what exactly these exploitative filmmakers thought they were doing, reveling in the drama of the characters of four boys in a room. The answer: a treatise on how science is inferior to God. Many thanks. It's like opening a Kinder egg and getting your 30th damned puzzle. The priest is played by James "Roscoe P. Coltrane" Best, Gerald's philosopher "Republican Simon" McRaney. Moreover, with very, very, very long and large quantities of transition and transition shots, this movement is almost as slow as the liberal convention.
