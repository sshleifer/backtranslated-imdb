This story speaks of the romantic triangle between another. A prostitute of African origin, a French transsexual prostitute (Stephanie) and a Russian waiter who does not speak French and never seems to shave. <br /> <br /> As a film it is boring, sad and depressing, shot over foggy, overcast winter days or in poorly lit interiors, where everyone is immersed in a strange blue glow. And yes, I know, it's because the white balance was out. Everyone is pale and dejected and looks haggard, unkempt and dirty. The bodies are bony and shot in that first floor that look pretty ugly and unattractive. Moles, greasy hair. How disgusting. Bad news in a movie where people spend a lot of time naked or having sex. <br /> <br /> And the story? Well, Stephanie's mother is dying. All three characters return to Stephanie's home village, where, through a series of flashbacks to desolate, bleak countryside and interiors, we see some of Stephanie's childhood as a boy named Pierre. The mother dies. Well ... and that's it, really. The character development is minimized, as is the epilogue of the story. <br /> <br /> I suppose the plot is not linear (it would explain a lot of non-sequences) but in reality, after paying my seven euros, I don't feel like having to build the film myself: that's what the director I take my money Waiting to join the narrative process and get my hands dirty, so to speak, is asking too much. <br /> <br /> This film is a pile of pretentious garbage made, above all, by the desire of epater les bourgeois (or shocking straights). I can see how it was a shoo-in for the Berlin Film Festival, and I can see why it didn't come from anywhere.
