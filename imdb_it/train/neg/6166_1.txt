I do not recommend this film, because it is inaccurate and misleading, this story had to be in the Berber Algerian territory, this was shot in the southern Tunisian desert, (a completely different culture, I know they are from Tunisia and Algeria), the other shocking element is he was the character of his companion aunt, he speaks in the film with a very eloquent French French academic, while the character he played should be of a disorder never left his mountain character, so to live like a Bedouin with that kind of education that that context is impossible, The most shameful and disrespectful scene especially for the people of the region is the "femme repudiee" segment which is a pure invention of the writer / director, things like those that will never happen in an Algerian society ever !!!
