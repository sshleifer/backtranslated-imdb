I saw this not knowing almost nothing about it, apart from the brief description I read here. After seeing it, I was going to say that the director shows promises but he looks a little amateur, then I looked at the other things he did to see if this was his first or second film, but no, he did House on Haunted Hill and Fear Dot Com. He almost lost the mark on both of those films and was the same with this one. <br /> <br /> The story was really terrible, could anyone fall in love with a girl because she's cute but has a child's mind? I gave it a 3 because there were some visual elements that I liked in the end but overall this movie is pretty awful.
