You can't resist this too much, knowing it was done in four days and I expected it to be camped anyway. (That's not all you campy in reality. With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who don't take themselves seriously, the rest of the cast plays halfway, Riley Smith is exceptionally bad.) The ridiculous story is actually paid for attention to, what kind of shocked me; I thought the whole purpose of these very low-budget horror films was to satisfy the lowest sexual fantasies and they didn't give a damn about the story, but they use many words like "technological" and "physicality" in the script to get the their point of view. (Although it is possible that the story is important only to explain why there are so few cast members.) No one cares about this stupid plot, and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mocking of sects and soft homoeroticisms. core (which are not so sharp). I would have liked it better if there were only a few random murders for no reason. The film is grainy, with an appearance of TV quality and level of acting. There are some "sexy" scenes that go well - the boys squirm in bed in their boxers, feeling upright; or be tied up and make orgasmic faces while the wine is poured over them - and some of them are pretty funny. I liked the excavations of L. Ron Hubbard and the irony of a story about religious cultists told in intense gay tones, but it's still not a good idea. 3/10
