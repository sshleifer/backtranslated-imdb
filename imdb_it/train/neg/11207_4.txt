As an avid fan of George McDonald Fraser's Flashman books, I couldn't wait to see Flashy on the big screen when this film was first released. Unfortunately it was a huge disappointment, so I left him alone for 20 years before looking at him again, but it wasn't the second time. Mr. Fraser is a remarkably skillful writer, but I'm not a fan of his film script with Richard Lester. The inclination for slapstick has ruined "The Three Musketeers" for me and the same is true here. For me, the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong. Flashman books are incredibly fun, but they are adventure novels. There is a lot of seriousness in the way that the adventures that Flashman has - after all, is involved in dangerous situations. This is conveyed in the novels, but not broadcast on the film at all due to its comic style. It's a pity that he could have a great film if it was a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book. When I first read that the film had to be shot, the article said the film would star in Oliver Reed. I rejoiced, as Reed for me was the epitome of Flashman. How I wanted to see him in the role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but he doesn't adapt to the visual image of Flashman created by the books (too thin!) Flashman should be a great companion. Neverheless Reed was excellent as Bismarck. What kills the film is that it is made like a comedy. The only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills de Gautet (Tom Bell). A great pity, given that production values, costumes, sets, etc. They are superb and the casting is generally excellent - almost everyone in the film is quite distinct from Malcolm McDowell. Perhaps the direction of Richard Lester was responsible for the way the film is, since a recent radio adaptation of "Flash For Freedom", adapted by Mr. Fraser, worked quite well. Maybe one day we could see Flashman doing justice on the screen.
