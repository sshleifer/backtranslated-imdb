I admit that most of this film was not inspired, but I was still amused. It has a wonderful sense of frantic energy, above average music, and the women in the film proudly defend themselves, there are no girls here. I can think of dozens of other films that were much worse, at least this had an intriguing storyline along with some social comments. They allude to how the military deals with viral epidemics, destroy everything in sight, even if it means that you people are supposed to be saving. Furthermore, how dangerous martial law can be as democracy ceases to exist at that point. Fulci seemed to be trying to combine his previous work (zombies, beyond the gates of hell) in an attempt to improve on them in some way. He failed, but surely not miserably, as a number of people would think. I have a weakness for zombie movies, so I admit I'm a little biased when it comes to reviewing them. All I am saying is that this film is good for once, if there was not such a great descendant in the making of this film (quit quills and brown (I can hack the best of them) mattei took over) it may have been much better and more concentrated. It will remain in my collection like the song of the zombie swans of fulci. A surprising note, is that there is a scene in zombie 3 that the cemetery man actually robbed me, I couldn't believe it myself, take a look that you'll be surprised.
