I had high hopes for Troy and I am so bitterly disappointed. The film was directed so badly that it hurt my stomach. The pace was so slow, the dialogue ridiculous and the film - well beyond a beautiful fight scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was superficial. <br /> <br /> And why, oh, why? Hollywood always insists on rewriting stories to adapt to "consumer approval". Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris OUTSIDE the walls of Troy with an arrow on his ankle! It annoys me that such a classic story like this has become a soap. <br /> <br /> And he hasn't even started talking about the "lack" of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was the woman to whom the war had been fought and it didn't even seem to them that they cared much about each other. No spark, no emotion, no hope. <br /> <br /> I must say that in the defensive film Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O 'Toole played very well with a bad script, but it's not enough to save this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me where the Â£ 200m budget went? Perhaps in all the trees they used for funeral pyres - where did they get all those trees? <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed that it hurts.
