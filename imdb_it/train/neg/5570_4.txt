valorizziamolo. <br /> <br /> entertainment: a trash script that has been typed by unintelligent people in front of typewriters a thousand times ... a pathetic acting that is hampered by history ... OK production value, including good set / location and beautiful girl .. -rating 4/10 <br /> <br /> social message: the film has no social messages. it is thought free ... but if I pretend to have 10, and my intelligence quotient was 70. I feel that the message is: don't be afraid to love? -rating 0/10 <br /> <br /> questionable things: nothing special, just the mild hedonistic and arrogant attitude that is presented by the writer / director. in general, good, nothing degenerate -8/10 <br /> <br /> the overall rating is 4/10
