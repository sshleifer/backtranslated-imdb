"I'm a cartoon!" "You're an illustration!" what does this mean ?! This plot could not be worse since a boy, who is afraid of everything, becomes very brave at the end of the film because he entered a library. The sole purpose of this celluloid waste was to encourage American children to read, when a cheaper and more effective way of doing this could be a series of advertisements! Even the talents of Macaulay Culkin (like the child), Christopher Lloyd (like the so predictable "who is a Page Master librarian"), could save this useless film from the boring plot. Even the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, (also) Leonard Nimoy, or the God of Hollywood voices, Frank Welker as the cartoon characters never save him. I can only describe it as an equivalent of the 1990s to the terrible adaptation of the 1978 Water Babies, because the bland animation makes the film worse, without improving the boring plot!
