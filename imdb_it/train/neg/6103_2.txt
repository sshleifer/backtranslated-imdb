To be honest, I am surprised by the positive ratings this film has received. The film only drags its 81 minutes of life, and the public has to endure the whole journey. In reality there are some positive moments in this film; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. She is given a nice pathetic dialogue and handles it quite well. Scott Valentine (Merrideth's boyfriend in Family Ties), on the other hand, is a pretty tough watch. I imagine that the highlight of his performance is to witness the boy lying on the beach wearing tiger-shaped teas .... give me a break. Moreover, Valentine gives us a crude and pathetic portrait of a suffering vampire who misses the day (to see a much more convincing version of the suffering vampire see Denice Duff in "Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4"). The film moves so slowly and is only positively punctuated by, and to be honest, Charlie Spradling's dance scenes. This film can honestly be recommended only to the tough Charlie Spradling fans (which I am, and I still had a bad time watching it!).
