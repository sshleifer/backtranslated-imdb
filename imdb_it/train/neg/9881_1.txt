Did Bo Derek's debut film remain invisible for eight years? and that's how it should stay! John Derek was a competent actor but, as a director, is he practically the Ed Wood of erotic cinema ?? Not that this is particularly explicit, considering that Bo (atypically sporting dark hair) was only 16 when the film was made! John also wrote and photographed; the second translates into some decent shots of the setting of the Greek island against which the narration is set ?? but the plot is childish and the dialogue atrocious! <br /> <br /> The character played by the male protagonist Peter Hooten grew up with Bo's family: they grew up as brothers and sisters but, now in their teenage years, the couple discovers they are attracted to each other ( but, as I said, don't expect any sexual fireworks!). Still, the worst thing is the fact that the protagonists have an obsession for the whole film that they are not just fools in themselves but irritating in their inexorability ?? Hooten wants to transform the community of fishermen at a distance into a modernized sea resort and continues to think that a cruise ship will appear in sight (which, of course, is done in the final); Derek's is even more crazy ?? she craves the possession of a large and ancient bathtub !! For the record, the couple is married by the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Also involved in non-events are the mayor of the female city and a lotharian photographer who wants to make a model for Bo (and which, of course, incurs the wrath of the jealous Hooten). Occasionally, for no good reason, we are even treated for fragments by showing old Hollywood classics in an outdoor cinema that assembles the whole city (among the titles shown is THE PUBLIC ENEMY [1931])! At the end of the day, while Bo's ingenuity is undeniably fascinating, it's not enough to make up for the dullness and dilettantism of the film.
