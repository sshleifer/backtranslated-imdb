=== minor spoilers === <br /> <br /> I am, like many others, a big fan of Jerry Bruckheimer. So when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging in front and the trailer passing in front of MI: 2, expectations were increasing. A production by Jerry Bruckheimer. Big machines. Nic Cage is fresh from an Oscar - Angelina Jolie. What could go wrong? A lot. <br /> <br /> The script is neither fun (which is really hard to be looking for) nor exciting. You put a black person who constantly makes racist jokes about himself and Wooh-haa !! do you have a play? I don't think so. Excitement is totally off the field. First of all (and this is probably said many times) there are no sympathetic characters so who cares who gets killed? If you can bear the premise that a psychopath will kill Nic's brother unless you steal 50 cars in 4 days, the next thing you know is that Kip (his brother) is walking with Nic in the streets again. Is this excitement? Don't think Then the best part comes: the love story between Nic and Angelina. Seems really bored having to utter all these stupid sentences to Nic. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' "Do you see anyone?" 'What went wrong?' etc. <br /> <br /> Then there is only a spark of hope: the car chases. They are disappointing to say the least, because the trailer made it look like it was full of them, and there is only one. A very long one, caught by a disturbing and frenetic camera movement. I really had trouble following the action. <br /> <br /> So it's an action movie? a thriller? a romantic comedy? - No need to decide, just avoid this horrible mess. I will give 3 stars out of 10, and I feel like I'm generous.
