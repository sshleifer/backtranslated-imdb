** NOTICE: POSSIBLE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> If you can get away with the extremely unpleasant argument, this film offers an enormous amount of outrageously campy melodrama. Surprisingly, this film has been copied and ripped several times over the years, although it is difficult to understand that ANY filmmaker was inspired by this trash drama. None of Hemingway's women can act here (although Mariel HAS has improved over the years), Anne Bancroft offers the only touch of class in a prosecutor, and Chris Sarandon is sometimes pathetic and unintentionally exhilarating as the wicked, skinny bad boy of the piece. <br /> <br /> The veteran Lamont Johnson cannot derive a silk purse from the ear of a screenplay sow, which is chock full of terribly ugly dialogues and bizarre situations. For example, the final sequence, in which Margaux grabs his rifle and chases Sarandon after his last shocking act was thought to be exciting, but instead elicited hearty laughter. Add a notoriously acute and ghostly soundtrack to Michel Polnareff and you have a real guilty pleasure, even if you are likely to feel dirty and need a hot shower after seeing it. Don't say you haven't been warned.
