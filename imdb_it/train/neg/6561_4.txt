The opening sequence should show the Legion arriving in Paris on November 13, 1918. Troops mass on the train - wearing the uniform in which the French army, including the Legion, marched into the war in 1914! This is a sure sign that the war shot you are about to see will be a turkey. (The French army, in 1915, realized that going to war with red pants and dark blue coats did not work, the French metropolitan troops were put on "blue horizon" and the colonial troops were put on khaki.) Claude Van-Damme ( sp?) the remake has at least the uniforms more or less in place. It's really too bad when directors make these kinds of mistakes when they do everything they can to get other things right.
