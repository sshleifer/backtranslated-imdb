A story of Cinderella made for adults who live in the world of dreams. The love story is very unrealistic, fluttery, lovey dovey, perfect etc. The plot of Cinderella to the end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you are looking for a dream love story with an extra touch, this is definitely your movie, but for the rest of us real-world people, I highly recommend you save your three hours of viewing. Awake! <br /> <br /> Four of the five people who saw the movie with me wouldn't recommend the movie. We had a lot of fun dominating most unrealistic scenes. Maybe I'm missing something .. I can't believe a movie like this can beat a classic like HDDCS !!
