I couldn't wait to see Dreamgirls for a while ... with all its enthusiastic reviews, nominations and media attention. And I must say that the first quarter of the film was good! At that time it really represented the black music scene. However, as the film went on, all my family and I were bored by our wits. The singing kept coming, one after the other. I mean seriously, just another number of music and it would have been broken even with RENT. <br /> <br /> Also, I noticed very little character development in any of the characters; I just don't care what happened to him! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died of an overdose, I knew I should have been sad, but I couldn't feel any emotion for that character. The characters were given an inconsistent background about singing in their childhood and whatever, but not enough personalities were revealed to involve me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the conflict was not significant enough to make the viewer attentive, which goes hand in hand with the lack of character development. This film reminded me of a cat-script movie based on Ray, Chicago and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful films in my opinion). Overall, I think this film is the most suitable for someone who doesn't care about an overall story, but who could enjoy two hours of fun and funny singing shows.
