I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules: This movie is crazy! From acting to unrealistic animation to countless mistakes. In reality I was hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a touch of imagination (it is not possible to extend the flaps without motors). The landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity. That little fan that went was not enough to extend the cart. The only thing I thought was somewhat peculiar is when they landed, the rear wheels lowered and then the nose stopped, suspending the plane with both rear tires in the air. How did the captain apply the right and left brakes to tires that did not touch the ground? Have they forgotten the spoilers? Word to the director: discover * everything * on planes before trying a "plane" movie. Sorry for the technical rant, but I give this movie 1/10.
