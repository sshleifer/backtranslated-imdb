This is without a doubt the worst film ever that Steven Seagal has ever made. And this says a lot. Don't let the judgment fool you, it's too good. This abomination was not even worthy of a 0/10 grade, if such a thing existed. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no storyline <br /> <br /> - Worst action scenes ever, and there aren't too many either <br /> <br /> - Seagal doesn't do it anyway what, including fights, speeches (many dubbing) and so on. As always. <br /> <br /> - Seagal is fat, lazy and couldn't care less about this movie. Something that is very obvious all the way through <br /> <br /> Take all the other DTV junk movies that Seagal has made, multiply them together, multiply them by a thousand billion and all the wickedness that is then conquered. '1% of this absolute worse.
