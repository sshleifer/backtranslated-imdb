Mona, the tramp, lives on the fringes of French society, in a life without meaning, purpose or direction. I saw this because of all the stellar reviews, but I'm afraid I lost something. The character of Mona has little or no personality while adrift through life is rude to people, rises and does not contribute to anyone's life. She is not interesting or exciting. It's just useless. <br /> <br /> I have seen and known enough such people: there is no secret meaning to what they are doing. They are just lazy wanderers. I wouldn't want Mona anywhere near me, because he tends to steal everything that isn't nailed and leave his friends in the lurch. Of course it's enigmatic - because there's nothing for her. A lot of junkies, winos and bums I've seen are enigmatic; I wouldn't even want to see a movie about them. <br /> <br /> Maybe there is something that I totally missed. Otherwise I suppose all the reviews come from people who assume that anything made by a French director is a high level art.
