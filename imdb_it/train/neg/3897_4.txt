The comedy labored has I.R.S. agent Tony Randall investigating the eccentric Maryland farming family that never paid taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the daughter of the tomboy farmer who puts the grip on the not-so-disinterested tax-man. Debbie certainly did her share of lower theatrical sitcoms during this time - and this is no better or worse than the rest. The image starts brightly but ends halfway, becoming hectic and dull. Randall is not a bad game for Reynolds, but the vehicle itself defeats chemistry. Based on the novel "The Darling Buds of May" by H.E. Bates, with a poor sound mix that makes all the actors play like they're stuck in an echo chamber. ** from ****
