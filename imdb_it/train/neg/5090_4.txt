<br /> <br /> Regardless of whether any accusation was intended, it must be taken into consideration. If in 2000 there were still splits in feelings between Caucasians and African Americans in Georgia, as shown in this film, of course it remains a somewhat backward mentality among many people out there. It's rather hypocritical, to say the least, if everyone loves Halle Berry, Whoopie Goldberg, Beyonc√©, Noemi Campbell, Denzel Washington, Will Smith, et. al., while outside in the back part evident racial divisions persist. <br /> <br /> The white grandmother suddenly becomes black, a granddaughter pushed on her, only to meet with her black grandfather in a very white social backwater. The story is sweet, it does not lack tragic nuances and is predictably predictable as in most of these TV movies, even if the final scene has guessed ............ will it? it will not be .......? <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands in her typical style offers a sincere rendering, and Louis Gossett is a good companion for her; little Penny Bae fortunately does not steal the show. <br /> <br /> A nice way to relax after Sunday lunch without having to force your mind too much, although you may find yourself taking a siesta in the middle.
