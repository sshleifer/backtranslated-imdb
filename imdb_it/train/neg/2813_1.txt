Normally I would never have rented a movie like this because you know it will be ugly just by looking at the box. I rented seven films simultaneously, including Nightmare on Elm Street 5, 6 and Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I got home I found out that the videostore gave me the wrong tape. In the box of Wes Craven's New Nightmare I found this lame film. <br /> <br /> This film is incredibly boring, the acting is bad and the plot makes no sense. It's hard to write a good review because I have no idea what the movie really was. At the end of the film you have more questions and answers. <br /> <br /> On "Max Power's Scale of 1 to 10" I consider this movie: 1 <br /> <br /> PS I would like to correct the Corinthian review (right below mine). He says that Robert Englund is ripping underwear, riding horses, etc. The guy who did those things was Mahmoud, played by Juliano Mer, not by Robert Englund.
