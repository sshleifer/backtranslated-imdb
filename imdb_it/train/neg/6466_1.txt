Marlon Brando had long since lost interest in acting when he shot this film. His performance of "The Swede" is the worst of his career, and that's exactly what he meant. He does not overdo it. Instead, he simply acts bizarre and teases his awkward womb. The scene in which Brando climbs over the toilet is probably the worst fun moment in film history. While we see him fall into a toilet, it's hard to believe we're looking at the same actor who starred in A Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront and The Godfather. <br /> <br /> I guess the real question is why Marlon behaved this way in his last years. Was he fed up with the world of cinema? Did he just like to freak out completely? I guess we'll never know. But this film is a fascinating study of what bad acting is. <br /> <br /> In that note, look at fellow veteran acting Donald Sutherland as he struggles to free himself from his lines, embarrassed with himself for agreeing to participate in this parody.
