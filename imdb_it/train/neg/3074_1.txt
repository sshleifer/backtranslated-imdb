This is a pathetic one for 1980 cocaine. I don't understand why someone would waste celluloid, time, effort, money and brain cells of the public to make such a racket. If you're going to make a comedy, make it fun. If you want to film the garbage like this, keep it for yourself. If you're going to release it as a joke like this: DON'T !!! I mean, it was a joke, right? Someone, please tell me it was a joke. please.
