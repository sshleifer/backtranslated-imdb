I'm a good guy and I like to think of myself as tolerant of the genre. And, I suppose, I mean that I try to consider a film in the context of the genre in which it resides. If nothing else, this saves me from feeling like I have to say really unpleasant things about people or movies, which I don't like doing. <br /> <br /> The plot of this was patently obvious, the production values ​​very low and set, um, simplistic. From time to time, acting turned into "good for a high school" territory. My feeling is that it was shot in one day - please tell me it was. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, sex, although quite abundant, was fairly trivial, hampered, at least in my copy, by a "sound-over" that was inconsistent with the action (climatic moans and squeals while lying on a bed undoing a bra ???). There was absolutely no "advantage" at all - nothing special or interesting, and surprisingly fast cuts. <br /> <br /> My vote is a "1" then, with the following summary statement: it would have been better if the filler filler material in the club was expanded, and the rest of the film condensed.
