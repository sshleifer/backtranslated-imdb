After seeing a dozen episodes, I decided to give up this show since it unrealistically describes what mathematical modeling is. In the episodes in which Charlie predicted the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models, I thought my profession was the subject of jokes. I'm not a mathematician, but a chemical engineer, but I work a lot with mathematical models. So I will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to the "fiction" of fairy tales. <br /> <br /> First of all, choosing the right model to predict a situation is a challenging task. Charlie Eppes is shown as a genius, but he too should spend a lot of time looking for a suitable model, especially to try to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future. Individuals are irregular and random, there is no model for them. Isacco Asimov also wrote about it in the 1950s. Even if there were a model for a specific type of individual, it would be a probabilistic (stoic) one, which means that he has a good chance of making a wrong prediction. <br /> <br /> Second, assuming that the right model for someone or a situation is found, the model's parameters must be known. These parameters are the constants of equations, such as the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m / s2), and are often not easy to determine. Again, Charlie Eppes should be someone beyond genius to know the correct parameters for the model he chooses. And after choosing the model and the parameters, they should be tested. Strangely, they are not, and by a miracle, they fit exactly into the predicted situation. <br /> <br /> Third, a very important aspect of modeling is almost always overlooked, not only by Numbers, but also by sci-fi movies: the computational effort required to solve these models. Try to make Excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and you will find yourself doing a Herculean job. Even though Charlie Eppes has the right software to fix his models, he could be stuck with hardware that will be terribly slow. And even with the right software / hardware combination, the model's solution could take days to reach. Solve them immediately! I could use his computer in my research work, I would be very happy. <br /> <br /> As a drama, it is far from being the best show. The characters are somewhat stereotyped, but nowhere near as amusing as those of the Big Bang theory. Crimes are boring and the way Charlie Eppes solves them sometimes makes the FBI look rather incompetent. <br /> <br /> For some laymen, the show could work. For others, the way things are handled makes it difficult to digest!
