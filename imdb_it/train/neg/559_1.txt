I saw this movie at the London Premiere, and I have to say - I didn't expect much, but I was expecting something that was at least slightly fun. <br /> <br /> The original "Basic Instinct" was not a great film and is still something of a "classic smog" but it was fun. I can remember countless times by browsing the TV channels late Friday or Saturday night after discovering the film and finding myself starting to actually pay attention to it. <br /> <br /> However, this lame-brain, delayed waaay-sequel has nothing. Is Sharon Stone still beautiful? Well, let's say this: for a 47-year-old woman, she's pretty sexy. Is she as beautiful as she is in the original? No. He also clearly had plastic surgery on his face, and his haircut in this film is rather unattractive. It doesn't look as soft, genuine or innocent as it did in the original - which is a bit like being a bad seductress, and so on. <br /> <br /> The rest of the performances range from bad to terrible - and Michael Caton-Jones (a typically confident director - one who doesn't always do a great job but makes films worthy of note) has officially delivered the his first real turkey; a film of such bad people who laughed at certain moments that should have been serious. <br /> <br /> I have heard that the film has undergone multiple editing sessions, and it is clear from the beginning. Nothing makes much sense. The whole plot is a cosmic disaster and the ending - oh my! Let's talk about stupid AND incredible. (Still predictable though.) I saw "Gigli", I saw "Son of the Mask" - and even though I'm not trying to "smear" this film, I can say with my own authority (that I disagree with all, it is clear, that I prefer both those films to this catastrophic failure. <br /> <br /> By the way, Stone left five minutes before the film started and the theater people started throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and offensive scene in an orgy-type disco. <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" - after all, it also smells.
