The clich√© Polynesian males drink, fight and make a stream of sexist, stupid and not funny comments. Real life Polynesians are much more fun than these stereotypical cardboard characters. The alleged Samoan girl did not watch or play Samoan at all, she looked more like the white female having sex with someone on a whim. With weak lines like water, nothing can be said about acting - even the brightest actors could do nothing with this script. It is sad to see Polynesian actors willing to recite such sad stereotypes in a film with a bad scene, and only two or three "lines". What a waste of Kiwi taxpayers' money, what a lost opportunity to make a great film about a vibrant community. It is better not to make films if they are so bad and senseless.
