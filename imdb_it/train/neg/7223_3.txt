My first attempt at vision ended in 8 minutes, roughly after the scene of the television report, which I could not manage. It went roughly like this: <br /> <br /> Reporter 1: Hmm, there's a pyramid in our skies. Reporter 2: I think they are aliens. * embarrassing silence * Reporter 1: In other news ... <br /> <br /> A few days later I watched it until the end, and it wasn't as horrible as I imagined, but there are serious problems with this. About half of the plot can be easily discarded. And the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something. <br /> <br /> What is the use of the detective, the people of eugenics and the monsters that are temporarily put aside by Horus? The monopoly scene was more fun. "We are all powerful" gods ", who have lived for eons, and of all the games in the multiverse that we played at the monopoly". Monopoly? Monopoly?! Erich von Dainiken also seems consistent with respect to that. <br /> <br /> The other half is terribly lacking. What did our protagonist do to freeze? Why wasn't there a big event when it was finally released? He had those annoying followers, remember? What happened to normal humans? What is the agreement with the masked boy? How did the blue-haired girl look? What's in his sight? Etcetera, etc. <br /> <br /> Visually it's okay, more or less, if you ignore the Egyptian gods that look like walking clubs with rotweiller heads.
