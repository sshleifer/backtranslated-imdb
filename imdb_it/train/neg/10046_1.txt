I wasn't very impressed with Dante's offer for the first season in "Homecoming", it wasn't a very horror story, but rather an intelligent political statement with the undead. The situation of Screwfly is the story of a virus unleashed in the world that causes the sexual drive of men to be replaced by homicidal tendencies towards women. The episode begins perfectly with a short film explaining how scientists killed the vine fly. Then there is a brief scene in which a man is arrested when the bodies of females are discovered in his home. I assume this should show the beginning of the epidemic, but it is not clear why this is never revisited. The episode goes on for a while introducing blah blah blah characters. It looks beautiful and mysterious but the episode gets worse and worse as it moves forward to its sad and unsatisfactory end. The worst episode. Well, except for chocolate.
