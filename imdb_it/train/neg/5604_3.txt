I've heard about this film for many years and finally got the chance to see it. A massive murder of cheerleaders in 1963 and 1969 eventually causes a cheerleader camp to close. Fast forward to 1982, and Bambi, a former student, reopens it with new recruits, including Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (Judge Reinhold) and Sandy (Debralee Scott). One by one, they are killed by the murderer, as long as there is only one left. That's when we find out who did it and why. <br /> <br /> In the film there are also Tom Smothers who makes a terrible accent like a Canadian Mountie, and Paul Reubens making his mockery Pee-Wee Herman. The overall plot is not very developed, and rather lame, but some funny scenes occur, namely the House of Bad Pies and the poker strip scene. The ending looks like it's thrown together, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> In general, good for about ten or fifteen minutes total, the rest can simply proceed forward. Maybe take it on TV, but it's not worth buying.
