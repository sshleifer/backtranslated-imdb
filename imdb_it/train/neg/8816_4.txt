I saw my mother ... well, she wasn't kissing Santa herself; he has his hand on his thigh and bad thoughts in mind. <br /> <br /> This was enough to scare an emotional boy who wanted to believe. He grew up to be a bitter man who was shocked by the quality of the toys he made and the lack of Christmas spirit. <br /> <br /> Waiting for a real slasher movie, I was very disappointed that less than a handful of people died, and there was no nakedness. What a pity. <br /> <br /> I wanted to appreciate this movie, but it was too slow and actually didn't have a good script. I didn't expect great recitations, but I certainly wanted some action. There was none at all.
