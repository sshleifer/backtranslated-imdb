Yet another film about an indecisive, arrogant, arrogant, insensitive and self-defeating character that one has to worry about. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong I am very open to all kinds of off movies on the wall that feature a strongly self-destructive character. What I object to is that there is so little background for this guy. Why did this guy hate himself and the world? If the script had been dealt with more, they could have aroused some sympathy for him. As it is, it appears as an unpleasant and hateful character, not tragic, just hateful. <br /> <br /> Having made great efforts to make this boy as foolish and anti-social as possible and make his destiny as obscure as possible the writer has the courage to make a happy ending .... <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but that's where he fights! Man! Do not waste time.
