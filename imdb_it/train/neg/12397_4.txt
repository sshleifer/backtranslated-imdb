I read somewhere where this film should have been a remake of the 1949 film noir, "Criss Cross". I found this disappointing, but it was even better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a "neo-noir" since it is modern and is in color, two things that purists would do to be disqualified for film noir status. <br /> <br /> The biggest negative to it, however, was not the cinematography (which was fine), but the confusing plot. Hey, some of Dashiell Hammett's 1940s stories were similar but I didn't even care about those. The filmmakers here did not help the situation by inserting flashbacks into the story that seemed to take place every three minutes. No wonder it was the sequel to this story. It was ridiculous! What happens is that with the 45-minute mark, theirs is so much confusion that nobody cares anymore. I know I didn't.
