This horrible piece of trash manages to be racist, sexist and homophobic all at once, pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated. Atrocious shows, a wild screenplay and a boring direction make this movie a starting point. Two scenes were particularly offensive - one in which Schaech rubbed his tongue after being kissed by another man (it could be really so crappy), and the scene where Eastwood is kissed by Schaech's best friend, who is pretending to be Russian . After leaving the room, he exclaims "f ** re foreigners"! So much for being an educated artist who dreams of living in Paris!?! <br /> <br /> Jonathon Schaech can be a nice actor on screen, and he is surprisingly handsome. It is a pity that he did not learn much from working with gay director Gregg Araki in a previous film, and trying to save this film from a series of gay stereotypes and a quagmire of homophobia.
