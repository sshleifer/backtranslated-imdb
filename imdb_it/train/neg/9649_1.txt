Who were they joking with? There was too much in this film that was difficult to digest. Just when Arjun (Ajay Devgan) unwittingly desires his father's death when he arrives in London with his uncle (played by Om Puri) only to abandon him a few minutes later. The only problem with this theory is that anyone who has ever crossed London Heathrow knows that such a party would be impossible to accomplish and, above all, not from an Indian. But the film's problems do not end there, there is the problem of the two main protagonists (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) who pass as rock stars on the verge of realizing their dreams. I mean, yes, we've seen success come to Susan Boyle (a woman in the UK who made her dreams come true after 50), but that was a rare case. It was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief because I felt that the casting of Salman and Ajay was just badly conceived. They would never have chosen Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi to play the same roles, so why should we be forced to watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men well over 40) running around desperately trying to hold on to the twenties? We are not even talking about the most careful actress on the screen today, Asin. This is his second film (which I saw) and she is simply hopeless as an actress, so aware of her appearance that she only cares about looking beautiful and rowing for the camera rather than giving a good acting performance. It is hard to believe that she has refused all the other roles in the film to play in this stuff and then be as flimsy as an actress, nothing to write about at home. And on top of all this, the film was simply boringly dragged. There is nothing special about it, believe me, expect every thing clich√© that will happen in it.
