Let's be honest here: the only reason someone bought this, the only reason why someone reviewed this, and the only reason anyone could boast of enjoying this is because David Lynch made it and because you want to have David Lynch's children. But guess what? Even David Lynch can produce a piece of shit. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Lynch wanted you to transcend normality and experience absurdity as a pure subject of knowledge. Perhaps the atrocious and cacophonous sounds and the scratchy chicken images should imply something about humanity's place in the world, about our relationship with the Real, about the absurdity of it all. <br /> <br /> Instead, it just says one thing for me: I just lost $ 20. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to offend for the sake of offending, I could pull Hansen up and make me bleed ears. If I wanted the absurd for the taste of the absurd, I could simply make a dump on a plate and watch it for 33 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is only one saving quality for Dumbland - it is a destination, a fun destination. I mean, it's so ugly that it's not even funny because it's so bad. This fact, however, is a bit strange. <br /> <br /> If you hate yourself and hate your money, then buy Dumbland. Otherwise, save the agony.
