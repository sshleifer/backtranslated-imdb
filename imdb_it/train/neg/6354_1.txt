Woody Allen has lost the ability to write dialogues or characters that are clearly distinguishable from one another. This is the case of "Melinda and Melinda", in which all the characters speak of Allen's generic pseudo-refinement and have problems and points of view that are not recognizable to anyone outside a radius of four blocks from where Allen lives . They also share the same curious condition of being able to afford multimillion-dollar apartments in Manhattan that seem to have been designed by professional decorators regardless of their financial situation or what they do for a living. <br /> <br /> The only character that exists outside of this dull mentality is Will Ferrel as the obligatory Woody Allen surrogate. Although he does not simply make an impression of Woody Allen (like Kenneth Branagh in the terrible "Celebrity"), Ferrel lacks the charm or charisma that the real Woody had when he played the part in his best films himself. <br /> <br /> The end result is another in a series of self-indulgent annoyances of a once great director who has been trading his old reputation for years.
