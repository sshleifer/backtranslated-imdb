WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS (Not that you need to worry.), I'm sorry for the hoods. <br /> <br /> Starting from an unnecessarily dramatic voice that is all the more annoying because it makes no sense, it goes on without meaning and without unnecessary drama. This is bad but carefully placed. <br /> <br /> We know that space travel is a risky business. There is a complicated system with great potential for malfunctions, radiation, stress-related symptoms, etc. And unexpected things are bound to happen in largely unknown environments. They knew things could go wrong. In fact, things had gone wrong. It's called learning. Of course, Appollo 11 was not safe by today's standards and there was enormous political pressure, but the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive. <br /> <br /> Assorted errors / comments I didn't even have to look up: <br /> <br /> 1) Nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong. Well. This is what I would have done. After all, it was the culmination of a propaganda war. <br /> <br /> 2) NASA gives the green light despite the fact that Appollo 11 will probably explode. (This is "only" implicit, though.) Yes, that's why they leave people and watch the car almost in real time. <br /> <br /> 3) The ejection of the capsule would not work. As if it didn't work the moment a chimpanzee was in it. What survived? It was a test launch and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated and landed with a parachute. There is a video, you will probably find it on youtube or at least look at it somewhere. <br /> <br /> 4) An interviewed boy says an explosion would have wiped out a fair share of Florida. I can only assume that it was intended as a hyperbole, because if it were not so, I'm just stunned how it could be wrong. <br /> <br /> 5) The technology was primitive then compared to today's standards. In reality, relatively primitive software and hardware is still used today, the reason being that it should not crash. It is even worse for spacecraft because their computers must be built with relatively large components that are not susceptible to radiation. (And the same engine must be manually controllable anyway, so a complex driving system like the B2 would not work.) What is there in the fact that they were using "TV screens" rather than "computer screens"? It's the same damn technology. In reality TV monitors were and are produced with a significantly higher definition. <br /> <br /> 6) "If that object wasn't part of the rocket, it could just be one thing." Let's see where it's going. Apart from the fact that the claim is wrong, who says it wasn't a part of the rocket? At least one interviewee makes it clear that if something is flying and you don't know what it is, it is by definition an unidentified flying object. <br /> <br /> 7) The off-screen voice and some erroneous references make it appear that the irradiation sheet of the lander was actually its hull. Which would make him thinner than a space suit. <br /> <br /> 8) The death of Neil Armstrong during a practice flight is a film that I can appreciate; I've never seen it before. As I said, any element of manifest technology can go wrong, especially if it hasn't been tested enough to be, you know, unprecedented. <br /> <br /> 9) The trajectory discrepancy of the descending lander (due to irregularities in the density of the Moon) was in no time acutely dangerous for life. Not even the "fifteen seconds of fuel left", or "fifteen seconds of fuel left before leaving the mission and returning to the command module". <br /> <br /> 10) A "catastrophic" chain of events "usually leads to a catastrophe. I really don't know how to simplify it. This, however, is a great example of the rhetoric used. <br /> <br / > 11) There is a short sequence of one of the astronauts who walks and walks around aimlessly like a cheerful little boy, followed by the off-screen voice that tells us that the reason for this strange behavior "can now be revealed". who walked and hopped aimlessly like a cheerful little boy, hilarious things. <br /> <br /> 12) It was said that during the return, all contacts were lost.This is a perfectly natural phenomenon and was known to epoch because it is impossible to get around it with contemporary technology. Again, the gravity of this is implicit, but in a very intentional way. <br /> <br /> 13) There has never been a shuttle lost in space itself, while the off-screen voice presents this "fact" as proof that Appollo 11 was a pile of shit chicken 13 was almost at a loss, but the two real disasters occurred respectively during take-off and return. In any case, comparing the shuttles to Saturn's rockets is somehow ... well, okay, just stupid. Even ignoring it, successful shuttle missions do not seem to be of interest to the public. <br /> <br /> 14) What the hell is going on with the UFO? Even in the context of the film, it makes no sense. Unless you think it was made for entertainment purposes, aimed at a specific audience (which seems to include people with little or no understanding of history, science or rhetoric). <br /> <br /> Even the film's point is somewhat obscure. Capture phrases like "blankets so far", "publicly revealed here for the first time", come on, but the film does not blame or offers a lesson or something else, something one might expect from such an emotionally made film. In the good old tradition of sensationalism, there are numerous shots of interviews and fragments of recording that are often out of context or with people we know nothing about except "NASA scientist". Wow, so the astronauts were very nervous before the effort? Fancy that one. What does this have to do with the point of the film? Oh yes, what point. <br /> <br /> In summary, in addition to being intentionally or incompetently inaccurate, it is not even good entertainment. And believe me, I'm a guy who likes his sloppy documentaries; this film is not funny, witty, characteristic, it is nothing.
