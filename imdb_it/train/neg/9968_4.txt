As a former teacher (!) I have to confess to having done many scenes - "even though I kept looking until the end. I wonder why ?! (Boredom, maybe?) :-) <br /> <br /> Le First opening scenes struck me as incredibly mish-mashed and unfocussed. Even the plot, although there were some good ideas - the situation of a rescue teacher, for example - was not concentrated enough in any direction for three-dimensional development. br /> <br /> Not one of Mr Nolte's most beautiful moments. As for the young Signor Macchio, he speaks thus in * every * film? <br /> <br /> Apart from the complaints and recitation, the hairstyles alone they were a nostalgic (though nauseating) journey. <br /> <br />
