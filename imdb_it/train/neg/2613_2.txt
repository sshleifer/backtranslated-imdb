This sequel is completely irregular, inconsistent and inconclusive in the "plot" (if there really is one) and tries too damn well to be modern (ridiculous songs predominate, out of fashion and 21st century characters) and cute (yawn: there are too many jokes manufactured and beaten with animals.) The actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot. Even Glenn Close (and usually very good) goes through this film, parodying herself like the original De Ville and the protagonist of Sunset Boulevard! It is a film that is not even good to see. This is a great example of a bad and useless sequel. Even Basic Instinct 2 has an acceptable plot, characterization and acting. This no. It's bad.
