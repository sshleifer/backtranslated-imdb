Have you ever wondered what would have happened if a couple of Beverly Hills 90210 characters had been thrown into a Thai jail? If so, this is your movie. This is Midnight Express for the MTV audience. It would be ok, but the story was poorly executed. Twists, poor dialogues and unresolved issues abound. This light film has not earned the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being. Potential spoiler and impossible plot line - the fake tension fills the moment when the hotel clerk discovers that the girls don't have a room there and is about to throw them out. (This moment is played inappropriately with the same solemnity and gravity as they are arrested under the threat of a gun). Later the same hotel employee is somehow found, and Bangkok is a big city, mind you, I was there and testifies against the girls, as if a couple of free Mai Tais guaranteed 40 years in prison. Come on, come on. Instead, rent another day in paradise.
