I was one of those "few Americans" who grew up with all of Gerry Andersen's wonderful creations. Thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a fantastic action / adventure film if only the writers had figured out where to point it. <br /> <br /> I expected it to be a no-brainer, but I did it. Don't expect it to target such a low age group. Like Lost in Space, this could have been visually surprising and exciting. He should have focused on more action / adventure and the goal of the original series ... saving people in need. <br /> <br /> Instead, he focused on Alan who saved the day instead of his brothers (also their young cast anyway compared to the original). The breaking part was Lady Penelope and Parker. I didn't care too much about the characters in the original, but I was grateful for them in the film. They stole the show! <br /> <br /> I've always liked Thunderbird more for high-tech than for stories, and even for what concerns me I haven't had enough screen time. I would have liked to see other fantastic gadgets. <br /> <br /> But then, I'm just a kid ...;)
