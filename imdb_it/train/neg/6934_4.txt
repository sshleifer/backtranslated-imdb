OK, so obviously I thought this was a good movie in 1955. Too bad for the fools who think so ... Its absolute crap. <br /> <br /> The story is right. .. ridiculous. The characters are absurd caricatures - but this film is not meant to satirize, I'm sure it should be a serious drama right? <br /> <br /> Dean and the others are too old for their parts. People say that Dean is great at this movie, and well, maybe he played his part as well as he could. His character is destined for 16 or 17 years. But Dean was a 24-year-old man when he shot this film. Seeing him agonizing and throwing tantrums like a 4 year old boy ... is pathetic. <br /> <br /> Natalie Wood is beautiful, but the first scenes at the police station where she's crying and whining are very unconvincing. Establishes an ugly precedent for the film ... and for the rest, you want to come up with it whenever one of these scenes hurts. <br /> <br /> It may have been good for its time, but really its end. <br /> <br /> It must have been just a clamor over the death of Dean that inflated the reputation of this movie.
