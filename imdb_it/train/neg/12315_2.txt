OK, I'm not an American, but in my humble Scottish opinion, Steve Martin is not, never has been, and will never be a funny man until our posters head south. Phil Silvers in the role of Sergeant Bilko was a funny man, no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the most amusing and timeless comedies that America has ever produced. How anyone can have the audacity to try to replicate the Phil Silvers character is beyond me. To complicate matters, the exercise was repeated in Martin's humorous attempt to be Peter Seller's Inspector Clouseau, another failed attempt, in my opinion, to rekindle a demonstrably lackluster career. Some of your collaborators say "Steve Martin puts his stamp on the character", to which I would say "balderdash", his portraits will be long forgotten when those of Silvers and Sellars will be appreciated for generations to come
