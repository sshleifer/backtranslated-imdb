So, Prom Night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie. I'm a big wuss and I was afraid to see this movie at the beginning, but after seeing it, it's neither horror nor thriller. I was practically making fun of the movie in my place because it was so predictable. You could predict what will happen next. The young actors were good at playing their characters, but I should say that the killer was definitely at the top of the game - the acting was wise. <br /> <br /> Yes, I'll give the props for the plot because it was good, but it's not thrilling or scary. There were almost zero "jump-in-your-seat" scenes. So don't waste ten dollars to see it in theaters, wait until the DVD arrives.
