This film was long and boring. Surprising that he was selected for Cannes, although they tend to appreciate the pretentiousness. The point is that, unlike other Dutch stars of the artistic genre like Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey feels completely empty. Even more it has no cinematographic quality. A long opening doesn't mean cinematic depth, it's just a long and boring shot. The story was not interesting and the characters had problems with which I could not identify myself at all. The actors did not shine under his direction and seemed lost at times. Leopold tried, but it's not the talent I was hoping it would be. Where are Kerkhof and Kruishoop? They really did make some waves in Dutch cinema. Leopold has just made another attempt.
