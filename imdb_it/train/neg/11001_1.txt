I've never seen a play that was a thankless task to sit on ... not a laugh. Okay, maybe a little chuckle for the bite Michael Clarke Duncan like the big black and bald gay virgin. But the rest was surprisingly little fun. In addition to being laughter-free the "skits" go on forever! Stay away from this if you evaluate your time and money. TERRIBLE!!! The worst!!!
