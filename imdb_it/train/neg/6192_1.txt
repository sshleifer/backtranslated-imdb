Robert Carmichael's great ecstasy is a bad film in every sense. The script, the depressing rhythm, the lack of depth in each character, the useless sub-plots, the terrible acting, the useless climax make this perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. I did not find anything pleasant, funny or intellectually stimulating in any way. I imagine that the filmmakers thought they were creating something intelligent and dark, with its moody lighting, long prolonged silences and the vaguely disturbing classical soundtrack. If so, they failed completely. He just bored me, and I wish I'd never seen him. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
