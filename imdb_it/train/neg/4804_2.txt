I don't watch a lot of television and I came across this show. Reality show? I really hope this isn't real. If I were a man and had such a nag and was married to someone so snotty, it would be a divorce. I think it's a bad example of how a person should treat a person he loves. This is something that is wrong in our world now, so many people in bad relationships, selfish and who do not know the meaning of what it means to truly love another. Self-sacrificing and not something that should be on Merritt. This does not give a very good feeling, to see what should be in private consulting. If his personality on the show is real, then he deserves a much better person who would show true true love and take care of him and appreciate him for what he is. This show is a reality or compensated for the evaluations ???? I would really like to know. Sincerely, GB
