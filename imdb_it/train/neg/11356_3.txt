This is not a good movie. Too verbose in some parts and the plot was comparable. The 3D was OK, but not exceptional. I almost fell asleep in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about 3 young flies that want to venture out and follow them. The characters are lacking, I don't really care about these characters and I feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested. Pixar is not. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see more 3D special effects. I also like to see more mum flys from the mother who constantly says "Lord of the flies", rather sexist in showing women as house wives and fainting.
