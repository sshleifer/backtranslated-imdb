The Nutcracker has always been a somewhat problematic ballet. It bears little resemblance to the original ETA Hoffman story on which it is based. <br /> <br /> In ballet, the story basically ended in the second half when Clara (or Marie in this version) travels to the Kingdom of Sweets to see a series of character dances. <br /> <br /> There is an infinite variety of theatrical productions that reinterpret history in a myriad of ways (not always successfully) to compensate for the weak ballet booklet. <br /> <br /> Balanchine's version actually has no sense of drama or history (despite the fact that there is a lot of drama and mystery in Ciajkovsky's wonderful first-act music). The result is a completely forgettable Christmas party where almost nothing happens and where even the dance (the little there is of it) is not particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> The pantomime that acts excessively, in particular from Drosselmeier, which could seem passable on stage, seems only a silly film for the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, things don't go much better when we get to the Kingdom of Sweets (Act II on stage version). Although there are some choreographic highlights, most of the choreography is tasteless and uninteresting. This certainly isn't vintage Balanchine. <br /> <br /> Balanchine is widely considered a master of abstract dance, but I have always had the feeling of being less successful as a creator of narrative ballets. Watching this film version of his theatrical production of The Nutcracker has only reaffirmed this vision.
