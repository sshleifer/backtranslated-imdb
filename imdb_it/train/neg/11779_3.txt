I don't really like this movie. If you've read Puzo's books, or at least you've looked very closely at the first two films (especially the first one), you'll agree with me. <br /> <br /> Compared to the Corleone saga presented by Puzo's novel, the script of this film is sometimes even ridiculous. The characters and the relationships between them are distorted. The story ends up getting nowhere, even if it seems to go somewhere during the movie. <br /> <br /> It is understandable that we expect different times for the Corleone saga in the 90s, and that we would not want to find things as before. But, on the other hand, I don't know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other films, in contexts where they didn't fit. Why this? They look like those poor quality sequels that just try to copy the qualities of the original film. <br /> <br /> What will never be understandable is the fact that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino have come together to do it. A man who has directed pieces like Apocalypse Now and Godfather must be forgiven for almost everything he does in the cinema until his death. So does Al Pacino, to be the actor he is. But Mario Puzo shouldn't have written this. Why? He damaged all his previous work. What a pity, my friend. Puzo's novel "The Last Don" is a 90-year story about the crowd, and it's great. We can never say the same about the plot of the Godfather III.
