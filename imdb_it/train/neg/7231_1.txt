I saw him in an artistic cinema that also showed "Last Days" and some films by Charlie Chaplin. Based on the quality of the other features, I decided to give "Immortel" a chance. I'm almost out of this movie and I LIKE science fiction! The plot is set in a futuristic city of New York, full of Blade Runner style advertisements and some similar debates on cloning / human synthetics. Unfortunately, the script was not condensed enough for a one-hour and forty-five minute movie. There are three groups in this world: humans, artificial humans and Egyptian gods. Artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city. Humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation. The Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid (modeled on the Great Pyramid of Khufu and complete with a deteriorated exterior, leaving a smooth "hood" on the pyramid: wouldn't a futuristic floating pyramid be in perfect condition?). The pyramid rests above the city and no one on the ground understands what it is or why it is there. I won't bore you with the so-called plot, but there are a lot of useless gores and lots of gross scenes. The film, as I said, seems to have been influenced by Blade Runner and perhaps also by The Fifth Element and The Matrix. At the end of the film the credits were listed thanks to the UK, France and Italy. The film is FRENCH, but uses British actors who do not speak French. Therefore, it is obvious that their French dialogue has been nicknamed. This is a distraction, and I also thought that moving from one man to another to a rather distracting animation. It doesn't help that the animations are scarce - not better than a video game. Skip this.
