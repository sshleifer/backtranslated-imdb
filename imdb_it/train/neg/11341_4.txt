In a sense, this is the disaster that Fellini has worked throughout his life. The line between the absurd masterpiece and bullshit of the free association is very small, and in which category a film will end up adapting, it often depends only on personal feelings. Having said that, "Casanova" left me with cold admiration for his sets and little more that cannot be summarized more adequately by Bukowski: <br /> <br /> "Even Casanova is dead, only an old man with a big cock and a long tongue and no liver, to say that he lived well is true, to say that I could spit on his grave without feeling is also true, women usually go for the biggest fool they can find, that's why the breed human stands out where it does today: we have bred intelligent and lasting Casanovas, all empty inside, like the Easter rabbits we breed on our poor children ". <br /> <br /> As far as I could understand, this is the position that Fellini takes about his subject; granted, with more empathy, but still disgusted. <br /> <br /> The environment of Casanova is made of decadence and incestuous behavior, themes that Fellini has dealt with more explicitly in "Satyricon". The plot succession is characteristic of soft porn, only without coherence; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of distraction. <br /> <br /> However, there may be only one point in portraying Casanova as an unpleasant madman. And I challenge anyone to formulate this point without being obvious; Fellini could not. More than ever it seems like a dirty old man here - a master, of course, but one whose impulses are more satisfied than anyone else. I find it hard to imagine an audience that likes this movie. It was a story that was not worth telling.
