The revolution is a terrible film, I don't care if you are a history teacher, a journalist, an Al Pacino fan, it is not possible for this film to earn a legitimate "10". <br /> <br /> The key Indicates the plot that Tom Dobb (Al) is trying to get money from a note he received for the radical patriots who took his boat. Everything revolves around that note. Tom's son joins the army to make up for the ticket, getting Tom into the army, embarking on an adventure trying to get out of the army, years after the war is over and can finally deliver the ticket for their boat. The end. <br /> <br /> He had some battle scenes, and they were quite mediocre at best. Transitions between scenes used "five months later" and magically put the characters in a famous historical battle. Love affair is a joke, and the film as a whole is difficult to follow. So save your "Notes" and watch the Patriot instead.
