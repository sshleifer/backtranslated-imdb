If you hate the accents of the past, you would hate this movie. And to make matters worse, see Patrick Swayze, a man who tried to be a redneck. I really can't stand redneck accents. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was good at Slingblade, but he was boring in this movie. And what kind of name is Lonnie Earl? How hickish can this movie be? The plot was stupid. Usually this is not the judgment of the films, but I could not stand this film. If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton movie, go see Slingblade. <br /> <br /> My mom found this movie for $ 5.95 at Wal Mart ... figures ... I think I'll understand it and give it to my grandmother for Christmas. It may just be that I can't stand the accents of the red neck usually, or that I can't stand Patrick Swayze. Maybe if Patrick Swayze wasn't there. I didn't laugh once in the movie. I laugh at anything stupid usually. If they showed that someone's fingers broke, I could have laughed. people's fingers that break by accident always make me laugh.
