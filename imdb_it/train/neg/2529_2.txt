Bobby is a silly kid who smiles too much and wants to have sex. So buy a van to help with this search. The acting is lame, the play is pathetic and the script is nothing but a chain of clichés and chills at low cost. The creators of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the follies of the other films of the time, but they became much shorter. They also resort to Bobby slipping on a banana peel, because this will probably add comic value. <br /> <br /> I am struggling to find a saving feature of the film. If you like DeVito, this is another classic DeVito role - but it's just a supporting actor and there for the value of the cliché.
