Well ... the movie was a fun watch. The main problem with this film is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths adhere to. Like the vampires who walk in the sunlight. Although there are parts that only make you enjoy how the company makes films. A scene in which a vampire is stabbed and screams "Ow, this hurts ... It's really stuck". Then it seems that there may be some scenes missing but after a while you get used to it. And there are sequences of random dreams that don't really help the plot. Come to think of it, nothing really makes sense, but I just had a group of friends and I watched it twice to get the full effect. Come to think of it, the fight scenes were awesome and the zombies were just fun to watch. Slowly as I write more than this I like this movie better. But you know, all in all you can't expect Schindlers List but it's a fun watch.
