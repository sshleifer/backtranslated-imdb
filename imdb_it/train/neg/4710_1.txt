My brother is in love with this show, let's make it clear. I completely agree with the people who said he was copying Dexter's Lab and Fairly Odd Parents. <br /> <br /> I have never liked the rather strange parents, I mean, some things made me laugh, but most of the times it is definitely annoying and not at all nice. This is almost the same as I feel for Johnny Test. Except for Nothing makes me laugh in that show. The gags are so stupid and useless, and to tell you the truth, maybe it's just me, but the guys don't ENABLE like that! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is fantastic, but it's there! <br /> <br /> And Dexter's Lab, which was one of my favorite programs and I still don't mind watching it. Which makes me disgusted and ashamed of Johnny Test who makes an absolute JOKE for that wonderful show! <br /> <br /> Another thing. The dog. IS. So. Annoying. It's louder and hateful than Johnny! And the gay accent? What mud! I hate the dog to die and I hope it dies, because it would be better for the children to see it and listen to the hateful shit that happens in that show, and take a gay accent. <br /> <br /> Unless you want your eyeballs to burn in miraculous flames and your brain fry by this show, don't look at it!
