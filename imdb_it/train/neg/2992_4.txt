Next to the slasher films of the 70s and 80s, those on the living dead were probably the second most popular horror subgenre. While the slasher movies had "Black Christmas" and "Halloween" to make it all work, the zombie movies had the "dead" films of George Romero. And, it is not surprising that shortly after the success of his first two in the series, other directors wanted to cash in. Many Italian directors were particularly interested, like Lucio Fulci who brought us 'Zombie' a year after Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead', known as "Zombi" in Italy and other countries, and it was there that Fulci's film was known as "Zombi 2". Apart from the walking dead, he has no relationship with Romero's film, but it is a good film in its own right. It was a great success in Europe and a sequel was born 9 years later. <br /> <br /> Pros: Lots of beautiful and lush landscapes. Awesome score. The acting is not exactly good, but the cast is the game and seems to enjoy the experience. After a sort of slow start, the rhythm moves like an action movie. Lots of cheese and involuntary hilarity for bad movie lovers. Good work on the effects of makeup. Lots of blood and some decent blood. <br /> <br /> Cons: virtually less plot. Nothing you haven't seen before. Amazingly he rips off a few things from the first couple of "Return of the Living Dead" movies. Cardboard characters It hasn't aged too well because of the bad rock music of the 80s (Not that I'm saying that all the rock music of that period is bad), the clothing and the general feeling of the film. <br /> <br /> Final considerations: First of all, this is not a true sequel to Fulci's cult classic. In fact, I don't know if it was ever meant to pick up where the movie had been interrupted. For those who don't know, Fulci got sick during production and ended up leaving and was replaced by Bruno Mattei. Mattei's films are rather ridiculous, but like this movie many are good campy fun. And that's all this movie really is, just something to watch for fun. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (So-bad-it's a good grade) 2/5 (Serious judgment)
