Noting the cast, I recently saw this film on TCM, hoping for an underrated gem, since I watch many movies from the 1930s. This is not a gem - not even semi-precious. Anachronistic clothing and the Rolls Royce limousine of the 1930s strike you immediately. Casting is also strange. But above all, there are too many stupid and useless plot devices. This film has many good ingredients and a basic plot that is promising, but the components are not mixed according to the right recipe. It simply does not meet as it should. And this is a sin. With some pretty obvious but minor changes, this may have been a great movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about an American showgirl (Jean Harlow) looking for a rich British husband - preferably from the nobility. Meet Franchot Tone and his friend, who are on a lark in a Rolls Royce owned by his friend's employer. Harlow mistakenly assumes that Tone is the Lord who owns the Rolls, and she sets her sights on him. This first part of the film is a light comedy without distinction. <br /> <br /> However, Tone unintentionally discovers that his employer is actually a fifth German journalist on the eve of World War I, when the film completely changes tone and begins to fall apart. Tone and Harlow are married, but just as the honeymoon begins, he is killed by a guy Mata Hari (Benita Hume), and Harlow escapes from the scene, with a bystander accusing her of Tone's murder. (Indeed, Tone recovers from his wounds.) <br /> <br /> Harlow flees to France, where he falls in love again - this time with a rich French cad (Cary Grant). Tone, now in the army, and Harlow are unexpectedly brought back together in Grant's hospital room, where he is in a plane crash rehabilitation. In the following scene, Tone accuses Harlow of abandoning him because he is essentially a gold digger. Harlow never explains the witness who accused her of murder and her panic! This is one of those unreal movie sequences, of the film's plot, in history. <br /> <br /> Then Tone is also brought back into contact with the woman (Hume) who shot him. He is on hand to watch his lover, Grant, test the new plane that Tone delivered to him from England. Incredibly, both Hume and Tone recognize each other weakly, but they simply don't know where! Ok, so Tone was hit and almost dead; maybe his memory is a bit out of touch. But how many men did Hume shoot that he would forget one of his brands? (It does not appear to simulate the memory.) <br /> <br /> This is inexplicable and unnecessary. Hume should have recognized him absolutely, but he interpreted it when he realized that Tone was unable to place it. It would have been a much better treatment of this problem. <br /> <br /> The finish is also very unsatisfactory. The film, as it was made, has Tone and Harlow conspiring to preserve the cad's good reputation, Grant, which leads to his fraudulent burial as a hero. Then Harlow and Tone leave. It is noble to preserve the perception of the French public of their national war hero, but very unsatisfactory as a love story! <br /> <br /> What the film asks is this: Harlow explains that he fled in panic in the face of murder charges; Tone forgives her and gently rekindles her love for her; then bring a torch for her, even helping her fix the accident site to preserve Grant's reputation. Meanwhile, Harlow finally recognizes Grant for the CAD that he is. After seeing Tone for the brave and noble man that he is, Harlow also rekindles feelings for him. At the end of the film, the two are also reconciled as they work together to give the impression of Grant's death. After the burial of Grant's hero, we see them hugging and kissing to fade. That would have made a nice little movie. For Cary Grant fans, it would have been even better if Tone had played the French cad who is killed and Grant the first long-suffering husband, reunited with Harlow. <br /> <br /> It is incomprehensible that Franchot Tone is interpreted as the Irishman who lives in England, while Cary Grant is chosen as French. This film would have been much better if they had reversed roles. This too would have been more favorable to the film that should have been ...
