This film is supposed to be a "carefree" story about Santa Claus and his "magical and mystical" wonders. But instead it turns out to be absolutely disturbing. Two things in this film that stand out in my mind are horrible 1) the way it looks like Santa Claus. Have you ever seen a more horrible Santa Claus? and 2) "bad representative of Satan" Pitch's simple odd dances are simply disgusting to watch. Watch this movie only if it's the MST version or if you like a good laugh. I can't believe this is a children's movie.
