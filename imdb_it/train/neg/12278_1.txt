When you watch this show you're not quite sure it's the story or the acting that's most annoying. First of all, the plot of each episode is very predictable, the screenwriters must have used all the possible clich√©s, you can guess not only the general plot, but the layout of the scenes and also the lines of each character, making the show of some kind of a collage of every detective series out there. On top of everything comes the "message" of the show, that the good is good and the bad is bad and that at the end of the day the good will prevail and that we should all love each other, be a better man and better citizens, all done in the most flashy way . The actors, like the vehicles of this message and nothing else, will use a limited set of acting skills: the smile "I am a good bearer", the worried look and the "body position", while the bad guys have the "I 'm a bad "frowning and the look of" you captured me ", followed by the" head band "I am good for nothing and I should be removed from society" (this kind of summary of the general development of each show). The real story or not, the show is rubbish, another proof that the producers don't care about the spectators, that we all think we're idiots ... Well, this series makes every possible attempt to idiotize the living brains out of you.
