if they gave me the option of negative numbers I would use it. This film was really terrible. I went to the cinemas expecting it to be horrible, and somehow managed to exceed my expectations. <br /> <br /> The script was weak, the acting was painful. I wanted to go out but my friend was driving and I wanted to claim her money, I think we were both disappointed. <br /> <br /> Breast growth when girls have their superpower and hair change the color was simply wrong. Eddie Izzard seemed just wrong for the part of super villain, he became strangely weak and foolish. Jenny Johnsons (Uma Thurman) became psychotic and strange, as did Matt's friend (Luke Wilson) Vaughn (Rainn Wilson.
