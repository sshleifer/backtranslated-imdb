This film was supposed to have depicted a 'ladino' bachelor who was ready and willing to settle once and for all. However, I didn't care that his mission calmed down, because I didn't care about his character. I don't understand what all these beautiful women saw in him. He had absolutely no class, or charisma. He should have at least had a way for himself that made the girls weak in the knees except playing the saxophone, but without success. Just because he's a musician doesn't make him sexy. Not to mention the things he did to attract the attention of a married woman who fell in love in five minutes of getting to know her, absolutely outrageous and ridiculous. Does this man have any shame what ever? If he had rearranged and stopped doing and said stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character, but alas, his character was bland and boring. The character of Gina Gershon was unnecessarily British. He could easily have been an extemporaneous stranger in his normal voice rather than a poor British accent that sometimes faded into the film. <br /> <br /> The only two characters I cared about were the fish and the frog. Now those two had chemistry! Nomination Academy for both ?? STATISTICS! Hole, lack of character development, horrible acting, unnecessary drama, clich√© moments ... What a movie mess.
