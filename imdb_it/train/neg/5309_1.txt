I saw the movie late one night on cable and I couldn't believe how bad it was. I usually like bad movies, but this was so disgusting that it wasn't even funny. Some of the highlights of this film include the absurd music that is constantly reproduced throughout the film, the horrible special effects (when someone is hit with a laser gun turns neon green and disintegrate readily), and the disgusting acting. Actually, acting is what I feel steal the show. I didn't recognize any of the actors in the film, and I hope I never have to see them again. Overall, I recommend renting this movie (if you can find it, I can't imagine a video store that carries this junk) just to learn to enjoy quality movies after seeing this junk.
