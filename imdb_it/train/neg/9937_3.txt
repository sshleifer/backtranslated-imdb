First, this is a very dated film, not focused on his exposition of the left-wing political revolution. Honestly, when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to stop being intellectual (which in itself is quite senseless, since the answer came precisely from being intellectual) reduces me to despair; as if we all go back to being monkeys in the name of equality - it's just ridiculous. Our intellectuality is only one of many human qualities, but this does not mean that we should not educate ourselves to the maximum degree possible. But without a doubt this non-educational message is linked to the use of Godard of rock music; from here The Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The song "Sympathy for the Devil", of which we are witnessing and from which the film takes its name, is nothing special. The sequence of chords, which is not particularly original, was used to obtain a better effect in "Thankyou" by Led Zeppelin (Led Zeppelin II). Apart from that, "Sir" Mick Jagger declines in his usual hazy way (rather like Bob Dylan) - he notes that the first melodic sentence is repeated in an unimaginable way to form the verse again. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fact that the Black Panthers depicted in this film do not seem to know what they are fighting for, the most interesting scenes concern the equation of fascism with pornography; a message that actually undermines the sexual "liberation" of the 1960s and today (indeed, a message that would deny the behavior of the Rolling Stones in the period in which the film was made). No wonder, the DVD came free with The Sunday Times! For a truly profound historical exposition of the sympathy of the left, listen to Luigi Nono's masterpiece, 'Al Gran Sole loaded'd'amore'.
