I recently ran into Nine Dead and read the current reviews thinking that I could face an average movie. This film however was slightly below average, but watchable. The script was poorly written and the acting was on average for a B-level film with a couple that stood out as quite good. The plot borders that of Saw, teaches people what they did wrong in a situation and tries to make them appreciate life more, but that's where the confrontation ends. Nine deaths try to have a heart and a purpose behind simple ideas that are not new. The main flaw I found in Nine deaths was the slap in the face of the viewer of the flashbacks that occurred 3 minutes earlier in the movie and were completely useless and a completely inadequate ending that people won't see coming, in a wrong way . Spoilers aside, I've seen the worst of the bad movies and they haven't put an end to this. Decent blow, bad acting and fine though ...
