OK, this movie has had a terrible premise. Be serious according to the movie they had just lived in an apocalyptic war, but they have money to buy huge robots and face them against each other. Instead, each country decides to invest in rebuilding their country, preferring to fight with robots that no one could afford. Here is a better idea, rely on our most inept resource, athletes, to fight our battles. <br /> <br /> Everyone says what the director is, and he. Makes a good movie, makes a bad movie. There is no reason to give credit to this film only for the director, maybe he was asleep? I really enjoyed this movie, because it was so poor and ridiculous that I had to laugh. Actually I enjoyed watching it, except for the cowboy mentor who turns out to be a murderer (believe me nobody would see this guy as a murderer, so it's a surprise, anyway lame) What kind of training exercise is still a jim jungle. I was sad to see that Mst3k had not done so. I'm giving a two-star rating, however, because nothing could be as bad as "manos the hands of fate." <br /> <br /> The budget doesn't matter, I've seen a lot of reasonable films that had nothing for budgets like a cube. The plot was not even plausible and I saw him play better in school plays. Surely they could have afforded an eleven-year-old child from any middle school game. <br /> <br /> Anyway take it back, it's a fun movie to watch.
