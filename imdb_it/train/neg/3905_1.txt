Forget Plan 9, this is the final fiasco, a drama in costume, inept, direct, scripted, acted, etc. This film is based on the novel not much better than Isabel Allende. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films), and the other actors, including Winona, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons strive to overcome such a terrible script. A lot of mistakes (like, for example, since it snows at Christmas in Chile?) And very cruel, with tons of that evil called "magical realism", this stands out as the worst movie of all time. It sucks !!!
