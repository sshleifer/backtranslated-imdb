I tried twice to get past this film, succeeding the first time - and it was like pulling teeth - and failing the second time despite a big DVD transfer. The problem? It's just too boring. <br /> <br /> If you manage to enter the dramatic courtroom scene, which takes up most of the second part of the film, you did it, but it's hard to get to that point. There are some interesting talks of "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) during the trial. The finale is moving when Lincoln moves away and overlaps his Memoral statue on the screen. <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful story, well acted and so ... but it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging. I suspect the real Abe Lincoln was much more interesting than this movie.
