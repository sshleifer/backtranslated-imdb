This is one of those topics that I can relate to a little more than most people because I hate noise and have no idea how those in big cities, New York, especially how people can sleep at all! It amazes me that people can endure all the noise these days. The basic plot of the film is that it makes an argument interesting. It's a shame that it's all here. Tim Robbbins is decent, although apart from a couple of scenes (especially with the absolute supermodel in search of Margarita Leiveva) it doesn't really seem to be there at all. My biggest hope for this film is that the casting agents will see the actress absolutely extraordinary and talented, Margarita Levieva. It doesn't have much to do, but it is a beautiful top model. Even when they're trying to show her more girls next door. It saddens me that there can be people like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian in the world without redeemable skills or talent, to have more fame and success than this talented beauty. I didn't care much about this movie because the script isn't very good, but I'm glad I saw some new talent. I hope the producers and directors think of Margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be there in the big-budget film. If they can make Megan Fox a star (she's not that sexy, and her acting "talent" is worse than what was done for Disney Channel TV shows) from 1 movie, it should happen easily for her, since she's wonderful and talented! I would advise you to change your surname so that you can pronounce it and make it more marketable. I hope this makes her career, and if there is any justice she can appear in some great summer movie or two in the next two years.
