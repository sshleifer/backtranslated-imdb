Look, I'm sorry if half the world is offended by this, but life is quite confusing. I don't need to look at it that way. I'm digging Anthony Hopkins, great. I even saw Fracture and knew it would be a steaming pile of Quentin. But this thing is not well resumed, and it is not daring, even if it is artistic. Well-produced films have reasons for quick cuts and modifications, not this excuse "oh, but it's a realistic interpretation". This thing will hurt your head. It's the fastest moving photo ever to take you anywhere. I still love AH, and I'll always give him another chance, but if you don't have time to watch the bad ideas on the screen, skip this.
