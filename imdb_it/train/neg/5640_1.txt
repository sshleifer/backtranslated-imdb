I'm a big fan of Willem Dafoe, and I really looked for this movie (I had to get a Chinese Region 5 DVD!). But it's really one of the worst I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Acting (except Dafoe) is horrible. Dafoe and Colagrande BOTH have written and directed this (even if he is not credited as a director), and have no distinguishable talents to write or direct. (Stick with reciting Willem, Jade come out of the business, PLEASE!) <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing happens. Except for a series of completely unconvincing motivations, totally lacking in credibility, acts of these two people (who have just met each other) in this house. Colagrande is sleepy, I can't import an expression unless he practically never changes. And the sex scenes are definitely lame. Actually I got into one of them twice. How disgusting! They are not absolutely erotic, yet they are the only time the film does not make you fall asleep. So he's busy repelling you. <br /> <br /> Simply awful.
