The film did what it intended to do: show how a girl faces poverty and grows in her maturity. However, for most of us, this topic has been adequately explored and in most cases with greater sophistication than done here. The film fixed on the breast, which soon became boring and lost interest. If he were on TV, I would go to the latest news on Starr's report. It's so boring that I found this movie.
