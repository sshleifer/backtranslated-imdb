The guy did a lot of title design for a lot of movies and I think he said one day; I should choose a cheap scenario, try to put so much title into the box (because after all I am a title designer) and try to convince people that this is indeed a movie. One of the worst I've ever seen is safe. If you want to see good titles, go see some posters that don't waste time looking at this. <br /> <br /> It's pretty ironic, don't you think, did you see the poster? the only part of his project that SHOULD have done a job title has almost none!
