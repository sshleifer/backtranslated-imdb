this is what you would get if you allowed a 10-year-old (American maniac) to write a story about a trip to the moon. Absolute garbage without salvific qualities Perhaps it has had a certain charm in the 3D department. but as a narrative and entertaining animation it contained nothing to lose an hour and a half for a value. Save time and money and watch BOLT instead <br /> <br /> Damn. There are not enough lines, yet I hear it summarizes everything ... well, I agree with a review above - this is like a Cold War propaganda story. Perhaps it would have been more interesting if they had made sure the flies discovered the moon landing hoax, or if the flies had died in the first minute. By the way, why have all the main character's flies been deformed? - nobody had the full compliment of the limbs!
