Someone will have to explain to me why every film that characterizes poor people and adopts a pseudo-gritty look is somehow seen as "realistic" by some people. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen anything realistic about the characters (even if the actors did their best with really bad parts) or situations. Instead, I saw a forced and awkward effort to be "edgy", "gritty" and "dirty". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it takes a lot more than holding the camera without queuing or reasoning and failing to illuminate the movie to get any of the qualities mentioned above in any significant way. <br /> <br /> It is a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution which is the only film that sees the inside of a film, theater is nowadays all carbon copies, with bad cinematography, non-existent camera direction and a lot of oaths that strive to pass for "Art". <br /> <br /> It's no wonder if movies like "In the Bedroom" or "About Schmidt" get such bad words. I found them very tortuous and very mediocre, but compared to the current wave of independent clones like "Raising victor Vargas" they are decidedly brilliant and inspired. <br /> <br /> A few years ago I saw an "independent" film which means that you will probably be treated with a bit of originality and a lot of energy and attention, and maybe some technical problems caused by low budgets, nowadays , means that chances are you'll still have another number, let's -shake-the-camera-around-for-two-hours attempt to quell the lack of taste of independent distributors. And of course all this to serve completely unreal and invented characters and situations. <br /> <br /> Is there any surprise that the independent market has fewer and fewer surviving companies? Not at all when you see films like Raising Victor Vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them.
