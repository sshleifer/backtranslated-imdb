This film makes Peter an elf in Robin Hood's costume instead of a human boy in costume probably not Robin Hood and ignores all the features of the person in him that really matter. This movie makes Wendy a stuttering idiot. And the poor Captain Hook is a TOTAL clown. And of course, since every Disney cartoon must have a character that has had too many shots on its head, it made it one of the Lost Boys. The only character who has not been dishonored in this film is Tink. The only star is for her. <br /> <br /> So the story itself? Dear parents don't even have time to notice that their children are gone !!! Probably one of the most significant points in the original story and they ruined it! Even the famous scene of the kindergarten between Peter Pan and Wendy is an extraordinary piece of - There are no thimbles and acorns - one of the little things that make the original story so unique. It is amazing that he even lost his shadow and she helped him to believe it. (Although for his shoes and it doesn't make sense to me.) <br /> <br /> To ruin such a great story just to amuse children should be illegal. So know now if you've never known before - this Disney version has nothing significant in common with the original story - which is actually not a story for children but just a big, big story. <br /> <br /> This annoys me to no end.
