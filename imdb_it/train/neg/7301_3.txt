There is a big difference between the release of an original, intense, board-of-your-seat, scary, gore-fest, and doing how filmmaker Eli Roth and his team did with "Cabin Fever" and it was simply behaved like him. The film follows five graduates in a cabin in the woods that begins to prove fatal as one after another succumbs to this mysterious disease with fast-acting and carnivorous. It is not long before friends light up to each other, and they can barely stand the sight of each other, much less want to be in the same proximity with them. As crude as it may seem, there is a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that could have worked, in the hands of a less arrogant filmmaker. Unfortunately what we end up with badly designed characters whose sole purpose seems to be beautiful in the beginning to make the inevitable decomposition more contrasting, a script so coarsely chops as to leave the viewer to fine-tune the dialogue, and many incomprehensible subplots that motivate little more than (in one case) an appearance on the screen of director Roth. This is a sloppy movie in different ways! Avoid this time gobble.
