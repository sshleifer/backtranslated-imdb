THIS IS NOT A CHILD FILM !!! <br /> <br /> This film is like a "bad acid trip" for children under the age of 5. For a month, my 4-year-old asks from time to time "Why did that rabbit bleed from his mouth" or "Why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits?" (And that wasn't the worst). We stopped it for about half an hour, but the damage had been done. Intensely morbid, oppressive, violent. Fortunately he has finally forgotten all the miserable thing. Who decided that this film should be marketed for children should be brought up on charges. ... (go on censorami, my conscience is clear).
