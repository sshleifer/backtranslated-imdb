This anime series starts off in a big way: interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully rendered and performed. Not everything is immediately explained, dangling a proverbial carrot in front of the spectator, enticing the viewer to watch each successive episode. But imagine the disappointment of discovering that the sci-fi thriller / adventure of a giant robot is just a background for the exploitation of the psycho-babble and quasi-religious preaching. If you want to hear "You're fine, it's good to be yourself". after being attacked with negative slogans and negative emotions of the characters, this is for you. If you want a good science fiction movie simply fun to watch, forget it. Both the original and the alternative endings have deeply disappointed me. All this, and this movie was too much a preacher.
