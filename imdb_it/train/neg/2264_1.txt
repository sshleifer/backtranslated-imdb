To anticipate this review, I have to say that I was, I suppose, a little curious about this movie .. However, I probably wouldn't have seen it if I didn't have my slightly twisted arm. <br /> <br /> my opinion, this film shows how depraved a man can be. In my eyes, the worst thing about this entire Springer phenomenon is not the kind of people on the "Jerry Springer Show" that act like them (which in itself is eminently reprehensible), but that many people are so curious and excited to watch them and we will hear about their lives (yes, I suppose it includes me ... to what extent it is true). If we don't glorify that kind of behavior (as some might say), we might at least be able to corrupt our minds and / or desensitize ourselves to this kind of behavior. <br /> <br /> But enough soapbox (sort of). Here's the meager: the film has an R rating, and while it might only deserve that (I looked away at some scenes, so I'm not entirely sure), I feel that a NC-17 (hat point for the other reviewer) could be a a little more appropriate for the immense sexual content (a cynic might comment that the film was just a great excuse to show sex on the big screen). The plot is very bizarre, which links the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks upset that will appear on several Springer shows. In the end, the film leaves one with a certain determination and Springer's rhetoric about the need for us to see the real world (evidently seen through his show). I agree with him - it is important to know how the world really is so that we can try to achieve positive change. Having said that, let me tell you: the world looks bad in a new newspaper or news to see it, but don't pay money to support the kind of sensationalist and perhaps formidable titling that Springer tries to give us.
