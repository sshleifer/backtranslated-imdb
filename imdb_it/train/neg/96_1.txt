..Oh wait, I can! This film is not for the typical snob movie, unless you want to brush up on your typical film definitions, such as "continuity editing" and "geographic correspondence". I couldn't say where I was in this movie. A second is in the present, the minute after presumably in the 70s driving a modern SUV and wearing what I thought was the clothing of the 80s. I think. I couldn't pay enough attention because the acting was just awful. I think it only attracted attention because it has a 3d I didn't see. If you are a b-movie fan, and by b-movie I mean BAD movies, then this movie is for you. It's a home movie and all the senseless style will make you laugh until you're awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, however, skip this one.
