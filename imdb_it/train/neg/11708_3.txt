I am reminded of how this film was made. I watched him while working at home writing e-mails and answering the phone - I saw him ONLY because I was hoping that the "revenge" part would be good. needless to say, the revenge and the twists of the forced plot were not worth the e-mails during which they were watched. in fact, I'm not even sure what happened in the end. the acting was as bad as the re-enactment scenarios of the "FBI Files" show - by far the worst re-enactments (actually only "Arrest and Trial" can be just as bad in the re-enactments). I didn't even know the main character was in Third Eye Blind until I saw the movie here on IMDb, but it's obvious why he hasn't made films since then. I hope he is a good singer.
