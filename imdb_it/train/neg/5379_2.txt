Released on DVD in the UK as Ax, The Choke is a teenage slasher who fails in almost all departments: the story is almost non-existent, giving rise to a film that mostly includes people wandering through a dark building; with the exception of two characters (who are obviously destined to be the survivors of the film), all are absolutely reprehensible, which means that the viewer does not care less when they are massacred; the deaths are not gory enough (unless a brief stroke of a pound of ground meat covered with fake blood turns into your stomach); and the free sex scene has features without nudity (an unforgivable mistake to make in a slasher movie!). <br /> <br /> The wafer-thin plot sees the members of a punk band stuck in what appears to be the world's largest nightclub (there are endless corridors and abandoned rooms, unlike any other club that has never seen) where they are chosen by an invisible attacker. For a reduced budget effort, production values ​​are in place, and the cast seems to be a pretty capable actor, but with not enough genuine fear, a reluctance to become really messy (this is a slasher, so where's the splatter graphic?), a too horrible dialogue (in particular from the undead drummer-soon enough) and a reckless use of sticky video techniques in an attempt to add a style, the film quickly becomes extremely boring.
