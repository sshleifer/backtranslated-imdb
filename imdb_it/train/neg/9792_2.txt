I SHOULD BE BEFORE SAID THAT I READ MANGA AND THEREFORE MY ARGUMENT IS BASED ON THE DIFFERENCES. <br /> <br /> This anime disappointed me because it removed the comedy and high quality action of the manga and AVA. What he left behind was just a shell of what could have been. Many of the characters lacked the depth one sees in the manga. Alucard is not the nice character who secretly longs for death. Walter's story lacks treason. And the Nazi criminals who plot to swallow the world at war are completely absent. Instead, the anime provides Gary Stu Incognito's villain who is defeated against what appear to be all odds. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is not that the anime diverges from the manga, but that it does so little work.
