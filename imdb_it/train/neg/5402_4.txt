This film is so incredible; - the whole premise is the bunkum; the fact that a serial killer (vampire or other) can fly around without being killed and kill as many people as the film implies is ridiculous. The vampire himself would not appear out of place in a Bela Lugosi film. Most of the acting is so wooden that the actors should be treated for dry rot. I await the day when someone makes a decent film from a Steven King novel (with the exception, perhaps, of Stand by Me). This film suffers from what most Stephen King films do: lack of money used for "special" effects, poor actors, scary characterization and dialogue. This film is cheap, flashy and fails in everything it tries to do.
