Skippy's "Family Ties" plays Eddie, a "metal nerd" who is teased. When Sammi Curr dies, her favorite metal singer, Sammi Curr, throws herself into a dazzling stair of all the posters on the wall of her bedroom. But when later he gets an unreleased record that contains the spirit of his dead "metal" idol. First he gets sucked into ideas of revenge, but then he doesn't want to take it to Sammi. Which is not as far away as its main victims seem to go to the hospital. This film is completely ridiculous and has a lot to do with real metal, like "Rock Star". OK, maybe a little more than that piece of junk, but you understand my point. And as no one can root for a boy played by Skippy from "Family Ties", I have no idea. The cameo by Gene Simmons is OK, and Ozzy Osbourne reaches consistency, I applaud him for this, but otherwise he skips this. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elise Richards gets topless, an extra topless at a pool party
