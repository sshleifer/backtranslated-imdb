I managed to get a glimpse of this with the help of MST3K, and oh boy, even with riffing this movie was terribly ugly. Imagine someone whose expertise with a camera can be made by a monkey. <br /> <br /> The highlights (what little there was) came from the special effects, which were "OK". The acting for the most part was also "OK"; although nothing special, it was of a higher quality than the other B-Movies I've seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The rest of this film is terribly bad, The camera work often seems to have just put the camera man on roller skates and pushed him forward. The story (if you can call it that) is so full of holes that it's almost funny, it never really explains why the hell survived in the first place, or needs human flesh to survive. The script is poorly written and the dialogue only borders on the stupid plan. The apex of the film (if there is one) is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you can't find the MST3K version, avoid this at all costs.
