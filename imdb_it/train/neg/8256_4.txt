the only word I can think of to describe this film is: Ordinary. <br /> <br /> The plot about the character who tries Gary sinise's suicide is a ridiculous premise and we go to live as a sort of salmerist or recluse hermit in a shack that brings golf balls into the ocean because it's not in can you manage life in the profitable pro / am golf community? Cry Me A River. I wish these were my problems. I like Dylan Baker and Sinise but this film was clearly a bad choice or a Sinise payment allowance. The scene in which little Timmy Price is verbally abused by other members of the club in front of his father during the tournament is so exaggerated that I'm embarrassed to look at him
