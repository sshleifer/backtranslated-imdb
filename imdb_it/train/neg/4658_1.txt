BRIEF ENCOUNTER is a horrible and useless remake of the 1945 David Lean classic, based on Noel Coward's play "Still Life". A doctor removes a grit particle from a woman's eye at a train station, is in a miserable relationship, is happily married a social worker of Italian descent. They meet by chance on another occasion, form an instant attraction and organize themselves to meet each Wednesday. The couple falls in love, but after spending a few afternoons together they realize that they don't have realistic possibilities of happiness and agree to part ways. The original game of a Coward act concerned two common people who fall in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two Super Stars and veterans of Hollywood Epics, are not the idea of ​​"ordinary people". In particular Loren is a mixed bag - Sophia Loren in full make-up, with a million dollar appearance, working as a part-time volunteer social worker at a Citizen Advice Bureau does not seem real. Burton, apparently upset, with dyed hair, wearing too much makeup and wearing wedges, doesn't look like your average family doctor. That said, you can't really blame them for having a relationship after seeing their spouses. Burton is married to a literary critic who spends his evenings writing poisonous reviews and who treats her husband with utter contempt. Loren's husband, Jack Hedley, ceramist around the house all day and it's too boring: the most exciting thing I've ever done is to have a relationship almost six years ago. Their final scene together will induce nausea, ("You've been very, very far away", etc.). That great British jobbing actor, John LeMesurier, has a three-minute cameo as a friend of Burton, and seems to be slightly drunk, uttering his lines with a barely audible voice. It's a sad and forgettable performance in a sad, terrible rehash of a cinema classic. Avoid at all costs.
