In Cold Blood it was one of the many films of the 1960s that created a new vision of violence in the Hollywood film industry. Capote coined the phrase "non-narrative novel" to describe the book on which this film is based, and the spirit of that form was reported in the script of the film, which he co-wrote. Despite the fact that we had a great time in the era of color film, Richard Brooks chose to present this film in black and white to emphasize both the crudeness of the landscape and the desolation of history. This is the first problem with the TV remake: color changes the tone of the story. Furthermore, the confinement of shooting a TV movie reduces the options on how frames are framed and focused. As a result, we lose the dramatic clash that makes the second part of the original film (police interviews, trial, imprisonment and execution) so claustrophobic. On the small screen, it's just another version of the Law and Order spin-offs. <br /> <br /> The search for Hollywood scripts continually brings back films that have been successful in another era. Usually, this is a mistake, and this is no exception. <br /> <br /> All actors are competent. The script is OK. The direction does not hinder. It's just that the movie doesn't work the same way as the original precision instrument. It does not engage the viewer with the ambivalence towards Smith and Hickock that the original film provokes. At the end of the TV version, we were left with the feeling: "I have bye, who cares?" <br /> <br /> See the original first, on as big a screen as you can, then watch the TV version simply to understand why the first was such a major film in 1967. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't hurt to even go online and read some of Capote and the original book. It will help you understand the extraordinary effort it has put into the material, and also some of the controversies surrounding both the book and the film. <br /> <br /> Actually I only gave a 4 because I saved the bottom 3 rankings for real bombs - the type that annoys you for being sucked into spending
