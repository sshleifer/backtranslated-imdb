I love the sexy action and science fiction films of the sixties, because of the actress who appeared in them. They found the sexiest women in these films and it didn't matter if they could act (remember "Candy"?). The reason I was disappointed in this film was because it wasn't nostalgic enough. The story here has a European science fiction film called "Dragonfly" in progress and the director is fired. So the producers decide to let a young aspiring director (Jeremy Davies) complete the film. I'm a real beautiful woman in the movie that plays Dragonfly but she barely keeps us. The film is written and directed by Roman Coppola who has used some of his father's exploits since his early days and included it in the script. I wish the film could be a tribute to those early films. They could have many cameos of actors who have appeared in them. There is an actor in this film that was popular in the sixties and in his Law of John Phillip (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell also appear. I think I will have to keep waiting for a director to pay a good tribute to the films of the sixties. If someone is reading this, "Make it as sexy as possible"! I'll wait!
