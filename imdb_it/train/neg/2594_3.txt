Even if it's a R-rated movie, I really doubt that you'll like it a lot unless you're a teenager <br /> <br /> Why? Because there is no real plot, no character development, no funny joke. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film has in abundance is nudity. Tons and tons of naked or almost naked chicks (the cute ones I could add) to feast on the eyes. <br /> <br /> I can't really understand why this movie has the title of American Pie since it's just a bad combination between an erotic film and a comedy without being able to be one of them. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see naked girls, but you're too shy to rent / buy an erotic movie. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1/10 for the 2 smiles I had throughout the movie and another 2/10 for the cute chicks
