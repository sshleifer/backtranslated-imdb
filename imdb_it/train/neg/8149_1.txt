What a bunch of absolute pants. Having read Chris Brookmyre's books religiously since I came across "Quite Ugly ...", I was happy to find out that this drama had been commissioned. <br /> <br /> Obviously I had too much confidence. <br /> <br /> Nesbitt is probably the best thing about this show - and he too is not entirely suitable. As anyone can read the book, and then adapt it to this piece of waste is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Entire figures have changed, the situations are abandoned and seeing the dramatic Parlablane intrusion to Nesbitt reduced by a quick chin up and sliding an open window ... brought me tears to the eyes. <br /> <br /> I am afraid of thinking about what will happen with "Country Of The Blind" if this is the point of reference ... <br /> <br /> Please, just avoid it ...
