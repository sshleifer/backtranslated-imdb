Yet another adventure in the realm of adolescent comedy, set on a university campus that shows the search for a nerd to coldness, and how he decides to blackmail a trio of famous athletes to get him the girl. Everything has been done before, and everything has been done in a much more satisfying way. The crude humor that made children's movies such as "American Pie" and "Dude! Where's My Car" so popular is completely foreign to the context in this installment, appearing so completely by chance that the viewer can only disapprove and disapprove. The film is poorly written and the actors never manage to make it even slightly bearable. I will not even give dignity to this terrible image by disclosing, because it is a waste of my time and yours. At best, the Slackers never manage to entertain or induce laughter, and at worst is terribly ugly and sometimes completely unwatchable. <br /> <br /> Jason Schwarzman, who impressed in his debut Rushmore, humiliates himself by appearing in this photo and wonders how a career can end up in the bathroom so quickly. Please avoid, please avoid. Save your money.
