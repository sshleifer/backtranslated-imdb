This is a werewolf blow done very cheaply. The video is dark and poorly lit. The audio is irregular and poorly recorded and mixed. The script is wild garbage with the usual characters like the hard detective who shoots werewolves with his silver gun! [naturally filled with silver bullets]. The acting is wooden like the characters. FXs are non-existent, lots of extreme close-ups of werewolf and biting jaws. the only thing that is shown is a lot of T&A soft-core. Instead of losing $ 30 for this tripe, take a look at a picture of the very recent Werewolf: "Dog Soldiers" with Sean Pertwee.
