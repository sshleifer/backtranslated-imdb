This must be the stupidest movie I've ever seen (spoilers ahead)! First of all, the plot is stupid. The boy is strange and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker. We find out that the child has a gift, the "Shining". This gift has never had anything to do except make the boy look fashionable. Then the film becomes more boring and boring until the man finally goes mad. He goes wild to kill the child and his wife because ... well, he wants to. Why else would he do it? Suddenly we see a naked woman in the tub. The man kisses her and realizes that he is kissing a dead corpse, which is absolutely disgusting. Somehow a black man enters the hotel and is hit with an ax. Then the child and the woman take the black vehicle and leave their father, who dies within minutes of hypothermia. Most movies are not a complete waste of time, but this falls just into that category. The music is poor, the characters are trivial (except for Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit, the ending is very predictable, the plot is slow, boring and boring. This film is extremely overrated. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS. I'm surprised he got such a high score on IMDb.
