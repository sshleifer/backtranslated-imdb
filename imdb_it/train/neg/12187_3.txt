De Niro Scorsese's worst collaboration in this horrible messy and violent mess. Scorsese is totally out of his element in this film with the clich√© of a suddenly blaring horror and telephone ring that seems laughable and embarrassing to come from a master craftsman. The cast is totally wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced. Nick Noltie plays the most reckless lawyer in history who will believe he can defend anyone! De Niro's psychotic Bowden is none other than the typical 90s psychopathic film. The scene with De Niro and Lewis at the beginning is very embarrassing and the climax goes on forever and we should all be more than tired of the psycho stalker who never dies. One of my most horrible cinematic experiences. Rent the original is 100 times better. <br /> <br />
