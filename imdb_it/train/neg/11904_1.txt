The End of Violence and certainly the Million Dollar hotel have hinted at the idea that Wenders has lost his vision, his ability to tell compelling stories through a moving film map. The Land of Plenty seals the coffin, I'm afraid, being a film largely devoid of imagination, obviously sentimental and clich√©. The characters are completely flat and stereotyped, the writing, the plot and the direction are, at best, amateur. For the first time in a while, I was eager to finish the film so I could get on with my life. Uncle's war-torn delirium, the patriotic abstract that stared at the conclusion ... it all seemed so simple and pathetic, barely the work of a filmmaker who had once created an irresistible magic on the screen. What happened? The days of experimentation, perceptive writing and interesting possibilities of recovery have been behind her for a long time, I'm afraid. We hope you find your inspiration ... At the Toronto Film Festival, where I saw the film, Wenders was there to present it. Completely devoid of humility, he offered us the following: "I hope ... no, wait ... SO that you will enjoy the next two hours". I'm afraid it couldn't be more wrong ...
