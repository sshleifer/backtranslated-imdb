Incredibly bad acting, a story not good, unclear and flashy images and slow movements where less is needed: the adrenaline is all that a film should not be. <br /> <br /> Georgina Verbaan (a so-and-so Dutch actress who did not attend her English lessons) plays the rich girl Freya, who has the habit of "looking for the thrill". Which in essence is doing dangerous stunts, breaks stuff and annoys people. And not in a fun way Jackass. Then there is Dracko (Rivas). He has a leading role in the group but has other illegal activities on the side. Then there is Freya's father (Lockyer), who also plays a debatable role. And finally, we have Jason (the novice Fyall), Freya's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> One day, Freya has disappeared and everyone seems to be involved but we, the spectator, don't really care how any of the cast is funny or believable, and the story doesn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> Why was this done? 2/10.
