I rate this movie with 3 skulls, only the girls knew how to scream, this could have been a better movie, if the actors were better, the twins were OK, I thought they were bad, but the older and younger brother, they sucked them really badly, they seemed to be reading the scripts instead of reciting them ... spoilers: if they are vampires because they freeze the blood? vampires can't drink frozen blood, the movie's sister says we drink it while it's alive ... but then, when they move to another house, they take a cooler that has frozen blood. end of the spoiler <br /> <br /> was a huge waste of time, and this made me angry coz I read all the reviews on how great this movie was, how many awards this movie won, and this movie it was f * *** I'm s ** t !!!!
