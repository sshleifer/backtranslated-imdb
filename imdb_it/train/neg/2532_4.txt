The cult of personality has elevated the status of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman etc. As king of B. Because the people of Crown International were so important, they were not elevated to the status they deserved fully. A film like THE VAN might now look like a single-use piece of Drive-in esoteric, but it was a considerable success when it was released (not to mention later re-releases as a dual function with other Crown achievements). <br /> <br /> THE VAN was a perfect example of Crown's successful strategy of capturing the mood of movie-goers when a movie was released. Here were sex, drugs, rock 'n roll and the short "Custom Van" fashion. As others have noted, it is ironic that the hit song in the film refers to a Chevy when the vehicle's title is a Dodge in the film itself. I had a small town of Selectman where at the time I even claimed that these vans were "burrows of sin on wheels!" A perfect advertising line for the film! <br /> <br /> There are the usual assortment of "good" and "bad" girls, muscular heads and low-voiced hijinks (including a supporting piece by Danny DeVito). In many ways this is not very different from the old Beach Party movies of the 1960s, but now seasoned with the use of drugs and nudity. Obviously made with a limited budget and a limited program, the film develops in a fairly pleasant way with a breezy charm that compensates, according to today's standards, for the non-PC visions of women. <br /> <br /> The classic touch is a toaster for Bobby's den of sin on wheels. Yes, a toaster! Hey, you got to have something warm for those munchies! <br /> <br /> Grindhouse Fest.
