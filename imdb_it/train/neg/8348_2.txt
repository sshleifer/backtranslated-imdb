I just finished watching "El Otro". I have always taken off the hat at the performances of Julio Chavez, since he is a great actor, but this film is really depressing and slow. I guess it would have been even worse if it hadn't been for Julio. However, this is definitely a movie you will never understand if you are not Argentinian, and even if you are, I would advise you not to rent this movie to have fun with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends ... it is really depressing and incredibly slow, and the plot doesn't make much sense either. Probably the director wanted to show the fragility of human life, but what he does is bore and impress the audience with scenes that shock you a little. It gives you something to think about, but not in a positive sense. Overall, I really didn't like this movie.
