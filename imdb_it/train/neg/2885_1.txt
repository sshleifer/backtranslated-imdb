I can't really say what I think of this movie, it's against the guidelines, I've seen a lot of movies, and this is still the worst, Extremely low budget, I guess all the money went to finish the slaughter scenes, because I could do I work better with an 8mm b / w camera and a crew of monkeys. It was so bad that I only registered to leave a comment, because I had to tell someone, renting a movie was not enough. But this is my value of 2 cents, I suggest you borrow it from a poor weak person who rented it and looked at it by itself. Because for sure I won't waste money on it again. Now I'll leave you with this comment. I hope you didn't make it to the rental place when they won't refund your money .. =)
