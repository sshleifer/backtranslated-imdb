... and be disappointed bigger than ever. I will not make any direct reference or anything here, but to put it mildly, this film is pathetic. If you are a trained military, don't worry about looking. I put it on the DVD with 2 friends who want to see a rather interesting action / war movie. Because I couldn't read the reviews before. <br /> <br /> Already at the first "bomb" scene, the film has enormous problems and continues to show and grow bigger. My 2 friends, unrelated to the military in any way identified a couple of director errors almost as fast as I did myself and asked if some of the things going on were realistic. Well, as you may have guessed, they are not at all. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie unless you are able to overlook these completely idiotic and recurring mistakes that are made. 2/10 for capturing my interest at the beginning.
