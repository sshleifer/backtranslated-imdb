There was nothing in this film that I liked. He was so obviously on a low budget, with poor lighting and camera work (almost like the Blair Witch Project, only it didn't have to be that way). There wasn't much to the plot, and the movie was just continuous drugs. Actually I made a quick advance in the last 1/3 of the films, but this didn't help much. It looks like it might be good from the box, but I have to say one more time: nothing about this movie looked like good either. No good actor, the special effects were so fake, the work with the camera was horrible and the dialogue was painfully terrible. On my personal scale, I give this movie a 0 out of 10. Yikes!
