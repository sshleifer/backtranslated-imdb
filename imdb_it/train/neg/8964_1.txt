Those who are familiar with the two previous Cube movies know more or less what they can expect: a small group of people trapped in a lot of trapped rooms, paranoia, bad acting ... This is a little different though. About half of the film takes place outside the cube, where we can observe people looking at people inside the cube (or at least five of them). I imagine that Cube Zero aspires to explain what dealing with the cube is, but we really don't know much more than what was covered in the first two films. Of course, there is a sort of explanation in there, but it feels rather lame compared to what was suggested in the first film. <br /> <br /> Cube Zero looks pretty cheap (like its predecessors), and the fact that it shows more than a couple of empty rooms only underlines this feeling. I am also quite confident in saying that there is no risk that none of the actors will win any prizes in the near future. They brought back traps from Cube 1, though, (I mean they are almost the same, which is a shame). <br /> <br /> I know that many people like this film and its connections with the first one, but I feel that it is a completely useless contribution to a franchise that was not so nice to begin with.
