Something wrong with Al Gore's theory (and its supporters) is the whole "consensus" thing. <br /> <br /> If there was such a consensus, why is it that "believers" "in the omnipotent global warming feel the irrepressible need to try and bully anyone who asks. <br /> <br /> Because anyone who does not support the global warming line is greeted with complacent accusations of being either stupid or on the payroll of oil companies (apparently being a professional global warming researcher does not mean that you are on anyone's payroll in that wonderful world. ..) Why is there a need to tell everyone how the whole question is solved, when it is the very nature of science to honestly question the hypotheses? For some ideas on the answer to these questions, read Prey of the well-known henchman oil producer Michael Crichton ... oh wait, he's rich and not on the payroll of the oil companies He just took a huge career risk in not following the Greens and other Kyot worshipers line or and told the truth as he searched for it. By the way, did you know that sticking to the Kyoto protocol would have resulted in almost no lowering of temperatures, according to his supporters? Just a few questions that Al Gore made sure to stay away from the fear of not getting every penny of the environmental lobby in case he decided to run again. <br /> <br /> So who's a minion ...?
