An absolutely terrible Mexican film based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe about a journalist who wants to enter the confines of a madhouse hidden in the woods to write a story about how it works, etc ... When our hero, Gaston, is given the great show by Dr. Maillard, head of the asylum, we see all kinds of things that should be horrible, like the men who run long in a dungeon, and comedies, like our hero who is joked by soldiers as he climbs on a ladder hanging from the side of a building. Then there is a view that could have been thought to be both: a human man dressed as a chicken, yes, he is really a chicken, pecking chicken feed on the ground. The scene had to be a comic highlight of the film, but, at least for me, it was the weak point of the film and really more revolting when you considered that adult men and women thought it could be even remotely funny. Ah! This is really the real horror that is Dr. Tarr and his Legion of Name Changes. And this leads me to this salient fact of the movie which is most films that undergo multiple title changes usually have some kind of serious problem. Yes, this is obvious, but some have distribution problems and others, of which this is one, have numerous changes to the title so that someone can buy the same garbage more than once. This is definitely rubbish. It has very little to offer. The only interpreter worthy of attention is Claudio Brook as head of the asylum. It is a huge slab of ham as it laughs maniacally, orders of bellows, sashays with the sword in hand, and praises the chicken. I was so tired of hearing him talk about the "soothing system" as a means of treating the mentally ill. What a pile of playfulness (Hey, a film like this with a script like this deserves this kind of words). It won't take long to understand what is happening in the asylum, nor will it be more interesting. Chicken film scratch!
