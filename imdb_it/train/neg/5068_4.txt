I am stunned to discover the amount of fans of this show. I never said that Friends was, at best, an "average" sitcom, and not exceptional as others have done. Let's face it, if it wasn't for the casting of Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, then who knows if this show would have lasted so long. I very much doubt it. Even though the series progressed, friends became increasingly predictable, lame and boring that I didn't care less about the characters - those who are the most overrated in TV history - or their situation, or who was sleeping with whom. And it became fun in the first four seasons. And even when he had all these Hollywood actors in the film world, I still didn't bother to tune in. The script of Friends became stale and I lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and for the finale, well it was predictable to say the least. <br /> <br /> What was annoying was that it lasted for ten seasons, while some of my favorite programs lasted only three, four seasons for example and eventually they were erased and the air removed forever. The show should have stopped immediately when the cast wanted higher salaries. In truth, although the series had diminished, the show was bigger than the actors themselves, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> When it ended in 2004, I was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom. Now, there is talk of a reunion show for friends that will soon come to our TV screens. And yet, I will not be the first to wait.
