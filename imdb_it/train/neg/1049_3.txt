This film has a very Broadway atmosphere - the background, the acting, the "noise" - yet it is all it has. A little "sense" of Broadway without a bang. <br /> <br /> The film has a slow rhythm, the image is disjointed, the song "opens" on you, so that suddenly you are reminded that it is a musical. <br /> <br /> Disappointing: Sinatra <br /> <br /> Intolerable: Sinatra's boyfriend --- surely, the tone and accent of his voice were not necessary. <br /> <br /> Tolerable: Mr "I remember the numbers on my dice" <br /> <br /> Delight: underrated chant of Brando (very biased!) <br /> <br /> Surprise: how much Jean Simmons resembles Vivien Leigh in his scenes of Havana. It's the bone structure! How I would have killed for seeing Miss Leigh in a role that still challenged Brando.
