I saw this movie last year in middle class and I have to say that I really hated it. I was in year 10 (and 15 years) so it could have something to do with it. But for English this year, 11th, we had to read Animal Farm, also by George Orwell. Apart from the fact that the book is based on revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book, and I hated it too. <br /> <br /> But 1984, I think it was the most disturbing film I've ever seen, and I think George Orwell is one of the most unbalanced people I've ever lived on this planet. I feel sorry for everyone who loved his job, but unfortunately I didn't. The themes of the film were well represented, but the way in which the entire film was set and the events that took place inside it did not conform to my standards. This is just my opinion, and I'm sure many other people have really enjoyed this movie.
