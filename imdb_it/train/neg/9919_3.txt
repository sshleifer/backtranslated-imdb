In the opening scene of "Malta Story" Mr. A. Guinness had a similar resemblance to Noel Coward that I expected his first words to be "Some women need to hit regularly - like gongs" or a little tired world. Unfortunately his dialogue is not prose without death and even the Master would have had difficulty bringing it to life. In fact, Mr. Guinness wanders through the image as if he were looking for a focal point and could not find one. And here is the fatal weakness of the whole film. Mr. J. Hawkins also gives up soon and ends up giving a "Jack Hawkins" performance without an ounce of individuality. It may have been featured by a dozen British war movies. Many of the early fifties the usual suspects show up and make their schtick for very little purpose. The Luftwaffe failed to bomb Malta into submission in much the same way that it failed to bring London to its knees. The courage of the Maltese people in the face of incessant danger was recognized by the king and the island was awarded the cross of George. Worthy subject you could think of for a movie, but "Malta Story" doesn't even qualify for the term "worthy" in its most paternalistic sense. It gives the appearance of being hurriedly crowded to meet a deadline, perhaps before the actors lose the will to live.
