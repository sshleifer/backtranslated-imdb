It sucks. That's all I have to say about this sorry excuse for a movie. It sucks. It sucks. It sucks. I mean, what the hell were they thinking? The idiots involved should never be allowed to make another film. The acting was so bad that he couldn't even entertain at the wrong level. The attempt at a "lesbian scene" was sad. I felt so bad for the women involved. This movie sucks! Sucks! I sucked! <br /> <br /> I've heard rumors about a sequel. <br /> <br /> God <br /> <br /> Help <br /> <br /> We <br /> <br /> All
