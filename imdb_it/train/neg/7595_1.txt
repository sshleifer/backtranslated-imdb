"Ask the Dust" seemed intriguing from the trailer, and we especially like all the actors. Unfortunately, the film was not convincing enough to be considered a drama, and it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy. He practically seemed to satirize himself and without any fun effect. After seventy minutes of waiting for this thing to improve, my wife and I left, considering that we hadn't lost any more time with this nonsense. It simply wasn't interesting, moving, funny or artistic. It looks like it was written, produced and directed by a high school boy; worse, it was a shameful waste of otherwise extraordinarily talented actors, not to mention our time and money.
