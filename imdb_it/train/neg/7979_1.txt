This film was slow but boring and the acting often drifted into the land of ham. The character of Redgrave was not as attractive as the woman something 60 trying to compete with Thurman's 20 for the love of the Fox character (because he's beyond me). The film's title should have been "Shallow people on the lake". The actors played as if they were in a dress rehearsal. A terribly predictable ending to the boot. I can't believe this is on this site like a comedy!
