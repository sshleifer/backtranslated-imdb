This complete movie mess was directed by Bill Rebane, the man partly responsible for the infamous anti-classic Monster a-Go Go. As I was nearing the end of The Cold, I came to the incredible conclusion that this movie was actually even worse than in the 1960s. History ?? as is ?? speaks of three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to their remote villa to play a series of macabre games. Whoever manages to keep up the pace and survive to the end will win $ 1,000,000. It is a very simple plot, but Rebane somehow still manages to make the proceedings to the limit of the incomprehensible. Things happen. The characters are completely forgotten. Nothing makes too much sense. And then it ends. Strangely. I mean, what the hell was this all over exactly? I guess you're left to make your own conclusions. Production values ​​and acting are undoubtedly a pornographic film standard. In truth Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) is not even so beautiful. It is so incredibly terrible that it is irresistible. Unfortunately we can't say the same thing about this lousy as a whole, it's just a basement jokes.
