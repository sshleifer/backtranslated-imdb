The original was a good movie. I bought it on tape and watched it several times. And even though I know the sequels aren't usually as good as the original, I certainly didn't expect a bomb like that. The romance was flat, the view was old, the spoken humor was not. This may not have been the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's getting closer.
