I will only be vague about my potential spoiled comments. There are enough plot elements in this film that it is essentially pre-ruined. <br /> <br /> This film draws some ideas from a Southern classic, To Kill A Mockingbird. I suppose maybe TKOM has had his ideas from some source ... anyway, after seeing this, you will say "Oh yes, it's a loathing". <br /> <br /> I think the real The funny thing about these McMovies is once you've identified an element of the plot, it's figuring out whether they will stay with the original, or try turning it. Not many twists in this one.
