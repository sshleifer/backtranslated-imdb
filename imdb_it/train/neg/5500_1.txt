This film strives, but the fun of the 1960s TV series is completely lacking, which I'm sure people remember fondly. Even though I'm 17, I watched some of the series on YouTube a long time ago and it was fun and entertaining. Unfortunately, this film does not do justice to the series. <br /> <br /> The special effects are rather below standard, and this has not been helped by flat-work-work. Even the script was boring and lacked a sense of wonder and humor. Other films with under-par scripts are Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat, Thomas and Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion. <br /> <br /> Now I will say that I liked the idea of ​​the story, but unfortunately it was poorly executed and it ran out too soon, and honestly I'm not sure why this is something for the family to enjoy. And the talking dress bothered me, despite the lively vocal work of Wayne Knight. <br /> <br /> But the thing that irritated me most about this movie is that it wasted the talents of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah, all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels has already made some good performances, but he didn't seem to have the slightest idea what he should have done, and the character of Elizabeth Hurley was sadly considered useless. Daryl Hannah is a lovely and generally ignored actress, and I liked the idea that she is the love interest, but unfortunately you see very little of her, (not to mention the probable attack by Monster that scares children that they wither ) in the same way as Wallace Shawn as a kind of government agent. Christopher Lloyd recovers better, and as an actor I really like Lloyd (he was in two of my favorite films, Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and I'm passionate about Back To The Future), but he was given little to work, and I have had a tendency to exaggerate wildly enough. <br /> <br /> Overall, as much as I wanted this film, I was not impressed. Instead of being fun, it seemed pointless, and it's a shame because it had great potential, with some talented actors and a good idea, but wasted with a bad performance. 1/10 Bethany Cox
