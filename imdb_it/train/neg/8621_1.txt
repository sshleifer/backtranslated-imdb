The previous poster obviously worked in the film. It's a joke how bad it is and nobody should see this kind of film like he did. Questioning all the names of the actors and what they were previously is a clear sign that he is involved in some way. <Br /> <br /> It's on Cinemax right now and I was sure it was a movie where the porn stars (the one called Ava is gorgeous and well endowed) were forced to do something else for a crazy reason tax. <br /> <Also, when I saw it for the first time, I was sure it was made in 1986, and I was born in '73, so I thought I knew what I was talking about ... but no ... was made in 1993 !! Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> Even if I would call it one of those bad ones, it's a good movie. Like watching a train wreck.
