(Avast, slightly spoiler ahead) I received this tape from my local library, which keeps a copy for obvious reasons. <br /> <br /> I once went to the town of Matewan, in West Virginia, and to a small museum there I saw the program for the citra of the municipal theater in May 1954. The films would change every day at the theater . Since there would be no TV for about another decade in these parts, this was a large part of the entertainment available in the city. "The Raid" seems to have been made for cities like Matewan in the 1950s. Although he wasn't listed for that month, I'm sure he showed us some Monday or Tuesday night for an audience that probably wasn't too demanding. The historic raid - bold and remarkably successful - does not seem to have been very well studied, so the film is full of Hollywood embellishments, including a loose cannon played by Lee Marvin. Marvin takes advantage of the opportunity to practice the Liberty Valance. And St. Albans seems to have had more Yankee soldiers who came and traveled through the city than it did Washington D.C. <br /> <br /> What really made me laugh when the bandits turned into their confederate uniforms. Only in the picturesque paintings of the Civil War do the rebel uniforms seem so pristine. When Anne Bancroft's son takes Van Heflin in his uniform just before the raid, I expected the boy to think it was Halloween. <br /> <br /> And then there's Anne Bancroft herself. While watching the movie, I actually watched the IMDb to see if there was a second Anne Bancroft. The actress of the then studio does not resemble her subsequent films and does not have the presence she would later have in "The Miracle Worker", "Agnes of God", and of course "The Graduate". <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing if only 1). live in St. Albans and 2). you have a couple of hours to kill on a Hollywood fiction of the greatest news in your hometown.
