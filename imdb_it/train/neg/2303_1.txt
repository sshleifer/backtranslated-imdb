Except that people apparently buy in this trash! As shows like "Moral Orel" have shown, even if you tried to make the most exaggerated and exaggerated parody of evangelism that you could ever imagine, it wouldn't come close to the hilarity of this show. It's hard to say what happens even when you're watching it. Is it a newsletter? A talk show? Who knows !? They begin to report on various international news articles, but at apparently random points, the news is interrupted by this strange little man similar to a troll with a forehead bigger than his whole face, mumbling and laughing and generally being fearful. <Br /> <br /> Pat Robertson doesn't even look like a bad guy at first sight. It looks just like an old and harmless old coot stuck in its archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents). But this is a man who asked for a murder, who made friends and offered help to no one, but TWO murderous dictators, who illegally used money to donate cutting mines, who SUSPENDED forced abortions in China, and which regularly implies that Caucasians (particularly American Caucasian males) are superior to all other races. <br /> <br /> However, it would be all fun, except that apparently has a fan base big enough to keep his little show on 40 years later (or that, or enough money to bribe some TV executives who they don't care what they show). The idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people, somewhere, have to look at it and hold on to every word. Even when Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is, people still listen to him. I don't know if it's funny or scary. I imagine a healthy mixture of both.
