"Raising Victor Vargas" is one of those light family movies that you can watch and do the N.Y crossword. Times at the same time. And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a Corona, you don't have to "pause" the DVD. Let it move, because you won't miss anything really important. No turning, turning or tension. It is not an ethnic film, it is a film about a poor and struggling immigrant family that seems to be Latin. They could have been any ethnic group. It made very little difference. I've seen it all a million times before. Just connect a Jewish family, an Italian family, a black family or an Irish family. Only the accents and names were different. If the Vargas family were called Bush or Clinton and it was Presbyterian, the film would have been a total nap. <br /> <br /> It's funny that critics here aren't able to correctly interpret the settings. Some said it was the Spaniard Harlem. Some the Bronx and another Brooklyn. As a New Yorker for life, I vote for the Lower East Side. And it seemed that the family had never met anyone, except for other Latinos. They lived in a small isolated / isolated enclave. Some interactions with non-Latins may have created excitement, interest or tension. Remember West Side Story? <br /> <br /> And now for the often criticized cinematography. I don't know if it was my TV or something, but all the indoor shots looked very ORANGE to me. The apartment, the furniture and the faces were all ORANGE. What should it have meant? And the apt. it seemed rather cramped. Someone here said that the old apartments / apartments had very large rooms. Well, maybe 50 years ago. What landowners have done is to break a large app into 2 or 3 tiny ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can. <br /> <br /> And another annoying thing .... This is the second family movie I've seen and criticized this week when there was a teenager masturbating. Is this private sexual act necessary for us to watch? Please save me! What happens to these directors? <br /> <br /> So "Victor Vargas" is a nice little movie. It was nice for a change to see the young Latin actors give a break and the chance to show their talents, which they did. But the writers have disappointed them, giving them a flat and not spectacular script to work with. Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers close to the "fast forward" button.
