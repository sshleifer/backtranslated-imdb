I think they really let the quality of DVD production slip by. I rented this DVD from 2 movie stores and the second time I finally played it in the third DVD player I tried. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else have this problem? It is really difficult to give the film an unbiased review after going through such a nuisance to interpret it. First, I have never seen a Finnish horror film before, so I was a little tired of the fact that the film was made in English. Also, since it is never clarified what is wrong with Sarah, it came out as delayed and so I really hoped someone would shoot her in the face and make all the horrible events disappear.
