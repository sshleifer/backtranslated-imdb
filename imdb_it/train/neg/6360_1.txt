Can I get my $ 13.00 back? I would have preferred to see "Hydropower arrives in North America". Yet. This is a one-voice movie. The same voice, which comes from the mouth of every character regardless of age or sex. To listen to that voice again I should upload at least $ 150 per hour. And I don't take insurance. It was strange to see Will Ferrell turn into Woody. But I don't think imaginative casting is enough. You should expect them to have a story before they worry about making a movie. Unless he's doing it just for the money. And if this is the reason why it is not enough to re-issue an All-Rap version of "What's up Tiger Lily?"
