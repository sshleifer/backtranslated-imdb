The reason why the DVD releases of this film are in black and white is because nobody can get their hands on a color print of this public film, a modest sea story at best. <br /> <br /> Distributed for television through the Allies Artists, DVDs (or VHS) on the market right now for this title all come from the same 16MM television press. The films distributed for television before 1963 were often distributed in b / w prints, because most of the spectators had no set of colors. The impressive black and white prints for television were also cheaper, as they often included some prints to cover all the stations that broadcast a film on a syndicated basis.
