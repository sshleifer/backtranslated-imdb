Band Camp was awful, The Naked Mile was a little better, and this third DVD movie in the American Pie franchise looks like the same quality as its predecessor. Basically Erik Stifler (John White) separated from his girlfriend after losing his virginity, and now he and Mike 'Cooze' Coozeman (Jake Siegel) join Erik Dwight's cousin (Steve Talley) in college. With the promise of many parties, plenty of alcohol and enough chicks in the Beta House, they only have fifty tasks listed to become privileged official members. But a threat is in sight with rivals, GEK ("Geek") House, led by a power hungry nerd (and a shagger of sheep) Tyrone Savage that offers something bigger and better than Beta's. To fix it once and for all, Beta and Gek enter into battle with the Bannati, for forty years, the Greek Games to fight each other, with the loser moving. The latest champion of the games, Noah Levenstein aka Jim's Dad (the only regular Eugene Levy) runs the show, which sees people drop bras, a gladiator duel floating on water, catching an anointed pig, Russian roulette in mouth with cartridges of aged horse semen, wife who carries and drinks a barrel full of alcohol (with non-disqualifying vomit). Everything comes suddenly to death, with a guy who gets a stripper dancing, and they must resist cumming, Beta House's victory when Edgar comes with a girl dressed as a sheep on his knees. Starring Flubber's Christopher McDonald as Mr. Stifler, Meghan Heffern as Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as Bull, Nic Nac as Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italy Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert as Sara Coleman, Sarah Power as Denise, Andreja Punkris as Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Rock. The amount of nudity is slightly increased, as well as the coarseness of the jokes, and I could assume that one out of five stars is evaluated, but I like it. Adequate!
