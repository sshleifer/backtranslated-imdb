In the unlikely event that some aspiring directors are reading these comments, I would like to offer some (free!) Advice, from an observer's point of view. If you want to make an exotic adventure movie, do it. If you want to make a parody of exotic adventure films, go ahead. DO NOT try to do both at the same time, it doesn't work. For example, having a funny "comic relief" character killed and beheaded and following him with a monkey who shakes a tree and dropping a coconut on a cannibal's head makes you feel like you don't have IDEA what kind of movies you wanted to make. This is boring, meandering, cheap, racist ... get the picture. A couple of clever moments and some glimpses of Kathy Shower's nudity (which are too perfect here) are worth little. There is a reason why everyone has forgotten the existence of this film. (* 1/2)
