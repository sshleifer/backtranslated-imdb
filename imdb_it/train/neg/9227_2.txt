CQ was the worst movie I saw this year. Almost every movie I choose to see in the theater is at least fun or has something to say. This film seemed to have been directed by a film student for his introduction. to the cinema class. His father makes great films. His sister made a good one. But brother Roman? NO! A critic had the audacity to compare this film with Le MÃ©pris (contempt) of Godard. While Coppola, Jr. made the same idea, a film about the film, he tried too hard to appear European, artistic and witty, when it's all really just kitsch. The main actor brings the same expression through the entire film, as if he was either amazed or shocked that the film was filmed around him. Schwartzman somehow manages to pull off his role as a flaming director. Depardieu is fine. The only scene that has a real humor of the film is, surprisingly, not the scenes of the film B, but rather the one that takes place in Italy; a montage of shots of various characters in a very small car, going around collecting and dropping random people. This was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema that I'm trying to guess. Or rip off. Or both. The documentary with the protagonist who talks to the camera and takes up various objects has been reproduced, the ending has been tagged for the sake of a "twist" or artistic value ... I suppose the most amusing thing about this film was the film itself , and not in the way it is intended. No wonder this film was sent back after a screening of the festival to be reissued or republished or something else, which makes me curious to know how bad it was before. I can't believe it could have been worse than that. If you want to see a good parody of the movie, take a look at the Austin Powers movies. Some of them Opening up to the third is more fun and more brilliant than this whole movie. Lil 'Romy, for the sake of cinema, PLEASE go back to directing your cousin's music videos. Leave the godfathers to dad.
