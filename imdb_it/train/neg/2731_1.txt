Really bad and easily the worst episode I've ever seen .... always. <br /> <br /> They tried to fix it by giving us the "we know we're doing this" routine. It would have been funny if it hadn't been for the fact that "The Simpsons" had already done it. And it still wouldn't compensate if they had the idea in the first place. <br /> <br /> The flashbacks took place as part of the usual fantasies of the character (mainly JD). The flashbacks weren't even real events, just compilations to say, JD falling or, I don't know ... Elliott falling down. If I wanted to watch a compilation of Scrubs I'd go to youtube and not waste half an hour of my life. <br /> <br /> Scrubs eventually fell into the trap that most sitcoms have to do, and disappoint me, they managed to go 5 and a quarter of a season without an episode like this. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that scrubs shouldn't be that kind of sitcom. And just like a passing thought, why the hell was Dr. Calvo?
