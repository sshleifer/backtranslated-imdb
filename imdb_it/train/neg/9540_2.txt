The only reason to see this film is for a brilliant performance by Thom-Adcox Hernandez which is underutilized in the film within the film. As usual, Tom Villard is also good. Otherwise it is c ** p. Does the possesor not even exist as magically changes the letters on the theater pavilion to write "The Possessor"? Boring.
