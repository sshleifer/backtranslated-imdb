I hated the way Mrs. Perez portrayed the Puerto Ricans! We are not all ghettos - and we speak Spanish - not Puerto Rican! I can't speak for the ignorant people you met. But our language is intact, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is better off economically than any other Caribbean island! Am I glad that we are not like Cuba, Dominican Republic or Haiti, free from American influence? Free in real poverty, not in US standards of poverty. We are not victims of resilient, humble, honest and intelligent people. Our ancestry includes strong African roots, but not "black" roots - I have nothing in common with American blacks in research). <br /> <br /> The analogy between Pedro Albizu, Che Guevarra and Martin L. King could MLK was a great hero a true revolutionary - an honest man who saw a day when we would all be free <br / > <br /> Che Guevarra helped Castro create the Cuba it is today, that's why the boats full of Cubans risk their lives to come to America - why did Che make it such a better place for them? You had a great idea, fantastic and brilliant but you have politicized it too. We have so many things to be proud of as people - don't bring shame to our people by being victimized. I'm not a Nuyorican and maybe that's why I can't share your opinions. I am Puerto Rican, I speak Spanish, I am not a victim and I managed to achieve many of my goals in America. If there is a part 2 in the future - less political than history plus triumph stories - there are many. <br /> <br /> Damaris Maldonado
