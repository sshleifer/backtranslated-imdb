I give this film a prop that is very well done and reasonably well acted. BUt I could not overcome the implausibility of the whole affair. <br /> <br /> First of all, a game built around the notion of "Russian Roulette" which must occupy the hour. the big problem is that if you are doing a "live" show, you run the chance that your first competitor is the unlucky enough one to draw the "real" bullet. so what do you do? You have 50 minutes of show to fill and nothing to show. The corollary is that it's fine, you get to the end and the first five competitors survive, which means that the number six has the bullet and can't get the payment. At that point he won't shoot himself, so it's a bit anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> second problem, almost as big. Human nature. People retreat, they panic, dirty underwear and do things that otherwise would not make a good television. Too much randomness. This is why television reality "reality" is actually strictly written and even more closely modified. <br /> <br /> (The only random thing is the rant of the "performance artist" on female sacrifices, which in reality were rare historically. predictable, since it went on to shoot without any effect.) <br / > <br /> We are led to believe that the ratings of the shows would increase as it went on at 1 am (unlikely) with the Asian girl token announcing any upgrades in the ratings. <br /> <br /> A point about race and sex. Big surprise for the films that two minors (one gay) and two female competitors are the ones that survive. So we stayed with the two white males and, of course, their slightly less pleasant appearance is what buys them. The purpose of such a show would be randomness, but the guy you like least is the dying guy. <br /> <br /> Climax is that after spending two hours fighting for television suicide, the character of Eva Mendes (Mendes has produced and acted in this thing, so she has no one to blame herself). In reality the consciousness grows when someone dies. What did he think was going to happen? She is immediately struck by an angry spectator for the whole affair (the reasons are never explained) and the show continued to be a great success. Really? <br /> <br /> the problem with media satire is that it must have some basis in reality or it must be so exaggerated as to be ridiculous (like the Net). This is neither of them.
