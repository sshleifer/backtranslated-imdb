While some performances were good, Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau and the two Italian girlfriends came to mind: the story was lame and derivative, the emphasis on the girl's racial background was awkwardly managed at best, and relatives were mostly portraits as stereotypes, not as real people. I found myself shaking uncomfortably in many moments that should have been fun. I can barely understand why the local newspaper here in San Francisco said this is a good movie and I ask WHO who published the brilliant review here on IMDb. Very disappointed with this film, and madly, I actually went to a theater to see it, based on the wrong connection with Garden State, which is a much more entertaining, more inventive and touching film than this. I must mention in particular the emotional climax in the church, which was so wooden and from the numbers that I almost left, and some in the audience actually DO. That was followed by a stupid cemetery climax, which I saw 10 minutes before it happened. I really don't like being led to spend my money so unnecessarily.
