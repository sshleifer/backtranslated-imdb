** Possible spoilers in advance ** <br /> <br /> Gerald Mohr, a busy film actor B during the forties and fifties, leads an expedition to Mars. Before arriving at the Red Planet we are entertained by romantic chatter between Mohr and the scientist Nora Hayden; resident doous Jack Kruschen; and the sight of Les Tremayne as another scientist with a goat's beard. The Martian exteriors are characterized by fake backdrops and shades ranging from red to pink ?? - the "Cinemagic" process touted in advertisements. Really fantastic monsters include a gigantic amoeba, a three-eyed insect creature, a huge-sized fly trap and the unforgettable mouse / bat / spider. The whole bizarre adventure is remembered by the survivor Hayden under the influence of hypnotic drugs. Rumor has it that the ARABIC RED PLANET followed a certain cult, and probably gathered most of its adherents during the psychedelic sixties.
