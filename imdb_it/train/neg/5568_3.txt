Dolph Lundgren plays a former policeman / boxer looking for the whimsical Boston scene to find out who killed his brother, who was well thought out in the community, however, in the way he learns how his brother enjoyed vicious sex and that a serial killer is fault. Dolph Lundgren is very good in this film, in fact based on his performance here, one might forget that the rise to fame of Lundgren involved action roles. Having said that the material does not give Lundgren anything to work with, in fact Lundgren is completely left dry in a sad thriller that is both predictable and incomprehensible. The co-star Danielle Brett is also good, in fact the film works best when it focuses on the chemistry of Lundgren and Brett, in fact the film has had time to explore their relationship, the film would have been pretty decent. However the film is lackluster, the action is non-existent, the plot has not given enough exploration (Too boring B.S around Lundgren's investigations into his brother's employer) and the film is unnecessarily gory and ridiculous. Once again, Lundgren is really very good (like the newcomer Danielle Brett), but the film simply goes from one sequence to another, which makes this film particularly disappointing. If nothing else, it shows how underrated Lundgren is as an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 Out Of 4- (Poor)
