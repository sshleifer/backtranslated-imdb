In the recent movement to bring Asian films to America, this is THE LAST film that should be released here. Being a big fan of Asian movies of all genres, I was surfing the net and came across this soong to be republished in the US market, so I decided to try it first and rent it at a local video store. <br /> <br /> Trust me ... the action scenes are incredibly disappointing, Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey have completely wiped this film out of the water. Jet Li fell asleep watching the combat sequences. If you're looking for martial arts entertainment, your time would be better with a Jackie Chan movie !!! <br /> <br /> Also ... do you think you're going to see martial arts with a girl swallowed up in revenge for the death of her parents BUT SURPRISE !!! A good hour of this film in the middle is full of dialogues, an absence of action, the lack of a tangible plot, almost nothing to do with the premises to which we are exposed. He has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy, and the boy with his conspiracy group in which the producer / director did not devote time to elaboration, and yet he devoted a part of the film to the problem. It would have been much better if they had just cut that whole now and developed the story by itself through another film and focused on the martial arts aspect. By the way, I don't really think that Iron Monkey choreographer did the action sequence in Princess Blade. I was completely insulted by the frequent use of slow motion and rapid camera changes to portray the assassins' physical speed. I just didn't buy it. <br /> <br /> Please ... I warn you NOT to LOSE your time / money with this movie. The premise is intriguing and the trailer might even tempt you but I am sure that this film is NOT suitable for the public (perhaps in Japan but not in the United States) and will be the worst film brought to the States by the Asian industry.
