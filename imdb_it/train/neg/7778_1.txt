This must be the most monstrous, the most stupid, the most retarded monster of all time. It's a complete joke that has even emerged in theaters. This is a bit like looking at the Loch Ness monster in rural America. This film deserves to be thrown into a bathroom and completely forgotten. John Carradine, shame on you. People involved in this garbage mess must be lobotomized. Wait! Maybe I'm giving them too much credit. I'm sure they were lobotomized before shooting. How else can you explain the absolute and pure stupidity that this bucket of shit contains. Don't waste a minute of your life watching it. Don't waste your time by sending a review.
