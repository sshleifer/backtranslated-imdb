*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> When I saw it today I had some expectations of how it would have been, not too high, but not low either. But it was not at all what I expected, it seems to me that the producers cannot make up their minds about what kind of films to make. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film it is a bit mysterious and a little exciting, but soon I will change to some ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes ... As I looked over I fell asleep a couple of times. <br /> <br /> The ending is the most ridiculous of all though, almost splatter / comedy ... <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that it doesn't have some good scenes, it's just that the film never becomes "integer". <br /> <br /> 4/10 Movie-Man
