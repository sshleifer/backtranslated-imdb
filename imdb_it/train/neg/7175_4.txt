This may have been based on historical events, and we know that the creators of this TV documentary drama have taken liberties to make it more dramatic - I can live with it - but it was so badly done! I was amazed by the possibility of a mid-air crisis opening up, how calm everyone seemed, surely someone would have panicked, and what a smooth flight, no discomfort for the apparent passenger - come on! I'm not sure of the rules, nowadays some of the things about aviation safety seem OTT nonsense, but because taking off your shoes before the emergency landing, common sense tells me it's not a good idea! The shots of this huge airliner that descended on this remote landing strip were not convincing and fake. Actually it would have been a fantastic sight seen from the ground nearby, in this film it was disproportionate and looked like the model it probably was. Escape slides appeared in front and half of the emergency doors, but no one appeared to leave the front, even though the fall was much lower. The Captain is back on the plane after landing - why? this has never been explained. We know that the emergency landing was due to the lack of fuel, but even in this case there had to be some fuel lurking at the bottom of the tanks, and the risk of explosion had to be a very real danger, yet the evacuation it seemed almost pleasant and everyone wandered around the foot of the escape slides instead of getting as far as possible, as I'm sure I would have. There were too many inconsistencies, errors and simulated actions in this. I would have preferred to see a representation of the drama in real time and with the realistic movement of the portrait plane. It had the potential to be quite electrifying, but no doubt due to failed budget restrictions, and it hinted that a plane losing all its engines was not a big problem, and it would have slipped down a slightly bumpy landing. but no real danger! - reality is obviously a bit different!
