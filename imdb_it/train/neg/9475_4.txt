Wonderfully photographed and skillfully acted, in general, but the writing is very slipped. There are scenes of such unbelief that there is no joy in looking. The fact that the young lover has a twin brother, for example, is so ingenious that I complained loudly. And even the "connection with emotional light bulb" seems deceptive. <br /> <br /> I don't know, though. If you have a couple of glasses of wine and you want to relax with something nice to look at with some flabby comic scenes, this is a pretty good movie. No effort is required from the viewer. But the Italian film, in particular the Italian comedy, is usually much, much better than that.
