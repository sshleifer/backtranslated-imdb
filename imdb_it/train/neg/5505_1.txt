Shazbot, it's embarrassing. Indeed, here is a list of 100 that constitutes the embarrassment: 1.) a failed return of Christopher Lloyd. 2.) Jeff Daniels practically played the same role he played in the live remake of the 101 Dalmatians that wasn't too juicy to start with. He certainly has a fun way to promote his Purple Rose Theater ... 3.) Disnefluff. 4.) another disappointing reminder that Wallace Shawn is for Disney what Jet Li was for Bob Hoskins in Unleashed. 5.) Ray Walston, the original Martian of the TV series, played a little (read "cameo") in this film and died two years later of lupus. Coincidence? 6.) terrible special effects. Seriously - terrible. 7.-100.) That damn speech, handful of rushes doubly voiced by Wayne Knight ("Newman!"). My favorite scene? HAS! Hahaha! Ha ha ha ha ha ... Wow! ... Well. You - You're a prankster. Okay, let's finish this review with a moment of silence for the dying death of this franchise, and if you want, you can say a quick prayer that Disney doesn't forget this disguise and do something silly like a film adaptation of "Mork and Mindy" played by Tim Allen ............................................. .. ..........
