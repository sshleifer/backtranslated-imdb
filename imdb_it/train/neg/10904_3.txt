I took this film expecting a few laughs, hoping to have fun, but I was seriously wrong. This film showed really minimal moments of humor and the pathetic jokes made me shudder with the shame of having hired him ... Looking at a age group between 10 and 15, this film will surely leave viewers outside these borders feeling very dissatisfied. It is worth no more than 3 highly discouraged votes for anyone who does not want to waste 2 hours of their lives.
