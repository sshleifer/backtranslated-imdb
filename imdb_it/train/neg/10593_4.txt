Ed Wood's infamous Plan 9 "classic" presents an indignant foreigner who calls the human race, "... stupid! Stupid, stupid stupid!" I should say that exhibition A in that process would probably be this film, a ridiculous stupid science fiction film. <br /> <br /> The falling action star Jean Claude Van Damme returns to play a leading role in the original film, Luke, a former universal soldier who now works making really good soldiers. While Van Damme was too big to resume the role in the first two sequels, he was too small to do anything else before the fourth film of the Universal Soldiers series arrived. So, probably swearing under his breath all the time, he kicks and grunts and frowns at the ninety minutes of karate explosions and kicks. You will discover a lot of senseless violence, but I would advise you to check your coat for your brain at the door when you start looking at this thing. Otherwise, it's likely that you forget where you left off when it's over. <br /> <br /> Luke is summoned against other Universal Soldiers after a really REALLY wicked computer called Seth (makes HAL sound like Ghandi) transforms all the other universal soldiers into evil and ruthless killers. Obviously this is what these things are programmed to do, but in this case they are killing their creators, not "the enemy", so this is a problem. <br /> <br /> I love the stupid logic of this movie. Logic that believes that a supercomputer would create a body for itself that seems to be ashamed as Michael Jai White does in this film. A logic that establishes that Seth's creator is a cyber-stereotyped blue-haired geek who throws clicks of Old Faithful more often. The logic that has a climatic struggle of karate has as protagonists two characters who kick each other through ten shattered glass panes within three minutes of time. <br /> <br /> The film also features an endangered daughter, wrestler Bill Goldberg as a wrestler disguised as a universal soldier, and a love affair so attached, I must think that writers who thought they were against novels they were actually a good thing. And when this movie ends, it ends. Not a minute later a gigantic and gigantic explosion in final style are the running credits. No epilogue, not where I am now, no final kiss, just explosion, hug, over. Even the creators want to get out of this as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Even if it is not Plan 9, US: TR is a silly nonsense of an action movie that would be fun in noisy parties. Van Damme fans who love to see their hero reach really new depth. Don't be seen on a severe stomach.
