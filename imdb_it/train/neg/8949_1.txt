A few weeks ago, I read the classic George Orwell novel, 1984. I was fascinated by it and thought it was one of the best books I read recently. So when I rented the DVD, I was intrigued to see how this fit was measured. Unfortunately, the film has not even come close to creating the environment or developing the characters that Orwell has so masterfully crafted in his book. The director seems to think that all those who watch the film have read the book, because it makes no attempt to prove WHY the characters act and feel like them. John Hurt, the main actor, is completely awake, and hardly plays until the end. We never really discover what he does for a living, or because his love story is forbidden, or what the political climate is and why the protagonist desires rebellion. This book cannot be done justice in the form of films without a correct narration and explanation of the political system that oppresses the characters, and the fact that those are missing is the biggest gap of this film. Beyond that, John Hurt was a terrible casting choice, about 15 years older than the 39-year-old Winston he was supposed to play. On a more positive note, however, the rest of the cast was well chosen. It's just a pity that they were included in a film so horribly adapted with the wrong lead actor. - Brian O.
