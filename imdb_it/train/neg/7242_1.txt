The Pallbearer is a disappointment and sometimes extremely boring with a love story that does not work in part with the casting of Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie). Gwyneth Paltrow goes through the whole film with a confused look on her face and it's hard to say what David Schwimmer sees in her. <br /> <br /> However The Pallbearer is sometimes funny especially the church scene and the group scenes with his friends is a laugh, but basically it is. Just watch The Pallbearer for those scenes and move the rest forward quickly. Trust me, you don't miss much.
