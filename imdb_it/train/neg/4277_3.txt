The veteran director and producer Allan Dwan, whose huge film series includes both the completely forgettable and the applicant (for example, John Wayne in "Sands of Iwo Jima") tried his hand at a great musical with "I Dream of Jeanie ". Taking advantage of a cast of actors with a little past cinematic experience and, as it turned out, practically without a future, he shot a fake and largely offensive story about the great American composer Stephen Foster. <br /> <br /> Bill Shirley is the young man, in love with Foster, whose kindness towards slaves includes the donation of the money saved for an engagement ring to pay the cost of the hospital for a wounded black boy. His intent is Inez McDowell (Muriel Lawrence), whose annoying younger sister, Jeanie (Eileen Christy), is slowly realizing that she is in love with the almost indecent storyteller. Foster is in love with Inez who is disgusted by the composer's number 1 on the Levee Hit Parade Tune, "O Susannah". Enter the minstrel Edwin P. Christy (Ray Middleton) to help launch the profitable phase of Foster's career. <br /> <br /> This is, by the standards of early fifties music films, a great production. The sets are lavish in that special Hollywood way that portrays fakes with all the details. The singers are not badly hurt and Foster's songs are almost impossible to ruin. <br /> <br /> But this is also a real lime from the antebellum South. The largest number includes the black-face for everyone on stage, a historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of unreflecting racism. If these portraits of blacks were close to reality, abolitionists would rightly be condemned for interfering with such a beneficial institution. <br /> <br /> "Jeanie's Dream" apparently sank into the study vault with barely a whisper of death. Now imaged by Alpha Video for only $ 4.99 is a vintage piece with fascinating songs and repulsive sentimentality about the victims of the great American crime, slavery. <br /> <br /> This was what Hollywood was publishing two years before Brown v. Board of Education. He must have warmed the hearts of some spectators who have worn bed linen for the theater.
