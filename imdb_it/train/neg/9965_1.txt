WARNING! THE SMALL DETAILS OF THE PLOT REVEALED! <br /> <br /> I find practically nothing positive to say about this film. It is so badly written that every character is a caricature, yet he seems to take himself seriously. It is poorly expressed, especially Ralph Macchio (all of small face, five feet of him) like a hard streetwise. The plot elements are all drawn in black and white, with each situation coming almost immediately to an extreme climax. <br /> <br /> The most egregious of all (LIST OF REVELATION) is perhaps the most free and artificial naked scene in the history of semi-serious film. One can only imagine that the directors said: "We need JoBeth to do his best ... hmmm ... I did it! ... at the beginning of the film, we give Nick a ridiculous dialogue on how to discover himself in corridors ... then JoBeth can use that phrase about him later and REALLY undresses in the corridor ... yes, this is the ticket! "<br /> <br /> I will give credit to the producers for having addressed a topic heavy in 1984, one that proved too heavy in the late 1990s with events like Columbine. However, the execution is terrible. This film could have been a dark comedy in the wake of "Heathers", a political statement camped out as "Network" or a serious exam like "Brubaker". Instead, try to be all of these things - and end up being none of these things. "Teachers" gets an F.
