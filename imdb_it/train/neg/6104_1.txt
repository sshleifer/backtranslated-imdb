"Fungicida" is probably the most incompetent, embarrassing and pitiful "film" I've ever seen. Acting is criminal, the management practically non-existent and the special effects supposedly put together unleashing a monkey with learning difficulties on a defenseless laptop. <br /> <br /> Far be it from me to stifle creativity, but I truly believe that things like this should not be done. I'm sure the "filmmakers" will say that, yes, the "film" has been hampered by a low budget (as in nothing) - but in that case they shouldn't have worried. As it is, they offered the world something so terrible, so execrable, that only fools could get the smallest shadow of fun from it. <br /> <br /> Starting the "movie" wasn't like I was expecting "Citizen Kane" or something. I was expecting a little low-cost horror with maybe a little inventiveness, a bit of fun and even a little energy. What I got was the cinematic equivalent of a used handkerchief. <br /> <br /> The plot? Well, our silly anti-hero scientist, who works in his parents' basement, is seen mixing maniacally a little goo in a cup. Apparently, such a high level of science is the end result of years of research. His parents then send him to a strange place like a hotel in the countryside to relax. There are other people there, who are just too horrible to write. However, the scientist drops his tube on some mushrooms - and soon the mushrooms will grow and kill some people. (Wow, I'm committing suicide just by writing the plot summary). Our heroes save the day by detonating a barrel of balsamic vinegar (attaching a "fuse" - really a piece of string - to it). The barrel explodes inexplicably with the power of a small nuclear weapon, destroying all the mushrooms. The end. (Thank God). <br /> <br /> That summary is as good as the "movie" (and actually makes it much more interesting than it actually is). He should never have passed this development phase (by which I mean a plot traced on the back of an envelope with crayons). Someone should have really intervened and given someone a vigorous shake and said "NO". <br /> <br /> And those "special" effects. Well, they are "special" all right. This is crazy CGI. It is made by a person that I can only assume that the bicycle pump is the pinnacle of modern technology. And when mushroom monsters are not in the style of a 1984 home computer package, they are represented by actors dragging themselves covered in paper (no joke). <br /> <br /> One of the most unforgivable things about the film is its laziness. This can be summed up by the scene in which the hero spins his guns (a la Clint Eastwood) and then fails miserably to put them in his pockets. I mean, come on, a couple of shots and he might have taken it off, but only to leave it as it is - really weak. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that the money was spent on this garbage made with a video camera. The filmmakers should hang their heads in shame and be banished from entering fifty meters from any film production equipment. I also think it is wrong for the creators' friends and family to come to IMDb and post mendacious reviews and give stupidly high user ratings that give the "totally inaccurate" picture of the film. "Fungicida" is a true parody of cinema. Wascavage is very, very stupid or very, very cynical.
