I am a sucker for a beautiful love story, but this is not called good or romantic. I had the plot nailed before the credits had passed. With such a poor dialogue, plot and character development, I suggest you invest your hour and a half elsewhere. I had to run outside and rent Serendipity for the third time, so that I could take away the bad taste of it from my mouth.
