If Todd Sheets were to come out and admit that this film was intended to fake the zombie genre, I would change my rating to an eight. Try to imagine a film in which every scene, line and even every acting nuance was designed to be a parody. I could probably tear the soup out of the alphabet, reorganize what was left of the letters and still have a better script. Two particular scenes come to mind when I think of this film. NOTICE SPOILER! One is when Mike's dad and the other dad walk, I repeat going down a stairway full of zombies. This is a small scale and even if they touch the undead that are agitating, nothing happens to them. When they reach the end, the former marine turns around, says "God you are a horny bastard", and shoots only one. The other is in the military complex. The girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded. The camera moves around her for about forty seconds, while she is surrounded by zombies at an arm's length away. Then, almost casually, he turns away from the crowd and joins the other humans. SPOILER STARTING! These scenes must be seen to be believed. Anyway, I like this movie as much as any other comedy just because it's so damn funny. Congratulations to Todd Sheets for having so many people in his film and having the drive to do it but not for anything else.
