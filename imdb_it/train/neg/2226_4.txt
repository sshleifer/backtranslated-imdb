The DD movies were damn trivial, damn stupid and had a plot that seemed very thin but those days were at least a plot <br /> <br /> This film is not just a comedy but a mix of melodrama, romance all over <br /> Every dramatic scene is out of proportion <br /> <br /> Comedy is fun but too trivial Yet the movie is fun, those days Govinda's movies were loud, raw yet they had some funny moments that people have fun <br /> <br /> David Dhawan does a good job Music is ok <br /> <br /> Govinda plays well in comedy and in the drama Karisma is decent in parts and annoys in parts Kader is like as usual Gulshan, Prem Chopra is typecast Shakti is hilarious
