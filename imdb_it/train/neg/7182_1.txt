I could not recommend a Christmas movie more than this useless piece of drivel (trust me, double negatives are needed here - it's so bad). This film was in trouble from the opening credits when it was revealed that the writer was the same person as the songwriter. The musical numbers are too long and none of them is good ("Thank You Very Much" has a decent melody, but the lyrics are stupid beyond words). I would gladly take the chains worn by Scrooge in the bizarre infernal sequence of the film rather than pass from this insult to cinema musicals again. <br /> <br /> The only fun part of this movie (totally involuntary by the way) is about Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley. Dressed in a stupid white powder costume, Guinness wildly whizzes through his scenes in what was an attempt to make it seem like a ghost, or to show his utter disdain to be in this terrible movie. Albert Finney, meanwhile, blends the best of Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton to create his hopelessly repulsive character of Quasimodo / Scrooge. Finney's Scrooge is such a horrible person, it's impossible to believe his transformation. <br /> <br /> Avoid any film production abomination at all costs.
