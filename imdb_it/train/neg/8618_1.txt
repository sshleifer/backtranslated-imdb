Incredibly horrible movie. I saw a part of this on T.V. lately. I gasped as I watched a horribly designed plot and listened to a shocking voice. Not a single line of the one-liner master could come close to producing something that looks like a giggle. It was so ugly that it made me want to exhume Rodney Dangerfield's body, slap him and scream "How could you?" I know that many films are made quickly, hoping to collect the popularity of a particular actor or theme. But please, Hollywood, show some respect for your audience. It's sad and scary that people have to pay to see this tripe. The bottom of the cesspool, even for the Sunday afternoon TV standards.
