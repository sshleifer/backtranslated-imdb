this film has it all; the skilful photographic work, reminiscent of martin scorcese, or oliver stone, the close recitation of "heat", the explosive action of a jerry bruckheimer film, the witty dialogue of a Tarantino script and the epic sensation of saying godfather "<br /> <br /> the judge who covers the character shows an ardent temperememt, but also shows real emotional depth and intensity. his performance reminds me of the portrait of robert de niro of jake la motta in a wild bull. <br /> <br /> the action scenes are truly breathtaking, not since a movie depicted such spectacular but elegant car scenes. Special effects push the boundaries of technology and cinema to the limit. Independence Day has set the standard that this film has clearly equaled, and greatly exceeded. <br /> <br /> in general, great acting from its list cast (like an invitation list for an Oscar night party!), Classrooms, compelling action, and a tight script.
