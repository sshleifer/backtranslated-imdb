I really wish that when you make a comedy, people actually tried to make it fun. This is a movie you can sit on, but nothing is special about it. After seeing it, you will say it was fine. It wasn't boring to watch, but it didn't give the audience any joke to laugh about. Entertainment should mean that you actually get more than an o.k. history. This film wanted to be "Tootsie", but instead failed. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 1 out of 10.
