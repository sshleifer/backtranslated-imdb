THE DECOY is one of those independent productions, made from obvious newcomers, but it doesn't have all the usual flaws that sink most of these films. It has a definite history, has adequate acting, photography is very good, the hero and the villain are both formidable men, and the background music is not exaggerated. This is a new version of the DVD, so people will look here to see if it's worth it. I don't know where all 10 come from, because there's no way this movie is so beautiful --- even if you're the director's mother. <br /> <br /> The last film we saw in a theater was the trashing of J K Rawlings' Warner, the much loved and excellent book, Order of the Phoenix. Comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX, consider that PHOENIX (produced by Warners) did not have a story, certainly no acting was allowed by the director, the photography was terrible, and the overbearing soundtrack of the sound wall was just a disaster. I rated Phoenix a "1" because the scale never lowered. THE DECOY is 4 times better - in every aspect. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, give THE DECOY a chance. Remember, this is not "Decoy 3 - the Shootout" or similar nonsense. It's original If your expectations are not exaggerated with the stupid "10" scores here, you could just enjoy the movie on its own terms.
