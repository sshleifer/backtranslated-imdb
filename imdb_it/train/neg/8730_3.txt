The thing that stands out in my mind in this film (unfortunately) is the introduction, where John Berlin (Andy Garcia) is driving around town. You see his Mercedes passing on a winding road through a forest that appears to be full of redwood trees. It's pretty nice <br /> <br /> As for Andy Garcia who plays a character with the surname of Berlin, well ... Andy is too Hispanic / Latin to be passable. Perhaps an Indo-European father has married the Spanish mother for this story? Who knows. But I can tell you that when you put him in a town of peasants and hicks, he stands out as a sore thumb, especially with his accent that flares up when he gets angry. Yes, I know, big deal right? He's still a good actor. <br /> <br /> The title is about a serial killer who names his victims Jennifer. All the victims are blind and take them apart. The killer took a break but suddenly emerges when a blind witness (not asking) appears, Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman). Thurman does a good job playing a blind man, to my surprise. When I saw Lance Henriksen playing sergeant. Freddy Ross, I worried. Henriksen has starred in some rather strange films, especially lately. I still can't forget it in the Bloodbath movie, Pumpkinhead. <br /> <br /> Berlin films in a small town of L.A. as a detective. Start investigating Jennifer's murders after finding body parts in the local landfill. His genius at discovering one of the victims was blind it seemed far-fetched. Thus did the irony of the murder of * SPOILER * Freddy, with the registration and the similarities of name. I was very confused about how there were eight "Jennifers". And the reason for the murderer as simply unbalanced did not pack much. In retrospect, this film is probably more faithful to life in showing an unsuspecting individual how to kill simply because he became a bit wacky over time or maybe they were born tooney. <br /> <br /> John Malkovich does a wonderful job in his interrogation of Garcia! Although no policeman would be legally allowed to push someone so hard and crush him without rightly being knocked out. As for the ending, it's a bit of a surprise, but it's highly questionable, very similar to the sergeant. Ross's murder. The killer chooses to walk after his fleeing victim, opting instead for frollio, I think. <br /> <br /> And there are so many opportunities in killing her that it's ridiculous. I won't ruin it to the end because despite being terrible, it's a nice surprise. Later, you will probably say, as I did, "boy was lucky!" 4/10
