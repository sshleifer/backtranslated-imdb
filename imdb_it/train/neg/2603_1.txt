I was interested in the subject, and only Drew Barrymore's dance fans on David Letterman's desk will find something remotely interesting. OK, show some breast (or maybe a double of the body). The plot is torn to pieces and the acting is horrible. Neither of them has material to work with, since the direction of the film does not lead anywhere. Do not waste time. Instead, see Donnie Darko if you want a disturbing film by Drew Barrymore, and if you want to see another, skip this and look at Darko again. <br /> <br /> Even the treatment of the Doppelganger legend is absolutely criminal. Refer to the Charles Williams novel "Descent Into Hell" for something worth considering. This is just an excuse to make a B series movie to go directly to the video and suck some life from the Blockbuster people. <br /> <br /> What makes any of these people think that acting here is commendable? Give me a break.
