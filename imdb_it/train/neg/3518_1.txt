I saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor, and we found the whole thing so ridiculous that it was beyond pity. (For example, if Stallone is out alone to climb freely, there is no need to carry any equipment, but I imagine that those dangling carabiners seem a bit "mountaineers", so let's throw them inside). For those lobotomized people who think that Colorado resembles the Dolomites in Italy (where the film was shot), well, Hollywood magnates have much more ridiculous and smelly things to swallow.
