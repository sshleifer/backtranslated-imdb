OK now, let's see. What was fun in the first movie? I know, people with funny accents, people falling into the water, stupid boat accidents and funny comments between the two teams. In this film they have distorted the accent part to the maximum, it's not good. A lot a lot of people are falling into the water for uncertain reasons, it's not good. Boatcrash, check. Funny comments between the two teams, they tried but failed. Furthermore, there are also the personalities that are following in this film. This film should relate to what is happening on the water, not on the ground. I'm sorry to say that there is too far between the fun parties and the film's sponsors are exploited to the fullest. Not good. All in all, I give it four out of ten since it has some fun parts.
