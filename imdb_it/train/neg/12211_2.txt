"Rambo: First Blood Part II" by George P. Cosmatos is pure satisfaction of desire. The United States clearly did not win the war in Vietnam. They have caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this film continues the tale of innocent soldiers. The only villains were the leaders of the nation, who made this war happen. Rambo's character is perfect for noticing. He is extremely patriotic, complains that American Americans have not appreciated and celebrated the achievements of the individual soldier, but he has nothing but distrust of leaders and politicians. Like any film that defends the war (for example "We Were Soldiers") this also avoids the need to give an understandable reason for the commitment in South Asia. And also the reason why every single American-American soldier was there. Instead, Rambo gets to take revenge on the wounds of an entire nation. It would have been better to work on how to deal with memories rather than suppress them. "Should we win this time?" Yes.
