In THE FAN Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard. Or is it Travis Bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Max Cady? You see the problem with this kind of role is that De Niro played very similar characters in TAXI DRIVER, THE KING OF COMMEDY and CAPE FEAR and unfortunately the characters were more developed and had better scripts. It seemed a little hard to believe that Renard would become an obsessive and frustrated sports fan by becoming a real freak. <br /> <br /> The character's bow is not the only problem with this script - There is also a lack of focus on the character (A problem I had with THE UNTOUCHABLES where De Niro should have been superb but finished slightly flat) , for various traits of the film I kept thinking that Bobby Rayburn was the main character, so the story returns to Renard. He also seems to have disappointed a lot of sports fans who seem to think that this should have focused a little more on baseball. I'm not sure this should have attracted baseball fans originally, but again there are elements that suggest that it could have if the producers made a decision about who and what the story should focus on <br /> <br / > I admit that I was entertained by THE FAN (especially the soundtrack) but it is a very imperfect film and it should be remembered that in the mid-90s the characters were persecuted by Nutters as in SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, ENTRY UNLAWFUL etc. of steam a long time ago
