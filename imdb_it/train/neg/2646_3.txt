When someone enters a film of this type of film, it is not obvious that an overdose of this great over-the-counter brain medicine, Suspension of Disbelief, is very useful. <br /> <br /> Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna / Brigitta, the woman that Nelson Eddy has ignored since the beginning of time, but also who she is - an angel sent to Earth. <br /> <br /> My reaction when I saw this was a silent jolt of "Hunh?" Where did I see this before? It turns out, I've seen it before, but in a film made much later than this. DATE WITH AN ANGEL, a forgettable dreck stack made in 1987, set in the ethereal beauty of an Emmanuelle Beart who had no spoken lines, also wore a blonde wig and gave birth to the hell of the soap actor Michael Knight. Much worse in every imaginable corner with ultra-low values ​​of the 80s but more than likely an updated version of this 1942 turkey. In any case, not to elaborate, this is not a memorable film and stands as an information door because it was the last time that MacDonald and Eddy, nor very good actors but terrifying singers, would be together to play the "innocent" and "clean" love story for which they were known. After that you might need a cold shower, not because there are steam scenes here, but to get rid of the memory.
