An endless frenzy of intelligent visual ironies does not necessarily create an engaging film. Half of the film "Blonde Wig" has never taken off, perhaps due to the excessive self-indulgence of its creators. <br /> <br /> Half of Wong Faye (with a very playful character, if Karen Carpenter looks, Faye Wong) has much more appeal All the ingredients are there, however, the element of the girl's story meets the boy it takes second place to artistic ability. The character development is not uniform. No emotion. <br /> <br /> For music lovers, the "Mung Jung Yun" by Wong Faye (Cantonese version of the great success of Cranberry "Dreams") is used effectively in Chungking Express. Faye Wong also recorded a Mandarin version called "Zhen Tuo". Both are on CD, although only "Mung Jung Yun" is on the official CD of the film's soundtrack.
