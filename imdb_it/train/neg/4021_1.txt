This is probably the worst movie that has ever been made is just for the bad name of Roger Corman is associated with it. I could understand him in his early years when he had a lower budget, but nowadays there is no excuse to give birth to this! I'm a pervert of a "B" movie and from some people's point of view all the movies I love are put aside by "normal viewers", but take my word on that, the vampire club is at the top of my list of the best of the worst It is hard to imagine, fangless vampires, the soundtrack is totally out of place, the sound effects are not effective and finally Mr.Savage does not seem to know he is in a vampire movie to all the wizards is too bad because he had a "not bad" career on everything. Let me know if I'm too tough for this cause, when I don't like a movie, I tend to forget it's a positive side.
