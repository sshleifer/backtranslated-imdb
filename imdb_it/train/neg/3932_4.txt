This solid horror film is actually one of the best of Renny Harlin. The plot is routine stuff, but the atmosphere is what makes it really alive; in fact, the ghost story is almost an afterthought. The real horror comes from the same prison, and Renny H. spares no details in showing us how bad the conditions are in that old, crumbling, leaky, haunted hell (with a sadistic guardian!) Viggo Mortensen is excellent as Usually in the lead role , supported by some very authentic looking prisoners (there are no nice guys in this cast.) Horror fans should check this.
