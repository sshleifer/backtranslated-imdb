Kim Basinger plays the role of Della, a desperate housewife with a slightly violent husband, who gets into trouble while out at the local mall shopping for Christmas at the last minute. After laying a hateful scribbled note on a piece of paper and attaching the paper to the windshield of a car that took up two parking spaces, he discovers that the car's owners are the Rainbow Coilition of villains consisting of a white boy Mexican, a Chinese boy and a black. They face her for the ticket, they cover a helpless security guard and the hunt is open. During the course of the film Della will go hunting for the hunter while freeing his inner Bronson. <br /> <br /> I found this a little thriller a little tense. The acting was pretty good (except for some scenes, the motto "Why God because" he shuddered deservedly in his wickedness though) is canceled a little due to the fact that the criminals Della follow / after are incredibly stupid. If they hadn't had the intellect of a certain bad "Home Alone", perhaps their eventual defeat would have been something to savor instead of the reaction meh that it evokes. The factor of the incredible that I am willing to neglect given that both the director and one of the producers contributed to bringing "Shoot em up" to the screen (a film that, while throwing credibility out the window, was immensely fun). This film, while never reaching the heights of that film, was good in its own rights. <br /> <br /> My Grade: C- <br /> <br /> Anchor Bay DVD Extras: Commentary with writer / director Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy; a "Making-of" of 25 minutes and a half; a trailer and two TV commercials for this film; and trailer for Lower Learning
