This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This is saying quite a bit, considering some of the choices I made in movie rentals. <br /> <br /> I took this on Netflix based entirely on the fact that someone who attended high school is topless. The topless scene lasted for about 5 seconds and the rest of the film was as much fun as having punched sticks guided under the toenails while I was forced to listen to Roseanne while singing Big Spender. <br /> <br /> "They are stupid and consist of the worst kind of youthful bathroom humor and dressing gag, and it is a blatant (and poor) rip-off of The Kentucky Fried Movie that you will beg Big Jim Slade to crash into the wall and save us from the stupidity of "Vince Offer" (whoever it is). <br /> <br /> If you're not a masochist, avoid this pile of garbage.
