Blue Monkey (1987) or 'Invasion of the BodySuckers' as it is known here in the UK was a rather boring horror film about an old man being bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious toxic plant !!!! The man is rushed to the hospital, where this worm-like creature comes out of his mouth, obviously this turns into this insect monster and proceeds to go on a rampage !! Although Steve Railsback and John Vernon were in the film, I found it boring, with a flat and predictable plot, uninteresting characters, cheap special effects and lack of action !!!! Horror fans don't really need to track down this rare film, you won't miss me very much! I give this movie 2/10.
