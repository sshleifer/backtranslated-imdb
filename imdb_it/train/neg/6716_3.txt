The Fluffer could have strong elements of the truth of the porn industry - but this does not compensate for the fact that it is managed and interpreted in a rather shabby way - and with a very mediocre script. <br /> <br /> Grade B from beginning to overly fanciful finish. <br /> <br /> It would be embarrassing to think that this piece is offered to the public as an example of making state-of-the-art gay films. <br /> <br /> We hope he has a limited life on the gay film festival circuit and can die a natural death on video. <br /> <br /> This film will open the Queer Film Weekend in Brisbane on April 10th 2002. I think its success will be strongly influenced by the amount of alcohol consumed at the previous cocktail party - they will need it.
