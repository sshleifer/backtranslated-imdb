This film is a rather strange mix of musicals, romance, drama and crime with an announcement from the film noir. It's basically a messy bunch of different genres, none of which really works the way it should. <br /> <br /> This film is an attempt by Mickey Rooney to be taken more seriously as an actor. He is a former child-star who has always performed in happy comic and musical productions at the beginning of his career. In this film he chooses a different approach (even if the musical aspects are still present in the film). But his role is actually quite laughable in the film. Do I mean Mickey Rooney as a tough player? He is an extremely small boy with a boyish appearance. He was about 30 at the time of this film, but he really looks like a sixteen year old. Hearing him tell the girls and hearing hard talk about the gangsters who are about 3 times bigger than him doesn't seem fair. It is simply not convincing in its role. <br /> <br /> As the film mixes many different genres, the story seems really messy. Somewhere in it there is a criminal plot and somewhere there is a romantic plot and one that talks about living your dreams, but none of this really works because of the messy approach and handling of it all . It is not an interesting or compelling movie to watch. László Kardos is also a director who made only 10 films in his life, despite the fact that his career lasted from 1935 to 1957. He had to be a director in difficulty who struggled to work in the sector and instead once in while he was given a minor script to work with. His films are all unknown and normally they are not too high quality. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget also that this is a film from the 50s, but still it looks more like one of the 40s or maybe one of those of the 1930s. This is mainly due to the fact that this film was shot in black and white. The black and white films of the 50s often have an economic aspect and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> It is a rather strange sight to see Mickey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and his band performing together in a sequence. It was not the only film in which Armstrong appeared, but he often showed himself in this type of film, often simply as himself. I imagine that jazz lovers can still appreciate the vision of this film because of its music, since in this film there is a lot of it. The film actually received an Oscar nomination for the best original song. <br /> <br /> A little awkward movie released by Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> 4/10
