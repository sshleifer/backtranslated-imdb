I had no other expectations other than being entertained for 90 minutes, and that's exactly what I was. <br /> <br /> Obviously it's campy, obviously some of the dialogues weren't perfect, obviously the "special effects" were a bit drunk. This is exactly why I liked the film so much. It's perfect for this kind of a classic 70s horror. <br /> <br /> Talent must start from where, ie for the actors and the crew, and what better piece of material to hone your skills on this one. <br /> <br /> For a look forward to another film by these producers and directors.
