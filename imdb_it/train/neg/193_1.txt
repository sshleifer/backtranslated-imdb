The story of Norman Maclean is a masterpiece; Redford's film is mediocre. He adds trivial scenes of the Maclean brothers dealing with falls and those that are doubled in a shabby bar that were not even mentioned in history. The code, Brad Pitt, who tries to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, an open-air genius, demonstrates both the laughable and the depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some of the casting scenes are beautiful. Also, Tom Skerritt in the role of father and Craig Sheffer in the role of Norman are strong and masculine, as men were once expected to be. None of the women impressed in the film, which is regrettable, because Maclean loved women in his story and made it clear, even poetic.
