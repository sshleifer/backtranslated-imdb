I admire 'Kissing on the mouth' for his frankness ?? pubic cut and masturbation, especially by director / director Joe Swanberg. They were not afraid to show the truth to "private" daily events. Unfortunately, the film falls within the realm of 'The Brown Bunny', albeit with a slightly more developed storyline of jealousy. Yes, does it reflect 'Bunny' with a lot of nothing going on, or too many focused (or genuinely fuzzy) movie clips on absolutely nothing ?? feet, hands or genitals. Again, unfortunately, I understand why this film was released, and why people are renting: real life scenes and full nude scenes (equally, both male and female). Apart from that, it was a complete waste of time. We quickly discover a pair of post-graduate male / female roommates in which the male has obvious feelings for the female who sees him only as a friend while continuing to have sex with his ex-boyfriend. In addition to this, we are subjected to the daily events of their boring lives: work for his parents; works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer. For everything to work, the dialogue must be interesting and the acting real. Nor does it work, and it's boring like watching someone drive for an hour, like "The Brown Bunny". The only actor who stands out is Kate Winterich, and she also plays questionably. (The extra DVD with her in front of a microphone is really worth watching / listening.) Once again, I admire filmmakers, particularly Swanberg, for stripping everything out and not being afraid to expose themselves or their habits of the shower, but overall the film falls flat. It has narrations that don't fit the scenes, too many boring daily events and unconvincing acting that you ask yourself, apart from the soft-porn factor, why you rented it.
