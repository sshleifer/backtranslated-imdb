I never fully understood the popularity of Saban's Power Rangers show, which was simply a second-tier Americanized version of Japan's popular super sentai series over the past three decades! What was beautiful about the Japanese version is completely lost in the American version, in the characterization, in the special effects, etc. <br /> <br /> Of course many kids will say that the powerful rangers are the biggest but they would not be correct. /> <br /> I am sure that if they spoke in Japanese, they would learn how much better the super sentai is compared to the American version. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers are completely horrible, try Super Sentai instead! Looking for a better show, try Voltron The Third Dimension instead!
