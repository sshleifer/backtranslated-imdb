I had high expectations for this indie having reviewed the many positive reviews. So ... <br /> <br /> Here are my additional "two cents" on the review already published, excellent "lost in translation". Premise: Morgan is "stuck" in a small dusty town where he meets the beautiful Scarlet who works in the local supermarket. Can Morgan help lift the adorable Scarlet out of its towing stuff? <br /> <br /> Realistic dialogue? NOT. How about shopping in Target. First, Freeman looks at the inside of Target as if he had entered Harrods. Then, he threw himself on a shirt to confirm that he was never in any store visited by the adorable Scarlet. Morgan is detached from any aspect of Scarlet's reality and is portrayed as cheerful in his ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet's life. <br /> <br /> A reviewer liked Scarlet's and ex-husband's fighting scene where his survival, a car in this case, requires her to physically attack her former hubbie. Freeman runs in his defense ... no ... he is huddled in disbelief and totally incapable of facing such an abrupt aspect of his very real and sorry part in life. <br /> <br /> The character of Freeman believes that the car wash and the new tight and very revealing blouse are the key to Scarlet's job interview. Another sign that Freeman is INDOLECTIVE. Freeman's interminable "stage speech", in which all aspects of Scarlet's reality are reduced to one or more experiences related to Freeman's world, was irritating. <br /> <br /> Freeman is right in pointing out that Scarlet is young with his future ahead of him and therefore conveniently ignores the brick walls he faces vis a vis: uneducated, no clerical skills or experience, VERY POOR , no family support and a life of low self-esteem. Scarlet learns the life lessons of Freeman as: some people pay $ 100 for a T-shirt and a revealing blouse can open the doors instead of its lack of education and skill in white-collar work. In the end, Freeman offers Scarlet little more than a strange diversion with a "star", without even paying the gas for Scarlet's return to death for his life unchanged in a city whose name Freeman worries about not knowing.
