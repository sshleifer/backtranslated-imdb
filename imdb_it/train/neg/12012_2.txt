The dialogue was rather terrible. The plot is not really all that inspired beyond the obvious breakthrough it presents. Not visually stunning. Actually visually annoying at times. Surely one of those movies that you find easier to finish if you hold a finger on the fast forward button. If you could watch it for free, you have absolutely no other options open at the moment and really you are seeing the little lady poltergeist ... well maybe I would recommend it to you, but not anyone else can think at the moment.
