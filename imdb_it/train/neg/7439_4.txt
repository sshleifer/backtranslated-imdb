A different look at horror. The stylistic differences between American and Russian films are interesting. However, from my American point of view, this film was not so beautiful. The protagonist, Marie played by Anastasia Hille, was not a pleasant character and I had difficulty identifying with her. It was unpleasant for most of the time and confused for much of that little time left. Furthermore, too much time was spent taking it to the main position of the film. Then it was a long time before a real suspense accumulated. Once it happened, it seemed that the volume was the main effect, which was more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most Direct-to-video films and did not use sex to compensate for a subtle plot. All in all I would recommend it for rent, but not for theater goers.
