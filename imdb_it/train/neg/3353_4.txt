The bad movie offers nothing new. The usual creaks and groans try to wear makeup for a confused but subtle story. Acting is just above pathetic. Because Liam Neeson signed for this is nobody's hypothesis. Owen Wilson truly turns into one of the worst performances in the recent history of horror cinema. Catherine Zeta Jones is fun to watch and not much else even though Lili Tayor did an above average job. The special effects were quite memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and incredibly charming. However, they can't wear makeup due to poor acting and the plot that seems to have been thrown together at the last minute. Do not worry
