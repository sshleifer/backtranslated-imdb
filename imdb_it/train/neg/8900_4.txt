I liked the first film, but this is a textbook example of a sequel that would have been better left on the drawing board. The general idea of ​​the first film was, if not exceptional, at least very interesting. This sequel tries to build on the idea and characters of the first film, and although Christopher Walken is still as good as Gabriel, the whole idea suddenly becomes a bit ridiculous. If you haven't seen any of these films, take the first movie and forget about the sequels, they can take away all the joy of the original.
