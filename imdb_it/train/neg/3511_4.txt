'I'm working for a sinister corporation that does industrial espionage in the future and I'm starting to get confused about who I really am, sh * # t! I have a headache and things are going shaky, oh no, here comes another subliminal montage, fast and noisy, of meaningful but cryptic images ... 'I rented this film because the few reviews come out there were all favorable . Why? Cypher is an inexpensive, derivative, boring film set in a poorly made futuristic world, with wooden cables and a ridiculous ending. <br /> <br /> A disturbing sense that something interesting might happen makes you look at increasingly stupid and unconvincing series of events before the directors slap you in the face with an ending that combines the worst of Bond with a video by Duran Duran. <br /> <br /> It is painfully obvious that they exploited the production using Dr Who's style improvised special effects to include some good CGI pieces (if a bit Babylon 5). This sub Fight Club, subtitle of Philip K Dick, the future noir thriller aims at a much broader scope than what its modest budget will allow. <br /> <br /> Cool blue moodiness taken seriously with a dark face - disappointingly stupid. This is not intelligent Sci-Fi, this is the plot of a computer game.
