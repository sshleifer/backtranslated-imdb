I think Micheal Ironsides' acting career must be over, if she has to act in this kind of low crap. Surely he could do better than waste his time in this junk. <br /> <br /> This film could be far better if it had a good budget, but it shows itself repeatedly throughout the film. There is a scene in an outpost, which looks like it is outside the front of a train station, and I bet it was. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that gave this movie a 3, and shows the spaceship lands and takes off on a lake, surrounded by forests. This was well done, but the rest of the film, we forget it. <br /> <br /> There is another scene, which looks like an engineering facility, which I bet, and it doesn't look like a space outpost like the character says it is. <br /> <br /> This film is stupid, has a low budget, makes no sense and God helps Michael Ironsides.
