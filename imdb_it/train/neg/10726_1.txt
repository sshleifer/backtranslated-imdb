I agree with the previous comment, the beginning of the film is quite good, and you enjoy what must come ....... That is nothing. All open lines of history remain open; two characters that at first seemed to be of some importance are completely excluded from the image, except for 1 or 2 very short scenes. Vague if Ilya would not have done better to leave them completely out ... As for the only remaining character, nothing was done with her. He goes to some horrible place, and suddenly the film doesn't talk about her anymore, but some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls with bread, drinking homemade vodka and apparently blinking each other. Some might say that the film does well to show a crumbling society, like the IFRU judges, but to me it's just bad taste, bad script, a horrible script and a frighteningly bad direction. So I can't be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to evaluating: 1!
