My wife and I have just finished watching BÃ»su AKA The Booth. She fell asleep during parts of the film. I really wish I had taken a nap with her, but the unfortunate fact is that the voice of the main character is so loud and jarring that it's impossible for me to sleep. When our protagonist speaks, it makes me want to hear Regis Philbin and William Shatner sing karaoke. It also has no saving qualities. I was hoping he would be hit by a bus for five minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I love Asian horror movies, but The Booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really makes absolutely no sense. If you want a good Asian cinema, take a look at A Tale of Two Sisters or Into The Mirror. Avoid The Booth like the plague, especially if you suffer from frequent headaches.
