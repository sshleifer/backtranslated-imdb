I don't know if the problem I had with this film is that I wasn't able to capture the way the films were made in the past, but I believe that this didn't fail to use the fashionable conventions available over the years 40 to make a film. If you have nothing better to do, my advice is not to watch this movie but to read a book or go for a walk.
