Any movie in which Brooke Shields plays a Fonda will be an anomaly and a horror. The shields are actually just bad because he is young, inexperienced and clearly not well directed by his co-star. Peter Fonda is bad because, well, because he's bad. I liked it in Ulee's Gold, years later, but Lord at the top, it's horrible here. Not that anyone else is good. There is not a single performance (outside the delightful Henry Fonda cameo) that is even passable. I've never seen a movie with so many bad performances. In the case of Luke Askew, the criminal leader, it is clear that this is because of poor dialogue and leadership, as he has done a good job in the past. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is an embarrassing ham. The script is simply terrible, and the actors cannot be criticized for the terrible things they have to say. But they say them so bad! Assembly and direction are worse than pedestrian ones. The shots are kept for too long for no dramatic reason, or cut off before the impact of the scene can be realized. This photo was much worse than I had imagined and would have been completely forgotten (and probably never even made) without the participation of a couple of famous names. A bright spot: cinematography in the Grand Canyon is exquisite, capturing the beauty of that area in a way that even big-screen Imax productions haven't done so well yet. And finally: either this is a bad version of Paper Moon, with a lovely couple of father-daughter types, or it's a bad version of Pretty Baby, with a decidedly more icky relationship between a forty and a thirteen year old. It suggests more than the latter compared to the first, and therefore it is rather disturbing.
