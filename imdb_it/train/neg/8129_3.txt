Sometimes I don't know ... try trying to be charitable towards all the Brough Z level movies out there, but once in a while a particular movie tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved. "Bat People" (which I saw with the title "It Lives By Night") is really a movie. You can't watch this without thinking that it should have been an episode of "Night Gallery", and not one of the best. <br /> <br /> The film has something to do with a doctor who is bitten by a bat and consequently starts turning into a skinny bat that drinks human blood. (Actually, you'd think that if he turned into a real bat, he would eat mosquitoes from the gallon bucket, but because this is an inexpensive and horrible horror film, blood is the word.) Despite the fact that he has seizures when he falls of a hat and episodes of blackout almost every night, his friend and colleague doctor, dr. Mustache Aspen-Extreme, insists he is only having an "allergic reaction" to anger shots. Meanwhile, the most hateful and stereotypical county sheriff in the world suspects being responsible for the brutal murder and bleeding of several local girls (and a girl). Meanwhile, the doctor's wife decides that the denial is a river in Egypt and protests him alternately and torments him by distraction. <br /> <br /> It's not so much that acting is bad - you can say that the actors are making professional-grade choices, and they're trying to bring a little juice and life to the script, even the guy who plays it sheriff. (Okay, it's pretty ugly, but it's bad in a cliché, in wood, in a professional way). It's just that everything related to acting, the way the scenes are scanned, the costumes, the dialogue, the script and the plot in general makes your teeth come true and makes you want to slap everyone involved. <br /> <br /> I think the film had a chance outside of being a small, spooky and creepy cult favorite, MA: <br /> <br /> 1) The director needed to beat Michael Pataki , an experienced actor, with a chair until Pataki agreed to act, and not just Dennis Weaver channel. <br /> <br /> 2) He also needed to find a script that made more sense with regards to the whole scenario "Bat Bites Human, Who Then Turn into In A A Bat". <br /> <br /> 3) He also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically credible set designer for his "episodes", instead of using the "Man Has A Seizure" page of Little Golden Book of Clichéd Recitation of mannerisms. <br /> <br /> 4) He needed to rework the whole "wife" character, make it smarter, less acute and more careful. <br /> <br /> I would never look at this film again, except with the help of Mike and the Bots. It's bad, but it's not bad in a silly, funny or interesting way. Even better than "Battlefield Earth" or "Waterworld", though.
