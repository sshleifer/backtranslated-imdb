Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic book by Roald Dahl. Wes Anderson directs and respectfully brings the short book of the same name to the big screen in a feature film. While I respect what Anderson, an incredibly talented man, the film seemed to have lost in his intelligent spirit. Anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing he was a talented man, and if this was a bad movie, it would be his first bad movie. Just like when you go to school and you have your first bad day, this is Anderson's first bad day for making movies, so I'll leave it easily. I admit that he had a nice intelligence and spirit, and the animation is nice, but the film gets progressively more difficult to get, leaving the story behind and casually triggering random things. Even the characters are good. Jason Schwartzman gives voice to Mr. Fox (George Clooney), Ash's intelligent son, and particularly captivating. The film is not compliant enough, but it certainly gets closer and closer. I'm sure Wes Anderson will be back on track with another fantastic film when and where he decides to make another film, but for now, I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, this movie of yours was a big disappointment.
