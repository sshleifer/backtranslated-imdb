I was given this film because it had such a great premise, the friendship of three women inherent in falling in love with a younger man. <br /> <br /> Intriguing. <br /> <br /> NOT! I hasten to add. These women are all drawn in an extreme caricature, not very sympathetic to each other and conspiring to invent each other. <br /> <br /> Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could not be wrong in my book before seeing it, but here they are given a dismal script and they are told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball, which doesn't work too well when women are all well-known professionals in a very small city. <br /> <br /> And for intelligent women they spend a lot of time complaining about the lack of men / sex / lust in their lives. I had heard a lot more if I had given a decent script and more tension, the lesbian sub-plot was going nowhere and those smoking / drinking women (all three of them in their forties ???) were very unrealistic - even in the scene of the child - fuck the child, give me a cigarette! Quite right. <br /> <br /> As I said, a real pity. 4 out of 10.
