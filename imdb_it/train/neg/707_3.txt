"All Saints' Day?" Where is it...? When ...? <br /> <br /> Have the plot and theme for the festival of All Saints been eliminated? <br /> <br /> What a waste of a wonderful title! There is never anything in history that has the remotest link with the "Feast of All Saints". Nor is there anything in the "All Souls Day" story to which the term refers. Why bother using this title if you do not intend to include any type of plot or theme on "All Souls Day" or "Feast of All Saints"? <br /> <br /> Embarrassing script and amateur writing <br /> <br /> How did they attract such a great talent to this clunker? The screenplay is so amateur - the characters who have always known each other pass long talks about their life story for the benefit of the public. It's not the way people talk to each other at all. <br /> <br /> What was the director's thought? <br /> <br /> The direction is equally bad! The forced and too deliberate style seems amateurish. In one scene, a character is screaming "Get your hands off me" and NO ONE is touching him! The most misdirected scene, however, is the incredibly exaggerated battle scene at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Excessive Gore in a Very Fake and Silly Battle Scene <br /> <br /> There are so many deaths in the most fake battle scene. It looks like a Saturday Night Live live !! You can see the extras waiting for their signals to walk through the camera. Everyone plays the scene of death like 4th grade boys, exaggerating every little jolt and spasm. The blood on the victims of the battles is so excessive and applied carelessly it seems that someone has used a ketchup dispenser and has just sprayed straight lines of red on the costumes. <br /> <br /> The entire battle scene is presented as a parody of a real type war movie. You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to get on a horse and bring the punch line. <br /> <br /> Who in real life would behave this way?! <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous piece of writing, directing and casting is actually the centerpiece of the scene: <br /> <br /> A little girl is standing under the corpse of her hung father - who is terribly mutilated and literally the dripping blood forms his open wounds. Even a totally idiot might know he is dead! And yet it is - very monotonous - endlessly repeating "Dad, Dad ..." while watching someone off screen. He transmitted it with the same credibility and the same passion that could be expected from a non-actor child who repeated the line for cameras all day long. <br /> <br /> Even if the poor guy had some acting skills, the scene is absolutely incredible. The little girl wouldn't even be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage - surrounded by hundreds of corpses, while she is quietly standing there !! The natural instincts would have made the child scream and terrorize, running away from the bloody carnage! <br /> <br /> Suppose you are horrified or laughing ...?! <br /> <br /> A particularly foolish detail, which gives the scene a satirical SNL tone, is the hanging father, with a huge hook through his mouth and his cheek. It looks like a fish on the hook! The unintentionally funny details make the whole scene look fake and silly. <br /> <br /> In La-La-Land Fantasy, mothers and daughters are the same age! <br /> <br /> Another fun detail, is that you see a central character - the girl's mother - at the end of the scene and in the next scene, which occurs after 20 or more years, she looks exactly the same! She is still young and beautiful, and now she is the same age as her daughter! <br /> <br /> I almost shot the film right there, because the direction and writing were obviously horrible - but I tried to turn it off because I wanted to see the Louisiana environments and I like all the actors. I don't know what these good actors were thinking when they accepted these roles! <br /> <br /> Who was the target audience? <br /> <br /> The excessive amount of blood and abused violence in the opening scene is strangely out of place with the tone of the soap opera narrative that follows. It is also a strange way to start a film that, for the rest of the time, seems to be aimed at romance novels that read novels. Strange tone inconsistency!
