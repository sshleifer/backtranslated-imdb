When HEY ARNOLD! I saw it for the first time in 1996, I saw it. It was one of my favorite shows. Then the same episodes started to be shown over and over again, so I got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching it. I was a little surprised when I heard about HEY ARNOLD! THE FILM as it doesn't seem to be as popular as some other Nickelodeon cartoons like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. However, having nothing better to do, I still went to see the film. Entering the theater, I didn't expect much. I just expected it to be a stupid version of a children's movie like the movie RECESS. I think I got what I expected. It was a stupid children's film and nothing more. There were some good parts here and there, but for the most part, the film was a stinker. Simply for children.
