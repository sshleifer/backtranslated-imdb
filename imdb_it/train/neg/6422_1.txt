"I just watched this movie last night and I don't think I'll ever think any of the actors involved, because this movie will remain in my mind." <br /> <br /> the statement can be thought of as good or bad. I mean every time I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in a movie, I think of "A Few Good Men" which is a good thing. Now, whenever I see Ron Perlman or Kristy Swanson, I'll think of "Tinseltown" which is a VERY bad thing. <br /> <br /> I understood it thinking that it could be something clever or at least make me chuckle and with Arye Gross and the aforementioned Swanson and Perlman, I thought that at least it wouldn't be bad. It could be said that the film was made on a budget the size of Wheeling, Indiana (Where? Exactly.), But maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie. MISTAKEN. <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT fun or funny in any sense of any word. It's there and lasts for 84 excruciating minutes. <br /> <br /> The characters are very thin. You almost care about NONE of the characters, and since the protagonists are two Hollywood writers in difficulty with a dream that is all the two writers who struggle with a dream that wrote this need to know about them. Ok, the two real writers know all about the on-screen versions of themselves, so they also imagine the public. They don't even think about character development, except they try to tie the story to "Gilligan's Island". <br /> <br /> The plot is not original. Two boys live in a storage center, where one of them has a bed, and there are also about twenty people living there. The rest of the story is invented and stupid. Have you seen "National Lampoon's favorite deadly sins"? The second story with Joe Mantegna is about a TV writer who can't find a good story to make a TV movie, so he creates one. Now replace the writer for a screenwriter, turn Mantegna into annoying actors of half his age, and take away the comedy and you have this movie. <br /> <br /> The actors try. Kristy Swanson is in the film for about 10 minutes and still offers the best interpretation of the film. She is still sexy, but it would be a great help if she were actually STAR in a movie instead of constantly creating CAMEOS. As for the others, I don't think it's the actors' fault because they have BAD material <br /> <br /> Go watch the National Lampoon movie, but stay away from this movie.
