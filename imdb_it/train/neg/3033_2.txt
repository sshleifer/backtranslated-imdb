I'm a VERY big fan of Jenna Jameson, but this movie is horrible. At that time Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong and he was the director of this movie and Jenna was the most exciting porn star ever. So obviously, Brad tried to make more money than he could by letting her make this high-budget porn movie. Now I know why they don't make big budget porn movies anymore. In a fantasy world, pornstars could act, but this is the real world and cannot act. That's why there are porn stars, if a beautiful woman like Jenna could act, then she would try to go to traditional movies instead of porn. Just because your beauty doesn't make you a movie star. A good example of this is Traci Lords, when she was a teenager with her 20s she was one of the most beautiful and sexy women in the world. He made his entry into low budget mainstream films and could not act. Where is she now? I gave a 2 instead of a vote just because Jenna is so sexy, but there are better movies that she released "Dream Quest". Come on Jenna, we don't want to hear you talk as much as we want to see you have sex. Also, you Jenna, you'd have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you made an anal movie.
