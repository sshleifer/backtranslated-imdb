This is just awful rubbish, really horrible. Yes, we have beautiful naked women who dance and have sex. But while this could work in the mechanism of a porn movie ?? could it have been as successful as a porn movie ?? this tries to disguise itself as a "film" with real things to say, with real emotion and struggle. It is not. It's an excuse to put girls naked and have fun. I am sure that all these women (and men) in this particular film could have been decently decimated in the world of 70s porn cinema. . . but not in the world of cinema. <br /> <br /> The acting was mince, so bad, I mean really terrible. The writing was even worse. Can't I blame all these actors ?? they had nothing to work with. The film's very broad structure or plot could be done and done well with good writers and competent actors. The very wide structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting at people from afar, like a sniper. These shootings were motivated by men who did not respect their women enough. If there was more writing - better writing, much better writing - and fewer free sexual images we could have something to work with. <br /> <br /> This film should have been shot, made and marketed a hardcore porn movie all the time; would have made more money Practically it's already a hardcore porn movie, and it remains the only non-porn movie I've seen that shows an erect male penis.
