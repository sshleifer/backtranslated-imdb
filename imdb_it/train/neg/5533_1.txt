Before the release of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, zombies were relatively well-behaved creatures. Certainly they had much better manners in the old days. But the social etiquette aside from the chills that these first zombies offered to the public going to the cinema? Judging by this film, absolutely none. <br /> <br /> The story is about an expedition to Cambodia, whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombification. One of the parties discovers the secrets and starts building his zombie army. <br /> <br /> This film is basically a love triangle with zombies. But since this is a movie from the 1930s, the said zombies are more somnambulists than the carnivorous variety we think today. They seem to respond to mental control, rather than insatiable appetites. And frankly, the "revolt" is also quite overwhelming. The whole thing is really very boring. Apart from the lack of horror, there is no exaggerated melodramatic theatricality to entertain us. It seems unlikely that this could have provided much entertainment even 70 years ago. Watch it if you have to see everything with 'zombies' in the title, otherwise I would recommend you skip this.
