"Il Segretario" is one of those "clich√©" cheese subtitles that you are subject to watching on a Sunday afternoon when there is practically nothing else. While the plot (a demented woman becomes jealous of all those who manage to conquer her in the office and decides to do everything she can to stop them) can be unique, I recognized countless twists, probably taken from other films TV that I had been subjected to for the same reason. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I wasn't angry about the cast. Mel Harris is one of those actresses who appear in so many TV movies as a "mother" or a sort of "victim" of improper games or abuse, who must wonder about the kind of life she leads. In this, he has the joy of playing a mother AND a victim of psycho secretary Sheila Kelly, who was not a good choice as the villain. While Sheila Kelly has made good career moves (Singles, Breaking In, and I Believe, Law and Order), she is also assaulted by a series of pitiful roles in TV movies, and this adds to it. As for the others, I have no clear memory of them, so I have to say something. <br /> <br /> This will play on the Lifetime network (I think it's where I saw it), but don't worry about watching it, unless you're too bored with words. Not that it'll make you more excited ...
