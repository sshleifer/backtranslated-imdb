In "ISOYC, IPOYG" by director Eric Stanze, three men are subjected to torture in the hands of a woman who sexually abused. The first victim is forced to eat her own shit before being assaulted. The next guy ends up with a bullet in the horse after refusing to have anal sex with the corpse of the first. But he is the third man to get the worst: he has to watch the heavily tattooed "star" Emily Haack undressing and masturbating with a broomstick (oh, he also moves the handle on his butt!). > <br /> And unfortunately, we too (let's see it masturbate, it's not a broom that takes our butts!). <br /> <br /> Yes, "ISOYC, IPOYG" is a harsh viewing experience, not because of its relentless violence, but because Haack, which is obviously under the misconception of having the body of a goddess ( unlike that of a roadie for Metallica) it becomes constantly naked for the camera. It is not a pretty sight. <br /> <br /> In addition to the uninterrupted nudity of an invaded Haack, viewers can also see the terrible direction of Stanze (which thinks endless shots of tombstones and trees is fun stuff), some bad acting and the a fat man. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I give "ISOYC, IPOYG" a rating of 3/10, which is actually slightly higher than the current 2.9 average. This is a point for the disorderly attack (which, being a blood hound, I really enjoyed); a point for the piece in which the fat man pushes his face into a chocolate mousse masked with faeces (exhilarating); and a point for pure nervousness to suggest that this film could somehow be a sequel to Meir Zarchi's classic exploit I Spit On Your Grave.
