What a complete waste of time. The film begins as a clone of the Saw series, but with even worse acting. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely horrible. The ending is ridiculous and the plot contains no twists, no surprises on the plot and only a bad ending. I liked some characters and I hoped that everything was tied together at the end. It just doesn't happen. It's a total "Wrestler" that ends with none of the good recitations. I can't believe I spent the time looking at this. It is not "funny" as some people say. A guy in a mask kidnaps people who are connected and forces them to understand it. The connection is a bit long and he should have shot the main actress first.
