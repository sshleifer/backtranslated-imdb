Ladies and gentlemen, please don't be fooled by the "A Stanley Kubrick" tag. This is a very bad film that has unfortunately been hailed as one of the deadliest horror movies ever made. Horror movies should create such a fear that during nights people should shudder while thinking of a real horror movie. In Shining, there is no real horror, but what we find instead is just a naive and crazy attempt to create horrifying horror. Everyone knows how good the attempt is if they are different from reality. All that is good in the film is the view of the frozen valley. The hotel where most of the actors are housed looks good. One word about the actors Jack Nicholson looks like a lost and lazy soul who is never really sure what he should do. There's not much to say about a bald, colorful actor who for the most part is busy pampering an actor child. He doesn't need to blame bad weather for the tragedy. It cannot be avoided because the film was made and poor Kubrick is not alive to make changes.
