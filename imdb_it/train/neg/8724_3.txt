OK - i Contra prima: The obligatory alligator of the 70s (all right, correction - caiman) with non-moving limbs is worse for miniature miniature shoots (with the entire length of the reptile compared to the size of the boat) using a toy alligator being swirled around the toy boat in widely lit water - even for night shots! <br /> <br /> Unlike most primitive-kill-exploiters-western films, the superstitious natives who go bat-like and start massacring holidaymakers seem unjustified this time. No one has ever abused natives - exploited, yes, but far from abusive treatment. After all, he was one of the natives (who sang with a spoiled supermodel during a taboo full moon) that brought the curse of the River Demon on them, didn't it? <br /> <br /> Vacationers are easily annoying (with the notable exception of the old-soul / blasphemous token-girl-that-takes-a-brilliant-for-the-heroes you often see in the Euroflicks of the years) 70), but far from being worthy of violent death - unless it was your neighbor neighbors, beware. A couple is actually killed being heroic - notable since none of them fill the role of assistant.

Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. You all know WHY you are interested in this film in the first place, right? I thought so. If you are a Bach composer, get the DVD reprinted from NoShame films earlier this year (digitally remastered without any real extras to talk about, apart from the director who complains about the current state of international distribution of movie). <br /> <br /> The hero is not bad at all, being anything but an idiot (always a plus in the B films) and the cynical boy offers most of the comic relief. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look, but take it cheap!
