Starting with the long series of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a Chinese factory, Manufactured Landscapes tries to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies. His buzzing narrative assumes that industrial development in China and elsewhere is completely unprecedented, as if there had never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America and Karl Marx had never visited the British Museum. That there may be a connection between the current Asian push towards industrialization and wealth and the previous experiences of hunger and terror is never mentioned. <br /> <br /> At the same time, there is an effort to present Edward Burtynsky's photographs of industrial waste as somehow "beautiful". Much of the film is a presentation of these images. They are well produced, of museum size and apparently have appeared in various exhibitions. For me, however, they only show that almost all photographs can be made to look beautiful if well presented. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. The relationship, if any, between the photographs and the spoken message of the film is not clear. <br /> <br /> I do not mean to suggest that there are no real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialize. Manufactured landscapes, however, only offer strange and bitter desperate conditions. It's like a two-hour lesson from Noam Chomsky. Perhaps it has some value as a demonstration of what is wrong with the American (and Canadian) left.
