I was expecting a bad movie and I made a bad movie. But I couldn't really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was. I don't even want to try to explain what Blood Surf is. It is not a question of navigating on blood, but of a large crocodile. They complain about the fake shark in Jaws, but Spielberg was wise and didn't show the shark until the end. Here the crocodile is shown a lot of times, and it's the worst fake crocodile I've ever seen, and they don't try to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile watch, Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> The director had the opportunity to make a decent surf / shark movie, but he had to make a bad b-monster movie. He had the chance to make an original surf film, but he wanted to make a monster movie. So you understand how bad this movie is, do you have some good parts? Not really, he had a little nudity, and a sex scene that was taken directly from a playboy movie. The acting isn't bad either, and Kate Fischer looks good. Too bad you don't take your shirt off. Even the main actors are not bad. They had potential. The location was beautiful and the film starts well with beautiful surf scenes. The fault lies with the writer and director without talent. The dialogue is among the worst I've ever seen and the script is poorly written, and the director has no talent like never, and not a fantasy. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. Even if you want to see the beautiful Kate Fischer. It's not worth it. Watch the sirens to watch Kate naked and look at Lake Placid if you want a good crocodile action. <br /> <br /> 3/10 because I'm in a good mood, and Maureen Larrazabal looks naked and Kate looks good (but she's a bad actress,) and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi have done a good job with the piece of sh # t they had to work with.
