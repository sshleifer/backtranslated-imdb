I felt that the film was dry ... very disappointing, no plot ... expected something to happen and nothing was dry as a bone ... a waste of money .. One of the worst Robins Williams movies ... if not trust me, wait a few months for it to come out on DVD because what seems to be a scheme for movies that don't go well in cinemas are out like rents before the year is over ... This is one you won't want to see say why I spent my money on that! Also, since it's such a new film, there were only 8 people watching it .... This was Friday night at 9:50. I also felt that we needed more excitement or something that kept us awake. When the characters spoke in the film, even the voices were very low, you couldn't hear what they were saying ...
