Hey Arnold! it's a slow and a bit boring movie. The plot is not very creative. The character of Paul Sorvino (Shenk) buys all the decrepit and expensive buildings to build a giant shopping mall, commercial complexes and offices. This plot dates back to many children's films from the 1960s. That's boring. Even Paul Sorvino is not very exciting, so the idea of ​​him as a villain is not very scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the film talks about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal have to find the document with the hidden help of Helga, whose father hopes to get rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. Children have to travel around the city by bus, and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not just silly, but points out that this film was written for very young children. Hey Arnold, the cartoon on TV is usually a lot of fun, and has enough humor to please adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold, the film, is about five times more sedated, and a good way to put anyone, including children, to sleep. Hey Arnold was a tough one to stay awake until the end predictable and totally boring. If you want to send your children to a totally non-offensive film, this is it. I got the impression that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie, the producers started with a 30 minute script on TV and tried to extend it in 90 minutes. This story of the mall certainly could have been covered in the TV cartoon. I hope Arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel.
