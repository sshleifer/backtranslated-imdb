The only reason I rented it was for the Fangoria Magazine article. The article made this film interesting. Well, it's not. This was a very boring film, written and directed by amateurs. All the actors in this film are horrible, except Faye Dunaway, which is always a joy to watch. But too much time he focused on Gina Phillips and his ridiculous encounters with the crows and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has such an Argentine accent, you can only understand every word he says. Also close at hand is Nicholas Pauls, who plays the ultra-bland love interest for Gina Phillips. The bottom line: this film is not scary. There's only one good scene and it's the last five or ten minutes of the movie. I would have given this star, but I gave three just because I like Faye Dunaway so much. But she wasn't that good at it either.
