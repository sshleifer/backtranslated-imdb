What I found so curious about this movie - I saw the full version of the 4-hour roadshow, is strangely dispassionate. For a film about two very charismatic men - Castro and Che, engaged in a gigantic political struggle, they are almost totally devoid of emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (which at best is a second-rate actor, with a slightly high-pitched voice) have no drama or depth and basically go down to Castro telling Che: go here, go there, do this and that, without any explanation about the effect or use of this action. Odder is still an actor in the cast who has the power to play Castro - Joaquim de Almeida, but is sidelined in a small part in the second half. Without the tension or passion one would expect to fire these men and their followers, the film becomes a boring epic movie about hairy and bearded men running through various jungles, screaming and shooting at no particular purpose or end. Many of the reviews I read praised director Steven Soderbergh's work and almost completely ignored the actors. (In fact, more time was spent talking about Soderbergh's new digital camera than the plot or the actors or the fact that it was entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.) This is a strange, strange thing to do a) Soderbergh it was just a rental gun in the movie and b) it is nothing more than a competent work job, with a hint not mentioned by Oliver Stone's JFK in the black-and-white camera-cut work when Che visits New York. If you can imagine Reds directed by Andrew McLaglen in place of Warren Beatty, you will get an idea of ​​the despicable competence of this film.
