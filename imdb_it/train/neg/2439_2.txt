"Intensive Care" by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror films ever made. This extremely cheap Dutch slasher film offers a bit of gore and many absurd situations. A horror veteran George Kennedy is completely wasted as Professor Bruckner. The acting is abysmal, the action is slow and the climax is ridiculous. A famous surgeon has a car accident. He is in a seven-year-old coma and then he wakes up and goes on a rampage. "Intensive Care" is clearly influenced by American slasher movies including the "Halloween" and "Friday 13" series. The murders are hilarious and the dialog boxes are painfully stupid. Again, if you're in the mood, you can give this piece of junk a look. You will laugh until it hurts with this one - you can believe me!
