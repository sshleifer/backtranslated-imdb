First of all let me say that I had to think a lot about writing a comment for this film. The best review for this type of Cinema can only be silence. Film dedicated to housewives and grandmothers. This film tries to look "genuine" and the characters are supposed to be "real people". An Italian could never think that the characters could be "real": they are just "low profile" stereotypes. It gives a very disguised vision of what life is in the Italian countryside. The plot is weak (plot? What plot?) And humor doesn't make anyone over 12 years old laugh.
