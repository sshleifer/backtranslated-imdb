- A newlywed couple moves into the home of her husband's ex-wife. It doesn't take long before the new wife begins to feel that someone doesn't want her at home. He sees skulls all around the house. But when the husband investigates, he can't find anything. Is anyone trying to get her back to the asylum she was recently discharged from? Or is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get her new wife out of her house? <br /> <br /> - This is the first time I watch The Screaming Skull without the assistance of the MST3K crew. And, in all probability, it will be the last time I look at it this way. Can you say boring? I'm not talking about something boring, I'm talking about how the grass becomes dull. There are great stretches of the film where nothing happens. The screen could be blank and I would get so much fun from it. The characters continued to sing with the most monotonous conversations imaginable. Probably the Screaming Skull could be marketed as a sleep assistant. <br /> <br /> - Actors don't help much. Most of them deliver the lines with the sentence normally reserved for a school play. I didn't look for it, but I would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this film has ever appeared in anything of cinematographic value. I won't even get into the script with which the actors are given to work. Let's just say that the characters are given some of the most idiotic jokes ever pronounced on the film. <br /> <br /> - You have been warned! Or avoid this at all costs or, at least, look for the MST3K version.
