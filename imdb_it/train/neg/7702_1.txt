I am a black man who lives in a predominantly black city. That said, I have some important doubts about the work of Tyler Perry. I realize that some people out there feel the need to praise him, because he is black and is trying to portray a positive image of culture. But frankly, I think, it was Perry White, this movie would have had the NAACP, Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson all over his ass. <br /> <br /> I have been forced to watch this movie a whole hell of very recently and any repeated viewing makes my blood boil. The characters are poorly written and recited. The jokes are so bad, I really have to say that something should be fun. I'm just going to break this big pile of sh-t down. <br /> <br /> Madea = sucking. The character may have had some appeal, but he is no longer. When the only thing it seems to do is slap children and threaten adults with violence, it's less than useless. It is not necessary. <br /> <br /> The situation with his wife beating her boyfriend was horsesh-t. If a woman was so scared to death by her husband, why would she try to escape while she slept in bed. It would have made no sense for her to leave when she was at work. However, the characters in this bow were so annoying and overbearing that I hoped he would knock her off the balcony and that she was really rude when she didn't. <br /> <br /> Then there are the two lovebirds. A bus driver asks a woman to harass her while she is doing her tour. I could not believe. I really couldn't believe it when he agreed to go out with him even more. But what takes the cake is that an adult man has been reduced to throwing stones at a window and passing notes like a ten-year-old boy from a mega castrating bitch. I don't use this term lightly, but that woman only had two modes. Morosa victim and psychopathy. No matter which of these two faces showed, however, there was a constant. The driver would have had none. He even married her without tasting the products - WTF! <br /> <br /> Then there is the scene of family reunion. Here we have the burden of the mother that includes the implicit incestive taboos, the grinding for the sake of grinding, without a shirt, too muscular, b-ball, besides the great taste of Maya Angelou. When those girls dragged their asses out and called a meeting, I was wrong to wish the oldest of them had been charged with a heart attack. All this shit is happening at the meeting, in ridiculous and easy-to-separate groups, and then they ring a bell. When they do, everyone drops what they are doing and heads for them to speak astern, just like a pack of Pavlov's dogs - WTF !! <br /> <br /> So you have the last five minutes of the movie. In it we see the violent boyfriend being beaten by his long-time victim and bad actress all around. There is an impromptu marriage where blacks are dressed like angels and they hang from the ceiling - WTF !!! The only reason to look at it up to this point, besides testing your pain threshold, is the hope that the second villain of this story will bring her ass to her too. Guess what, it doesn't happen. Instead, Perry takes the testicularly challenged exit and plays it safe, ending the film on a forgiving tone - WTF !! <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure that if I had one day, I could probably write a doctoral thesis on all the ways this movie sucks. Don't even get me started on the rest of Tyler Perry's movies. I'm just saying this. In my opinion, as a black guy, D.W. Griffith's legacy survives. The irony is that he does it through a black man who will be praised for doing what Birth of a Nation did, selling us along the river. I just wish Perry's movies were guys, so I could have kicked them in the balls. Thank you so much my friend !! What are you going to do with this in 2009, a comedy about rape and the savage beating of slaves in colonial America?
