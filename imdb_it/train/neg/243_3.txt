William Russ is the main character of this TV movie. He left his family behind only to reappear and start paying his debts. But he tries to stay away from his family. Here is where Peter Falk (Colombo) enters, playing different roles, to convince him to go home. <br /> <br /> The story is average and they managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use it quite well. But William Russ wasn't really a star. However, it seems that his acting is still valid. <br /> <br /> I found the delivery and plot very rough about how everything was predictable. In fact, in the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate word by word before it happened. A good movie should never be like this. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a secondary film. In a letter classification system, it would receive a "D".
