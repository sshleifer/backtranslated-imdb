This TV movie shows that bad movies exist. The only reason I saw this was covered by a KTMA MST3K. It's the Super Bowl of the New Orleans Superdome. However, there is absolutely no football and we see that there is practically nothing behind the scenes. With the many stars in this film, it made no difference. I really don't know why I saw it.
