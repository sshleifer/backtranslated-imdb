Just recently, I obsessed and anticipated this film so much that I almost had to see it. Well, having just seen today, the rating of 5.8 is completely understandable. I think if you anticipate something so much as to become a desperate need, it turns out that it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Sure, The Hills Have Eyes 2 has its moments. It has a very nice and well-developed texture that goes well with the product itself, but the whole thing is so self-indulgent that it becomes so difficult to follow. And if it weren't for the production of Wes Craven in this film, it would be nothing to do with The original remake. <br /> <br /> But the whole thing makes you go "Should this be horror or COMEDY?" because there are lots of ridiculous, randomly positioned and stupid one-liner jump moments (IE "There's a hand in the sh ** er!" or "You motherfu ** er! I'll kill you all the damned children of b * * tches! ") and acting (God does not even remind me how bad he was. <br /> <br /> STORYLINE: (this part contains spoilers, beware!) The film begins with a woman giving birth to a baby mutant (ooh la la!), and then the screen fades black with the title of the movie that appears and a monologue, then we go to this office where there are randomly placed veteran war mannequins of people looking for mutants. keep track of the audio feeds has disappeared and everyone dies! After that tone-opening, you would expect more. <br /> <br /> So, let's go to this team of military recruits who train in Baghdad, while the captain them "A good job for stupidity", their last day of training is in New Mexico, the desert do where the family in the last age they were using were blocked While training, things end badly, people die and ... should I tell you more? Because right now I have the attention of a goldfish that forces me to sit here and write it. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with THHE2 is that it doesn't work. No flashbacks here, and the ending is pretty sure ... but with a twist! A fool, that is. I'm pretty sure the Ultra Super Director's Cut with a holographic cover and a ticket for The Hills Have Eyes 3 will show all its alternative endings, but at this point, I'm not sure if I'm interested. <br /> <br /> So by all means, if you loved the first THU so much it's almost a shame not to see it, so by all means, see it. But if anything else, then, avoid at all costs. It's for your own good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
