I love B movies ... but come on ... this was not even worth a vote ... The ending was stupid ... b / c THERE IS NO FINAL STATE !!! .. not to mention the fact that he comes to life alone ... I mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers ?? Slow as crazy and then start killing the characters one by one in a 15 minute time interval ... and I won't even begin to start on the side of the thing by killing a boy without his head .... so you can't not even see what Jigsaw does with his so-called "new puzzle" .... Unless you have nothing better to do ... Id look at the dry paint before recommending this God-forgotten movie to anyone else ... oh and to make the other totem of the movie even better, you can see the guy who throws the only creature in the basement scene from the window .. which was fun to die for and probably the only good part of watching that movie loss
