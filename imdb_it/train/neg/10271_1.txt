This movie was supposed to be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. The acting was terrible, horrible and cheap and speaks of a predictable plot! I will never watch this film again, nor will I recommend this film to anyone. What a waste of time! First of all, as soon as the film started, I realized what I got myself into. All they did for this film was copying the scenes of many other horror movies out there and bringing them all together in this one movie. Telephone chat, halloween night, a psychopath and a knife! It's absolutely ridiculous. I wasn't scared at all during the movie, which I thought horror movies should do. As for the making of the film, it's pretty funny how everyone talks about how this movie was so big and so scary. I mean how do you not realize that movies are a cheap rip-off of "Scary Movie" for example. At least you let in some good actors and then maybe it would be pulled out like a good horror movie.
