A steaming pile of cow dung. It's amazing to me that this film was made. Hip-Hop and old westerns don't seem to mix. To which audience target were these people who thought when they designed this train. <br /> <br /> Not only is the concept and plot a joke, but the acting is atrocious and the fact that some decent actors were also in this nightmare of a movie makes their careers laugh. The girl of unconsciousness should never be forgiven and she is stripped of any residual dignity she has had. After reading the first ten pages of dialogue he should have asked which of his friends was playing this sick joke. After some research, I found a list of other actors who broadcast this film: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah and finally Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, I'd rather fix an empty TV than watch this movie again.
