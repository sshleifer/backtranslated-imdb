This film was packed with endless surprises! Just when you thought it couldn't get worse, they added more joints and more frayed pink vans with ramshackle sex scenes. As you can imagine, I was a victim of the original version. We were led to look at him thinking he was Supervan, the host box that promised lasars, prison breaks and more. Who would have thought that a Christmas gift at the Dollar Store could have been so fun!
