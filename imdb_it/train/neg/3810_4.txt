When I was younger, I enjoyed this show, but now ... BLECCH !!! This show is mushy, poorly written and rarely fun. The three protagonists were all good actors and funny men (the Saget riser was much better than the things that this show had invented, just as Coulier was better than Stam was a better actor than average). After a while, Stamos wanted to get out of the show because he wanted to do more serious things (who could blame him?). The show was eventually canceled when many actors asked for more money. <br /> <br /> Here are some things that make me crazy about the show: <br /> <br /> 1. The catch phrases- How many times a person can endure frantic phrases like "rude", "you guy "," nerdbomber "," size "and" have mercy "in a period of time of 24 hours? <br /> <br /> 2. Kimmy Gibler - the most annoying character ever written for television. <br /> <br /> 3. Writing - stale and cliché like a mineral biscuit. There is good writing on clichés and bad cliché writing. Full House has had bad cliché writing. <br /> <br /> 4. Three men living together in San Francisco - Just say. <br /> <br /> 5. Unrealistic things - Too much to remember. <br /> <br /> 6. Fashionable boys - The girls had all the latest fashions in the mall and you can see the posters of the trendy recording artists they would be in. <br /> <br /> Now this show is on Nick @ Nite. I would hardly call it a classic. I have nothing negative to say about the people involved because I think many of them have talent for them. But this show was so sweet and sugary, I couldn't stand it after a while.
