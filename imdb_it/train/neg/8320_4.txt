After seeing Awake, I led to a conclusion: the director and screenwriter Joby Harold made Awake with the intention of laughing at the viewer, for the simple fact that the film is full of ridiculous elements. The awakening has a lot of holes in the plot and is full of absurd and ridiculous elements (for example, the hospital uniform used by the spirit of the main character ... did a doctor's ghost leave him on the floor?). The concept behind this film is a little ingenious but all the holes in the plot and the absurd things make this a stupid and lousy movie. With the exception of the great Lena Olin, all actors bring bad performances. Jayden Christensen has zero expressions and the same goes for Jessica Alba. The extraordinary actor Terrence Howard is hugely wasted in his role. Awakening makes the viewer laugh. It is so ridiculous and full of absurd things that it is impossible to take it seriously. My recommendation is: skip this lousy movie.
