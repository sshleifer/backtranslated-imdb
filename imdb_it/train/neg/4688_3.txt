Letting the lesson look in English was a bad idea. Movies that are serious and more educational can have an effect, but this seems to have had no effect on the class - whenever the teacher left, conversations started quickly - and I didn't hear the words "Shakespeare" or " Tempest "is used at all. And when you look at this, it's easy to see why. Acting is nothing special - everyone seems bored to pieces, just read from the page without worrying about the world. Shakespeare always preferred expository dialogue to action and death, but I could not understand a word someone was saying. The costumes are not so bad nor the special effects - the class might not have loved the movie, but they weren't even taking the p * ss. But it is difficult to joke in a film that is devoid of any kind of inspiration or joy. The scenes on the ship at the beginning of the film were not bad, even though the rain seemed a bit unrealistic, everything else was done well and well. But where were the severed heads and the exploding trees? Where was death? Where was the inspiration? Ariel's character would have been taken much more seriously if he wore clothes - but since everything was on display, it was just another excuse for a joke. This film is in no way attractive to either sex. Women and girls will not have romance or comedy to have fun, and there is an abundance of naked men and lack of action or death that will put most men and boys away. The Tempest was not badly done, but this seemed like something the producers had to do, not something they wanted to do. And the general boredom and lack of inspiration show. 3/10
