For me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes about Franks fanatesse when she travels with a ladder and when she is sitting in business meetings ... The problem is that when you watch this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasies / situations fun again and again and again. It is predictable. It's more a television story in which you can leave and return without losing anything. <br /> <br /> I like Felix Herngren as Frank but it's not enough even when it's a comedy he must have more variations and some kind of message to his audience .... <br /> <br />
