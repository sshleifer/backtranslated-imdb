At least the seats in the theater were comfortable and I ate the popcorn as loud as possible to stifle the lower dialogue. This is definitely not a movie for girls. Any guy that likes, are the ones that we women can be sure to stay away from. Stupid history, mediocre dialogues and a film with an economic aspect. I've seen many, many movies, but this is the new winner in the bad category. If you happen to see it, the only thing you'd expect is the ending. So you can finally run out of the theater as quickly as possible.
