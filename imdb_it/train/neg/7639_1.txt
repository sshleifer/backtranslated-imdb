I saw this movie at the NY Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and thought it was pretty bad. The first and most distracted was the way in which much of it was shot; that is, a lot of slowdowns and too artistic close-ups that seemed to have no point of view - wise or aesthetic - besides showing the abilities of the director of photography (which I believe was also the director). This film looked like what a pretentious film student would have invented. The main actor (Sam Levine) was certainly very nice, but at best he was a mediocre actor; and the rest of the cast went from so-and-so to bad. The story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable. I have to admit that most of the audience seemed to like the movie; constantly laughing and sighing, but I didn't like it much.
