This was a watershed event in my life-watching film. I went to see him in the theater when he came out. I was completely surprised by how bad it was. Movies like this ask you who put the money and who owes a favor - a very, very big favor. The special effects are absolutely first-rate, as any first grader could have done them. Toy rubber bats on strings without any attempt to hide the strings, arrows that seem drawn on the film and appear to be the shape of an arrow on a road sign, and a ridiculous narrative line. Ed Wood has made masterpieces compared to "Conquest". Every film student should see this just so they will know the very definition of a bad movie.
