The question, when you see a film so bad, is not necessarily "how was such a bad movie made?" or even, "Why did I see this horrible in the first place?" but, "what did I learn from this experience?" Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> - Just because the "rules" of horror movies have been cataloged and satirized countless times over the last ten years doesn't mean someone won't go ahead and make a movie that uses ALL , without a bit of irony or irony. <br /> <br /> - If your film is to be described as ** vaguely ** based on the video game, you have script problems. <br /> <br /> - The black character cannot always die first, but the Asian character always knows kung-fu. <br /> <br /> - While you might be proud to have figured out how to "make the" effect "Matrix on a budget, this does not necessarily mean that you should use it over and over again until you feel sick. <br /> <br / > - Being Ron Howard's brother does not guarantee roles of choice. <br /> <br /> - Whenever a scene is not modified together, it only uses some footage of the video game, no one will notice. <br /> < br /> - If your cousin's rap metal band offers you to write your movie theme for free, politely decline. <br /> <br /> - Zombie movies are not a zombie killing people zombies that kill people, preferably in the most gruesome way possible.That's what makes them SCARY. <br /> <br /> - Whites who can pay $ 1600 to get to a rave deserve to die. <br /> <br /> - If you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know - anything else you'll find on your two lines after someone asks you r√† "What was it?" or "Where are we?" <br /> <br /> - Bare breasts are not the horror panacea. <br /> <br /> - A helicopter strike and a license agreement with Sega magically transforms your film from "student film" to "major studio release". Try it! <br /> <br /> - Just because you can name all three "Living Dead" movies, that doesn't make you George Romero. Or even Paul W. S. Anderson. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse movies, but only because I've seen "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation".
