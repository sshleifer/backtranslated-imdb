People like me will rip this movie off. It's not just realistic. The plot is tremendously predictable. You can anticipate everything that happens with Convienza. Of course, they find the treasure and they become rich, broken and deceive the bad. We've seen it a million times before. The authors of this film must think that most of the film they publish is stupid. They must be right because most people liked this movie. I mean solving puzzles in seconds. The secret treasure room hidden under the Manhattan subway? You would think with all the work that happened in New York underground. That room would have been discovered earlier. and all that was built during the civil war? PLEASE And the love story between Ben and Abigail ?? how nice, and I thought the romance in Clive Cussler's novels was weak. They fall in love in that way, in 2 seconds, SOMEONE would be more interested in saving my ass and then getting some. hell with the girl and the stupid piece of paper. 1/10 Garbage
