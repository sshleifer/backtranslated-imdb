When you look back on another ugly Nightmare sequel like Freddy's Revenge, you must at least give it some credit for trying something new. And even if The Dream Child is more fun, it offers absolutely nothing new to the series. Yes, there is creative death as usual, like a child who becomes part of a comic and faces "Super Freddy", but even such scenes are not exploited to their full potential and the parts without Freddy are simply boring. <br /> <br /> This marked the official death of the fear for the series. Freddy seems to be the comic relief now ... but what? <br /> <br /> My vote: 4/10
