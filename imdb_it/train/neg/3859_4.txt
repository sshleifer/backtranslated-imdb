Jason Lee does his best to make a silly situation fun, but the film fails to connect. <br /> <br /> Perhaps because the character of Julia Stiles seems as embarrassing as the conniving and sexy who will soon become a cousin. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because her and Selma Blair's characters should have been chosen in the opposite way. (Selma Blair seems more conniving than Julia would be). <br /> <br /> In any case, this film is yet another Hollywood trivialization of a possible situation in the real world (to be captured with your pants off your cousin's bachelor party), which despite having a promise fails to deliver. <br /> <br /> There are a few laughs to be sure and the cast (though mixed) does his best with sub grade material that does not transcend his vulgar argument. So instead of making a successful feast (ie Animal House or American Pie) there remains a middle ground of partial humor and part stupidity (Meatballs 2 wing or something like that).
