This film was ridiculously bad. A friend rented it from Netflix and made me watch. There are so many gaffes and tricks that it's impossible to even worry about knowing the characters and the plot. How about these for example ... <br /> <br /> The "Vermont Airport" surrounded by palm trees <br /> <br /> Ben's shirt miraculously appears during a telephone conversation <br /> <br /> the sumptuous office of the priest ... complete with a folding table with game table <br /> <br /> There is a decent story hidden behind a very bad film. But even if you look beyond technical flaws, you'll find horrible acting and casting. I was more tickled by the casting of a flaming gay actor to play the religious zealot right wing brother. His opening scene, sitting in his spotless apartment, caressing his kitty, was exhilarating. I congratulate the writer / director / producer / editor / star / catering / cast dentist / composer (and whatever else he has done on this move) for actually distributing a film like this. If you have nothing better to do, it could be a fun group movie or even the basis of an alcohol game, but don't rent it for a powerful story about homophobia and gay marriage.
