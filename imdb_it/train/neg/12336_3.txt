I give this five out of 10. All five brands are for Hendrix which offers a very decent set of his material for the last day. Unfortunately, the quality of the camera work and the editing are at the limit of the terrible! We have countless shots in Hendrix's full face where he could almost do anything, peeing maybe? We don't see his hands on the guitar, that's the point! Also are we getting a lot of Hendrix shots from behind? There seem to be three cameras on Hendrix, but crazy amateurs handle them all. The boy in front of Hendrix seems eager to wander around lazily on stage as if Hendrix were a simple distraction on the guitar. While the guy behind is more active in clearing up some chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible work of the guitar that is turning off the amps (sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider) Interspersed on the tracks are clips of losing students protesting against Vietnam etc on tracks like Machine Gun, complete movie loss! If Hendrix had lived another two years, Berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day until a full official version is published. The only jewel that it contains is the incredible Johnny B Good but all in a rather scarce visual document of the great man and inferior to both Woodstock and Isle of Wight
