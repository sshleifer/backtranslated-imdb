A recent post here from a woman who claimed a military background contained the comment "A woman's life is no more valuable than a man's". <br /> <br /> This politically correct mantra is not as true as the story as well as biology show. The companies managed to recover from the heavy losses of their male population, sometimes with surprising speed. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939, despite the war of 1914-1918 in which over two million of its men were killed. In the Triple America War of South America (1865), Paraguay assumed three neighboring countries until almost all its male population was wiped out, but fought to a standstill in the 1932 Chaco war against Bolivia much bigger. <br /> <br /> No company, however, has ever been able to survive the loss of its female population. Only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight. Israel faced that situation in 1948, but since then has never considered combat units coed for its Defense Forces, despite the popular image of the Israeli soldier. <br /> <br /> "G.I. Jane" is a Hollywood hair.
