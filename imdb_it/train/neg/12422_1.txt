I rented this movie to see what could be a bloody and nonstop action movie and I got this over-priced and cheap super cheap drama that makes Kickboxer Die Hard look like Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and while Lou rescues Reb from the creaks, he is hit in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever. The scenes of Vietnam are filmed in someone's backyard, I swear! Lou is now brain damaged and Reb and he live together and own a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou believes he is fighting in a cage for money and Reb goes on a murderous madness to bring him back. There are no good fighting scenes, the fists are two inches from a person. The characters' personalities change in seconds. A boy is ugly and in the next scene he is good. The acting is horrible and the music is a song with an excessively sentimental sound by Frank Stallone that would make you sick. I hated this movie
