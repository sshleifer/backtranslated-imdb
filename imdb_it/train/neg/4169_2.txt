I gave it a 2 just because Natassia Malthe (like the vampire Quintana) looks so sexy in this movie. Surely there is little logic in this film, but so is most of the science fiction vampire flicks. The film probably tried too hard to break the traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, he went too far and made the whole story not only unreasonable, but ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There are too many scenes of blood and too much stuff that made me feel bad. A good vampire movie should be more reasonable that you don't need to see much blood - we all know when a vampire jumps on a human that will do what a vampire will do. Some moans or screams are all it takes to describe the scene (like the one at the end when Quintana tries to sexually arouse Rosa, all she needs is some groan, the rest is your imagination). However, it's just my personal taste.
