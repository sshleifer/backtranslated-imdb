I saw this film as I liked the plot, a group of strangers kept prisoners trying to understand how they are connected. <br /> <br /> The setting and the premise were obviously influenced by the first (and best) I saw the film and even though there wasn't much action the story moved at a relatively good pace. <br /> <br /> There was a kind of relief from the comedy of the two "Alpha males" who quarreled and it was a welcome surprise (for anyway) to see Melissa Joan Hart hasn't given up acting yet. <br /> <br /> Some things have disappointed me personally; 1. The pedophile has been characterized in such a way as to be activated by everything from children to corpses. <br /> <br /> 2. MJH's joke about her ex-policewoman "brought her into this" when in reality, she was the least deserving person to be there, she had not contributed KNOWLEDGE to the events that led to capture them. <br /> <br /> 3. The ending ..... what kind of film ends up in the middle of something that's happening? There was no resolution, no crutch, no obvious conclusion ... it really ends. <br /> <br /> And for this alone I lost two stars from my evaluation. The first 2 points I would like to let slide but not the end!
