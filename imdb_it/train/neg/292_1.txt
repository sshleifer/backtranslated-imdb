I saw this by chance show on the cable at pleasure as I thought that Sandra was quite funny from what I remembered. The only facial movement I had during the film was stunned by how horrible a movie I just experienced was. <br /> <br /> The person who said that this is one of the most entertaining films of all time, indicates a line, just a scene, which is also worth a laugh. <br /> <br /> She is a much better singer than I remember about her, but I didn't want to watch an act in the lounge. <br /> I think this movie is hard to prove because they think they should and don't see it objectively.
