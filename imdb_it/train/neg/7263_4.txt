This star-studded British / Spanish co-production looks great, what you can see. I have three versions, two VHS, a DVD, and they are all terribly cut, so bad that it looks like the buildings are talking to each other. Few films suffer so badly from pan and scan like this, as director Robert Parrish seems to have been so in love with the widescreen process that he tended to use both sides of the screen simultaneously, neglecting the medium. Another user comments that we see the entire inhabitants of a church massacred at the beginning; not in any of the copies I have. There are some sharp cuts of peasants who shoot their rifles, a Mexican officer is shot, Shaw and Landau celebrate, and that's it. We never find out why Shaw became a priest (if he really is), we never find out what happens to Don Carlos (Savalas), although I suspect he was called home to perform in Kojak, since his departure seems arbitrary. And there's a strange flashback sequence in which Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) is dancing with a bowler hat and an ugly dress in the great tradition of the old English music hall at the 1960 BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, not sung by Johnny Horton but with some text I've never heard before. On the plus side, the location is great, a huge ruined fortress with Escher-style stairs that lead nowhere, some beautiful chewing landscapes by Robert Shaw and good performances by Stevens, Landau, Lettieri and Telly Savalas like Telly Savalas . I didn't really like this movie, but I didn't see it exactly. I will look for the widescreen version and then I will make my decision.
