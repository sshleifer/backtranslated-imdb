Someone here actually compared this film in some way with High Noon. Now it's a real trait! I'm a big Sinatra fan, including some of his acting roles, but maybe the only person who could have played this part would have been Don Knotts. First of all, as someone pointed out, Sinatra doesn't have the build for an aspiring Western villain. He is too "light" at this point in his life. Maybe he was the same height as Audie Murphy, but Murphy had a rather solid build. Sinatra looks like the big talking kid that no one should take seriously. <br /> <br /> The story is not inspired and really not credible. I don't want to ruin it, but I think the ending and the way people react in this story makes no sense. Another thing, these people constantly allow themselves to be completely dominated by a "bad boy". This is just a small town, so I don't understand the attraction and I don't understand why people would let themselves be dominated that way. <br /> <br /> There is a "love interest" in the story and if I followed him well, he was angry when the main character refused to admit who he was, so another villain wouldn't kill him. Now there is true love for you. Get up for yourself! Tell him your name so he will kill you! LOL. Stop, you're killing me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the basic premise of the film is not good enough and no matter how much they have tried this story has not had a logical path to follow except in the waste paper basket. Want to know why it's not on video and never shown on TV? Apparently, the critics cut him short in 1956 and they were right: this film is pretty ugly. I almost bet Sinatra paid someone 6 for as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Want to see a good western in which a city opposes a villain? Try Tension at Table Rock or At Gunpoint - two really good westerns with that theme. Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko. Frank, you were the greatest singer ever - but you don't belong in a movie like this.
