Dear Richard, I know we all loved you in Home Improvement with Tim Allen. But seriously, don't you have anything else to do besides the limping sequels of Air Bud? I would have thought that Tim could have given you a small role or become his personal assistant. I know it sounds ironic, but the salary benefits are much more rewarding. <br /> <br /> Everyone will see you around Tim and will immediately think of "Tool Time". You would also have roles with Bob Vila more often. Instead, compare for 10 minutes with a Golden Retriever and smile. I know there wasn't much of a script, but you could have added it. I mean, come on. Tim owes you. <br /> <br /> But seriously, this film does nothing for the Air Bud line. In contrast, fake talking puppies are shorter than seeing dogs play sports. The original was better And you, Mr. Richard Karn, know more than anyone. <br /> <br /> This is an "F" movie.
