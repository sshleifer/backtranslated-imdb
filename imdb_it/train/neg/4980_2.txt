I just read a review that defends this film because it had a low budget, now it's my opinion of things. <br /> <br /> CGI monsters were reasonably well animated but they were implemented in the worst possible way. The fighting scenes weren't even fights, it was just a hit from an actor, then a monster hit with lots of interaction. When the monster interacted it looks like it was done in paintshop pro. In my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets. Maybe they don't look fancy, but at least they interact, just look at the first Peter Jacksons movies. <br /> <br /> As for acting, Beowulf did a descent job but the rest of the cast was not trying or forgotten where they are. <br /> <br /> The script seemed confused to me. One minute they would speak as if it were a modern day, the next day Shakespeare's theatrical speech will be held. I do not say that it should be all 'you' and 'that is' but you have to find a cohesive balance so that the lines sound as if they came from the same person. <br /> <br /> I noticed a part of it near the beginning when Beowulf was quoting the old testament that would have been found if he hadn't spent the rest of the films talking about gods and portents. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is a bit shiny asshole, but a shorter round.
