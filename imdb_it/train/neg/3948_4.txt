This is not video nastie, but only because it came out in 1994 when they were supposedly tired of the whole affair in Britain. It's 75% of a remake of The Boogeyman, and it would have been banned for the same reason - whatever it was. <br /> <br /> At first I was confused because I thought that Annie (Kelly Galindo) might have been another Lacey, but it was a problem with the psychic visions of a black man similar to that of the first movie. Fans will immediately notice that they are not the same person. <br /> <br /> After seeing a murder in a bathroom, and also seeing the address, Annie, her psychiatrist and a para psychology student that looks a lot like the boy on cheap pink novels and butter announcements, head for the house, and, of course, it's the same bathroom. 24 hours later a murder happens just as she described. Obviously, we have no idea who this brave woman is or why she was killed. <br /> <br /> Then the film moves to a reinterpretation of Boogeyman's story with some extra footage that we didn't see in the original. In particular, the black man is shown unlike the original. Unfortunately some of the best scenes have been cut, but 90% of these are present. Why re-run this movie? Did they find the movie in the trash? What was the purpose? <br /> <br /> We will never know, and despite the psychologist telling Annie to be cured, we all know that the black man will never die.
