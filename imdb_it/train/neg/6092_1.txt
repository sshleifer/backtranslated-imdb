Someone must have really joked when they made this film. <br /> <br /> Firstly, it is absolutely impossible for this film to have been released in 1993. Fashion and music dictate that this is seriously 80s. My hypothesis is that this remained for a long time on the shelf before a crazy distributor took it and published it in an incredulous world. <br /> <br /> There is a plot. Guy. A strange solitaire meets a random man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favorite song he will be able to turn into anyone he chooses. At this point I feel obliged to point out that the solitaire's favorite song is London Bridge Is Falling Down. Why is this his favorite song? Because he is an idiot. We are only a minute into the film and already the film has reached a monumental level of stupidity. Become even more stupid. <br /> <br /> The solitaire is the collector of nostrils. I can only assume that there are two scenes in the movie where he is seen touching his nose. This clarifies the title. He decides to turn into a girl so that he can get close to the other girls. And kill them. This is more or less. <br /> <br /> Acting is universally terrifying. Every single performance in this film sucks. In fact, I would say that acting is the standard of a pornographic film. It's really so terrible. The nostril collector appears to the public as the nostril collector. The characters in the film see him as the girl with whom he became singing London Bridge Is Falling Down. Friend, I feel like an idiot even writing this. However, it is a bit strange to see a middle-aged girl walking around with school girls. And not in a positive sense. There is also a large assembly of scenes in which the nostril collector is at school with the girls and a song sounds high. It is most likely the worst song ever recorded. I'm not going to describe it. You'll know when you hear it. And you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes of violence, of course. And there's a Benny Hill style chase sequence that involves a transsexual. There is also some immortal dialogue, which may or may not have been taken by Shakespeare or John Milton, where the nostril collector tells a prostitute: "I have the money if you have a gash". Bella, I'm sure you'll agree. <br /> <br /> Absurdity.
