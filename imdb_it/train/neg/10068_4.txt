A cowboy in tune with the plight of a nearby Indian tribe is wrongly accused of rape and murder of the chief's daughter, causing much hatred and violence. <br /> <br /> This nudie feature is fun to watch, even if absolutely impossible to defend at any artistic level. The terrible customs and the fact that all the Indians are obviously white, makes this aspect more like a live cartoon than the serious production that the press material demands it to be. <br /> <br /> In short, the abundant nudity (the real reason for looking at this) is good. All the rest is not. There are certainly better examples of both genders. <br /> <br /> More interesting is that The Ramrodder was shot in the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and does not include one, but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who was probably already in the murder jar at the moment this hit the stained soda screens of the Pussycat Theater!
