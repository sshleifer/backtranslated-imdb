I bought this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart. After seeing it, I could simply go back to the store and try to get my money back! The only reason I gave the film to 2 and not 1 is that the story has some novel elements, even if it never rises to the level of being interesting. This film has all the characteristics of being made for the market of drive-in theaters: very low budget, amateur acting and a liberal dose of sex (for a film of the '60s). In fact, I wonder if maybe the only reason the film was made was to make a quick penny and because someone knew some strippers that they could use as extras. The film is about a wacko doctor who wants to transplant his girlfriend's severed head onto the body of an unsuspecting donor. Most potential donors are strippers or a model - whose only real purpose in the film is to titillate while removing most of their clothes. However, they take too long to make the film still worth watching for the bad parts and the film is not horrible enough to deserve to be watched by bad movie actors.
