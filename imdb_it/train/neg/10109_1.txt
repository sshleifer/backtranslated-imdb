BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; the man continues to pull out the absolute garbage and the ironic thing is that he loves his shit. <br /> <br /> I've never seen an Ulli Lommel movie, but I was so surprised by how everyone thinks his stuff is so terrible. Like the films I mentioned at the beginning they are not even equal to six if added together! After reading the comments I was curious to see how bad this guy really is. He's the worst out there. <br /> <br /> The credits would not end when the pathetic film started and in a short time I noticed that the audio was incredibly cursed. The acting was incredibly horrible and the same as shooting on the camera. Assembly is easily the worst. This film made no sense and I couldn't stand it unbearably since it wouldn't end and I only had 45 minutes in the film. I can not handle it anymore. I've lost 45 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK AT THIS CRAP!
