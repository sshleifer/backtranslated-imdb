First of all I can say that I felt so strongly with this film that I joined IMDb specifically to review it. And my review? This is without doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The synopsis of the film seemed interesting: Nazis, occult, time travel, etc., but the plot of the films could not bring all these elements together. Do you remember the South Park episode that showed the manatees who wrote the Griffins using "idea balls"? Did these manatees also write ungodly? It is as if the writer wanted to include all these different ideas, but he had no idea how to link them all together, and thus make things even less sensible, including a theme of Donnie Darko's time travel to the end, messing up the chronology. <br /> <br /> I could tell right away that it was a bad movie. The special effects were too low budgets for something better than directly on DVD. The acting was not great, but in all honesty I saw worse. I will praise the Nazi paintings, they were disturbing, but the evil Nazi was just a comic. <br /> <br /> I don't have a revenge against this movie or anything, but to be honest, I'm not even in the horror genre. But this film cannot be described as a thriller or a drama. If this story had been well told, this would have been a good movie. But it was over the top. Waaaaay over hyped.
