The past creeps into a rehab drug addict when he reconnects with his sick brother and a former girlfriend after what he hopes is his last detoxification period. "The dramas of life", presented here in the most simplistic way imaginable (not even writing has any bites or spirits). The cast is composed of attractive-looking actors who smile darkly at each other, and music and photography are lugubrious (a couple of visual effects are laughable, indie-clich√©s touch the stench of a gaunt budget). Although it was written and directed by a man, this was produced by a woman, and I'm not sure, but I think this may be a distinct reason why this photo of two men, strangers brothers approaching, never gels, he never feels natural or seems to have lived. It is an attempt to enter into a male relationship, but careful and sterile presentation is a trick. No one has the heart in this, living, breathing or bleeding this material. "The Perfect Son" is quickly spread by too many cooks in the kitchen.
