Not a film, but a collection of synchronized performances with a lip of acts that were part of the British Invasion, which followed the Beatles' dynamic entry into the world of music. Some of these acts have not been very successful on this side of the pond, but many of them did. In the foreground are Herman's Hermits, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, Peter and Gordon, Honeycombs, Nashville Teens, Animals and, of course, the Beatles. <br /> <br /> It is so much fun to watch these young artists first sharpen and polish their acts.
