"The Vampire Bat" is certainly interesting, being one of the first horror films set in the 1930s, but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for true praise. <br /> <br /> The film is set in a European village in the 19th century, where a series of murders were attributed to vampirism by suspicious locals. There is a very similar feeling to James Whale's Frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of Lionel Atwill's character of Dr Niemann, complete with his misconceptions about scientific progress. <br /> <br /> The theme of the vampire is arbitrary and only used as a red herring suspecting of falling on the simpleton village Herman (Dwight Frye) lover of the bat, thus providing the excuse for a crowd wielding a torch to go on all the rage - as if he needed it. <br /> <br /> This is one of the trio of the first horror films in which Lional Atwill and Fay Wray played (including "Doctor X" and "The mystery of the wax museum") and like the other collaborations the film suffers of bad advice comic relief and a tendency to deviate from horror to elements of the mainstream thriller. In the context, "The Vampire Bat" is still weak and derived. <br /> <br /> All we have left is a poor quality Frankenstein imitation, with vampire elements purely a device to deceive Dracula fans. But for the title the film would be tiring even to be considered a horror film and it's worth noting that director Frank Strayer was making "Blondie" films a few years later.
