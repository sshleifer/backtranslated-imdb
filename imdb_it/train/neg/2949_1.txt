Wow ... what would you do with $ 33m? Let me give you a choice; you can a) destroy it and throw it down the toilet or b) create a film based on the premise of Whoopi Goldberg as a Futurist cop tied to a rubber dinosaur that uses words like "I didn't silence the trumpet" and blow raspberries on the base that this It is funny. That's right, you would choose the option that has more merit: blushing the toilet. <br /> <br /> This must be seen to be believed. I can't even find the words to describe how bad this movie is. It doesn't even fit into the "so bad - it's good" category. I actually did it on television as I write - and as I watched I felt the need to come to IMDb and record my disgust. <br /> <br /> Considering that Jurassic Park was created a couple of years ago, why do they think the public would tolerate a man dressed in a rubber suit anymore? WG should have simply walked and damned the consequences. All interested parties will go to hell for this criminal waste of money. <br /> <br /> I have to stop writing - I'm about to implode.
