Exactly what you would expect from a B-Movie. Mock, free nudity, boring parts, awkward and poor special effects. Obviously it could have been better, better interpreted (better) better written, directed, etc. But then I suppose it wouldn't have been a B movie. The actors practically sucked, in fact this seemed almost an episode of buffy, the vampire slayer or something like that except with a lot of blood, swear words and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiffany Shepis must be chosen. She is absolutely the screaming queen of the new millennium. Not that acting is really important in these films, but it was better than any other actor. She's also very sexy, in that plastic jumping costume she wore for the whole movie - wow! Her back is absolutely stunning in that dress, I mean that every time she turns around you can help her control it. And near the end of the film, the viewer is rewarded for seeing it completely neutralized. <br /> <br /> So if you are a passionate horror b-movie (like me), look at this. If not, you should probably avoid them at all costs.
