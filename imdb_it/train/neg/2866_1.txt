No word can describe my total hatred for this frightening interpretation of the BTK killer. Evaluating this film one in ten completes this truly disastrous excuse for a film. From beginning to end, there was not a single highlight. The whole thing was horribly put together; the script, acting, plot, lighting, direction, ACTING, factual information, ACTING, just to name a few. A number of scenes are literally laugh-out-loud-funny, for the atrocious way in which the whole thing is put together. This review may seem like an unfair and scathing attack on a low budget movie, but this is not the case. The mere thought of the movie I just saw makes my blood boil. How come this film has been granted production rights I will NEVER know. I'm almost tempted to actually recommend BTK, because it's really a reference point for how pathetic and terribly terrible it is. I can honestly say that, in all my years of cinema, this is the WORST. MOVIE. NEVER. I wasted over an hour of my life in this useless garbage, and I would gladly be thrown out of the nearest building in advance if I had known what I expected. ZERO on TEN.
