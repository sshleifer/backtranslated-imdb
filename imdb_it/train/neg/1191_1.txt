I'm a big fan of Troma but I can't understand why they bought the rights for this movie, it's so boring I felt like I was watching for 3 hours. In some places the plot summary says "but what Satan does not know is blocked by boring tourists". Well, they didn't seem to bother him in the movie, just me. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this film is the actor who plays Satan, I like bad movies but it was just boring.
