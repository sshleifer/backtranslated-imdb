I saw this movie at the AFI festival in Dallas. Most of the audience, including my wife, enjoyed this comic drama, but I didn't. It stars Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kissed, The Five Senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Art School Confidential). The director is Matt Bissonnette, married to Molly Parker. All three actors do a great job in this film about 3 friends, the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third. Everything takes place in a lake house and it looks wonderful. The film wants to treat his subject as a comedy first and then as a drama, and I thought it necessary to be the opposite.
