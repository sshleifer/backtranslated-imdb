Oh just what I needed, another nineteenth-century film about England. Which is more or less like normal England, no one's vandalized football stadiums. In this picturesque setting of gentlemen, ladies and other randomly chosen titles, Charlotte Gainsbourg goes around aimlessly like Jane Eyre, from that novel no one has ever read willingly. in the cradle of Mr. Rochester, where he tries to teach a French girl to look at an empty board all the time. One day, Mr. Rochester (William Hurt on the autopilot) returns to fall in love with Jane and all, but there is still the question of his muffin that is locked in the attic. Oops, it wasn't in the brochure. After some people were thrown around and some were carefully scattered (probably they rented the set), the film finally came to an end. Everything seemed really authentic, it's something I believe. But then again, nah.
