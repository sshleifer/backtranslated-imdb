What is this? This must, without a doubt, be the biggest waste of movies, settings and camera ever. I know you can't set your expectations for the 80s slasher, but this is too stupid to be true. I made this film for $ 0.89 and I still feel the urge to claim my money back. Can you imagine who is STINKS tough? <br /> <br /> Who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations ??? Well, actually, you couldn't care less. And why should you? The creators of this piece of trash certainly didn't care. They didn't try to create a little tension. The director (Stephen Carpenter - I guess it's much easier to find money with a name like that) also made Kindred (1986) quite pleasant and recently did Soul Survivors. Complete shit as well, but at least that had Eliza Dushku. This garbage has the debut of Daphne Zuniga !!! (Who ??) Yes, it's true, the Melrose Place chick. His memorable character dies for about 15 minutes. after the opening credits. He is the second person to die. The first victim dies directly in the first minute, but no one seems to mention him later or not, so who cares? The rest of the actors ... they don't really deserve the term actors, they are completely uninterested. Hope that they die a quick and painful death ... and not just their characters <br /> <br /> My humble opinion = 0/10
