I like musicals but as a Dickens fan I hate it. ** MOON SPOILER ** Hungry boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the lab? The poor of London who go out to sing? Fagin and Dodger walking towards sunset? Not exactly faithful to the novel. As a souvenir, Dodger was publicly hanged and Fagin went mad in prison. ** END OF SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes, doing little more than a snarl to indicate his illness. Worse still, it's Mark Lester as Oliver, who often comes across so clumsy and passive that you wonder if he's really the main character. His portrait is in no way helped by the fact that the best they can do when he sings is dub in a girl's voice. I guess they didn't realize that little ones can be found in almost every church in England. <br /> <br /> Respectful Dickens fans: stick to David Lean's extraordinary 1948 film or the BBC's 6-hour adaptation in the mid-80s. Avoid this bleached lime of a musical.
