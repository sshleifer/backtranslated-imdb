When many people say it's the "worst movie I've ever seen", they tend to say that he didn't like any movie. However, of the nearly 700 films I remember seeing this is one of the two that I have moved away from feeling personally insulted and angry. This is my first film review, by the way, and I registered with IMDb only for raving this movie. I went to see him when he was in theaters (I and my two friends were 3 out of 5), and after 15 years I don't remember many specific details, but my attitude after leaving the theater is still crystal clear. <br /> <br /> --- Warning spoiler --- <br /> <br /> Oh my, where to start. Fatty loser left at the altar, goes on a ski weekend, meets a blonde bombshell who is interested in him, takes him home to meet the family, they are all cannibals and he is the main course, pathetic attempt to dramatic escape, he takes to kicking all their butts and running off with his brother's girlfriend, they live happily ever after. He retched. First, the gags are so bad that it took me a while to realize that they were trying to be FUN, and that this was a COMEDY. The special effects, which are few, seem to have been made 15 years earlier. The great dramatic ending was so drunk and poorly performed that it was almost unbearable to watch (it puts the whole cannibal family out of the way with rakes on the lawn, which raise the style of Tom and Jerry when they trample them). I'm sure there is much, much more, but I'm not going to see it again for an update.
