This film is a pathetic attempt to apparently justify the actions of Mary Ann Letourneau. To do this, they chose a nineteen -well, probably not "to do this". There was no way they could have a twelve or a thirteen year old like the boy, because the love scenes would have cashed everyone out (if they were allowed to do so) - as they should have. Mary Ann's boyfriend was the age of my nephew, making her a pedophile. Sixth grade, people. The definition of pedophile must not include many children - all you need is one. <br /> <br /> I don't really care about his education or his unhappy marriage. He had a responsibility to his students that he was not up to. The reason given is that she is bipolar, refused the diagnosis and refused to take her medication. It is understandable, therefore, that he was not thinking rationally. Hopefully she now understands her actions. <br /> <br /> Now that you and Vili are married and have two children together, I pray you are taking your medicines and thinking clearly. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, Penelope Ann Miller was absolutely convincing and perfect for the role.
