... not living in Montana and above all not living there at the end of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> "A river flows through it" is certainly a film well done from a cinematic point of view. Great landscapes, Redford performs well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is ugly (if there is a story). <br /> <br /> I was sorry for the narrator / author, who is like a dry and petty character like his father, a preacher. Being guided, not driving his own life, he is left to look at his brother, who is also caged in the small city environment, losing his life. The author never even comes close to understanding his brother's motivations, but at least he realizes that he lacks the least amount of fun / homour. All there is, fly fishing, where it also follows his father's style as an old man. <br /> <br /> The end is not surprising, it is predictable from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Definitely NOT a must see (3/10) <br /> <br />
