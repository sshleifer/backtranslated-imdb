What Hopkins succeeds with this effort as a writer and director gives us the feeling that we know absolutely no one in the film. However, perhaps the problem lies here. His film has a lot of ambition and his intentions were obviously complex and drawn from a very deep depth, but it is so impersonal. There are no characters We never know who anybody is, so there are no investments on our part. <br /> <br /> It could be a scriptwriter who mixes with his characters. IS? Could be. By this I do not mean that Slipstream is ambiguous; I mean we can't say. Hopkins' film is an experiment. At first glance, it could be said that he is an aspiring screenwriter, who at the very moment of his encounter with destiny, realizes that life is inconstant, and / or success is a blind possibility, as he is hurled into a "trail" of collisions between points in time, dreams, thoughts and reality. Nevertheless, it is so incessantly cerebral that it leaves no room for any trace of emotion, not even the small, fairly rudimentary measure of allowing us a connection with its characters. <br /> <br /> I did not think that the e is a flamboyant school of film camera and camera, machine gun, disengaged me, but reflecting on the film I am beginning to understand that it has a lot to do with this film . There are so many movies of the last decade where camera cuts or movement have sound effects and other technical deteriorations that deteriorate the atmosphere. I suppose in this case it was justified that his purpose was to compose the impressionistic answer of dreams. However, I barely knew anything about Slipstream when I watched it, and I came out the same way. And I really don't care, because Hopkins made no effort to make us worry. There are interactive films, and there are films that sit in a rocking chair and knit, unaware of your presence. Slipstream is the second.
