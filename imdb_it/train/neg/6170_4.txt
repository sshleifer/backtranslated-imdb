This movie starts VERY VERY slow, but when the action finally starts, it's a little to follow. I couldn't understand why some events were happening and many events happened before they were explained, which made them a bit confused. The only thing that he really intends is the massive amount of blood / blood he has, even though most of the time special effects are missing. The blood looks like a red Kool-Aid. Watery skin looks as if someone were treading on a pile of sticks. Again, the story has a kind of amateur feeling, as if the writer didn't take long to perfect it. I feel it could be a much better film if the effects had been made better and more time had been devoted to the script. Honestly, I wish I hadn't seen him, not because of the blood, but because I feel I've lost 90 minutes of my life. If you like extremely bloody movies, this is for you, if not, stay away.
