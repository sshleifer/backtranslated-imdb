A few days ago, I saw a documentary called THE FIFTY WORST MOVIES OF ALL TIME and I heard about the INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN. Being a lover of schlock movies, I'm making a point of trying to find some of the documentary films - not just by including THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN. In fact, MELTING MAN is the first "bad movie" I've seen since and I must say I'm rather disappointed. Even though it's really a bad movie, it's not even close enough to be included in this list. <br /> <br /> Now, before seeing the documentary, I enjoyed the "bad movies" since I read the book "The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time" by Harry Medved. Despite the same title, the book was released for a long time, long before the documentary and the documentary creators never credited the concept of Medved. From the book Medved, I saw about 35 of the 50 films, but I came to a standstill - the rest of the films are not available on VHS or DVD. So, I thought about trying the movie with the same name. <br /> <br /> The reason I was more disappointed with THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN is that there were some good elements in the film. First, the special effects of the melting boy were generally really fantastic and disgusting. It is obvious that a professional (the famous Rich Baker) has been involved in making this aspect realistic. However, I must also point out that there were also more than a few cheesy and economic effects - such as the floating plastic head and the way the monster ran after his left arm was cut - he saw himself "cleverly hidden" underneath her clothes! As for the story, it's just stupid. A group of astronauts miraculously penetrate Saturn's rings without being crushed. So they comment on how beautiful the sun is - how we see close-ups of it. This is strange since Saturn is so far from it - it should NOT appear that way - it should be a grain. Regardless, the scene immediately changes and we are told that one of the surviving astronauts is in a hospital. What happened between the last scene and this one? Yes, nobody knows. Well, soon after, the survivor escapes and engages in a murderous fury as his whole body melts. <br /> <br /> Now considering that they have a psychopath who runs on who looks like a melting icicle, you'd think the government pulls out all the stops to find it and stop it, right ?! Mistaken. A general commits a lone doctor to find him !! No army, no police, just a stupid doctor. Even after the bodies start to accumulate, the doctor or general never does anything to organize a meaningful search or get a backup. <br /> <br /> Now, given the stupidity of the film, you too would not be surprised to find the following: <br /> <br /> When the guy is approaching the doctor's house, the doctor gives his wife a powerful sedative and leaves her at home. <br /> <br /> When an old and pretty couple is driving late at night, they naturally stop in an orchard to collect fruit and get killed. <br /> <br /> When a lady sees a man who is melting, he barricades the door to protect himself. This would be smart if she didn't have the back door of the house next to her! Instead of leaving the house and escaping, she waits! <br /> <br /> When a photographer and his model are taking snapshots, the guy grabs his assistant and pulls out his top. Why? Well, to give the public a cheap thrill and make it a class shot. <br /> <br /> When the guy finally finds himself and the sheriff shot him, the doctor stops him - even though now the monster had killed about half a dozen people. <br /> <br /> So as you can see the movie abounds with silly elements of the plot. It's a very bad film. But given the occasionally good special effects, it wasn't as horrible as I had hoped. Sure, it's a good laugh, but not close to PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE in bad condition and should never be included in anyone's worst movie list.
