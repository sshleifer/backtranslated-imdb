I had the clear displeasure of seeing this film at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. I have attended this festival for over 5 years, and I have certainly seen some poor films occasionally. However, "First Bite" has reached a new low in the film. Despite being shot in beautiful places, with the occasional, exquisite first floor of fabulous food, the film disputes an excessive number of twists and turns until I was practically pleading for it to end. <br /> <br /> The main actor, David La Haye, failed to show any character development throughout the film, representing a pompous chef from beginning to end. Additional secondary plots, such as eating disorders, have been developed so inadequately and totally inadequate in any context that the film had shown up to that point. <br /> <br /> A theme of mysticism has been used as a poor attempt to hide a film that gets nothing, goes nowhere and completely disappoints.
