I remember being forced (yes - literally FORCED) to see this movie from a Southern Baptist Preacher when I was a child, and even then I loved his terribleness. It is designed to scare the poor suckers into being "saved". The only thing that has "saved" me is the fact that in the end it is over and I could go out and have a REAL life. <br /> <br /> See the chapter on this film in Sarah Diamond's book "The Politics of the Christian Law." And certainly more interesting than the movie!
