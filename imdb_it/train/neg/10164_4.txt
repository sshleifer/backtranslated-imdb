I've just seen it at the Venice Film Festival, and I can't decide at all. We have never been allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to worry about it. Perhaps this was the point, that we are all in a "bubble" of ours, but these people did not force me to be worried about them or shocked by their various destinies. In a running time of just over an hour, the characters were not very well developed. A lot of time was spent on factory equipment shots (forklifts, conveyor belts, shovels); and the somewhat creepy looking dolls with surprisingly realistic eyes, which most characters created for a living, were somehow more interesting than living people. An interesting experiment, but somehow never quite united.
