As a South African, it is an insult to think that someone has actually been paid to produce this nonsense! <br /> <br /> Although the director was one of the writers of the original mini Shaka Zulu, this "addition" to the series is scary! The original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist, leader and warrior. A man who played an important role in shaping the history of local tribes in South Africa. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film, however, is nothing but nonsense, scraped from the bottom of the cane by a writer who failed to impress since the mid-1990s. <br /> <br /> While Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors, what is David Hasselhoff doing to save the slaves drowned with his red buoy and his whitened smile? <br /> <br /> I kept expecting blonde and prosperous women to appear out of nowhere and pass through the screen with their tiny red bathing suits, for no apparent reason. Not that this would have been more bizarre than the fantastic plot that was probably imagined after 10 pints of beer in a costume party, where someone's caveman costume inspired the writer to return to an African theme for his next "success" .
