The only thing that "An Inconvenient Truth" proves is that Al Gore is still an idiot. These "unchallenged" experts are not contested because an answer to their inane hypotheses is generally below the true science. This is mostly people of false science. The biggest source of greenhouse gases - CO2 - is people, we breathe it out and, unless you are willing to start sacrificing your brothers to save the world, there is no damn thing to do. We have heard how the world would end up as the result of man for more than 50 years. Fools publish a time line for their judgment day and when time passes, nothing has happened. "An Inconvenient Truth" is just another vehicle with which a naive faction of American society can pass off their poop. <br /> <br /> And as for the fact that Al left the tobacco business because of his sister's death from cancer, it's a burden as well. Al couldn't handle his farm better than he could handle the country. He was losing money on the operation because he didn't care about cultivating when he could do more $ talking about tours. The only global warming that is unquestioned is the hot air produced by this gasbag!
