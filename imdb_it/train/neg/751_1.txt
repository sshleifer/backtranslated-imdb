I honestly believe that ANYONE, considering the making of a film, is subject to this unbearable failure. Like the "films" by Edward Wood, Jr. in the '60s and' 70s, this film is a brilliant example of why real filmmakers use so much energy to rewrite screenplays, rework their films and rework their special effects up to at the end Look to the right. This film is also a decent topic for the studio pre-screening process. If Mr. Hines had been forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial public, perhaps he would have cut 75% or the scenes of walking / running / walking and would have modified this film up to 90 minutes more bearable. <br /> <br /> Film students should see this film as an example of how dangerous it can be to think that their work is "good enough". Every performance, every line of dialogue, every digital effect, every filter effect, in fact every frame of the video expresses the danger of fighting for simple mediocrity. A novice director may find himself trying to think "At least I have achieved SOMETHING" or "The completion of this will be a result in itself". This film will help them understand how bad a film can be. <br /> <br /> Critics could also benefit from watching this film before dubbing the latest summer shows "the worst movie ever made". <br /> <br /> Beginner writers can learn from this film how important rewritings are, and perhaps understand the need to rewrite. Furthermore, novice filmmakers can learn the importance of a good script, and a degree of respect for how difficult it is to write a script that makes the audience feel emotionally constrained through history. Writers and directors who watch films made to measure for the week and think "I can do better than HERE" can see an idea of ​​this film as it is difficult to produce mediocre results. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that this film can serve as an educational tool for novice filmmakers. In particular those that enter the boat in this current post-Lucas and post-Spielberg environment. There is a reason why filmmakers like these are acclaimed for their special effects skills. The war of the worlds clearly illustrates that not everyone can make it. Some can't even get close to it.
