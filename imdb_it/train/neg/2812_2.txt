I saw this movie recently at a film festival. It is the love story of a former unemployed alcoholic who has just emerged from a great depression and a single middle-aged woman who works in an employment agency (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of clich√©s, taking the "social" theme of the film and turning it into a romantic comedy. The leading actor has done a good job, he definitely looks like an alcoholic, but Ana Belen is not credible as a working-class woman, it seems, acts and talks a lot like a "high-level" woman. What I mean is that Ana Belen plays herself. He does it anyway in all his films. The whole staging of the film was very poor. Photography is ugly, it is not using panoramic proportions well. The dialogue sounds totally scripted and boring most of the time. The comic situations are typical of Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny at all and are badly solved. In my opinion this film is not worth watching. Only if you really love Pereira's previous films could you enjoy this a little. Anyway, I left the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The director was near the door. I wonder how a director feels when he sees someone come out of one of his films, especially one made to please everyone.
