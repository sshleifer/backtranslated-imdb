ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE (1940) is the ninth (ninth) film in the series and shows the direction in which it was inevitably direct. The characters ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and JUDGE HARDY (Lewis Stone) would have been protagonists. The rest of the cast was even going to beat the time and collect their checks. The series would once again rise to the occasion and have had its moments, but a fatal decline had already begun. <br /> <br /> Lewis Stone throughout the series will continue to portray the character of JUDGE HARDY in a comprehensive way. The rest of the cast would be professional even if he has less and less to do. On the other hand Mickey Rooney would have continued his character as if there were no learning curve. ANDY's reaction to any situation was naive and incredible. Even after returning as a veteran of the Second World War service in LOVE RIDE A ANDY HARDY (1946) his reaction to any "teapot storm" was the same, youthful. <br /> <br /> In this film it is clearly illustrated. ANDY finds himself in several incredible situations that would have been solved with a simple explanation. This on-screen writing device was known as the "idiot plot". A means to lengthen a poorly written scenario. Perhaps it was less the fault of Mickey Rooneys then of the director and the writers. Most likely George B. Seitz had directed too many and a firmer hand was needed to control the excesses of the Rooneys. To see our overview of the entire series go to TE ONLY A YOUNG ONCE (1937).
