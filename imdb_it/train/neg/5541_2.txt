Since the movie-loving universe became acquainted with a boy named George A. Romero, the word "zombie" is automatically associated with images of blood-soaked horror and non-stop sequences. It is safe to say that his "Night of the Living Dead" formed the zombie movie as we know it now. And yet, in the early years of cinema, the premise of reanimated corpses was simply used in slow psychological thrillers, almost without action. "I walking with a Zombie" by Jacques Tourneur is a perfect example and so is "White Zombie", with Bela Lugosi. This "Zombie Revolt" could have been another example, but unfortunately it is a failure across the board and easily one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. A terrible acting, a poorly written script and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension! The film lasts only 65 minutes, yet the first half hour is entirely wasted on stupid intrigues of love stories and unexciting monologues. The setting in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor could surely have led to a more compelling story, but all we saw are interior shots. The lead actress (Dorothy Stone, textbook blonde with curly hair and an ugly nose) irritated me enormously and I continued to hope that a ravenous undead would suddenly appear from nowhere to devour her. Unlucky again ?? If you can compete in 60 soporific minutes, you will be rewarded with a pretty decent ending. Still, this is too little to give this film a positive rating, let alone a recommendation. To avoid! This is the kind of movie you should only see if you've already seen everything else.
