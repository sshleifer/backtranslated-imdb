This delightful fusion of New Age grumbles and badly cinematic movies can't "open" you, borrow one of the film's favorite verbs, but it could leave your jaw soft and your belly aching with laughter or gagging. Based on the bestseller by James Redfield, the first (self-taught) published in 1993, this kitsch cornucopia traces the spiritual awakening of an American history teacher (Matthew Settle) who, traveling to Peru deeper, darker and prouder , sniffing both the air or something else more illegal. That is to say, what he discovers is a Shangri La schlock populated by smiling zombies that could be crazy or simply abused, perhaps because they are often accompanied by a flute flair and occasionally by a celestial choir. Although there is a lot of talk about "energy", that quality is definitely absent from the heterogeneous group, whose numbers include Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow, who are now firmly placed in the camp's pantheon. For those who care, the plot involves soldiers, terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni provided the wrong direction while Mr. Redfield, Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote the script for a script. In short, easily the worst film seen in over 40 years of watching movies.
