This 1973 TV remake of the classic Billy Wilder is less than the original. Surprise! <br /> <br /> First, the good things. Lee J. Cobb makes a fantastic Barton Keyes. He's not as good as Edward G. Robinson, of course, but it's the only reason to see it. The only improvement of this remake compared to the original is that it reduces the role of Lola Dietrichson, stepdaughter of the femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson. <br /> <br /> And that's all for good things. <br /> <br /> Bad things are many. The director records everything in an indifferent way: if you watched the film with the muffled sound, you almost didn't have the impression that something particularly interesting was happening. Due to the bad modern taste, the film must be in color instead of black and white. Due to the bad taste of the 70s, all the sets are absent-mindedly ugly. Walter Neff's expensive apartment in particular is horrible. <br /> <br /> The modern environment hurts in many small ways. Train journeys were a little more unusual in the 1970s than in the 1940s, so Dietrichson's decision to take a train seems more like a contradiction. The men have stopped wearing hats, which prevents Walter from covering his brown hair while posing like Mr. Dietrichson with white hair. Mourners have stopped wearing veils, which kidnaps Samantha Eggar of an object that Barbara Stanwyck has made splendid use of in a key scene. (Strangely, Lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was looking for a black hat and a veil before she needed it.) Stephen Bochco retains much of Billy Wilder's script - Raymond Chandler himself. But he makes many small, inexplicable changes to the dialogue that leave the script a bit flabby where it once was thin and muscular. Shockingly, the famous biker joke is gone, but look closely and you will see what looks like a post-production cut where these lines should have been. Bochco may not be the cause. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna is passable like Walter Neff. What could have made this version tolerable is a truly splendid Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead we take Samantha Eggar, who comes out as a "Barnaby Jones" standard mischief. But who can blame Eggar? With a director who seems barely interested in what's happening in front of the camera, how could Barbara Stanwyck herself have come out well?
