Can I do it until I need glasses? at least it shows that anyone can make a film. Talent is not a consideration. People who have unleashed this miserable vomit vomit pile on the world lack the appearance of talent, taste or intelligence. The relevant public must be composed of newborn children and newborns who play with their own faeces. Anyone else would be too wise in the world to even get a laugh from this movie. It consists of a series of small scenes in which the final line does not even extend to the obvious. It ends up ridiculous. The jokes told are the types of jokes that elementary school children tell (usually vasal or sexually related) in which they don't know the meaning of all the terms they use. You know, like the one on Dad's car and Mom's garage. Applying any more severe method of criticism would be useless, since the normal standards of acting, writing, directing and the like have never even been heard by creative "minds". behind this mess Don't judge, but anyone who has enjoyed this movie should think seriously about their purpose on this earth. <br /> <br />
