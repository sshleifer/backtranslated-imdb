Anyone who has seen Comedy Central around midnight in recent years has probably seen advertisements for this movie. I first saw ads for this movie in 2001. It seemed like it could be fun, but I wasn't going to call the number on the TV screen and order it without first seeing the movie. I thought I would wait until the movie was available for rent at Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> About a year and a half later, I was at Tower Records and on the "DVD for under $ 20", there was a copy of this movie. Seeing that the DVD cost only $ 6.99, I decided to buy it. I returned home, inserted the disc into the DVD player and waited for the laughs to start ... and I waited again. Laughter never came. <br /> <br /> I should agree with almost every other comment on this page when I say that this film was horrible. Sick, desperately insipid and poorly written and directed, THE UNDERGROUND COMMEDY MOVIE is a piece of atrocious garbage and in my opinion is the worst movie of all time. No stars
