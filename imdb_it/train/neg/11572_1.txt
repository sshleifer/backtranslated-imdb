Slow, boring, extremely repetitive. No wonder the Weinstein Company did not buy this. This Spurlock should eat more McDonalds during filming, and stop producing. There is no way you can watch this and have fun. The preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can make a 2 minute movie with this idea not a feature. I'm so sorry I rented this movie. I will never look at anything with the name Spurlock. He's completely junk. Filmmakers like that should be on YouTube and never receive a distribution agreement. The film states that American consumers and their purchases are at fault for the current depression when shopping and buying products, by circulating money in the system are the basis of a healthy economy.
