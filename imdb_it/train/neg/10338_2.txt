This film is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> From the casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the fatuous climax, the film is an exercise in predictability in wood. <br /> <br /> Mike Hammer is one of the true sociopaths of detective fiction. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who put the pieces together to solve the mystery, Hammer breaks things to get the truth. This movie turns Hammer into a cum by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well, too stupid to get away with anything. One is so badly drawn that it succumbs to a popcorn attack. <br /> <br /> Other parts of the film have just come out of the book of Stooges' three books. Velda's dance at the bar, for example, or the villain who accidentally stabbed his head in the back. And the interruptions of continuity are shameful: Frau Blucher is running along the center line of the road when the camera is tight on her legs, but it is far ahead when the camera pulls back for a wider shot. The worst pause, however, precedes the attack of popcorn. The villain who chases Hammer passes a watch a few seconds after our hero, except the clock shows that he was seven minutes behind our boy. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there were some interesting shooting and lighting angles, and the grand finale is so bad that it has to be seen, which is the only reason it gets two points out of 10.
