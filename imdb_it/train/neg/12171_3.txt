Being a fan of slasher movies, I usually settle for watching all the slash movies that go through my retinas, which sometimes hurt my brain more than good, I will say. While the canal was sailing the other night, Sleepaway Camp II crossed paths with me. Of course, I wanted to check, as I had heard about the Sleepaway Camp franchise, but I've never seen any of them (to my shame, I know). I will note that since I did not see the original, my criticism should not be taken too seriously, because perhaps what I think is wrong is totally intentional from the design of the franchise. <br /> <br /> Now I assuming that the Sleepaway Camp franchise is, in itself, a joke on itself. Hell, even the name looks like an intentional joke. Sleep far away camp? It's fun. I can appreciate the movie for wanting to put together something for pure horror camp value, but that's the best I can. The acting in this film made the cast of the original Friday 13 appear as actors playing Macbeth. Campy requires bad acting, but come on. Pamela Springsteen as the evil murderer out of reality has done a better job of killing my interest than he killed the entire cast. As for the comedy, there were a few times when I giggled, but it was little and far away. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, SAC II is pretty boring, and I really wanted to sleep away from the field. The deaths are so clearly staged and false that you can hardly appreciate them. If you're looking for a slasher movie comedy with a good pitch, I recommend the Dread Club. If your navigation channel takes you through this, check and see what else is active.
