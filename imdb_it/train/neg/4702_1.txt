I hate this movie. I hate the show. I hate pretty much everything about it. it's so annoying and stupid. everyone says that nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and that they will make it great. WHAT KIND OF MEDICATIONS ARE YOU TAKING ??? !!!?!?!?!?! nat and alex will eventually become hobos or end up like Jane Hudson from "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" I couldn't get over 20 minutes of this, just 30 seconds of the show, and I managed to survive for about half an hour of "Battle of the Bands". How anyone can cheer for these guys in the audience at the Kid's Choice Awards, I have no idea. a few days before the film's premiere on Nick, most of Nick's teenage actresses (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) showed up in an audience that negatively affected dead children about how awesome nats are alex wolff. first of all, they didn't deceive me, and secondly, nat and alex probably drugged them or paid a lot of money to be able to say it and seem convincing, because I don't see how anyone can find this show / funny movie. the music is just awful. Nat's song sounds like a dying and sick moose. alex is the most annoying character in the film / television program EVER. it's not funny, it's boring, it's really weird, and he thinks he's sexy and knows everything about girls. this guy is lucky if he can ever fuck. you know this show is fake when you find out that some of the characters (in real life) don't even exist !! the character Jesse is actually played by Nat and Alex, cousin Jesse Draper (they had to have some budget problems). Their father is not single, he is married to Polly Draper, but he does not appear on the show, making it appear that the Wolffs are motherless. Not even Rosalina exists. His name is Allie DiMeco. I'll tell you that the Naked Brothers will find themselves somewhere deep when their "fans" discover that the whole thing is on stage. 0/10
