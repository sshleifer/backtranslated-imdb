It happened on a copy of this. Not mine and if I had spent my money on this, I would have found those responsible and I would have asked for a refund! All I can say is that it would be a terrible student film. Any understanding of the medium of the film is absent. Acting is terrible, the story would have been rejected by the original Twilight Zone series as not original and lame, and the change in tone of the protagonist's reaction to the "ghost" is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I can only accept that the "brilliant" reviews of this film come from friends and family. I'm afraid it's not even bad taste. <br /> <br /> Amateur to the extreme! <br /> <br /> Avoid! To avoid! To avoid!
