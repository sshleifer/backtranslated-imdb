This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Not only does it have almost nothing to do with the other American Pie films, the story is obvious, flat and absolutely not fun. <br /> <br /> The girls are beautiful, but spending time watching low-cost soft porn might be bigger than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be a sex very badly made announcement, made for an audience that is not older than 12 years. I have never visited an American college, but I would have serious doubts about whoever did it could really laugh at any scene. <br /> <br /> Save your time, do something else.
