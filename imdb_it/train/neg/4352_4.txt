If you have seen friends, writing will seem very familiar to you. Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of Friends often share the same comic scenes. <br /> <br /> The show concerns a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class when they were still quite young (around 10 years I think). Now they are about twenty-five and meet again in a class meeting. This is where the series begins. <br /> <br /> A typical episode deals with multiple narrative lines simultaneously. They are usually not connected in any way. Each plot is divided into several sections, which are then shown in a mixed order. <br /> <br /> Sketches are my problems with this series. As in the following seasons of Friends, it is often a rather silly environment with situations that are hard to believe. One of the main characters does something really stupid that is hard to believe. The situation is therefore strongly exaggerated, as if it were not silly enough. If you like this kind of in-the-face humor, then maybe you'll like this series. For me it is a great starting point. <br /> <br /> The reason I started watching friends is because of the first few seasons. There are interesting and particularly credible story lines, with a little romanticism that makes you the root of the characters. The class has none of this. The characters are simply too forced and the stereotypes are pushed too far. It is therefore not possible to relate to them and like them. <br /> <br /> At least with friends, it took several seasons before it ran out and the character's features were all milked. But in The Class, it looks like it ran out before it even started.
