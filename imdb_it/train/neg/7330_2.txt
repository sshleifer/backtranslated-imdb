Kill Me Later "has an interesting initial premise: a suicidal woman (Selma Blair) about to jump to the top of an office building protects a bank robber (Max Beesley) who promises to" kill her later ".> <Br / > The actual execution of this premise, however, falls flat as almost all actions serve as a simple device to move the plot to its predictable conclusion. The badly written characters that show no reason for their behavior compromise the quality to act all The lack of depth of the character diminishes in particular the performance of Selma Blair, whose character Shawn falters from being gloomy to acting "cool" and in the end looks like a confused disoriented. This is unfortunate, because in other circumstances Mrs. Blair is a captivating and capable actress. <br /> <br /> Compounding is worse is the insistence of director Dana Lustig on the use of fast cuts, s effects. incongruous pecial (eg look for an unintentionally exhilarating infrared motorcycling chase in the end), and a fashionable soundtrack in the hope of attracting the attention of MTV fans. Surely Mrs. Lustig proves to be able to master the technical side of directing, but in no way does her skill help overcome the problems inherent in the film and then the film drags on to the end. Clearly, Lustig has a distinct visual style; however it is perhaps more suited to music videos than movies. <br /> <br /> The producers (Ram Bergman and Lustig) can be praised for their ability to make this film: they were able to scare up to $ 1.5 million to finance the film, secure a good cast and get national and foreign distribution. It is no small feat for an independent film. However, given the quality of the product, the result is a mixed bag.
