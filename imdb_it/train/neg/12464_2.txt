This film, apparently a thriller, had about five sub-frames that developed simultaneously until the climax, but ended up more like a yawn. <br /> <br /> The writing was trivial, the rhythm was slow and bumpy and the characters were boring. George Clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym, Matt Damon hammered it and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompter. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this film is that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so ended up saying nothing about big business, oil and the Middle East. I saw the documentaries provide more excitement. Look at it only if there is absolutely nothing else to do.
