I will make it short and sweet .... this film has been sucked up !!!!!! <br /> <br /> I saw the first part today and thought it was one of the greatest movies ever, it gave it 9 out of 10 stars. So I thought maybe parts 2 and 3 would be sequels, I was wrong. This film bored me to death and was so different from the first, it had a continuous plot and that's all. It was like a bad outtakes of the first part or something. <br /> <br /> I love Walken, but I feel sorry for him here. I was so happy that Glenn Danzig was in this movie, but he didn't blink to lose you. There was a cast full of disgusting actors and people I don't like like Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, it was a breath of fresh air to see Ethan Embry, he is one of the funniest people in the world. <br /> <br /> This movie will make you look a little less first, so don't watch it because you feel you owe it to yourself, being a fan of part 1. I'll wait a few days before looking at part 3 and please that is better than this shit. <br /> <br /> The last scene of the film with lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown in the film. Advance quickly or jump to that if you can't stomach the first part. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars - this was terrible!
