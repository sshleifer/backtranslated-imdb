My first review of 2010 is "Into The Blue 2: The Reef". The story is about two divers played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort who love to explore hidden treasures at the bottom of a local coral reef. One day after a day of exploration they are approached by a couple played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They tell young divers that they want to hire them to explore the coral reef and find a rare artifact on Columbus's hidden treasure located at the bottom of the cliff. <br /> <br /> The day after the four dives at the bottom of the reef and roughly after a whole day of diving they find nothing. A few more days later, the two divers discovered they were part of a large deadly plot in which they cannot escape otherwise they will be killed. They were hired to find two large containers. One contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a nucleus. <br /> <br /> The film also has a story about another person (the protagonist's brother) trying to sort things out with his girlfriend, I think this part of the story was a waste of time, this includes also a very smoky sex scene between the couple which to me is a complete waste and was not necessary to be shown. <br /> <br /> However apart from this, this film has a good underwater photograph and the colors blend well, which is why it receives 4 stars. Into The Blue 2 is a sequel by name only. None of the original actors or characters come back, it has a stupid storyline, stupid characters and a boring climax.
