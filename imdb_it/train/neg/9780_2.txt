Good God, whoever made this turkey needs to be buried alive. I'm sorry, but the other reviewer must not have seen this movie, must look at something else, or have never seen a movie before ... 9 out of 10 stars? Is he saying what, is he as good as Ben Hur or Gone With the Wind? Characters unintentionally funny, massively incredible, absurd situations, it seems that it was shot in Griffith Park (which works quite well - MASH was filmed in Griffith Park), a disgusting script, practically everything that could be wrong in a film all rolled into a single package. The vision of all future directors should be required as an example of how a film could be terribly wrong. It reminds me of something a USC student could do for a film class. <br /> <br /> Give this a ride, unless you use drugs and are on high ground.
