In what I can tell was a robbery of my time I was taken to see this movie and I have to say that horrible experience. Fay Ann Lee is a terrible actress and does not convince in this film. Larryjoe76 is obviously a reviewer. The plot is thin to say the least, the Cantonese dialogue is not fun. Watch this movie at your own risk. <br /> <br /> David Tang of Shanghai Tang should look for the film for the minimal or non-existent revenue that this film will generate. The trivial plot attempts to compete with other community novels out there, and simply blends into the scenario. It was like looking at dry paint. <br /> <br /> In short this film was a total waste of time and space. I've seen better movies on YouTube.
