For a great classic story, the setting (location), Grendel was disappointing. As a writer, I blame the script that completely lacked dramatic tension. The club history column is useful and would have provided a new interpretation of the classic of literature. For some strange reason that the column was abandoned soon. Knowing that this was shot in 21 days tells me "hurried" and unfortunately shows. Now we will have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I spoke on FX, I can tolerate CGI really crappy, but the script must be rock and this was simply too slow, spartan and lacking in drama. I would blame the actors but ... since I can write more than act, I will choose my colleague.
