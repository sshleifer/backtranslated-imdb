Okay the promos promised a comedy and the people (a few) went to see it Being the first release of 2006 is not a bad thing, or for that year, because the first and the last film are mostly flops except GHAJINI and others again <br /> <br /> Okay coming to JAWANI DIWANI <br /> <br /> Review at a glance The film is about Emraan Hashmi who does his usual things unfortunately it is annoying this time after reps He has an irritating Hrishita Bhatt and a flop Celina Jaitley <br /> <br /> Cringeworthy dialogues, comic scenes and ill-managed drama and a lot of loopholes <br /> <br /> Direction is bad Emraan Hashmi is annoying here, fortunately now he is becoming of age Ma post FOOTPATH ​​and MURDER and some decent work in some other films the actor in him took a back seat and directors focused on his kisses and on the womanizer image which unfortunately lost his touch later the Hrishita and Celina reps are bad. Mahesh is horrible
