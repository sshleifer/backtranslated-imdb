Oh, my dear God. They turned what was a pretty inspiring movie into an exciting testosterone festival. <br /> <br /> The original 1971 version of this film was wonderfully vague about our hero Kowalski. He was a man trying to drive from Denver to San Francisco to win a bet. Why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a handful of uppers? We're not really sure. <br /> <br /> We had some flashbacks that made us realize that he was an adrenaline junkie, and presumably he had driven his whole life trying to reach the vanishing point. That point you see in the distance where the left and right shoulders of the road come together and the road itself vanishes. It lives only to be free and does not mean to fall ill for anyone. We have seen several times when there were incidents that he stopped to make sure that the other driver was in place before going ahead, even the police chasing him. <br /> <br /> When he saw the futility of his research he took his life rather than being arrested and living a life of captivity. He died as he lived, and opened wide. <br /> <br /> In the remake Kowalski has a whole story (including a name, too.) He is trying to get to the hospital where his wife suffers from her pregnancy complications. She is a devoted husband and an excited expectant father. Comes to the decision to take his own life after hearing his wife dead on delivery, but they also leave THIS question when they suggest that he might have jumped out of the car before he ended up in the bulldozers. Have they even given the part of "super soul", the blind DJ (brilliantly played by Clevon Little in the original) to JASON SACERDOTE?!?!?!?!?!? Give me a break.
