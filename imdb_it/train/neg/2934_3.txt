Simon Pegg plays Sidney Young, a stereotypically clumsy idiot who works as a celebrity journalist in this American comedy. After a successful break, he began working in the prestigious magazine Sharps directed by Jeff Bridges in New York. It's more The Devil Wears Prada than Shaun of the Dead. The unlikely love interest is provided by Kirsten Dunst who works well with Pegg for laughter but cannot set the screen on fire with their passion. <br /> <br /> Sidney faces some emotional challenges as he tries to decide if he should forget his journalistic principles to get material in the magazine. Of course in the end he is seduced by the pomp and charm of the celebrity world, in particular the young actress Sophie Maes (Megan Fox of Transformers). Fans of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Spaced will wonder if Pegg himself has ever experienced similar feelings in real life with this film and partly Run Fat Boy Run as one of the United Kingdom's best in ruins. /> <br /> All in all this is a forgettable comedy. Please come back to us Simon, we can forgive and forget.
