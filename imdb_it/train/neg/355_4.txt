Just Cause is one of those films that initially make you think about why it was so heavily predicted when it came out - nothing special but quite competent and with an excellent supporting performance by Ed Harris. Then you hit the last third and everything starts to get more and more silly until you have a murderer with a torch tied to his forehead who threatens to impale Sean Connery's wife (a typically manic and unconvincing Kate Capshaw) and a kid (a very young Scarlet Johannsen) in a hut of an alligator. <br /> <br /> The type of film that is probably the best seen on a plane, and even then only once.
