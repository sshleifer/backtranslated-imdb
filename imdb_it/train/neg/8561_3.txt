The Cowboys could leave you a little sore in the saddle. Definitely not one of Johns' best films. Don't get me wrong, with any John Wayne move there are always good points. And this has its fair share. But the whole picture moves slowly and is not up to the aspirations that could have been. Bruce Dern does an exceptional job as bad again. Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the film. The guys in the movie were average, but they could have cast better. This would be a good movie for film-goers between eight and fifteen. <br /> <br /> It would be a good family move to watch with your children. Keep in mind that there are a couple of scenes you might want to take a look at before letting the young people see them. But most of the guys I know have seen the movie that way. Maybe it's because they can see children of their age doing all the grown up work.
