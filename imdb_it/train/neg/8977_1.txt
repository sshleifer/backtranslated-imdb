A female country singer nicknamed "Big T" - seriously, that's what they call her - risks her musical career and her budding life falling into the company of a squalid drunk (Busey) who wants to be his manager. Her mother committed suicide, her father is an alcoholic and has a violent nature. You can imagine where it leads. Meanwhile, there's music in abundance, as Parton, with his fluid vocal talents, belts song after song (at least half a dozen of them on Texas). Stay away from this mess and take a look at NINE A FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS.
