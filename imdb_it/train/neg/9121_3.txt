This is not a terrible comedy, but it is very unbalanced. It has almost no laughter, and wastes its prodigious production values. There is a touching moment towards the end, when Fu Manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his "nemesis" and tells him that "You were my only worthy adversary, and now we can start all over again". That scene, however, along with Burt Kwouk's amusing cameo at the beginning, are the only memorable parts of the film. (* 1/2)
