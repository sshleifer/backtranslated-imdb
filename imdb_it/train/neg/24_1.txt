I must congratulate the genius who approved this. Edward Furlong, you're not as good as you think, buddy, you can't grab every piece of cheap amateur shit, whose only purpose is to get some money. <br /> <br /> The shooting is bad, and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera would get the same result, or better. <br /> <br /> Acting, let's just say: don't go to the supermarket looking for actors. The good guys usually come with a degree or, at least, have some damn experience! The director ... Mr. Jon Keeyes, please find your purpose in life, as a director that you just suck. Your direction is poor, the corners are all messed up (not in a good way), the lines seem as if they were read from toilet paper and the damn music ... it always appears when it shouldn't come out for no apparent reason. And don't even go as a writer, by the way. Making movies is not like serving in a coffee shop, it requires art and skill, things that I really doubt you ever have. <br /> <br /> Instead of making a shooting movie, you should have turned this back to oblivion and wait until something good came out .. Or just go find a job in a coffee shop. You'll have less stress and you'll save movie goers with a little money and a bad night. <br /> <br /> vote: 1/10 (my first)
