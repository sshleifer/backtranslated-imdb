This movie was really bad. I love war movies and I can usually get out of most movies and find something I liked, but it wasn't one of them. This film lacked substance and intensity.OK I understand, the Finns have quarreled and this is fantastic, but the story is told badly. You have no real connection with any of the characters and there is no real storyline to follow. You go from one random scene to another, nothing flows to form the story that is trying to be transmitted. If you want a war movie that will keep you pinned down, and surprisingly enough without battle scenes, then I'd suggest "Downfall" (German film of World War II). Or if you prefer a fabulous plot and lots of action then I'd suggest "Brotherhood of War" (Korean war / Korean film). These two films will not disappoint you as Winter War does.
