After seeing the 2004 Canadian / Icelandic / British production of "Beowulf & Grendel", which I thought brilliant and surprising, I approached this - the first of 3 new Beowulf films released this year - with trepidation. As soon as I heard "Viking" and saw the horned helmets, I moaned. It was the Swedes and the Danes of migration, not the Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings have never worn their horns on their helmets (the horns make it easy for your enemy to take off his helmet and then brainstorm you). Then there is Hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a set for a film about Greece or Rome, not Denmark's 6th century. Swords and armor look like props left behind by previous films set in various historical periods. I spotted the weapons that could have been used by the Crusaders in "Kingdom of Heaven", and one character was even wielding a sword from the playback film Windlass Steelcrafts from "Beowulf & Grendel"! Beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was sad and the acting totally in wood and unconvincing. The biggest yuk was a crossbow with a secret weapon, complete with sight and explosive bullets, which looked like something bought by the Iraqi rebels. The special effects monster and his mother were so steroid that Beowulf could never tear off his arm, as he did in the poem. Thanks to the gods for the bazooka crossbows! I could go on, but I won't.
