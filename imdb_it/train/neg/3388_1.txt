I admit I was a fan of the original stage production. I never saw the version of the film on cable until recently, and I looked at it with anticipation, to see my memories brought back to life, because I love the original show. Imagine my dismay. <br /> <br /> This must be the worst translation of a Broadway show for a film never made. They changed the story, they changed the songs, they lost their soul. I expected a journey along the memory, singing for the extraordinary moving Music and the mirror, At the Ballet, and Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen. Not! Not only did they adulterate the music to an almost unrecognizable point, but they messed up the plot, adding external songs and plots (hi Cassie and Michael Douglas) not present in the original, and injecting "drama" where it wasn't needed. The original had enough pathos alone. If you were a fan of the original Broadway show, don't worry. I'm sorry I wasted my time and diluted my memories by looking at this tripe.
