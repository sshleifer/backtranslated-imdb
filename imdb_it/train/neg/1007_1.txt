I found it very difficult to observe it after the first 5 minutes of the film. I managed to endure 45-50 minutes before turning it off in disgust and instead looking at Monster House (which, by the way, is a lot of fun). <br /> <br /> History has huge holes in it. The plot is enormously declared and boring, the acting is horrible, especially by Justin TImberlake who should really stick to what he's good at (looking silly and singing like a castrato). Morgan Freeman seemed incredibly uncomfortable, especially when he was made to dance around rock music for no apparent reason in the middle of the film after he and Timberlake met. It seems that the characters of Freeman and Timberlake have some sort of father / son relationship or something, which simply is not at all obvious apart from the fact that; although Freeman's character seems to have nothing but contempt for Timberlake's ignorant and rather stupid character, he never took the rest out to help him discover a completely ridiculous cover. <br /> <br /> It would take some incredible time to suspend disbelief to give credit to the plot, which is simply absurd and disproportionate. <br /> <br /> Not watching this movie is a waste of time.
