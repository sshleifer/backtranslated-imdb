I was attracted to seeing this movie because of this plot and my desire to look at a horror. <br /> <br /> To my disappointment, this turned into more of a comedy than a horror. The acting, the dialogue and the flow of the film were very badly done. Much of this made no sense. For example, there is a party of about 30 people and they are all terrified of one person, despite being in a secret place and being all healthy young adults and the guy who threatens them seems upset. I kept thinking, maybe this was a parody of another movie like Scary Movie, but they were trying too hard to make it look horrible - emphasis on the attempt. <br /> <br /> Blood and blood are also badly made. I saw the Halloween costumes seem more credible than this. A boy with his head cut off ... looked clean - bones, flesh, blood and even his head were missing. A strong downward blow with an ax on a corpse should creep into something ... it seemed that the boy was swinging a club instead of an ax. <br /> <br /> Reveal who the main villain should have been a twist, but contradicted other parts in the story. What was happening in the boy's mind to become like this? If there were a turning point, you should at least build yourself adding mystery and suspense.
