Title: Zombie 3 (1988) <br /> <br /> Directors: Mainly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei <br /> <br /> Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin < br /> <br /> Review: <br /> <br /> To review this movie and get some good background, I have to start at the beginning. And the beginning of this is really George Romeros Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn came out in 79, Lucio Fulci decided to make an indirect sequel and call it Zombie 2. That movie is what we know as simple Zombies. Know the one where the zombie fights with the shark! OK, after that movie (called Zombie 2 in Italy) came out and made a lot of money, the Italians decided, heck. Let's do a little more zombies! These things are raking in the dough! So Zombie 3 was born. Confused again? The story of this film is actually just a retelling of the stories we've seen in many American zombie movies we've seen before, the best comparison that comes to mind is Return of the Living Dead. Let's see ... there is the government that is experimenting with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies. Canister is released in the general population and shebang! We get a lot of zombies that want human flesh. A group of people start to escape from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel. They have to fight the zombies to survive. <br /> <br /> There were many problems during the filming of this movie. First of all, Lucio Fulci, the beloved godfather of blood from Italy, was ill. So he couldn't really finish this movie the way he wanted. The film was then handed down to two minor directors, Bruno Mattei (The Hell of the Living Dead) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They did their best to revive a film that wasn't already so good. You see that Fulci himself did not really have his heart and soul in this film. He was disenchanted. He hit the producers and basically said: "Do what you want!" And God loves them, they did it. <br /> <br /> And that's why ladies and gentlemen we have a lousy zombie movie with the great Fulci credited as his "director". The main problem in my opinion is that it is such a useless bore! There is no substance in this! After the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and release it accidentally, the rest of the film is just a group of empty characters without a personality without a soul that escape from the zombies. Now in some cases this can be fun, if the n. 1 is the zombie trick and the zombie action is really good and fun and in second place there is a lot of blood and guts involved. <br /> <br /> We don't have either here! Well, there are some inspired moments, such as when some eagles are infected with gas and start attacking people. This was nice. There is also a scene involving a flying zombie head (which among other things defies logic and explanation) and a scene with zombies coming out of the abandoned hotel pool and crunching the legs of a poor girl. But other than that ... the rest of the movie only falls on his ass. <br /> <br /> Endless endless scenes that don't make jacks to move the already non-existent plot. This was my main gripe with this movie. The sets seem unfinished and the art direction is practically non-existent. I hate it when everything seems so damn unfinished! I like my b-movies, but this one really went down too! It's closer to a z-level movie, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> The zombie trick? Pure shit The zombies are all Asian actors (the film was shot in the Philippines), so you'll have a lot of zombies with an Asian appearance. But this is not a big problem since the film is set in the Philippine islands. It's the appearance of the zombies that really sucks! They all died in the same clothes for some reason. And what passes for the zombie trick here is a bunch of black makeup (more like spots) on their faces. One or two zombies had a slightly more complex makeup, but it was still not good enough to impress. It's just a handful of useless sketches on the faces of the actors. So not only does this film flow slowly but the zombies seem disgusting. These should be dead! Whatever, for those who expect the usual coldness in a Fulci film, don't expect here because this is mainly someone else's film. And those two involved (Mattei and Fragasso) didn't really put their hearts and souls into it. In fact, when you see the extras on the DVD you will see that when Fragasso is asked about his memories and his feelings about this film, he doesn't even take it seriously. It can be said that he is ashamed and on many occasions he says that "they only had one job to do and they did it". And that my friends are the last nail in this movie. There is no love and no courage to make this film. So take a film of half-domesticated and lousy zombies. <br /> <br /> Only for the most complete or people who want to see or see all the zombie movies made. Everyone else, don't worry either!
