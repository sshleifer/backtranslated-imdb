After reading some positive reviews about this film I thought it was time for me to go see it. Well, I don't know why I took the trouble. Basically this family has been given a clue that leads to a large deposit of ancient treasures, hidden by the Knights Templar during the War of Independence. Apparently it had to be kept out of the hands of the British at all costs. First, why did the Knights say to move the treasure from Europe to America? How did Nic Cages' character understand that "Charlotte" was actually a ship? How do they understand all the clues and riddles in about a minute? And how could two people suddenly become thieves and steal what is probably the best piece of paper kept in the world? These are just some of the holes in the plot of this inane piece of Hollywood action gone wrong. Cage has been in some great action movies - 'Face-Off' and 'The Rock' - so why did he turn to that? Is it getting too old? His character is quite annoying indeed - Somehow this 'ordinary' type steals the Declaration of Independence, overcomes thieves with guns, flees the FBI and generally seems invincible. The whole film makes no sense and all in all it was a real disappointment.
