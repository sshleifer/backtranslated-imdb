Greenthumb Grace is left penniless after his husbands' death, so he turns to ganja cultivation to pay the bills. It looks promising and the always reliable Brenda Blethyn does not disappoint but the material is as thin as a sitcom. There's actually a scene where Grace asks her young gardener to "give me one" (a pea) and he thinks she's asking about sex and acting awkwardly. Yes, it's humor, so a nun would be bored. Saving Grace doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: the splendid cinematography and the majestic rhythm evoke the memories of Ryan's Daughter while the light caprice of the villagers could be raised by any episode of Antiques Roadshow. It accelerates after the first hour, but at that point it's too trivial to worry. The climax manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless Deux ex Machina I've ever seen.
