In this film, old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman again. He meets her in his restaurant. The younger woman, Tabu, flirts with him. He doesn't know what to do and asks her out. His reaction to his invitation is rather strange. It had to be fun. <br /> <br /> And that annoys me for the whole movie. It wasn't so funny. The jokes and the script were terrible! The only jokes I liked were about the teeth of a waiter, but after several times, even that began to bore. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has a little girl named sexy. This was a strange relationship! A little girl with the mind of an old woman! It was scary! I know someone can be attached to a child, but this man has adult conversations with this child. It didn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He must give Amitabh difficult moments, but we all know Paresh, he cannot do it. So even the conversation at the end, when they all sit around the table, even that had to be fun. <br /> <br /> I only like movies that are really fun. I guess I will never watch this movie again.
