I'm trying to imagine the field for Dark Angel. "I'm thinking of the Matrix, I'm thinking of Bladerunner, I'm thinking of that kind of chick who plays Faith in Angel, who wears shiny black leather - or some chick like her, leaves that with us. I'll do it without plots, dialogues, characters , decent deeds or budgets, just a few loud noises and a shiny black leather hot chick straddling a big pulsating bike. The fanboys dig strong noises and hot chicks in shiny black leather riding big throbbing bikes, right? " /> <br /> Showy, superficial, dark, formidable, without passion, boring, dull, stupid, lacking in a sense of humor, occasional, barely competent. Live action souls without any action or life. SF just like Joe Fanboy does, in fact. :(
