Memoirs of a Geisha is a well-made film, no doubt. And acting is generally excellent, at least in terms of how he portrays the characters as they are scripted. <br /> <br /> However, so many small and large details are just _crypt_ that annoy me too much to be able to fully enjoy it. A small detail that characterizes the kind of lack of sensitivity of a species is a scene (this does not ruin anything) where Mameha plays a bell hanging on the door of the house where Sayuri lives, on a snowy winter day. The bell he is ringing on is a fuurin, or wind bell, which is left alone outside the houses in Japan in the summer! People in traditional Japanese homes did not have bells - they just opened the door and announced themselves. (You might think it's such a trivial detail, but I would equate it to a movie made in America where a Christmas wreath hangs on the door in July and nobody thinks about it.) And don't even get me started on the totally wrong hairstyles given to the maiko and to the geisha, who is vaguely pan-Asian / Chinese / kung-fu-ish, and nothing like the real thing. I think this rather contemptuous attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray really manifests itself in the attitudes and representations of people and situations. <br /> <br /> So, I suppose you know less about Japanese culture and the world of geisha and maiko in Kyoto (which is "Miyako"), so I suppose you'll like it more. I honestly think that this film could have been much better ... as it is, it's just another Hollywood version of "exotic Japan".
