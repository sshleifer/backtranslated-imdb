'Iedereen Beroemd' has everything we can expect from a movie at the cinema. It's the story of a man who believes his daughter can be a star. The only thing he needs is to take her to the stage, surrounded by cameras and journalists. A simple plan for which he must kidnap and blackmail. The problem with the film is not the basic plot, but how it is made. Everything should be fun, but it is not. It is trivial and clumsy, the characters are superficial and the final sequence is totally devoid of climax or emotion. The last sequence is probably the only scene where you want to laugh, but just how pathetic the whole set-up is.
