The main reasons for seeing "Red Eyes" are Rachel McAdams, who offers a stellar performance, and Jayma Mays, who is wonderful as an Assistant Hotel Manager. On the other hand, Cillian Murphy manages to overwhelm so much that he becomes a cartoonist. The rest of the film is full of holes in the plot, on which I will elaborate. <br /> <br /> Please don't read further if you don't want to know what's going on! <br /> <br /> is a synopsis of the plot. The character of Rachel McAdams (Lisa) runs a hotel where the new head of internal security, with a stiff nose, intends to stay that night. Rachel is returning to Miami from a funeral, but raises calls from her assistant until the plane leaves. Meanwhile, someone is stationed outside his father's house, Joe (played by Brian Cox), ready to kill him if Cillian Murphy (Jackson) calls. All Lisa has to do is call the hotel and move the manager's suite to one where Jackson's cohorts are planning to fire a guided missile (from a fishing boat) to kill the director and his family. <br /> <br /> So here are some of the holes in the plot or the absurd coincidences: <br /> <br /> 1. Jackson eventually convinces Lisa to make the call and, in between, the phones in the plane they lose the connection. Lisa tries to pretend that she's making the call, but by coincidence, a Jackson boy is making a call and starts slamming the phone to indicate he's dead. Jackson picks up and picks up the phone from Lisa. <br /> <br /> 2. At some point, Jackson's head kicks and she obviously gets knocked out ... but only for 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> 3. Jackson surprises Lisa by writing a note on the mirror in the (extraordinarily large) toilet, and he hits her a little. Miraculously, the only one who hears something is an 11-year-old girl, whose word is obviously obvious. <br /> <br /> 4. Lisa stabs Jackson with a pen in his throat as the plane is landing, steals his cell phone, and makes a mad dash for the exit, adapting along the corridor between the seats and 6 pm rows of standing passengers. Despite knowing that there is a passenger with a pen stuck in his throat, the flight attendants force Lisa by opening the door to the jet way. <br /> <br /> 5. OK, all of them are reasonable (if not highly unlikely). But here's where it gets really stupid. Lisa enters the Miami airport terminal, and there is no cell phone signal (all major airports in America have excellent cell phone reception). <br /> <br /> 6. He runs through the airport with Jackson in pursuit, and no security officer delays them. <br /> <br /> 7. Jackson, who lost Lisa at the airport while the train from the gates left the terminal, lost some of his voice from the pen to his throat, but can still be somehow understood. However, he doesn't bother calling his man out of Joe's house. (PS: There is no train at Miami airport, but what they showed looked very similar to Orlando airport). <br /> <br /> 8. Lisa steals a car and leaves. Certainly this time, when he goes to make a phone call, the phone says "low battery" and turns off soon (when will they stop using this inane plot device?). <br /> <br /> 9. While the phone was still saying "low battery", Lisa had reached her assistant just in time to save the manager and his family from the guided missile launched from the fishing boat towards the room window at 40 Floor to which the director had been moved. Of course, they expect that we don't notice that the hotel is surrounded on 3 sides by the ocean, so the missile may have probably been launched in the first suite, thus negating the need for the entire Lisa-Jackson plot. What is the story here? Was the manager's original room on the 38th floor the only hotel room with a bad view? However, everyone leaves just before the missile hits. <br /> <br /> 10. Lisa drives to Joe's house to save his father just to see the killer out. Even if she runs over him (while he's shooting at her) making his jeep collapse at home, no one in the neighborhood seems to notice or worry about stopping. <br /> <br /> 11. Jackson arrives at Joe's house and knocks him out (we don't see how ... maybe another head). He then explains to Lisa that he has not yet killed Dad because he wanted Daddy to see Lisa die first (give me a break, what is this Saturday morning cartoons?). <br /> <br /> 12. For the rest of the film (about 20 minutes), Jackson chases Lisa around the house, and she fights him skillfully. Obviously a real killer (ie one perhaps played by Jason Statham) would have eliminated Lisa (or anyone who was not a trained killer) in the first 30 seconds. During this chase, Jackson approaches Joe at least once without worrying about killing him. <br /> <br /> 13. Eventually, Jackson prevails, and is about to kill Lisa when (guess what) he is killed by Joe. <br /> <br /> So here's my suggestion ... to tell Wes Craven to stick to the horror. Or maybe he should reunite with Michael Bay (who directed the equally stupid "The Island") and do "Red Island".
