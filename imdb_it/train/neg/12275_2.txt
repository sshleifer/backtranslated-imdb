This is the case of a group of people who think they are smart enough to have a story right now. Do you remember the all-out political conspiracies examined in the years that led to Watergate and a little later? Most movies that try to "tailor-made for TV" or conspiracies so powerful, or so numb, have actually been caught in their navel-watching attitude. <br /> <br /> I've never been a fan of The Conversation that I find so dated compared to other episodes of conspiracy of the time but Coppola was loyal to his main character and Hackman was a rather engaging actor to watch. I mean that these conspiracy films are mostly drowned in the pool of noir hero characters. Lots of unanswered questions, lots of communication ... Well, at least for Bergman it's necessary to build a film on these non-visual basis. <br /> <br /> The Next Man is a perfect example of his time: a political soup served with an idealistic character and a horrible conspiracy that tightens his network around him. Neither side is interesting in itself and the whole does not improve. In fact you can tell how bad it will be from the very first sequences that accumulate 'watcha that' murders without ever advancing any plot. The direction of pedestrians is worse in that most of the film is a pompous accumulation of scenes that revolve around the violence naively brought under the eyes of the spectator.
