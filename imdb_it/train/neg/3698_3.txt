No need to detail what others have written in other reviews - here is the summary: <br /> <br /> * Much of the nested animation work is absolutely gorgeous - the colors are superb - I'd like to have done it in silk like a tie <br /> <br /> * The story and execution are a total nap - it was quite difficult to stay awake sometimes <br /> <br /> If you are a fine arts student, medieval calligraphy, primitive religion and so on - there are. This is a movie for you. <br /> <br /> If you want an engaging and fun movie, look elsewhere, this is a failure like something other than an artistic declaration. <br /> <br /> The Vikings didn't do it By the way, I have horns ...
