Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) killed his son and his wife brutally attacked a domestic invasion. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) tries to help him overcome post-traumatic stress. Then Archer finds himself in front of a man (Til Schweiger) bound and gagged in a chair. He is told that this is the man who killed his son and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he likes. And there is a vast assortment of tools there to help him ... <br /> <br /> The film is interesting in the beginning (and shows real moderation in terms of blood and blood) but becomes more stupid by minute minute and has some unlikely twists. It all ends in a twist that was so old and stupid as to be shocked that someone would have thought of using it anymore. As such talented actors as Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer have been involved in crap like this is outside of me. This gets three stars for acting, but the stupid plot and the really incredible plots make this task a task to be performed.
