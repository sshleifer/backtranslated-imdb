Dakota (1988) was another of the early protagonists of Lou Diamond Phillips. This film is similar to the next movie, Harley. There are some differences but they are both the same. I don't know which one came first. I imagine it will remain one of the mysteries of life. But both are worried "children" who are trying to turn there in a lifetime. Instead of bikes this is about horses. Basically they are the same film and both are in bad taste. If you are a serious L.D.P. fans so I suggest you watch them both. You will get some extreme attacks and attitudes from L.D.P. if you're at the game, do it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, except for L.D.P. fans !!!
