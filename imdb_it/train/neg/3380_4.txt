Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante's Broadway have been running for years, but the proof of his power and charisma is lost in this film adaptation, which probably derives from the director's choice (Richard Attenborough, as far away as possible from B-way) and lead actor (Michael Douglas, who plays a director-choreographer as a slippery corporate lawyer). The lean story, which speaks of a bold audition for a Broadway show that turns into a therapy session for the actors-dancers-singers, is pushed up to us, with strong brass talents playing on the beams. Nothing is modulated or subtle, in particular a laughable subplot of a former dancer returning to the theater and knocking down the heads with Douglas' old flame. The exaggerated hopes are full of promise and anguish, but their personal stories of anguish are a bit embarrassing; this, combined with the slow rhythm of Attenborough, causes disasters and even the now famous songs fail to break through the artificial envelope. * 1/2 from ****
