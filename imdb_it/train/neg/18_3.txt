This is an art film made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film seems to be very indicative of this general time period - with some styles of work with cameras and pop art that are pure between the 60s and 70s. <br /> <br /> The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using various strange camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialogue or plot of any kind. Obviously this was meant almost as a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it is initially interesting but quickly becomes boring. The film, to put it even more explicitly, is total boredom and nobody would like it, but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends and perhaps some people who are too fashionable and "with it" to be understood from us mortals.
