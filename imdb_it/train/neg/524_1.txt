"The 40 Year Old Virgin" exists in a world I don't understand. A world in which an electronics store employee can tell his boss to "fuck" and transmit videos of his naked ass around the store and not be scolded. A world where it's really fun to drive drunk and crash into other people's cars. A world in which it seems that a leader can sexually harass his subordinates. A world full of furious and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And a world without funny jokes! I am absolutely shocked by the apparent chorus of viewers who enjoyed this film. I thought every scene was like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch - not much fun to start with and lying beyond rational thinking. The waxing scene went on FOREVER. <br /> <br /> The characters, apart from Carell, were totally monotonous. And the romantic elements have been completely invented, in particular the scene in which Keener finds porn in Carell's apartment. It was simply lame. <br /> <br /> And I also found the "Aquarius" sequence totally annoying and excessive. I hated hating this movie!
