I was dying to see it once I saw the ridiculous MEATBALLS poster and discovered it had to be the best satire ever. What a brilliant idea for a satire: gender is the order of the day. Unfortunately, the finished product (as I think all that was probably made) is a catalog of missed opportunities, not entirely accurate shows and (fortunately!) Some extremely hilarious and inspired pieces. Janeane Garafolo, who is very engaging, looks really ugly here, probably because she's struggling uncomfortably to make her flat role fun. David Hyde Pierce is just sad to look at, trying to be as tough and fun as a gelding nerd. Molly Shannon is so funny that VEDO makes you laugh, but somehow her segment can't make her become something hysterical. Paul Rudd had great adolescent mannerisms and was sexy to die for, even the other guys are really funny (the most nerds). I think the problem is that the director doesn't move things at the right pace. It begins very impassive, and this sets the monotony. But when he lets things get really outrageous (the drug sequence is the second funniest moment I've ever had in movies, the first even in a lame movie: Andrea Martin in ALL OVER THE GUY complains about the movie IN & OUT), it's simply fun. I wanted this movie to work so badly, but it just didn't work. The clothes and styling of 1981 are 99.9% perfect and even the few songs used are perfect. This ends up as a mean-bad MAD TV episode, complete with frustrating sketches.
