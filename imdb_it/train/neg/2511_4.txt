Director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne) directs this well-intentioned but inferior comedy about Albert Einstein (Matthau) who tries to hook his scientific niece (Ryan) with the ordinary guy Tim Robbins to make her relax and enjoy life in the 1950s . To convince Ryan to like Robbins, Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is nice, but the film falls flat with trivial situations and silly dialogues. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan and the terrifying supporting cast do their best to keep this stupid comedy afloat, but are unable to save the film. It is unfortunate that so much talent went to produce such a lackluster film. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they are big fans of Meg Ryan.
