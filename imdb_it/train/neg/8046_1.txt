No? I didn't think of it! Well, in that case all you have to do is stay a lot, far away from "Do You Wanna Know A Secret", as it's just another useless post - "Scream" slasher with absolutely no redeeming value. The plot is extremely ridiculous; the characters are unbearably stupid, the gore factor is negligible and the whole is simply boring! As you can already deduce from the title, this film is mainly inspired by "I Still Know What You Did Did Last Summer", since the events take place in a similar environment and the murderer's motivations are equally stupid. Because anyone would like to steal ideas from junk like "IKWYDLS" is a complete mystery to me. At least that movie could depend on Jennifer Love Hewitt's precious rack, while the girls in this junk are, as well as brainless, also terribly unattractive. A year after the still unsolved murder of her boyfriend, Beth Morgan, her new adulterous lover and four other simple college students travel to Florida to spend the spring break in a luxurious beach house. The killer didn't make a move all year, but now he follows the team in Florida and starts slaughtering them leaving behind the main message as a kind of business card. You don't really need to be a horror expert to quickly figure out which face is hiding behind the unspeakably ridiculous mask and the authors' attempts to put you on the wrong path are definitely embarrassing. Since the plot is so subtle, most of the film is a purely irrelevant padding, including the secondary plots about the incompetent Floridian police and the "mysterious" FBI inspector who seems to have a personal score to adjust. The murder happens inexplicably off the screen (don't you hate it when it happens?), There isn't even a free T&A to enjoy and there is no need to get me started on the quality of the dialogues. Suffering from shit like this just makes you understand that the delicious spirit of the 80s went on forever.
