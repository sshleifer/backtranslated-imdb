DEAD DEAD is a rather silly comedy about a group of wives who conspire to clash with other husbands Â». It's not at all embarrassing like some comedies I could mention, but it's never possible. Imagine how nice it would have been if we had the Farrelly brothers who ran Ben Stiller as Carter Elson. <br /> <br /> Oh is Carter based on Jerry Springer? Simply curious, because the love phrase about Dr Elson's show is "take care of each other and keep talking"
