It was almost incomprehensible to me that this film would have been a failure, but I was really disappointed. Having been a Pekinpah cinema connoisseur for years, I found this DVD, drastically reduced, for sale and thought it was worth shooting. The few opening titles, iconic for Pekinpah fans, have the intersection between humans and animals, but here we have the non-diegetic environmental noise of children playing in a school yard while a bomb is being placed. Fantastic suspense. Then, when the culprits, Caan and Duval, move on to their next mission, Duval abandons the Cann bomb that his last night appointment had an STD, found only by browsing through his handbag while Cann was intimate with her. The resulting laugh is fantastic, and is clearly honored in Brian Depalma's Dressed to Kill, at the expense of Angle Dickenson's life. The problem with The Killer Elite is that after the opening credits, the film falls to the ground. Also bring me Alfredo Garcia's garment has a stronger production value, a bold appeal for anyone who knows what I'm talking about. I use Pekinpah's credits as supplementary teaching material, but once finished, deactivate The Killer Elite.
