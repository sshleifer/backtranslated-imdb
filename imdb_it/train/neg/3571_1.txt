The super sexy movie actress B has another part as future "Goodfellas", the star of Ray Liotta in this box office bomb. Play Marion, she has only one line of dialogue, well, a WORD of dialogue actually. He shouts "Joe!" Ray's character is violating poor Pia Zadora with a plastic garden sprinkler. This film is so bad even though it becomes fun, sometimes hilarious. The guys at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 would love this! Take a look at the hysterical scene in the end, where Pia has a nervous breakdown and all the building effects they make to try to show how much Pia's character is going crazy. Pia plays an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter in this. Pia Zadora as a screenwriter? Yeah, for sure. Pia can barely speak, let alone write! Pia is absolutely and utterly annoyed in this stupid role. But who cares? The real star is the warm and fresh Glory Annen in her little piece in the opinion of this cat! Rock on Glory!
