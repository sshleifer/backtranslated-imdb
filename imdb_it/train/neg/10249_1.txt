What can I say about this film if not "not seeing it". I waited, waited and waited for something to happen (or something) and did not come. Watch incredibly while two people walk while setting the record for most of the screen in a single movie. What are they doing? Are they solving a mystery? Are they collecting clues? Perhaps, it's just hard to say. At the end of the film, after many radio signals have been decoded (illegally on some sort of PET monitor) and this guy is holding some conferences, the plot is finally revealed and set aside as quickly as possible. Some aliens want to return to their world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth (I guess they don't like sharing wealth). My guess is that they finished filming and saw their 35 minutes of work or art (garbage!) And decided they would allow the editing team to turn it into an 88-minute movie. Look at your own risk, it's not even funny because it's so ugly, it's just ugly.
