Bashki should be congratulated for trying to convert one of the great works of English fiction into a movie, and then foolishly slapped this attempt. The animation was scarce, the characters were ridiculous, the music was ringing at the top of its lungs, and the film was a ramshackle run in the first book and a half of Tolkien's masterpiece. I can still remember my pure disappointment and aversion to the film when I first saw it. Now I understand that any attempt to convert a book into a film is bound to fail in many ways, simply because of the medium, but this film, regardless of the source of the story, is simply pathetic. Bashki is capable of much more.
