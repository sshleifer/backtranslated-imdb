The plot is simple: an old man who lives on a main road in the woods one day is witness to a man who killed a child in the woods. Soft For Digging follows the old man's attempts to try to convince the police that what he saw was not his imagination. However, there is a problem whenever the old police guide to the place where the murder takes place, no corpse can be found. Soft For Digging has a tiny dialogue that reflects most of the scenes in the film, an old man who lives alone in a house. During the film I discovered that I was scared twice, that is when the murdered child appears abruptly in front of the old man. The rest of the film I have to admit didn't involve me; I found the movie's time a little too slow. Limited dialogue was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its conclusions, after seeing the film, took too long. I feel that more could have been done about the relationship, the ghostly encounters, with the child and the old man. Alone in the uncertain night forests of your mind can lead to disturbing situations, children are always scary as ghosts, see Dark Water.
