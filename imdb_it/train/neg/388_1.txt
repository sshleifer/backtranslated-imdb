I can't stand most reality shows and this is worse than the one with Paris Hilton, and it's definitely his company. But "are you fired" or "are you hired", for how many seasons? After seeing the show, I wouldn't want to work for the boy with his ego and everything and I think watching the dry paint has more entertainment. <br /> <br /> I'd like to hear a single person get up and say "Donald, I'll stop, take some of your money and buy a decent hairstyle". I see he's also trying to buy fame in WWE wrestling. I hope he gets hurt, so I don't have to see his pathetic face anymore. It must be sad to want fame so bad and not have talent and make a donkey of yourself trying to buy it. I would give this show a negative sign if I could, but it gets a 1 and doesn't deserve it.
