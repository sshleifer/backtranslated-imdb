This poor remake of the 1963 classic starts quite well, so it replaces the suspense with confusing and useless special effects. For example, in the original, one of the most chilling moments occurs when Nell and Theo find themselves side by side in twin beds, listening to terrified noises outside their room. Nell tells Theo to leave her hand because he's hurting her. Nell then looks towards Theo, who is several meters away and realizes that it is not Theo who is holding her hand. In the latest version, Nell lies alone in bed, when she suddenly dives and slips on the floor. It's only when she tells the invisible force to stop convincing her that we realize what happened. And can someone explain what Nell's last words mean: "It's about family, it's always been a family matter"? <br /> <br /> The only thing that redeems is the performance of Lili Taylor, but even this cannot save the film. Catherine Zeta-Jones proves once again that, under her beautiful fa√ßade, there is little depth. In the original, Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion. Zeta-Jones, however, must specify, for example, by asking Nell if he has a boyfriend - or a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Definitely one that should be handed over to the cemetery for unnecessary remakes.
