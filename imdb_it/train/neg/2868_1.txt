This is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the BTK killer. The events of this film are not even close to the truth. Because they failed to make a film about real events it makes no sense since the real events are more interesting, so this made the farce. Don't waste time watching it for free. Low budget and a shameful representation of events that should not be played, which is really what this film did. If they would let me give a 10 to this movie, I'd do it. The acting has sucked and seems to have been shot on an old VHS camera from the 80s. Save time and money by not watching this movie.
