SPOILERS FOR EVERYTHING !!!! <br /> <br /> I had read the book "1st to die" and wanted to see if the film followed the book so I looked at it. For the most part he did. There were a few minor differences (position of the last violent scene for example) but not many and for the most part the film remained more faithful to the book than most films. <br /> <br /> It could have been a mistake - even if the film was perfectly cast, with Pollen and Bellows in particular, I wasn't very impressed with the book. Or let me take it back. I started very impressed, gradually I became more disillusioned and in the end I was completely dissatisfied and I felt almost dazed. No difference with the film. Here because. <br /> <br /> There is no "payoff" in the book or in the film. I rarely read who made the thriller that created such a disappointment with its final resolution and I had hoped that the film could vary a little. <br /> <br /> The intero (did it, NO did it, NO, BOTH DO) - was not interesting, not charming and more confused, annoying and depressing than anything else. Add to that the love of Lindsay's life dies at the end (after the USA clears up and she cries over her grave) ... and then cuts to the point where she is contemplating suicide .... then to the suddenly he is fighting for his life with the real rascal who was cleaned up after being arrested .. but it turns out that he and his wife were together ... HELLO !!! The whole thing has now become "GENERAL HOSPITAL" instead of a good old-fashioned thriller. I felt cheated and robbed by the book and watching the film (I must admit that it caught my attention with pleasure - the acting was very good for a TV movie) I was hoping it wouldn't follow the book it did. <Br /> <br /> I still think the film is watchable and for some reason it doesn't leave me as bad in the mouth as the book (or maybe it's just that I knew what would happen) But I have to say the way this is unraveled story was not well done at all.
