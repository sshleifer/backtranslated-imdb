Steven Seagal ... how could you be part of such a terrible movie? I rented this movie because your films were usually pretty clean. I lost a lot of respect for your being in a horrible movie like this. Very, very poor taste! I'm embarrassed that I even rented this movie. Steven, if you continue acting in movies like this, I think your career is over. My husband and I enjoyed watching many of your movies because you can always "take the bad guy" with a few maneuvers and make it clean ... and the language is pretty clean in your movies ... but that's something else. I'll think twice before renting another movie of yours.
