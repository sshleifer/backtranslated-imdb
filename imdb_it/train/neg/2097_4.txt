I was expecting a lot more from the Battlestar Galactica franchise. Very boring prequel to the main series. After the first 30 minutes, I was waiting for it to finish. The characters talk a lot about religion, computers, programming, retribution, etc. There are gangsters, mafia types, who perform hits. However, Caprica does not have the action of the original series to compensate for the slower parts. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some useful advice when watching movies: As a general rule, if there is a lot of excessive unrestrained titillation, then you know the film will be a real disaster. Caprica has a lot of that. The director / writer usually tries to compensate for his poor skills by throwing some naked bodies. It never works and all it does is detract from the (very) young actresses involved and I feel sorry for them. The directors / writers who do this should be banned from the business. <br /> <br /> If you want to be bored for an hour and a half, by all means, rent Caprica. There is a porn (free) on the Net if you really want to see naked bodies. Otherwise, go ahead, nothing to see here.
