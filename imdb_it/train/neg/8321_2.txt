Hayden Christianson and Jessica Alba, two of my least favorite actors of this century, unite in what is probably the simplest attempt to redo the already terrible butterfly effect. Awake is so boring and so utterly uninteresting that you will be better asleep. Terrance Howard is still recovering from the diabolical August Rush and fights decently like the sadistic doctor who seems determined to kill Christianson and after seeing his performance I'd like to assist him. <br /> <br /> Alba, still in recovery after the Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver surfer. It is naturally disastrous and equally unwatchable as always. Only once was she rather ingenious, in the hands of master director Robert Rodriguez in Sin City. It could be that Jessica Alba is not as poor as an actress, like most people to whom she attaches the credit and it is likely that her acting skills are weighed down by a poor script. If so then this would explain Awake. What with a script that would be ashamed that of Plan 9 of Outer Space. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba, Hayden Christenson and Terrence Howard perform in the psychological thriller by Stew Harold, the first-time director / screenwriter of a man who experiences the appallingly common surgical phenomenon known as "aesthetic awareness" which those who are placed on the operating table remain acutely aware of what is happening around them, while remaining completely paralyzed and unable to ask for help. When a successful young man (Christenson) goes under the knife and realizes that anesthesia has not yet done his job, the horror is quickly established while his worried wife (Alba) anxiously awaits and a terrifying drama takes place in the operating room. <br /> <br /> Hoping to do for the operational tables what Final Destination did for the planes, this first effort by director Joby Harold revolves around a presumption of blood frosting. The sequence of pre-credits tells us that one person in 700 suffers from a phenomenon known as "awareness of anesthesia", in which the patient remains conscious but paralyzed during surgery. One of these unfortunates is Clayton Beresford Jr (Hayden Christensen), who finds himself completely awake during a heart transplant ... and can perceive every single slice. <br /> <br /> Intermittently inventive as he probes his tortured psyche, Awake fails to inject the true terror into his unpublished premise. Spiraling from a chilling simplicity to an absurd conspiracy, it is hampered by sad twists by Christensen and Jessica Alba. Would you like to have blown up a sedative before looking? <br /> <br /> VERDICT: Awake is extremely interesting without pretensions. A film without strokes that undoubtedly looks better on paper. But like a film it is terribly generic and extremely derivative. Awake fails to inject the terror into his unpublished premise. The end result is really bad. Alba and Christian are the least of your problems, because the main flaw of the film lies in its inability to scare the public. Awake is a film you will probably sleep with.
