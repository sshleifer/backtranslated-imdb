I was attracted to this film, curious to see how they adapted Hubert Shelby's brutal novel. I thought that a literary piece of such depth, with a rich tapestry of characters, horrible situations and social criticism could not translate into a bad movie. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This film is a terrible cinematic experience, not for its content, but for its shape. The director Ulrich Edel carries out, in my opinion sincere, a terrible directorial job that does not do justice to the original book. No wonder Edel is a television director; this movie looks like a bad movie "made for TV". Some of my opinions on this bomb (** spoilers ahead **): <br /> <br /> - Lack of directorial creativity. The scenes are slow, they feel slow, they seem poorly affected and almost never move from an anchored position. The only freedom they take is in the cinema area, with a nice dark tone. Apart from this, the film has the same technical creativity as a television soap opera. <br /> <br /> - All actors do a fantastic job of portraying these miserable characters. The problem is that adaptation does not address a fundamental element in the development of the plot: MOTIVATION. All these characters move like robots, without a clear motivation for their action. They seem to do things out of the blue, like robots, for no reason at all. Edel loses every opportunity to enrich the development of the character by not exploring the motivations of the character and avoiding developing the personality of each character in its maximum extension. <br /> <br /> This lack of character development is evident on Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight does a great job with this scruffy prostitute, but her decision to let the sailors violate alcohol is not explained. He looks extremely stupid, since this character is doing it suddenly. This is a clear example of poor character development. <br /> <br /> The film also has many secondary characters, who do nothing, try nothing and add nothing to the plot. I wanted to learn more about Harry's wife, for example, and the interaction between the two. This is another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Edel only approaches the character development with Harry and his fixation with his gay lover, only to ruin him in the end, not clearly explaining - and no doubt - his motives. Thugs are also a joke in their lack of development. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack is one of the worst I've ever seen. Terrible work by Mark Knopfler. I seriously expected more from the former Dire Straits leader, but his work in this film is seriously lacking. Sometimes, like in the battle between trade unionists and the police, the music seems totally disconnected from the film. He also feels completely poor and anachronistic; I could have sworn that the entire soundtrack was made with a Casio toy keyboard. It distracts from the real action. <br /> <br /> - The adaptation of Desmond Nakano's book is so literal that it eliminates the point of history. They seem to have tried so hard to keep the action-by-action plot in the book that they forgot to actually develop the characters and, once again, to explain their actions and motivations. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend the serious to this film, not even to a Shelby fan, because it can ruin the original book. It is a very little inspired effort to adapt the novel and shows very little creative input.
