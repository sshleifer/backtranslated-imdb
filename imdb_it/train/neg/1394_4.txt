"The Brain Machine" will at least put your brain into overdrive trying to figure out what it is. Four subjects from different backgrounds and levels of intelligence were selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and the environment. Since the only common denominator between them is the fact that each of them does not have a known family it should have been a handful - none of them will be lost. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is overseen by a mysterious creep known only as the general, but it appears to be taking over from a senator who wishes to remain anonymous. Good call from the senator there. There is also a guard who constantly obscures the camera, who later claims not to take his direction from the General or "Project". Too bad it wasn't more effective, he was overwhelmed rather easily before everything went kablooey. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, the film is a veritable treasure trove of the technology of the 70s with repeated clicks of phones, room-sized computers and a teletype machine that will not close. Perhaps this was the basis of the film's alternative title - "Time Warp"; nothing else would have made sense. As for me, I would like to consider a title suggested by the experiment of Dr. Krisner killed entitled "Group Stress Project". It applies equally to the actors and viewers of the film. <br /> <br /> Just keep an eye on the poolside General's head when asking an agent for his weapon, a boom microphone is visible above his head for a number of seconds. <br /> <br /> You might want to take this movie if you're a huge fan of Gerald McRaney, could he ever have been so young? James Best also appears in a somewhat unusual role as a cryptic reverend, but not to call him a father. For something a little higher in his alley, try getting your hands on "The Killer Shrews" from 1959. This at least does not claim to take itself so seriously.
