1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you can't believe you've wasted 2 hours of your life seeing the role of credits. I honestly think I could make a better vampire movie ... and I don't know anything. The only thing that doesn't suck (more difficult than a Vampire) is Jason Scott Lee ... his character is at least a little cold, he has a bit of mystery and he kicks a small ass.
