I felt compelled to watch this film all the way, since I had found it in a business basket and bought it for mine, but I approached it many times to turn it off and simply to cancel the money I paid for this. If you are a fan of blood and sadism, this film is OK. If there is one thing that the producers of this film know, it is the creative use of fake blood and body parts for a disgusting effect. If this doesn't excite you, then stay away. <br /> <br /> This film is shot on a home video camera, with school props and terrible actors. It is nicknamed by the German, but even taking this into account, the sound is terrible. This film is about the budget you get, except for the special effects mentioned above. If they had spent a little more money on the actors and a real script instead of blood and guts, the film could have been a little more pleasant. <br /> <br /> The story is about three men landing on an island inhabited by an army of masked sadists. They are captured and the rest of the film is about their escape attempt. I call it a story in the loosest sense, since it is actually a series of torture and fighting scenes put together by a dialogue full of obscenity. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that can redeem this film, unless you like brainless blood. Consider yourself warned.
