Dolph Lundgren smoldered and frowned through this incoherent mystery / thriller that isn't as beautiful as the box would have us believe. He's actually pretty good here, but the story is a mess of B-type clich√©s (detective, revenge, tycoons, prostitutes, S & M) that seems to have been invented as they went on. The film resumes a bit in the second half, but for a more decent shot by Lundgren, instead, rented RED SCORPION.
