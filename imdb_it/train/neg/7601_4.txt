This is a film that shows that the mood, the music and the plot are not enough to make a good movie. Of course, the viewer is treated with numerous beautiful scenes of Los Angeles in the thirties - I especially liked the view of the trolley approaching the tunnel, and the tram that goes up the hill - but in a sense this fine cinematography is self-defeating, because it creates a mood that "something is going to happen" - and nothing does. Even the script continues to pretend to be some plot or action or trauma - and from time to time it doesn't deliver. Not even delivering the theme (I presume) of the film, the essential misfit of the characters. The main actors, both too cute for their roles, did not transmit any repression or agony, and the script did not expose us to anyone. <br /> <br /> Now, Donald Sutherland? This is another story. His character was so well modeled, so perfectly interpreted, that I wanted the camera to follow him.
