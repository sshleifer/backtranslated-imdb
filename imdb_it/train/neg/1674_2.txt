The premise was intriguing, but unfortunately this film does not do it justice. The casting was pretty good, and it was shot beautifully - but stylistically most of the direction was inconsistent (the too-oversized quick assembly was done with no effect ... I was waiting for Steven Bochco to execute the credits followed by a spot), the characters were identified exclusively through the use of coca on screen (and practically everything else left to Boogie Nights for the development of the character), and no major personage to draw the viewer into the story. A very forgettable film.
