This is a copy of the 1948 Doris Day classic, Romance on the High Seas. <br /> <br /> The plot is more or less the same but contemporary. Govinda plays a sharp and sharp man who replaces her husband during the journey. While Rani plays his wife's college friend who does her the same favor. Evidently they try to intercept while her husband and wife try to stumble on Bombay. <br /> <br /> During the journey, Govinda exchanges another girl for Sanjiv's wife and spies while falling in love with the wonderful Rani. <br /> <br /> Lever has a dual role as a father and son, both lawyers specializing in divorce proceedings. They are set against each other for the fighting couple. <br /> <br /> It's a miserable attempt to copy the original classics and the songs are pretty scary. Comedy is slap-stick and won't make you laugh too much.
