I have just returned from a free screening and I am very happy not to have paid to see this very sub-par movie. The theater was full and the crowd was a mixture of children and adults. It seemed that it was only the children who laughed at all the slap and fart jokes (good god who very often loved to hit these poor mice in the horse!). The film is quite young, unintelligent, predictable and mostly annoying. The characters only seem to be thrown together to fill the empty space and the relationships between them all seem very forced and without any charm. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is average with nothing really standing out. They did a decent job of imitating the clay look of Wallace and Gromit, but other than that they are very forgettable images. <br /> <br /> Although I was really bored throughout the film, I giggled a couple of times. It's not an absolute failure, but I certainly wouldn't want to see it again. If you are a parent with children (and you don't care that your children see cute jokes), feel free to take them to see it, but everyone else shouldn't waste their money.
