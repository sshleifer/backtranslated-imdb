The Space Camp, which had the unfortunate luck of being planned around the time of the Challenger accident, deserves much luck. The "stars" make a mockery of acting, Lea Thomson is actually turned sideways when asked more than her usual innocent smile with her eyes wide open, presumably to mask her laughable attempts. The film is sometimes hilarious, when it starts to ask too much of you. A boy holds a multi-million-dollar robot in his closet that breaks when he is given too many commands from the hordes of common dormitories. This haggard machine, "Jinx", is one of the main actors in the film's ridiculous premise, which seems to be part of the Short Circuit, part of the 2001 Airplane team. I won't bore you with this, suffice it to say that you can only laugh at this. That being said, it is fun to watch, in a SeaQuest, the way it is saved by the bell. Romanticism and technology, be careful, they are as incredible as one another. Also, if you are a fanatic of the 80s, you can't miss the fun performances by Kate Capshaw (Willie of Temple of Doom) and, of course, Lea Thompson. Moreover, Joaquin Phoenix turns into a disreputable turn as a kind of Goonie aspirant who befriends Jinx. Don't get close to this movie if you're not a trash fan.
