Watching It Lives By Night makes you wonder, only who in the world has illuminated this shit. A couple of newlyweds hunts down caves on their honeymoon, is attacked by bats and the husband starts running in his pajamas attacking various people. And where exactly are they? They are in the desert, then they ski, then they find themselves in a small town that seems to have mountains nearby. The city is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against the plaintive doctor. The ski hospital is run by a really sturdy guy with a thick bushy mustache and his wife looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. There is no dramatic tension and the ending will leave you full of anger. Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston made the effects for this film. I guess you have to start somewhere.
