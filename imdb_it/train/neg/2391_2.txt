I love movies. I love independent efforts and major studio productions. I love movies with stars and I love those with unknowns. I love dramas, comedies, action adventures, science fiction, mysteries, westerns, all genres except horror. I love foreign films and those in English. I love good films and I also love the bad guys, because almost no movie can entertain or entertain at a certain level. Except "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues". <br /> <br /> When I participated in a late-night performance of "Cowgirls", I joined an audience of about 10. Less than half, I was alone. Soon I could not tolerate the disorder that was spreading before my eyes, and I left too. To this day "Cowgirls" remains the only film I have ever walked by. <br /> <br /> I don't know how to describe this incoherent, vacuous, unkempt, meaningless film, or how to adequately convey its lack of redeeming value. Suffice it to say that it ranks as one of the worst important films of all time, absurd and unforgivable at all levels. He tries to be intelligent, but his conception of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic. Try to be funny, but his humor is gross and worthy. This is one of the few films that can profane their ethos, portraying the protagonists in such a discouraging way that they rebel against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, look at "Waterworld", "Ishtar", anything but this. Except the new "Alexander". If you choose between this and that, read a book instead.
