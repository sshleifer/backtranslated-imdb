Although there are Flying Guillotines as part of the title of this film, it has no connection with the original Flying Guillotines (1975) and its sequel Flying Guillotines II (1978). The two originals are masterpieces of the kung-fu film and still stands out as a classic. This is a much lower copy of the original, and even as a normal kung-fu film, it is below average. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film doesn't have much acting. It's a senseless fight scene after another, and the flying guillotine doesn't even have an important role in them. The story is about some Shaolin monks who are tracking down some bad guys who took off with a holy book, and an evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the plot. The same evil prince intends to attract the monks and use the flying guillotines on them. <br /> <br /> There are four films with Flying Guillotine as part of its title. In my opinion this is of a lower quality. The design of the flying guillotine in this film is different from the other three, which indicates that this film was produced by a different entity from the other three. <br /> <br /> The film has nothing chemical about being unintentionally funny due to poor production <br /> <br /> Skip this and look at the two originals.
