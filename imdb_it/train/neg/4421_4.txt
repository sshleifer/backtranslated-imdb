The topic is certainly compelling: a group of people brings their love for the game a step further by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes and castles. Wargaming is an interesting phenomenon that deepens our collective need to "escape" from the reality and sometimes worldliness of our existence - something that almost everyone can refer to. The characters are the predictable mix of Lord of the Rings nerds and Star Trek fans. This is enough to attract most people. However, very quickly the film turns into a vision of war workers with an almost stereotypical thumb to the spectators who "do not understand". Filmmakers seem to take the theme of wargaming into consideration and, in particular, too seriously, rather than recognizing the humor and fun of making a film about adults who drag themselves into medieval clothes and beat each other with swords of foam. It is rather difficult for those who do not sit on their computers for 7-10 hours a day to play or to design the last destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should worry about them. However, the filmmakers themselves don't seem to mind choosing to focus solely on the topic of the game itself rather than building a strong narrative with a clear story that anyone can understand. Furthermore, the characters themselves are not so compelling and you are quickly getting bored: a big no-no when you're trying to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
