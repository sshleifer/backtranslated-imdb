I heard this movie started well. The acting was perfect and I felt for all the characters, even if the real family unit had not been completely revealed. We never had enough information about the father to really feel his pain for all his involvement or to increase his animosity with Tobe. I mean in a scene that you see him that admires her for her tension and in another scene that is almost to take her head off. Another problem with the film was only revealed and lost focus at the end, and I was praying for it to end. Any film with such a long ending and a painful ending should never have an automatic rating of 7 or higher for acting only. We are looking at the quality of the cinema experience. In the case of this film, the end is so serious that I seriously thought about leaving the theater. This movie got me in and then spat me out.
