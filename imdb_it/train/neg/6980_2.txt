Historically accurate? Hmm ... Maybe ... if you squint your eyes, and the light falls on the subject just like that. But the accuracy of the core is not a compensation for a dismal, fragmentary and inconsistent plot, reams of cardboard dialogues and an unsatisfactory conclusion. The main characters are only characterizations; embarrassing stereotypes ranging from "enigmatic and noble" American Indians to "stifling but sadistic" British officers. A miserable and unworthy representation of a fascinating period in American history. I want my money back.
