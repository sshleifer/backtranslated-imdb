The first thing I noticed in this film, of course, was the useless amount of nudity. It does not exude nakedness or anything, but much was not necessary. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman who believes her stories about family ghosts that her ancestor who strangely resembles her was a werewolf and believes their fate is destined to be the same. Which I actually found quite interesting. The original Wolf Man was meant to be a completely psychological film, but Universal threw in the real wolf as you shouldn't see for n extra or two. I find that this concept of someone is not really an interesting werewolf. Unfortunately this is not the film I was looking for. <br /> <br /> Instead we know that he is not a werewolf from the beginning, so there is no thrill or twist, they too try to make the film look like it really happened. They also fail there by adding one or two parts of the film to this reality. At first I was excited to read the description of the film. But slowly I realized that it was a cover only to be able to expose the breasts of the main characters as often as possible. <br /> <br /> Annik Borel is a decent actor who plays a psychotic role or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role. Since the character Danniele has no brain and is just a madman running around crazy and snarling and shooting like a wolf, it takes little skill to play. He has moments in which his performance broke for a disturbing moment, but is quickly ruined by poor photographic work and light. The idea is great, but horribly performed during the film. 3/10
