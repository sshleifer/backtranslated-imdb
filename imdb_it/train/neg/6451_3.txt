"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) brings together a group of high schools for a meeting in the post where his twin brother Wes has disappeared. While there, a reptilian creature in the shape of a man (it reminded me a lot of the Gillman of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON) waits in the desert choosing the right moment to take them in pieces one by one. A biker, Ellen Ripley, the time of the bad female assault, Kat (Chase Masterson) has an underground military bunker in which she practices experiments, while also acting as a place of salvation from the bloody fury thing. Kat knows more than she says (she also suffered from the loss of a child), but there is another novelty that most of the group has no idea of. This creature could simply be more human than they realize ... and its previous identity could shed light on a deception only another person hid from Wes's death. Kat holds the key to many of the mysteries that unlock as the group stays close to the cabin. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a large part of the film remains away from the blowing-up creature as we also see a misty screen when we look through its eyes. The film has Dawson's Creek-type melodramas that often hinder the real tension that must be built into a small monster movie. The management is very bland and leads to a relatively boring experience instead of arousing fear. The cast is rather lifeless and uninteresting. Pretty Maggie Grace (THE FOG remake) may be the only attraction for this film.
