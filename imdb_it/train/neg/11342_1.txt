I should explain why I gave this ... 1 piece out of 10 stars possible. Simply because it is difficult or almost impossible to judge it correct. it would probably have been the same if I had given 10/10 - explanations, however, would have followed. <br /> <br /> I don't like these useless gore movies like HOSTEL or so - I think it's awful and cute terrible (in all possible contextual meanings), but as I found out after watching this movie - there's a genre called "historical drama" - and probably would have been the case of 10/10 as it has a lot of it and Tarantino would have been more than happy with it (and pushed Kill Bill 3 to shed even more blood on the screen than here to prove that it is possible). but the thing about the "historical drama" genre is that it is a sub-category of "trash movies" in which John Romero is the undead-emperor-of-courage and therefore automatically cannot be evaluated as a movie default - since these films are badly made on purpose and you can't really tell if the comically ugly moment was meant to be that way, or simply it was bad. it's for people who like to enjoy bad acting, bad script, and bad everything else. And for a round of faith - I'm one of them too. there are days when I want to see a really bad movie and look for some rubbish and go here - the day is saved! but this is certainly my opinion and has nothing to do with anyone else. <br /> <br /> What I wanted to say is that if you want to see some terrible films, then Fellini's Casanova is definitely the choice, but listen to my advice and don't rate it by default.
