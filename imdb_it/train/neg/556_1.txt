In my book "Basic Instinct" it was a perfect film. He played an exceptional role in the parts of Stone, Douglas and all the secondary actors in the smaller role. He had a wonderful photograph, the music and the noirest script never seen before. All this by adding a film that is as good as it ever will be! <br /> <br /> This sequel is the exact opposite, it can never get worse, a bad acting and a lame script, combined with totally inept direction, this is really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that keeps you quite focused is the relatively short wait for the next scene, which is an exact copy reproduced of the original. These copies are so ugly that they make you laugh and I laughed a lot despite myself, because it was like watching the demolition of a shining monument. The only thing that is good about this horrible mess is the Jerry Goldsmith score extract from BI1. Michael Caton-Jones and the witty scriptwriter also included the "No smoking in this room" dialogue in the interrogation scene and yes she sends away her lawyer (who is now a lawyer)! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I saw this terrible movie that should never have been made! It hurts the original, it is so ugly. The only redeeming value is the awareness that cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure Ms. Stone offered the best money for the surgeon can buy) can do a good job but obviously it can't restore the perfection of the original. And what concerns the human body also applies to the making of films. There should be a law: never make a sequel to a perfect movie!
