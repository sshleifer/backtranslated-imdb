This should be a great movie ... Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson have acted as two journalists. Mike Nichols directing. Uh It's dull dull boring! Useless and predictable! Slow and blurred! <br /> <br /> It's a cookie cutter "boy meets girl, boy bride girl, boy has a story, girl leaves boy story". Now there is an original concept! After being crushed for two hours (there were only two? They looked like six.) I wasn't sure if it was a comedy, a love story, a tragedy or a soap opera. It was done in 1986. I'm sure we all did things sixteen years ago that we would rather have forgotten. I hope the damage to Streep's reputation and others is starting to heal and that the emulsion on the master is starting to fade. It's not like it's such a bad picture. It's just that it's so good.
