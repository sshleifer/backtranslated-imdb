Well, AWFUL is just the first name. This film is a piece of junk made of clich√©s. A high school comedy in a military training camp. I'm sorry to have to give this 1 star he didn't deserve. <br /> <br /> THIS CAN CONTAINS SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Everything is totally forced, unconvincing and unrealistic. HEPO (military police) will not come to get you if you do not make your appearance, especially not on your wedding day. The actors were rather embarrassed during this scene, because the scene did not work as it was highly unlikely. You can feel it in their voices. Even if they weren't such bad actors, they wouldn't have been able to save the scene. <br /> <br /> Then the boy has to practice his wedding dress. No, there was no time to get him a uniform before. Friend, this is a great cinematography! I will remember this scene for the rest of my life. <br /> <br /> In the camp there are also GIRLS - exciting - one of them also has a model, even if she doesn't look so beautiful - and the most bad actress I've ever seen. I doubt that in Hollywood they would let them say a single line in a series movie B. <br /> <br /> Okay girls in the army! Now this is having fun. The girls are even on the same floor, so we can sneak into their room at night! In reality they would have been placed in another building a quarter of a mile away, separated by two barbed wire fences. <br /> <br /> There are tanks available that we can use for a fun ride in our spare time, of which we have a lot. No, the tanks are not locked and the ignition keys are inserted. No one will notice the engine sounds, especially not at night. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of scenes and references of sex and all are below the waste line. We need those so that sexually obsessed Germans will also like the film. Switzerland is too small a market for any film. Well done! <br /> <br /> A sex scene takes place in the kitchen. Certainly, none of these structures is ever blocked. Military routines are so sloppy that they can arrive. <br /> <br /> At the end of the mindless movie, the mafia killers are on revenge for the poor guy who tries to shoot him! Because he abandoned his girlfriend! Of course I buy it, Italians are like that - a jealous group (not). <br /> <br /> The bad guys try to do it in broad daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses. Not at night in a dark alley. Again, military training camps (where ammunition shooting is planned) are open to the public, anyone can drive or walk freely. There are no such things as guards or fences. <br /> <br /> However, the act is prevented by the good captain who promptly launches a missile in the car of the Italians. The explosion hits the goons and the angry girlfriend from their feet. No one 40 feet away is injured when the car is smashed to pieces. It's a COMEDY, remember. <br /> <br /> Ok. It's a comedy, I understood it and can live with it. Realism is not necessary. Filmmakers can easily achieve this if it is exhilarating, splitting parts in a fun or entertaining, interesting, stimulating way. Unfortunately, it's none of those. It's just embarrassing. A rip-off from American mindless comedies. The latter are at least professionally made, without amateur actors. <br /> <br /> It is rather boring and predictable, a waste of time and energy, especially to those who are sitting through the entire film as I unfortunately did. Yawn.
