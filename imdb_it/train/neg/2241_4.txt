I remember having fun a few years ago, but going back to it, I wonder why. I guess it's always nice and the girls behave quite well, but men prefer to leave the lower part. Why, oh, why in so many British sex movies should we have such inept men next to pretty girls? Moreover, this starts quite predictably as a similar sexual farce in the Confessions movies but at about a third (while we are starting to enjoy the presence of the adorable Me Me Lai) the film asks us to start taking it seriously. Not only that, but the sequences of the central rock club and cannabis are very forced and seem only rigged. In short, this is neither innocently foolish nor as intelligent as it seems intended. Perhaps Richard O'Sullivan, as a central figure, could have been helpful, but I think this is one of his worst performances. It's worth it for women.
