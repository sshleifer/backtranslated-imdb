WARNING: THE REVISION CONTAINS MILD'S SPOILERS <br /> <br /> A couple of years ago I was able to see the first five films of this franchise and I was planning to take an overview of the entire Elm St series. However, only two years later and I find that I can't remember enough about them in order to do it ?? I guess they couldn't make a big impression. From what I remember, some of the sequels ?? Dream Warriors in particular ?? they weren't as bad as they often are, even if the original wasn't a classic. Generally, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep are killed in their dreams) does not lend itself to narrative tension. But while I can't remember most of the first five films, I know they never fathomed the depths of Freddy's Dead. <br /> <br /> An indication of how sick Freddy's audience was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted exclusively at the end of the character. The fact that the conclusion of the film is not even hidden, but in reality the whole purpose of the being of the film goes to illustrate how this enterprise is empty, soulless and cynical. <br /> <br /> Taking the morally questionable idea of ​​having a child molester as the bad charismatic, Robert Englund's non-disturbing interpretation explodes into laughter. I always thought that Freddy's mocking about teenage victims was less targeted at the characters than the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe. It's like Englund screaming "we know this is rubbish ?? but you're paying to see it, so who's laughing?" And I'm sure the victims of child abuse would be discouraged to see such a callous representation of their situation. Was Freddy's appearance in the movies always so rudimentary? All you get here is some "haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr ?? har ?? har ?? hars" and that's it. If this was the only Elm St. movie you'd ever seen, you wouldn't know the character at all. Although the pre-dead character in a flashback Englund interprets him as a bad quagmire of quagmire, with an inclination of transatlantic irony (ie exaggerated, out of place and not at all funny). <br /> <br /> Acting is almost universally poor. Just look at how many times Breckin Meyer manages to overwhelm with his gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, maintains his dignity. And when Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up, you can almost visibly see the movie sinking into the mud. Even the script is absolutely bad, almost completely worthless. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road map, on which Freddy, like Noel Coward, wittily wrote "you're fucked". When the map is requested, Carlos responds "well, the map says we're screwed". Who wrote the script, Oscar Wilde? <br /> <br /> Or what about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy, his hearing improved to painful levels? So Freddy torments him threatening to drop a pin? a potentially fatal sound, since all the sounds are enlarged. Strangely, the fact that Carlos shouts loudly to keep him from falling seems to have no effect. "Good listening to you, Carlos," Freddy jokes, hoping for better lines. It is also worth noting that dream sleep does not occur instantly, so being unconscious would not allow immediate access to Freddy's world. Although as part of the narrative it contains a human computer game and a final three-dimensional logic is not the one at the top of the list of requirements. <br /> <br /> The teenagers who direct the cast this time are really the most hateful, unpleasant group in the entire series. Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only one to greet Freddy with "shut the f ** k up, man" and a kick in the scallops. And was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? Freddy is dead. No laughter. No fear No interest. It's not funny. <br /> <br />
