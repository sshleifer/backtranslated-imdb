Every Christmas Eve I make my children survive another show of It's A Wonderful Life. I also really appreciated Bad Santa. So denounce me. I admit. I like cheese films, schmaltzy. I also like excellent and smart ones, but as with so many things, variety is a good thing. What would be the Christmas season without the annual ka-ching ka-ching of Santa in all its forms, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus won't let Bedford Falls forget, but I don't think a Christmas movie should reach the iconic stature to succeed. "Fred" is a perfectly OK holiday film, with enough humor for adults and sufficient charm for children. My wife and I laughed a lot, even though most of the humor was obvious and Vince was simply Vince. Paul Giamatti was a first class Santa Claus, who helped a lot. Not a great film, and unlikely to become a must for someone's annual Christmas traditions. But my wife and daughter and I enjoyed ourselves for what it was, schmaltz holiday with a hint of spice. There is nothing wrong with that.
