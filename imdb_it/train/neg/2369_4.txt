Sixth adventure for Freddy Krueger in which he finally managed to practically kill all the young people in Springwood; now he wants to broaden his horizons and (** SPOILER **) needs a family member to do so. <br /> <br /> A failure like a horror movie because it's just not scary at all. It works better as a dark and macabre black comedy, to tell you the truth. Freddy Krueger has now been deprived of all his abilities to relax this viewer. (Too many lines, that's for sure.) Actors are not interesting (except Robert Englund, as always, and of course Yumet Kotto who is staggering) and there are simply too many visual effects. The ending is OK, but it doesn't provide as many sparks as I think we can hope. <br /> <br /> Adding a new twist to the story of the dream killer, it offers Englund the opportunity to do more trick scenes like never before. <br /> <br /> There are noteworthy cameos: a joint cameo by spouses Roseanne and Tom Arnold that is worthless of entertainment, an appropriate appearance by veteran rocker Alice Cooper, and a fun cameo by Johnny Depp which also recognizes the pop icon it had become. <br /> <br /> Film debut by Breckin Meyer, who plays Spencer. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about it is the reproduction of key scenes from previous entries during the credits. <br /> <br /> 4/10
