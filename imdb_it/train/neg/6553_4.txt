Years after the fall of the last of the big corporations, the world has fallen into a new dark age in which cyborgs are gathered for their parts. Cash, a female cyborg, goes to a devastating doctor to get news that she's pregnant. On the run from Recyclers (bounty hunters who hunt cyborgs), Cash tries to find his way to Cytown, the mythical shelter for cyborgs. <br /> <br /> "Cyborg 3: The Recycler" is the third (and last far) entry into the CYBORG trilogy. The first film was originally designed to be a sequel to MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, but was quickly rewritten in a standard post-apocalyptic martial arts festival that became something of a cult classic due to its action scenes. CYBORG 2: GLASS SHADOW was a sequel that actually improved its predecessor but was not widely seen (and was rejected by those few who saw it as economic fodder). <br /> <br /> First of all, this film tries to be a combination of the first two films (the first was a poor action movie while the second was a Cyberpunk story) but unfortunately it's not up to it of both fronts. The budget was obviously lower than CYBORG 2, with the film set in the desert desert lands (like many post-apocalyptic action films of the 1990s), filmed around old industrial buildings to save costs. <br /> <br /> The film's story centers on a plot device, that of a pregnant cyborg, which is as interesting as it is absurd (this film is not the first to prove it, the anime series OVA ARMITAGE III lo uses to a greater extent). But the film falls into the same trap that many victims of low-cost sci-fi action films fall into, in that the obstacles (synthetic organisms) present are nothing more than androids. Visual effects are equivalent to nothing but prosthetic weapons and the effects of makeup. <br /> <br /> Acting is pretty standard for this type of film, with the lead actress (Khrystyne Haje) being the only worst performer on show. Instead of being happy with the news, she is pregnant, behaves in a whiny and grumpy way. His co-stars are much better, Malcolm McDowell is the usual type of gangster who enlivens the scenes in which he appears and Richard Lynch has a lot of fun as the bad boss. Of particular note is Andrew Byniarski, who plays Lynch's right hand man, who would later appear in the remake of THE CHAINSAW MASSACRE in Texas and in his prequel.
