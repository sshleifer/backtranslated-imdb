A young professor of genetics playing basketball is researching the genetic sequence, using human fetuses. He hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging. He is forced to finish his research because he has not published, so the university has difficulty justifying it (I think). <br /> <br /> Give a test injection on a monkey, which dies quickly. He then tries it on himself. He begins a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying boy; she is the one who requested research results. <br /> <br /> Initially, it seems to have no effect from the injection, except for some new strength. Then he realizes he has a memory leak and begins to remember what happened. Also, it starts to look very unhealthy. <br /> <br /> Since the film is called metamorphosis, it eventually turns into something else. You will not believe your eyes - neither what it has turned into, nor the absolutely lousy costume that the actor wears to represent what it is transformed into. Incredibly, there is a further change in the store - the end of the film is really, really absurd. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film is going to do is that Laura Gemser is in it, but it has a very small part. <br /> <br /> I once saw a video box with a shape of sculpted plastic glued to the lid of the box. Maybe he could have had some electronics at once, maybe the eyes that light up (the eyes of the main character occasionally turn green in the film). The copy I saw had a box that showed only signs of tears where the glue had kept the plastic, which had been removed. The box of novelty, if it still existed, would have been the only reason why I would have kept this film; I'm definitely getting rid of it.
