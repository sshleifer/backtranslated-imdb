To know how horrible The Shield is, you should write pages and pages, so suffice it to say that it is a monument to bad direction. <br /> <br /> "When Directors Go Awry" should have been the title of this production. In fact, filmmakers should infuse their work with a sense of visual style and storytelling that propels the story forward. <br /> <br /> How do you constantly shake the camera and play with a "style" zoom? How is the story carrying on? Obviously there are also the nonsense "Modification for random numbers". Apparently it became fashionable to cut it at random. <br /> <br /> I guess it's too much work to do a good editing. <br /> <br /> Well, that made it too much work for most people to watch The Shield which languished as one of the most overcrowded and unseen shows of all time.
