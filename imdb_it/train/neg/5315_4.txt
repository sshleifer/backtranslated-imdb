Kol, a space prisoner on death row in space, manages to hijack a space shuttle and escape into the woods of America where, along with some new friends he finds, he tries to escape a machine to kill a female cyborg from the alienator. Fred Olen Ray's best career film, "Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers", this can't help but seem a bit disappointing, just like a low budget like that previous movie, but not as fun as the one I had with it. None of the actors really impressed me, the film is good for the indiscriminate observer during a rainy Saturday afternoon, but it's almost all for him. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D + <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Thriller
