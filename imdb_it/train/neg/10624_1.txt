In an otherwise good review, loleralacartelort7890 says "The truth is that Americans use a secret anti-radiation aluminum alloy." "It is not so well known." The exact specifications are a secret. And why is it a secret: Well, why should they reveal it then? If they were in a space race with the Russians, it would be VERY stupid to reveal that they had a new technology that could protect the crew from radiation. "This is completely wrong. There is (and was) no" secret "for radiation protection in Apollo. The design and construction of the Apollo command module have long been available to the public. It uses a" honeycomb "Lightweight of aluminum and stainless steel. The entire external surface (except the windows of course) is covered by a heat shield in phenolic resin, more often on the bottom that looks forward during the return. These materials are actually * better * in stopping the type of radiation we have in space (charged particles) compared to lead, which is better suited to stop ionizing photons such as X-rays and gamma rays. <br /> <br /> Space radiation is a definite problem for long-term space flight due to the risk of large solar flares, but it was simply not a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts The command module gave them good protection during their brief (1/2 hour or so ) Passage through the Van Allen belts. They all carry dosimeters in order to know exactly how much radiation they received: no more than 1.5 rem, and usually much less. Of the 24 men who flew to the moon (12 of whom landed), 18 are still alive. Only two died of cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died of a heart attack, pancreatitis (Roosa) and a motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are actually quite good statistics for a group of men who are now around 70 years old (Shepard would be 86).
