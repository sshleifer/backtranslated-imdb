1st watched 12/6/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Walter Lang): musically disappointing in terms of character development, in my opinion, from this much-announced piece by Rodgers and Hammerstein. There are a couple of good songs and a decent comic portrait, sometimes, of Yul Brynner's King of Siam - but the film doesn't really do a good job in presenting the situation and settings. I can only blame the script and maybe some acting on why we don't fully understand the character's features and their situations. I know it might be a bit too much to ask for a musical intended for the enjoyment of songs and dances, but I didn't like this part too much. The basic plot is about an English woman who comes to Siam to teach children European luxury things. We discover later that the King is actually the greatest student. There is a forbidden love story between the king's new wife, played by Rita Moreno (a Latin like Arabic - dai !!) and a former lover who causes some complications, but nothing really hypnotic added though. Deborah Kerr, as the main female character Annie, that's fine, but it's not even convincing. The King learns some things because of his presence and then the film vanishes like he does. This is really a tiny story with some songs and dances, but it's not a great experience for a viewer.
