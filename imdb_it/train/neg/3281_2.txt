I suspected the film would be ugly. I've been a Duke fan for a long time. They have three years of TV series on DVD. Well, I was right. He brought the family to see it. I really wanted to see the general jump up again and some chase scenes were good. But to sum up, the film was a refined version of the show. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson was pathetic. While I can honestly say that Daisy's original clothes were equally revealing, Daisy's interpretation of Jessica Simpson was simply horrible. Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle must also roll into their graves. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money. If you are an old and proven Dukes fan like me and my three children you are very disappointed.
