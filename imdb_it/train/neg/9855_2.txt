Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of fantasy. However, this film is not for me. Many unlikely arguments are trying to support the claim of this film that dragons could ever exist. The film is about connections in different stories from different countries, but fails to investigate further, which could give the film a certain credibility. The film uses (beautiful!) CGI to tell us about a fantasy story told about the life of a young dragon. This is combined with popular TV-show-CSI flash-forwards to make something look scientific, which it certainly isn't. In many cases the arguments / clues are unlikely. In some cases, the clues used to show that dragons have probably existed, or flown or spit out, are simply invalid. Seeing this makes my toes cramp. Even a fantasy film needs a certain degree of reality, but this just doesn't have it. Bottom line: it's a fake CSI fantasy documentary, not worth watching.
