In my humble opinion, this version of the great musical BDWY has only two things at stake: Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script. (OK, Vanessa Williams is beautiful to look at.) But that's all for me. Most of the cast seems to be walking through the show - Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim really is and it's no wonder people walk on Harry McAfee when played by George Wendt who seems to prefer going back on bar in Boston. Jason Alexander is passable, but that wig has to go and I've seen Bugsy Malone dance better. As I said, it's nice to have a version of the script now, but I hope the young people out there, who have never seen a musical, DO NOT judge them all by it.
