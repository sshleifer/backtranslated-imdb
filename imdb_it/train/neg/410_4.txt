Unfortunately, one of the best efforts made in the field of special effects has been made completely useless, being next to a bulky, silly and just as useless plot and an inadequate screenplay, cliché. Hollow Man is a rather useless film. <br /> <br /> Practically everything that was seen here was done to death - the characters, the idea and the action sequences (in particular the elevator shaft!) - with the only element really intriguing of the film is the impressive special effect. However, it is the same special effect repeated over and over again, and even at the end of the film it was done until death. I was hoping before looking at Hollow Man that the Invisible Man theme, which is barely original in itself, would be the basis of something newer and more interesting. It is not so. It is not long before the film turns into an excessively familiar bloodbath and a mass of ineffective histrionics: the pile of clichés accumulates so quickly that it seems almost impressive. <br /> <br /> On top of all this, Kevin Bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast is just doing his best. Good points could be a passable score by Jerry Goldsmith (but no competition for his best efforts), a rather interesting use of thermal images and special effects. I was tempted to give this movie three out of ten, but the effects push the merit of Hollow Man up a notch. <br /> <br /> 4/10
