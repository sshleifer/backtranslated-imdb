There is absolutely nothing to redeem this film. They took an insignificant story, they misanted it, they wrote it wrong, they misinterpreted it. He has bad dialogues performed badly in a sinuous and unkempt story. <br /> <br /> As bad as it fails as an art, it fails even worse as a trade. Who could have been the reference market for this. What age range? Which interest group? <br /> <br /> Someone should make a film about how and why they made this film. I would pay to see. <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of bad movies, and this ranks with "Sailor Who Fell from Grace" and "Manos" ... my choices as the three most hopelessly bad films I've ever seen. All associates should be forced to converse with VanDamme for eternity. <br /> <br /> I challenge you. Watch this movie and do an academic exercise: how could you take this and make it worse? I can't think of a way.
