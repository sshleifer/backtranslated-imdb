I love horror movies, low budgets, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s ... but how can you think this is a great horror movie? let's compare it to the titles of a similar vein-infested film house. the haunting, the shapeshifter, the splendor. or for a horror film based on similar technology that has been better FAAAR, (although it is still FAR from the big) Demon Seed. OK, I'll be honest ... let's face it with horror movies made for TV! don't go to sleep .. waaay more creepier and better done. The Salem sack, the night stalker, the night gallery, even not going to the basement or the crowhaven farm were much better. * SPOILERS * First of all, however good the scene of the bloody shower scene was, you have a scene like the opening scene .. oh boy! the garden hose shows up to refresh some young teenagers! TERRIBLE. moreover, just what we understand of the house .. apparently he needs to use his cameras to see what's going on, and it's a very emotional house. it is not a spirit, a demon or an entity, it is a house that is "possessed", but for what? are we led to believe that an inanimate object has learned to love Suzie / Margaret, our protagonist? now that I'm on the subject of suzie .. another scene that totally bothered me, this poor old madwoman arrives, tells you that she was your nurse, pours her heart out, falls into the boiling pool, struggling in agony to 45 seconds and what does Margaret do? could his hands be burned to save this poor old woman who came there to feel her life? no, she's there and look! acting for the most part was better than average for a horror movie, but that's where the positives end up. for at least one more interesting and amusing horror film about an inanimate object that kills the people watching the death bed: the bed that eats. I have the feeling that people who have evaluated this so much or haven't looked at it since it was originally broadcast, or remembered scaring them as children. this film was about less.
