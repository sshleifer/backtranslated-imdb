There is not much to say about this. A plot can be practically anchored in the first 10 minutes. Nothing too wrong with this film, very little action for an action movie. There was a chance to explore the emotions of the characters from time to time. If an action movie is the right genre to do it, I'm still undecided. Sniper was one of the easiest movies to watch without giving the utmost attention, as he had little twists and a simple plot. I was probably guilty of this, so with a second watch or with undivided attention it could be better. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but the best of my 4 out of 10)
