I would like to say that unlike many of the people who did not like this film and found it impossible to understand, I was fully able to understand it for what it is .. A very inconsistent attempt on a plot. <br /> <br /> I don't like to turn this word but in this case it fits very well. The director first presents the material in an extremely "arrogant" and worse, extremely inconsistent way. It is inconsistent in that it presents the material in a disorderly order, making us think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes come first, and arrogant in how much 2 hours is expected, the viewer at CURA at the end of it. <br /> <br /> I respect surrealist cinema for what it is. (creating a story around a more than real world that does not relate to real life) But there is nothing surreal in having a story set in ordinary modern times, and a modern terrestrial setting, which is above all not able to engage the public but also, simply, a series of out-of-phase events that barely bind. The most accurate way to describe the experience of seeing this film is like seeing a story; perhaps even a very good story because it is based on a book, but frustrated by the fact that the camera does not seem to capture the necessary moments and tie together every means of coherence. <br /> <br /> We compare stylistic cinema. Compare "Seul contre tous" by Gaspar Noe to this. He gave us a coherent, extremely engaging and intellectually profound story. This film does not offer an intellectual study, and while it is very stylistic in its fragmented presentation, the director has finally abandoned the essential art of good storytelling and all that remains is a mess of events that barely intertwine. <br /> <br /> Yes, indeed, it is possible to make sense of things ... to a POINT. But as I said before, the viewer will reach a stage where they simply say "Who cares". It's like watching a banal banal story of a man who goes to the supermarket and buys food in an anticonological order. Even with the murders he is completely devoid of interest and disinterested. Too many people these days will give top marks to something they can't understand or make sense simply out of fear of sounding silly, and anyway this movie tries to make the viewer look stupid. <br /> <br /> If you have too much time, then please watch this movie, taking into account what I said. It is a story based on a book that could have been presented in a MUCH more effective way and this is my basic reasoning.
