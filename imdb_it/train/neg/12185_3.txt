What on earth has Martin Scorcese ever owned to redo this movie? And not only has it redone, has it completely ruined? The senseless decision to make the character played by Robert De Niro (in his most exaggerated, and very telling) performance in a religious fanatic is ridiculous, and an example of attitudes nourished by Hollywood (and especially by Scorcese) - attitudes that force Writers think that the best way to make a character crazy is to tattoo a crucifix on his back. In any case, this film is horrible. <br /> <br />
