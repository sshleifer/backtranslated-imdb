Six different couples. Six different love stories. Six different angles of love. Eighty public numbers in the cinema. Looking at the eighty different parts of the big screen. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie. All the stories have no connection between them, but somewhere along the line Nikhil Advani tries to show some relationship between them. I tried to find out some lines that I could write as a review but at the end of 3 hours and 15 minutes I didn't find anything to write. The film is a poor copy of the Hollywood blockbuster LOVE ACTUALLY. <br /> <br /> My suggestion. Don't watch the movie if you really want to see a good movie.
