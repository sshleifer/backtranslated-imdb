This film fails miserably at every level. I have an idea, we all get involved in this movie and ship them to a hot area in the Middle East. Maybe if we are lucky they will be killed and killed and we will never have to waste our time with them. Did I mention that I've never been so bitter about a bunch of movie shit in my life? My God, I can't think of anything I've ever seen so badly. I'd rather watch Ishtar 25 times in a row than spend 10 minutes of this sorry apology for a movie. If I ever meet someone who's been involved in this movie, I'll spit it in your face and then beat them meaninglessly. They are my two cents.
