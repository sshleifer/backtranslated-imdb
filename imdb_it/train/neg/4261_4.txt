Pathetic. This is what happens when the manager comes to work just because someone is paying him. <br /> <br /> The intentions were good, fantastic places and settings for a film of epic proportions. But the performance, damn it! I swear, in some shots you can see extras in the background staring at the camera or watching the actors because no one told them what they should do when they hear "Action!" The battle scenes are so bad you wonder: are these people real? They could have done more damage by simply hugging each other. In slow-mo scenes you can see people on the battlefield around or just stand up, waving their hands. <br /> <br /> Only the action in the foreground is somewhat emphasized. But for what? The story is so illogical and discontinuous, it seems that the situations are random in chronological order, sometimes not even that. The dialogues are stupid, the plot of love is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in Hong Kong action movies. <br /> <br /> With a budget of 40 million and you can see every dollar invested on the screen, at best, the end result of all this enormous effort is a round glossy laser disk in the thin cover placed on the store shelf of videos.
