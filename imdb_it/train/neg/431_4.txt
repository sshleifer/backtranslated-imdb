I must admit that Al Pacino is a guilty pleasure. He was a good actor until Scent of a Woman, where he apparently overdubbed himself beyond repair. I was hoping that this film, of which I had hardly heard anything grow, would have been a beautiful gem. A neglected, avant-garde, intelligent and engaging metropolitan thriller. It is not. <br /> <br /> City Hall is a film that obscures its plot with so many "realistic" characters, names and problems throughout the city, that for a while you think it is such a broad and engaging storyline , that once you discover the truth, it will drive you crazy. In reality, however, these subplots and digressions actually translate into marks of fairly docile and very familiar urban stories like Corruption of Power, Politicians with two sides, Mafia with police ties, etc. And, theoretically, this configuration allows you to feel tension, they fear that none of the characters is safe and that everything can happen! But again, it really isn't. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the only things that happen are quite predictable, and there remain many "confession" monologues, taken together to form a modern fairy tale of sorts, a lesson on the moral ambiguity of the "world real "of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of missing names and relationships and a web of lies and concealments, the public is usually treated to a rather satisfying revelation. I don't think they'll stay in the town hall, and even if it's a very full movie, I don't find it entirely rich.
