I was very excited to see this film, anticipating a visual excursus on the relationship between artistic beauty and nature, containing the types of wisdom that "Rivers and Tides" likes. However, it is not what I received. Instead, I get a pretty uninspired movie about how human industry is bad for nature. Which is clearly an unorthodox statement. <br /> <br /> The photographer seems to be in conflict about the aesthetic qualities of his images and the alleged "ethical" duty he has towards workers who occasionally populate the images along the periphery. And frankly, the images were generally not so impressive. And according to this "artist", the scale is the basis for what makes something beautiful. <br /> <br /> All in all, a stupid movie. For people who would like to feel better with their environmental conscience ... but not for those who would like to think about the complexities of the problems that surround them.
