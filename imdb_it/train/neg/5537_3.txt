What? Weren't you aware that Scooby-Doo fights against zombies? Well, you might not even be aware of this little film directed by Victor Halperin, who had also directed White Zombie four years earlier. This would probably make the second zombie movie made. <br /> <br /> No, don't go looking for Dorothy Stone to expose her breasts as you would expect in most zombie movies, and don't even look for eaten brains. This is 1936, you know. <br /> <br /> So what you will see is typical of the period - lots of talk. <br /> <br /> You'll see Dean Jagger (Twelve O ') Clock High) and Bela Lugosi's eyes, but that's all. Zombies in Cambodia, really!
