Words cannot describe how bad this film is. I can't explain it by just writing. You also see it for yourself to understand how awful a movie can be. Not that I recommend you do it. There are so many cliches, mistakes (and all the other negative things you can imagine) that will make you cry. To start with the first technician, there are many errors regarding the aircraft. I don't list them here, but I only mention the coloring of the plane. They didn't even manage to show an airliner in the colors of an imaginary airline, but instead they used a 747 painted in the original Boeing livery. Very ugly. The plot is stupid and has been done many times in the past, only much, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that I lost count of them very soon. Also, I was always on the bad side all the time in the movie, because the good guys were so stupid. "Executive decision" should no doubt be the choice on this, even the "Turbulence" -movies are better. In fact, every other film in the world is better than this.
