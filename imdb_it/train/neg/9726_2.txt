This is a fascinating and terrible film. It makes so little sense that it begins to create a kind of strange internal logic. Well, he would do it if he didn't keep darting on back alleys until he finally squirmed under the weight of his own indecision. The film cannot decide if it is a simple film "Man Turns Into Monster" (like all the 50s). THE INCREDIBLE to insert the verb ING MAN 'film, or a horrible film of conspiracy theory of large companies, or a mystical story of contact of the afterlife, or ... or what? Make your choice. It's just a mess. Grotesquely above and firing in all directions, leaving the free ends shaking everywhere. It was as if Tobe Hooper had taken David Lynch's pills. Unfortunately he didn't get enough.
