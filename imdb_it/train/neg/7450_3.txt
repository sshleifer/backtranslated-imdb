I saw this movie in the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so badly that I didn't see any saving virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was chosen as a cop who never smiles or smiles, while his smile and his smile are two of his brands. Danny Glover was chosen as bad, but - once again - the imagination of the spectators could not go far enough to believe him in that role. Furthermore, Jared Leto was not as credible as the former medical student. The tension was not there, since the killer was known very soon. The ending was, once again, neither dramatic nor tense: no one around me worried about what would happen next. All we could expect was the end of the film. All in all, a disappointing evening spent at the cinema.
