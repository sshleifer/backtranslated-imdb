A confusing melodrama based on a story by William Gibson, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark is the head of an elegant and luxurious rural madhouse, where his free wife fights with the self-proclaimed queen bee Lillian Gish, and Widmark himself has the elusive eye for the newcomer of staff Lauren Bacall, who is putting back the his lives after the death of her husband and her son. Easy and confusing, set in an indiscriminate time and place, and with a love story "David and Lisa" hidden in the plush swamp. Widmark and Bacall have a good chemistry together, but this script doesn't give them anything to build. For exactly one hour, most dialogues are about what to do with the curtains hanging in the library (this thread is not used as a symbolism, rather it is a false track in a non-mystery!). The image hopes to show the short irons that disparate people when they work in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is right, but unfortunately the way Minnelli draws this stew is neither informative, nor illuminating nor amusing. ** from ****
