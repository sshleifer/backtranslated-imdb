It's hard to believe, after waiting for 14 years, we end up with this piece of cinematic junk. The original was a high-impact dark thriller that achieved cult status by demonstrating the art of cinema as directed by Paul Verhoeven. This film adds nothing, offers nothing and eventually ends up in the big box of failed sequels. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerable and capable cast. Unfortunately we are treated to a 90-minute dissertation in Catherine Tramell's self-indulgent life ... or it's Sharon Stone. Perhaps a copulation of both. <br /> <br /> If desire also sees a continuation of the sensual provocative stunning of sex as in "B.S.1", forget it. Finish with the boredom of soft porn that ultimately supports the old saying that a woman can be more seductive in clothes than outside of them. It is interesting to note that the wonderful Charlotte Rampling went wild in her shots, passing by the GEORGY GIRL of 1966, when Mrs Stone was only 8 years old. A very talented actress and skilled in holding her own here too. <br /> <br /> If you are a true cinema fan, then you have to watch this movie and judge it using your evaluation system. Otherwise, you could also wait for the DVD to be released in the "rated" version, in the "unrated" version, in the "collector" edition or in the "ultimate" version, and perhaps in another 14 years we will be saturated with news of Basic "Instinct 3" at that point Mrs Stone will be 62 and nobody really cares.
