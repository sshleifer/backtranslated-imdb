Words cannot describe how absolutely abysmal this film is. It's a series of random clips, not funny about everything, from a stupid parody of Batman to a guy who takes it with an old dead lady (REALLY disturbing). The only oddly funny thing about the Comedy Movie underground is watching Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor in this movie. Furthermore, it is rated NC-17, avoiding the only people who could tolerate it.
