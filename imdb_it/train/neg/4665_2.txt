I really wanted to love the pillow book. Intriguing history, traits of interesting characters, Ewan Macgregor altogether absolutely glorious. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of it. Greenaway fell in love with presenting the film in a unique way, and not for the benefit of the film. I won't even go into the abyssal acting of Vivian Wu. <br /> <br /> You distract yourself from the story with 4 billion windows and calligraphy that roll down the screen showing the lyrics of the music that is playing. He seems to have lost sight of the presentation of the real story and the development of the plot, and he got caught up with foo-foo embellishments that have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like presenting a portrait of Sergeant by John Singer on a chintzy frame with the inscription "GRANDMA LOVES ME!" in large shiny letters. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be a victim of the auteur's directorial ego instead of what could have been: disturbing and horribly beautiful. In the hands of another director (Jeunet? Coppola?), It could have been a masterpiece. In Greenaway's hands, it's better to go back to the fine art classes that take themselves too seriously.
