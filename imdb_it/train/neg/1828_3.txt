I saw "Envy" two nights ago, on DVD, in a friend's house. The premise of this film is quite promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential, but absolutely fails to provide. I watched it with about five friends and nobody laughed for the whole movie. The jokes (which are few and far between) are NOT fun in any way ... the plot is crap, and they never answer the question ... WHERE GOES? Obviously the answer to this is NO ONE CARES. This film lacks any kind of comic value, and like few other users have said that the only thing that makes it almost worth seeing is Christopher Walken as J-man. None of the characters is developed, so subtle textures are almost transparent - and that song in the film should be fun ??
