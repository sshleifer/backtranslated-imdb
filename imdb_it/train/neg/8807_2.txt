I chose "Dead Creatures" because I thought it was a zombie movie, just like "28 days" or so ... but not quite. It's not even a horror movie. Nothing happens, except for a group of women who seem to have been infected by a strange virus that makes them eat human flesh to survive. <br /> <br /> That plot gives rise to a series of disgusting scenes of cannibalism ... <br /> <br /> VERY BAD FILM. <br /> <br /> * My speed: 2/10 <br /> <br /> ------------------ <br /> <br /> --------------- ---
