And how the production made me wonder. The main character is a hateful show that is not funny at all. I can't stand the character at all. He is an idiot with nothing to offer the show. <br /> <br /> This is the worst comic book to appear in the last 10 years, it's not a joke. The lines of the story are written and poorly executed. The jokes are as bad as Disney's Disney Life of Zack and Cody. I could not not love this show more, it is terrible and should be canceled. Even the acronym is ugly. The title, even worse. <br /> <br /> It is as if this show was written by a couple of fifteen year olds who based the character on themselves and think that they are hot stuff when they are really arrogant and lacking in creativity and humor. <br /> <br /> Johnny Test, go away far and fast!
