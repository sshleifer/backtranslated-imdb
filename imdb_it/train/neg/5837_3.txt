I can't say that I really liked this movie. He has some fun moments, but he doesn't seem able to decide if it's a comedy or a drama. light in tone to be a drama, and the funny moments are few and far between. It also doesn't make much sense. Things seem to happen for no reason. And it is also extremely convoluted. I feel like they just did things the way they were going. If they just needed some time to explain things, this may have been a better movie. I would say the ending was anti-climatic, but this meant that the rest of the film was actually growing to something, that it didn't do anything, it ends, and that's that. I didn't find it boring, really, but like I said, there's really no point there. I will give Winter Kills reluctant and weak 3/10
