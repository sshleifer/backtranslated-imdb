I really felt cheated after seeing this picture. I was sitting watching this movie for 101 minutes for nothing. I don't understand what they were thinking when they did this. Hardly able to kill Jeffrey Dahmer and has no end. It almost felt like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel. It was like watching a television episode of the Sopranos. It suddenly ends, and you know there will be another episode next week. I also thought I saw the first part of a two-part movie. There are many possibilities for what went wrong here; they became lazy, they ran out of money, they didn't know the rest of the story, they wanted to create a Dahmer 2. After watching this movie they all sound very accurate. I was watching Jeffrey Dahmer walking in the woods. Suddenly I hear this music playing, then the writing arrives on the screen and tells how Dahmer served two years of his sentence and was attacked by another prisoner and killed at 34 years. Wow, he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in prison. How about showing how he got there. How about showing the Dahmer process. How about showing some more details. I can't even explain what happened in this film because it jumped everywhere. In reality I found myself saying incredulously: "Here, is this the end?" I want to conclude this review by saying that there is still a good Dahmer movie still to be realized. I would like to say to the directors, if you intend to do it, do it well.
