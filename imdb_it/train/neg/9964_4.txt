In a recent biography of Alec Guinness I didn't find too much about To Paris With Love. I'm sure Guinness made the film to get a free trip to Paris. The film has no other reason to exist. <br /> <br /> Paris, of course, is well photographed with that wonderful opening of Guinness and the son who walks the Champs Elysee with the Arc de Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately it comes from all sides. <br /> <br /> There's really nothing between Guinness and the girl with whom he has a brief adventure in Paris. According to the recent Guinness biography of Piers Paul Read, Guinness did not like the girl, she found her behavior unprofessional. Regarding what Odile Vernois thought of his co-star, no record is available. They have the same chemistry as two sterilized cats. <br /> <br /> Guinness has a nice moment in the movie that was directly from one of his Ealing comedies as he climbs a tree trying to retrieve a badminton shuttlecock. But I wouldn't wait for the movie for this. <br /> <br /> At least Alec got a trip to Paris.
