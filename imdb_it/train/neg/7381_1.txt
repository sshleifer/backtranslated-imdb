Ok, first of all, Seagal's voice is dubbed like 50% of the movie ... Why? Because apparently they were rewriting the script and the story as they turned and need to change its dialogue for the continuity of the story as they have multiple versions. From the beginning, you scratch your head because overdubs not only distract you, but they don't make sense. <br /> <br /> That said, the story is still sucked in and it doesn't make any sense. When I had the end, I was just scratching my head because the film was so useless and the ending didn't even make sense. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. This film made me stop watching Seagal directly to the videos, because they only got worse.
