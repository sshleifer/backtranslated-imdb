Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha, ha), a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after killing the previous one. Although he witnessed the burial of a treasure, he begins to lose his memory and the treasure map he gets becomes empty. So, Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (do you make an announcement for this?) And help lead a path to the treasure. It's amazing how someone could have funded this useless film. Former Goon Spike Milligan has replaced Medak as a director, and given Medak's talent in the movie The Ruling Class, you can probably guess which of the grainy and dimly lit scenes Milligan had in the director's chair. Peter Boyle makes a brief appearance in the first 10 minutes of the film as a condemned pirate captain. He is probably very grateful that Young Frankenstein was released the same year he was filmed and stored in a box, so he could keep this curriculum out. Franciosa looks as fascinating as the powerful power-behind-Scratcher, but he and the salesman both seem pretty desperate, with even Makeup and Sellers' hair looking pretty awful. They had to know that this movie was bombing even while they were filming it. With lines like these, I can understand every possible inconvenience: <br /> <br /> PIERRE: (is about to be hanged) You will pay for it. <br /> <br /> SCRATCHER: No, I won 't. I will do it for free. <br /> <br /> And this is one of the GOOD bars. It's amazing to me that much of the vendors' prolific material is still in the vaults, but this was made available on VHS more than 15 years ago! How about someone approaching the plate and publishing in the United States the well-acclaimed British television program "A Show Called Fred" starring Sellers, Milligan and directed by the great Richard Lester?
