No saving features, this film is rubbish. His jokes don't start to be funny. Humor for children is pathetic, and attempts to appeal to adults only add a tacky package to the whole miserable package. Sitting with my children just embarrassed me for what might be next. I could not enjoy the movie at all. Although my child for whom the DVD was purchased enjoyed the fact that he owned a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing her again, unlike Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc. receive frequent replay requests.
