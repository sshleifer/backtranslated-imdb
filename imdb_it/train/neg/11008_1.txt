I bought it at the tower registers after seeing the info-merchant fifteen hundred times in the central comedy. Actually, I couldn't wait to see it. My God where did I go wrong? Now before giving my review let me tell you that I am a person who can practically find the good in all the movies, hell I have over 1,500 DVDs! That said, the underground comedy film is placed there with the worst movie I've ever seen. I tried to give it a chance, but it wasn't just fun. It didn't make sense, it didn't offend what it was and it was all stupid. God who in their mind thought these shitty pieces were funny? this is going all the way to the bottom ...
