This is the kind of film that looks in silence with an open mouth, horrified, and yet continues to watch, hypnotized, as if watching a train in slow motion. And yet, in the back of your mind, thoughts are wavering: "Who on earth has lit this garbage?" <br /> <br /> Some of the users' previous comments say things like "A good way to introduce children to Laurel and Hardy" - an insult to children around the world. That children would need some sort of training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy a profound misunderstanding about the nature of children around the world. Others have commented on the fidelity of the characterizations of the two stars of Laurel and Hardy that I would like to answer: so WHAT? One might think that the eruption of the beloved BOMBS movie (Rocky and Bullwinkle, Avengers, Flipper, Mod Squad, Nausea) would teach Hollywood that there are some things that simply cannot be recreated. Laurel and Hardy's films are readily available on video: why worry about this? <br /> <br /> As for F. Murray Abraham, a good stage actor and screen ... well, all I can say is, he must have been in trouble with the IRS. <br /> <br /> Run, don't walk, away from the television if this garbage comes on!
