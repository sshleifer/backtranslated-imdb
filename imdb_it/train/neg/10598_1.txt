this is a piece of s-t !! this looks worse than a fact for t.v. movie. and I shoot to think that a sequel has also been considered and that the results ... the war is more beautiful than this. jean claude van shame has done it again and wonders why his career is where it is now. no script, no story and no time should be wasted on this. I meant that. 1 in 10 is too high, too high. Goldberg should be hammered for it. van shame is not an actor.
