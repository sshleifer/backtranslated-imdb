I'm sorry, I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to get my attention. When I realized that the whole movie was really just an older guy who was living his dream, I felt cheated. Surely it could be a device to take us to something deeper, something more meaningful. <br /> <br /> So don't buy a big drink or run to the rest room. Even my children didn't have fun. Ah well.
