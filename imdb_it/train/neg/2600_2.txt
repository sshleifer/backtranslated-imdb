Here we have a film that fails in almost every way that a film can fail. Terrible script, bad acting, amateur direction, laughable special effects ... it's just a terrible movie. Not to mention the fact that when you get to the end you will realize that it doesn't make sense. After spending the entire movie wondering what is happening in the world when things are finally explained, you realize that the story was built on a basis that is ridiculously impossible. In one of those horrible sequences of "villain explains the whole film" we are told that our villain has done something that simply cannot be done and that makes absolutely no sense. Oh, and then we see that it also looks like there's some kind of jell-o monster involved. I'm sure Drew Barrymore would very much like to pretend that this movie never happened. If for any unreflected reason you are ever tempted to sit and watch this movie, I suggest instead that you take that time to bang your head against a wall for 104 minutes. This would prove to be a much more pleasant experience than sitting through this junk.
