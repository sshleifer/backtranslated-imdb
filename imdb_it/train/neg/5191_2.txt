Ah, the boring t.v. shows and pilots that were beaten together in the 70s to make t.v. movie! Some examples would be Riding With Death (the most hysterical of the genre), Stranded in Space (confused and uninteresting), San Francisco International (horribly boring and incredibly confusing), and this turgid piece of charm by Quinn Martin. <br /> <br /> Shot in Hawaii (although you wouldn't know from outside shots), he is apparently a failed pilot for a spy show. The real problem is that you don't like most of the characters, including the gray main character Diamond Head, who seemed half asleep for the whole movie; his boss "Aunt Mary", who had a really strange delivery of his lines and flogged white hair and a tan that looked like it was stuccoed; Diamnd Head's girlfriend / colleague (hell, I can't even remember her name) a thin, wooden woman with a flat way of talking that isn't just sexy or interesting; and the singer Zulu (again, I don't remember the name of his character) who wasn't bad in small doses. The most interesting person in the whole production was Ian McShane, who sucked a bad boy, but he still showed his talent as an actor. Beyond the beauty works, this so-called "chameleon" used to dress up was simply ridiculous. I have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that made him dress up as a South American dictator and the American general. I don't care either. The plot simply wasn't interesting enough to get your attention for even ten minutes at a time, let alone for an hour and a half or so on. Just call this - Hawaii Five No!
