Not having read the novel, I can't say how faithful this film is. History is a typical mysterious material: the murderers are the newlyweds; woman investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal disease. Yes, it looks like a soap opera and it's exactly how it sounds. The first 2/3 are boring, except for the murders and the last 1/3 makes a partial comeback as it picks up speed towards its tortuous conclusion. <br /> <br /> Acting is strictly sub par, even if it is difficult to blame only the actors: the script is atrocious. During the last 1/3 stop noticing why the movie actually becomes interesting, but this is only the last 1/3. Director Russell Mulcahy is very much in his element, but there is only so much he can do with a television budget and the censorship network on his shoulders. He practically limited himself to the quick cut and distorted lenses, although he managed to slip into a couple of "under the floor" blows during the murders in the club bathroom. Unfortunately, since this is done for TV, the fantastic compositional details that it uses so well with a larger image are nowhere to be found. Note to producers: give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic goal when you hire him. <br /> <br /> In summary: this film is negative by film standards and mediocre by television standards (see CSI instead). If you're in the mood for a movie like this, I have some excellent suggestions: take a copy of "Deep Red" by Dario Argento (my highest recommendation, the superb film), "Opera", or even "Darkness". They are stronger in every category.
