Very low budget police procedural film on homicide investigators trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body shows up in a car stolen in Central Park, and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm. Although released by RKO, this has the appearance of an independent production that was taken over by the distribution studio. The cast and crew, with some exceptions - including Jack, the young and uncredited Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner - are composed of strangers and complete. The performances are universally comparable and would not pass to a high school film, the direction is heavy and uncertain and, as previously mentioned, there is no chemistry between the main actors. However, despite the film's many shortcomings, it has some positive points. The location location in New York City and the very low budget of the film give it a stark authenticity very similar to that of the far superior "The Naked City", a dark basement shootout is handled decently and some of the investigative procedures are smart Otherwise , it's not much to write at home. It is worth a look, however, to take a look at the busiest sections of New York in the early 1950s, and fans of old cars will be thrilled to see the car legions of the 1930s and 1940s in streets. > <br />.
