Another vast conspiracy film that seeks to blame the US government and the Armed Forces (especially the Army) for every disaster from the Great Flood. Anyone who has performed military service in the United States can see how fake this film is. Uniforms, equipment, ensembles and mannerisms are all wrong. (And, of course, all the senior officers are corrupt criminals or total idiots.) Widespread propaganda without any attempt at objectivity. Most of the theories presented have been refuted in recent years. Use all the clich√©s, rumors and the urban legend of the Gulf: all are presented as gospel. (The truth is that nobody knows for sure why some GW veterinarians are sick and others are healthy as horses). PS This is not new. The war is NOT fun and I know the veterinarians of World War II, Korea and Vietnam with some very serious problems. (And the government has a responsibility to take care of all of them). Sensational films like this won't solve the problem!
