Spoiler <br /> <br /> Well, the summary of a line says it all. "Le samurai" by Melville is the original and there are elements of "Leon". And they are better - much better! <br /> <br /> In "Samurai" Alain Delon is a solitary professional warrior / killer who keeps a bird in a cage and is stealing machines for his work (with so much suspense in these scenes!). Even the end is exactly the same: the samurai seeks death with dignity and is shot with an empty gun in his hand. The world has changed and realizes that there is no place for the samurai. <br /> <br /> Delon is not killing as many people as the Ghost dog. But I guess Jarmusch really liked Rodriguez's "Leon" or even "Desperado". So he added that too. And let me guess: will the girl become a professional like the Ghost dog (like Natalie Portman in "Leon")? <br /> <br /> So what was Jarmusch thinking after all? Where is the one, the original thought of this film? <br /> <br /> I don't see the point of making carbon (celluloid) copies. <br /> <br /> Rated 4/10 of Macaulay Connor
