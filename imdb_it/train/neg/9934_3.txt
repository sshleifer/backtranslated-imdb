As a casual Rolling Stones listener, I thought it might be interesting. Not so, since this film is very "of its age" in the 1960s. For me (someone born in the 80s) this seems to me simply a shit of purist hippy propaganda, but I'm sure this film was not made for me, but for people who were active during the 1960s. I was expecting drugs at will with the Stones, I was disappointed, in reality he showed real life, hard work in the studio, so much so that I seemed to work with them to reach a conclusion to this terrible film. I have not seen any other director of other films, but I suspect that they follow a similar style of directing, a sort of "amateur" who gave a sensation like the Eurotrash TV show, badly directed, melancholy and devoid of real entertainment value. My only good opinion of this is that I didn't waste money, it came free with a Sunday newspaper.
