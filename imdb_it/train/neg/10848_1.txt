By all accounts, this could have been an interesting film. With a soundtrack from the powerful Cradle Of Filth, with their frontman Dani and the role of "the future of British horror", I expected Alex Chandon's gore fest to live up to the hype. <br /> <br /> wrong. <br /> <br /> Everything about this film is either cliché or inept. The scenography of the anthology of the stories was made to death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. Of course, the idea of ​​"the sick room" sent a shiver down my spine, but like most of the film, he was disappointed by bad screenplays and scripts. <br /> <br /> Chandon cannot write dialogues. Every sentence with the main police investigator is full of curses and insolence (the typical "cop on the edge" formula. Funny, I'm sure I've seen it somewhere else before ...) No Chandon, you're not Tarantino. O Scorsese. It looks bad. Add to act ridiculously with a very dubious cast (don't get me wrong, Dani Filth is a great singer and musician, but he is not an actor) and the performances are extremely ridiculous up to the vein that makes one shudder. Give me Bruce Campbell every day. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are poor overall, with some atrocious CGI, horrific effects of gore (for God's sake, Peter Jackson has done better and this was over ten years ago with less budget) and change the filters that scream OVER-USE! As for the often obscured use of the Cradle Of Filth score ... man, they should sue. <br /> <br /> The fundamental problem with Cradle Of Fear is that it takes itself seriously, trying to create atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience. too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do it much better with far superior gore effects (eg maniac, zombie carnivores, the afterlife, suspiria etc.), making Cradle of Fear, in my opinion, second-hand obsolete. <br /> <br /> I hope Chandon can learn from this horrible movie ghoul and go on to do some quality horror that really scares. <br /> <br /> Better next time.
