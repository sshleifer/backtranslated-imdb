The film begins with the people on Earth discovering that their rocket on Mars had not been lost, but was simply drifting into space near the planet. When recovered, one of the crew members is sick, one is alive and the other two are missing. What happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving member. <br /> <br /> While on Mars, the crew was apparently attacked by a multitude of senseless-eyed monsters. Strangely, while the sets were pretty good, the monsters were some of the silliest I've seen on the film. Furthermore, in a strange attempt at realism, the production used a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, this wonderful innovation made the film quite cheap when it was on the surface of Mars And the intensity of the redness practically made my eyes bleed - it was SO bad! Despite all the cheese, the film had a rather interesting storyline and a good message about space travel. For lovers of the genre, it's worth seeing. For others, you may simply find the whole thing rather silly - see for yourself and decide. <br /> <br /> While by today's standards this is not a particularly good science fiction film, compared to films made at the time, it accumulates quite well. <br /> <br /> PS - When you watch the movie, pay close attention to Dr. Tremayne. It looks like Dr. Quest's spitting image from the "Jonny Quest" comic! He also plays and performs a lot.
