Do you remember the chain-smoking channel displayed on 60 minutes a few years ago? This is her. Many people reviewed this film without checking the good faith of the directors. The producers have successfully used fake word-of-mouth promotions without revealing the financial and philosophical basis for this piece of marketing tripe. If you believe in channeling, reincarnation, a new era and a day baloney, this movie is for you. If you want a discussion on quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this film is to convince you that Ramtha is not a wacko, so you will give her a lot of money. If you can tiptoe through Ramtha's website without incredulous howling, then perhaps you will think that the dollars you left on this infomercial for madness were well spent. <Http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
