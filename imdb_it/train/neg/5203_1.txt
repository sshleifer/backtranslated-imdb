I've seen poor movies in my time, but this really takes the biscuit! Why oh, why was this film made? There's really nothing here. Please rely on me, touch the shutdown switch and destroy your copy of this movie. There is a plot ... which could take about 5 minutes to show on the camera. This is the key problem, the story 'based on a true story' (mmm ... whatever) is in no way liable to be completed for 80 minutes. So, then, we have to sit for over an hour watching people walk around. It is so! Absolutely nothing happens in the first half hour, apart from looking at someone walking in a shop ... and then 3 guys walking through a forest. Maybe this time it was spent on character development ... but no. And so there is absolutely no connection with the people on the screen, so when they start shooting, we don't care less! In fact, in the end I was the guarantor for the villain so the film would be finished! Moreover, working with the camera is really horrible! This director / editor / producer / producer, Ti West is lousy. I hate hitting a guy, but actually, his job is pants! These insignificant close-ups continue, and then the long single follows people as they walk - I'm sure he thinks he's smart, but the results are so boring that I just wanted to stop the movie and cut my wrists! How this man was led to direct the next cabin fever movie is beyond me! Finally, acting is also painful, ... which is true for the film as a whole. Keep your sanity, avoid this pile of total excrement!
