This film is exactly what you get when you've really stretched your skills, it's like someone who has just passed the driving test and scored them in a Formula 1 Grand Prix (I could not add, the US Grand Prix since everyone could pull out because of tiresome tires and you could just win), this is how the film falls. Now I don't do it the wrong way, I love B-Movies, about half of my collection is made up of B-Movies, but I don't think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how ugly this movie is. <Br /> <br /> The first of the story (for a B-Movie) is not so bad, it has the potential to create a B-Movie brand, they didn't talk about the potential of 13th Friday, but the potential is not from less. But what really leaves this film to be desired is acting, in no second I think, is like watching QVC, except that QVC presenters tend to have a heavier tan. <br /> <br /> In summary I'd like to say that I've seen worse movies, but I can't.
