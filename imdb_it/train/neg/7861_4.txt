The premise of this expected follow-up was really good and after the huge success of the remake I was expecting very sincerely. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this film is really absurd and inept. Situations are stupid and beyond reason and acting is really terrible. <br /> <br /> This time there are no nice characters or violins unlike the remake. Furthermore, the blood is not so abundant and when it happens it is really bad. <br /> <br /> Violence is minimal and it's a shame because there are many arguments that make you think there is room for heavy violence. I mean, there's a SWAT team chasing a family of cannibal mutants. You certainly expect something different! When I looked at it in the cinema, I wanted to get my money back. <br /> <br /> However, this is a clear example of how rushed films turn out to be a disaster and show poor quality in all respects. <br /> <br /> A mess that disappointed fans of the remake like me. That's why the sequels are never accepted; at least this film is not as terrible as the 1985 sequel to the original.
