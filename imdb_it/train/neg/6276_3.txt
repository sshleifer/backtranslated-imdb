THE BROKEN is part of the After Dark Horrorfest III. Not a slasher or full of blood. Lots of broken glass and mirrors in this angular French thriller and writer / director Sean Ellis. A successful radiologist Gina McVay (Lena Headly) intersects a strange world while her life seems out of control. While attending his father's (Richard Jenkins) birthday party, guests are stunned when a mirror crashes to the floor for no obvious reason. Things get really weird when you witness a woman who is the spitting image of herself that travels a street in London in a car identical to hers. Gina sneaks into her doppelganger's apartment and finds a photo of herself with her father. He walks away and is involved in a collision head. So mysteriously her boyfriend is not the same; to be precise, family and friends are not easy to trust. Is Gina out of her mind? Are you in a parallel world? His nightmares become more horrible ... is she broken? <br /> <br /> Congratulations if you can understand it ... it won't be easy. The change could not be narrower. Lighting is questionable. Other players: Melvil Poupard, William Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
