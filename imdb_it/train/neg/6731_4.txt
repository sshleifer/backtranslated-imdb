Unlike another reviewer, I think this is written OK, especially more imaginary, because more imagination would be needed; and he played well, because there were no other characters with whom to share the attention of these monologues of dozens of minutes and more, well done. But I am not merely entertained by such solemn and devoted memories. Each has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others. Everyone has problems and some are more intense than others. These are just ten stories and problems that are not very atypical, which exemplify how the life of someone (or part of it) is fodder by film. Then again, I think badly about TV reality shows. So if that's your bag, you might like it. It's the kind of thing that would make good phone and / or Internet gossip; but absolutely without other verbal action. And, although each of the speakers is female, I will leave the genre out of this.
