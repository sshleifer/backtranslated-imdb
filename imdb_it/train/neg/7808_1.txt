I'm a big fan of Michael Madsen, so needless to say I bought this film without even renting it or anything ... This movie was so horrible, I didn't even take it to the store, I wouldn't want anyone else to submit to this human poison I just threw it in the trash, no matter the money, it was worth the price to be able to throw it away. The acting wasn't so bad, it wasn't good or anything. The story was horrible and the ending was something I despised. He was a broken, alcoholic man. his life was a pile of garbage. I thought his horse, peanuts, was a horrible tool to show his childish innocence, a dog would have been much better. I also hate religion, so this ending undoubtedly made me angry. Jesus heals everything ... I hate that I know people like this who are huge Christians and Catholics, and time will show that God does not cure everything or anything. It was a horrible movie, if you have the chance to see it, pass it, or better yet buy it, or rent it, and throw it in the garbage, and leave the coffee grounds on it in the morning
