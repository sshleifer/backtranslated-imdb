Fiction movie (lists as based on a story even though it has a "documented credit") on a group of scientists going to the wilds of Canada to try to find a Bigfoot. (They want to catch one and then attach a device tracking). His scientific jumbo mumbo blends into what is really a boring movie about a group of people wandering in the desert. There are some attempts to create tension and fear, but to be honest there is nothing worth seeing outside of some beautiful shots of wildlife. This is a perfect definition of an exploitative film, it promises you so much, a look at Bigfoot, but in reality it offers very little. Recommended for insomniacs only
