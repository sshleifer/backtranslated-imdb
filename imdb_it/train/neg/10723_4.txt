The soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he can punish anyone involved in the desecration of his tomb. The transference of the soul causes the young to grow old at a tremendous rate until he himself looks like a mummy. One after another, the blood is drained by those involved in the excavation. <br /> <br /> To be as short as possible, the Curse of the Pharaoh is a rather weak thing. While the film presents some good original ideas (blood that sucks mummy, transference of the soul, interesting makeup effects, scene of arm tears, etc.) And some atmospheric moments, direction and rhythm are the true definition of arrangement. To make matters worse, the film's first 15 relatively short 66 minute runtimes consist of nothing more than filling. I usually go for these slowly moving mummy films, but Pharaoh's Curse also tests my patients. The cast helps very little. With one exception (Ziva Rodann is the only bright spot that wants the film to focus more on its mysterious character), the cast is as boring as the script. Finally, I don't know whose idea it was to put the mummy-like servant in what appears to be pajamas, but it's ridiculous and ridiculous for a creature that should inspire fear in the public. <br /> <br /> Despite my mostly negative comments about Faraone's Curse, I will evaluate a 4/10. It is not a good evaluation, but generous given all the problems I have with the film.
