And perhaps, as Fred Sandford said, "one through the lips". That to those who have published this film about an unsuspecting public. And perhaps to the person of "Rue Morgue" who called this "Fender Hellbender" and said it was good. <br /> <br /> Five girls, apparently in a secondary school house, get lost and stop to ask directions in some small shop in the middle of nowhere. While there the driver accidentally hits a parked SUV and puts out a lighthouse, but all the girls decide to leave and not go looking for the driver. But the driver comes to look for them, and it's not just that the headlights on his vehicle have softened, it's for another reason that the girls don't understand yet. When the driver first takes them, she (yes, it's a she) wields a gun and makes them undress, and continues to scream at them, "how much have you seen?". Obviously the girls are scared to death and don't know what they're talking about. <br /> <br /> As the night runs on the girls end up in a game of cats and mice with the SUV driver, who runs inflict all kinds of injuries on the girls, who are remarkably resilient to shoot gunshots and screwdrivers where they didn't want them. Eventually they come to discover that something happened in that store after they left and this is the reason for this woman's psychotic anger. And in the end they have a chance for revenge and take as much as possible. <br /> <br /> There are elements of this film that are quite disturbing and scary, but unfortunately those moments are undermined by bad acting, bad dialogue and huge credibility errors. A girl is shot and seems to be mortally wounded, and feels cold, her life passes before her eyes, but has she improved? And how far can a minivan run on an almost empty tank at a speed of 80 miles per hour? I need one of those things, apparently it gets great mileage. <br /> <br /> There had to be an ending when the girls took their revenge, but the movie goes on a bit later, which is an anti-climax, but at least they learn something of what drives the woman, and the driver he is still worried about "messing up his mother's van", which is obviously the least of anyone's concerns. <br /> <br /> So this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's too amateur to be good and even a little too scary and macabre sometimes to be completely terrible. But it takes the cake for a lot of acute hysteria and you would like to put two ears on it if you look at it. Which, by the way, I don't necessarily recommend. 4 out of 10.
