This acts as a satire during the era of the women's rights movement. Of course, this does not mean that COACH (the film) is a wonderful experience to see. It corresponds to the same style as FASTBREAK (which was better, but still domesticated), and is basically a typical stuff. What I mean by this uninteresting film is easy to recognize. Anyone who offers time for a normal job training a group of madmen to earn a sudden victory is a waste. It's the same feeling you might have after seeing this. A nice attempt to choose the opposite sex for a man's duty, but I expected better things.
