The problem that I find with this title is that I'm not sure the director is trying to produce a documentary or a film. A mixture of the two genders does not work and this leaves everything suspended in the middle of nowhere. This is more true as the director has chosen the most extreme aspects of what should happen in everyday life, making it an unconvincing documentary. If it is thought to be a thriller / drama this is too boring and monotonous. In both cases, what is the moral or message that the director is trying to convey to the public? That there are people around us who abuse others who are willing to be abused? That there are many lunatic lunatics around us? So so what?
