Some unrealistic movie spoilers included. <br /> <br /> From real life experiences, this film has continued to disappoint from the start. I am currently deployed on my second tour of Iraq as an infantry man. This film has nothing close to what would happen in real life events. From the beginning, just to name a few: the bomb cart, the elements of the EOD that rolled by themselves without an escort, the EOD staff sergeant who sneaked into VBC, with sleeves rolled all the time in ACU where I had to call him to come out on my $ 2 haji copy, the sniper scene. The list would continue, however, it is not necessary to list the wrong things that occur with a time interval of 2 minutes before other things were not correct; and the point was made. <br /> <br /> This film is for people and critics to watch who have no understanding or experience with sides or soldiers. <br /> <br /> People with military experience or military knowledge will be disappointed by the inaccuracy.
