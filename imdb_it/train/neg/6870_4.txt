A well-intentioned film about Sonja Horowitz (Ren√©e Zellweger), wife of the devoted Talmudic scholar Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). who is deeply unhappy. Mendel's brother Sender (Christopher Eccleston) sees him and hires her to work in the field where she is already an expert jeweler. He also begins a relationship with her, and then when he spends time with a Puerto Rican artist, he unloads her and betrays her with his family, who turns her off. There is a subplot in which Sonja's dead brother speaks to her, and apparently takes the form of a magical beggar woman, but because it is not clear. Unfortunately, much is not clear, including what is happening with Sonja, because she tells the Rebbe that there is a fire within her and maybe it is not from God, and what it means, and what the magic beggar woman means. To a certain extent, history touches on the plight of women in the ultra-Orthodox community, yet Sonja is not exactly liberated. Nor is the notion of being redeemed by the love of a man of another race very well thought out. The title derives from the biblical definition of the value of a good woman ?? and yet it is the bastard Sender who quotes him to Sonja. Zellweger fights with the part; she should be a Jew from the Midwest and sometimes her accent is flat, and at other times she is taken by the characteristic sounds of Brooklyn. It's at its best when it's tough and takes the lead, but in the end the film is a disaster.
