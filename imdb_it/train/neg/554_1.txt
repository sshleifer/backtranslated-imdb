This movie is terrible. The script is ugly, the script is mediocre and even the sex scenes are useless. The thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking. This film was shot in a dark, dark and monochromatic style (in the "War of the Worlds"), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film. Greg Morrisey's thoughtful character shows a facial expression throughout the film. The twists of the original plot are sadly missing here; the few that exist are simply anti-climatic. The only highlight is Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell, faithfully continued in this sequel, but it is not enough to compensate for the other shortcomings. The only circumstance under which a "Basic Instinct 3" should be done would be if Michael Douglas agreed to join the cast.
