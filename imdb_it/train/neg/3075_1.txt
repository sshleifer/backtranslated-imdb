Yes .. this is definitely there with some of the worst of the MSTifyed movies, but I've definitely seen worse. He thinks Gremlins has voted for R. Well, anyway, I met Rick Sloane at some science fiction convention, which was incredibly doing lectures! It was one of those low budget conventions, where everything goes, someone brought something (if you want to see crap, you should see what some friends and I have brought). <br /> <br /> he seemed like a very nice guy, he was very kind to my questions and comments about Hobgoblin, and he also told me not to take it seriously and said he loved the MST3K version! <br /> <br /> All in all, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think he was doomed to Mars Attacks. So I imagine being up for this movie and giving it a 5, and betraying all my MST friends. Sorry guys.
