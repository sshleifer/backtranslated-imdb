I don't think they made this film. Completely useless The first movie was fine. But there was no need for a sequel, certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film. This film looks like a soap opera. The writing is so ugly, it's absolutely simple. The jokes don't meet, the acting is flat, you shoot like a soap, you miss any direction. The first film had a nice emotional backbone behind. Each character had a small bow. It was very simple, but somehow it worked and I could see the merit of that movie. But this time there is no coherent plot. The characters are boring stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. A good thing: the Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire's son is pretty well done. This was their only moment of creative success in this film. I heard that they have already shot a second television series as a sequel to "Team Spirit 2" but please God, don't let them make a third episode ...
