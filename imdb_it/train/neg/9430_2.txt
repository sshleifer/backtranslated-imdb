I too have been deceived by the packaging. I, too, fell in love with the bloody packaging and the DVD wrapper that says "avid fans because every copy was pulled from the shelves". Although it was inexpensive ($ 6.99), it wasn't really worth it - no fear and very limited gore. The finish was very rough and did not provide the punch it should have. I really don't even know how it became a "Nasty Video" with how very docile it is. The plot draws, the characters are obvious amateur actors ... it does not live up to the promise. The DVD bonus feature ("the interview") is very strange because the director appears very inconsistent and not all there. The lead actress speaks as if she were appearing in a Shakespearean production. It's a good laugh.
