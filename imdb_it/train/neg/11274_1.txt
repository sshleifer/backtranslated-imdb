In order for your film fan friends to have the credit for this film, I decided to write another review. I lost some things last time ... <br /> <br /> First, the script. Secondly, acting. Third, Jesus Christ, what were they thinking of doing a piece of garbage like this and then expecting us to enjoy ourselves when there are no saving features of any kind from beginning to end except when Joseph Fiennes is finally wiped out in a very climax exciting !!! <br /> <br /> I can't believe I wasted my money on this when I could give it to a homeless or a busker or SOMETHING! <br /> <br /> Are you getting the image?
