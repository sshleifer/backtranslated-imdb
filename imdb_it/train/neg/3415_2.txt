In the standard view, this is a purely horrible film. However, consider a near-perfect score on the scale of unintended comedy. I can think of a few real comedies that make me laugh as much as I've seen this movie. The ghost of Andy Griffith dressed in American Indian clothes sends me into hysterics every time. I wouldn't want to waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it, but if you happen to lie on the couch at 3 am and get on TV, take a look.
