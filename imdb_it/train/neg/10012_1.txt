This film must be online for the most boring film in years. Not even the woody Harrison can save this film from sinking to the bottom. <br /> <br /> The murder in this film should be the point of interest in this film, but it is not, nothing is of any interest. The cast is not bad but the script is just awful, I simply marveled during this film, thinking about how anyone can find this movie funny <br /> <br /> The producers of this film were very intelligent. They made a boring movie, but they hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses in their cast. People will go to the blockbuster and will probably see this movie and think, Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe this must be good and rent this movie. (Boy am I in a horrible weather) <br /> <br /> If you like being ripped off and renting this movie, some people have really enjoyed this movie, but I like watching a movie with a meaning
