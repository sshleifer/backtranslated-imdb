'61 CLASS <br /> <br /> Format: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> In 1861, the members of the West Point Academy class are torn out apart from the outbreak of the Civil War. <br /> <br /> The dramatic historical drama of Gregory Hoblit makes an obvious point: the virtuous men are blinded by the conflict - even if the production seems a little rigged, despite the authentic details of the period and a cast of talented newcomers (Clive Owen, Christien Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher, Laura Linney, etc.), with Dan Futterman as a southern conscious who takes up arms in defense of slavery, putting him in direct conflict with his former friends from the North. The film's emphasis on such an unfortunate, though likeable, character is particularly brave, but the drama is otherwise flat and superficial, and Hoblit's direction is more efficient than inspired.
