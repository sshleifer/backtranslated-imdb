This is not one of the best films of Arbuckle or Keaton, that's for sure. Fatty's wife is tired of all her heavy drinking, so she takes him to a sanatorium where a psychiatrist (Keaton) claims to have a guaranteed cure! Well, once there, Arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and is taken to the operating room. Then, he runs away and is chased to the place where he meets a pretty girl who also wants to escape. Eventually, despite the pursuing personnel, they flee to that point it becomes evident that the girl is mad and Arbuckle is soon regained. However, he wakes up and everything after the surgery was all a dream - there was not a crazy sexy girl and Dr. Keaton is not a great incompetent as he seemed in the dream. <br /> <br /> A lack of humor is the biggest problem with the film. Of course, teasing the mentally ill is pretty low, but laughter was guaranteed in his time. I'd also like to laugh, if there was just something fun to answer! A lot of energy and that's it. <br /> <br /> FYI - during one of the tracking sequences, Fatty asks for a race for men of over 200 pounds (wow, what are the odds?). And, a little later, he finds himself in a post where the number 5 has just been painted. As a result, the five is now on the back of Fatty's shirt and looks like a regular participant. HOWEVER, the number SHOULD have appeared backwards on Fatty's shirt, but it came out in the front row - a mistake, since they should have understood that the mirror image would be a retreat 5.
