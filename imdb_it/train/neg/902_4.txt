I suppose this film has relevance today because it was one of the first films of Sofia Loren. He was 19 when the film was made in 1953. I saw this film because I wanted to see some of the early works of Sofia Loren. I was surprised when she came in the car with her tanned skin in brown makeup to look like an Ethiopian princess. Surely, today, this would have been seen as an insult and to be avoided in the creation of a film. In fact, it became annoying to look at Mrs Loren with the leather-colored paint throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Yes, this film would have been made better if the real opera singers had made this film. Thus, the singing and actual facial gestures of true artists would have been obvious. They discount the comments of others on the fact that the true opera singers are older and heavier. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as Mrs. Loren at the age of 19 and still is today, the film would have been better received as though it were performed on stage. After all, we don't see beautiful young men on stage with "old opera singers" singing backstage! Do not underestimate the success of the use of heavy-weight opera singers. It is enough to refer to the most artistically produced TV commercial for the J. G. Wentworth Company, with opera singers on stage who so professionally sing the praises of the company's product. This is one of the best and fun TV commercials to date. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film's printing also makes this production slightly inferior in quality. Color ink has faded a lot and this cannot be helped. <br /> <br /> To improve this film on DVD, the production company should add subtitles in English so that we, who do not speak Italian, can know what the lyrics are saying. It would help the story and teach it more than the narrator who offers 30 seconds of introduction to the scenes. <br /> <br /> Watch this film not because of Aida's story, nor because this is an opera. Apart from Ms. Sofia Loren, none of her co-actors is known or remembered by this writer. Instead, watch this movie if you're a Mrs. Loren fan and want to see her at age 19 - no matter what the production is. <br /> <br /> Larry from Illinois
