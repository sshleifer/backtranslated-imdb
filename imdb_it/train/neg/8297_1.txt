Ugh! Where to start ... first of all, the relentless anguish of Campbell Scott becomes a real starting point after a while (very little) while he internalizes his growing anxiety, curiosity and anger. Only we don't care! These characters presented by the writer and the director are completely unlikely, and here is the key. They gave us nothing to make us worry if they are adulterers and if they are still in love with each other. When Scott quietly tells his wife "I could kill you" in front of their three daughters at the table, after the shock of his bad selfishness vanished, I almost wished he had - and then did the same thing to the smug, joking appearance of Denis Leary before being dragged out of the jackal. A total waste of time and maybe - just maybe - resources.
