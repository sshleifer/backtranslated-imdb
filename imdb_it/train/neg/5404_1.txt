Have you ever had the itch to kill just an hour or two by doing chores and watching a movie so bad that you are not right? Well, by renting movies one weekend I see the art box for this and I see the T-Rex. Knowing perfectly that the dinosaur on the package was the T-Rex of Jurassic Park, I knew I had to rent this because I was in the mood for a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed the minimum. <br /> <br /> Mad scientists, secret formulas, a company more concerned about its fortune and shareholders than for lives and, of course, a great T-Rex, a puppet puppet and not very animated. Are I ours through the film there were scenes clearly implanted by other films? Not to mention the hunger of the Rex is never satisfied ... ever. How hungry he is beyond me because he really has no throat (Really if you look down at his mouth when he roars, he's solid ... like a toy or something). Now, I like to watch incredibly ugly B-Movies from time to time because it reminds me of how great a hit movie is. This was fun. I'm not even sure if this should have been a thriller or a comedy, because there are scenes where, to avoid mistakes, you'll laugh. <br /> <br /> I blame the film's budget ... yes, but acting wasn't helpful either. OK, Tony Todd was actually pretty good, as for some of the female roles ... when you cry shouldn't "tears" come out? Meh, I won't be angry with this movie, I knew what I was getting into and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here's what I recommend: watch this movie, then watch Jurassic Park immediately and then Lost World back to back. The following day you will write to Mr. Spielberg a letter of thanks.
