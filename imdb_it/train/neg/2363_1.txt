This film was simply terrible, the first film was not fantastic, I mean it's ridiculously stupid if they didn't have enough with the first 5 movies you had to add another, why not turn it into an unbroken series like James Bond, I'll tell you exactly because, because bond films are actually very very good and these films stink, I don't understand, this had to be a cross between genres like horror and the comedy for the goodness of my 1-year-old son the niece wouldn't be scared of so ridiculous attempt at horror, a spit in the face of people who at least want to be scared at some point in a so-called horror movie. Please no more of these films.
