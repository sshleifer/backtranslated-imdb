There is only one thing I have to say about this film - the scene in which Shaq is in a musical number with the character of Francis Capra on wanting to be a genius; never see this movie. The story is horrible, the acting is terrible (come on, it's Shaq!) And I'd rather see Capra in Free Willy (just as horrible) twice before seeing this movie.
