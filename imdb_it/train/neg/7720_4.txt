There are not enough gay themed movies and there are not enough "coming out" movies. Each is a welcome addition to the genre. Although the production values ​​are high (the film looks "nice", Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks REAL REAL in a pair of jeans) this is a bad one. It's a piece of history: gay life under an oppressive regime (East Berlin, 1989) a life that seems 40 years behind the west. In a way we are seeing our history; what it would have been like for gays in the 40s and 50s here (it often reminded me of `Last exit in Brooklyn: the book not the film). But it's incredibly depressing and SLOW in an invented way that evoked an old sending of SCTV on Ingmar Bergman. It is so modified that I wonder if the director did not model casually. Yes, it's a miracle that this was filmed and published before The Wall came down and yes, the life behind the "Curtain" was hard for gay people. A good director could have shown all this without surprising the audience. A good director would have made me mark this as one of the great emerging films and not one of the two.
