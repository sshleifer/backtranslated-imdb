A lukewarm attempt to bring Elvis Presley to the present day, but despite a sexy scene and a sub-plot of a pseudo-Playboy magazine, Presley is surrounded by the same old timid, winking at clich√©s. A woman chooses E.P. on the beach and then continues to take over his life - and he doesn't seem to care! Dick Sargent is grueling in another sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Strive like Elvis' two bosses (he's in the moonlight, see). Some of the songs are pretty good, especially "Almost in Love", but if you want to see a more flexible, hipper, up to date Elvis sex comedy - look elsewhere. When Elvis and his fatal Attraction sleep together, there's actually a wooden board between them! Come back down to earth. ** from ****
