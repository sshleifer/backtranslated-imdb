This film is "compelling" but in much the same way that a car accident is compelling. It's hard to look away. Overall, this film is nothing but an incredibly irresponsible social experiment - and a futile and partial experiment to that. The filmmakers are manipulative and seem to have no problem going to the lowest denominator possible. The way the money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation. The intermediate steps that the filmmakers force Ted to participate (meeting with so-called experts) were empty and lacking any substantial attempt to connect with Ted. Instead, it is painfully obvious that they serve to cover the background of the director and further exploit Ted's situation. The worst part is that the directors stop following Ted after 6 months; and apparently they are completely excluded from the subject they had followed so close months before. If they had cared, they would have found better "experts" to help Ted. If they really wanted to see what Ted would do, then they would have to let him spend the money without intervention. This film is Jackass's best feat at best and not a documentary. It is sad to think of how many $ 100,000 could actually have changed a homeless's life if he had been put in the right hands.
