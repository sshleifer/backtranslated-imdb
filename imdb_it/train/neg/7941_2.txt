As the 2000s closed, King Kong's adopted daughter went ahead and made a tearful announcement as her show was ending. <br /> <br /> While Miss Winfrey was tearing herself to pieces, I laughed and screamed like a wild Indian from the old west. <br /> <br /> So what does Oprah do? she takes famous people and puts them in her show. what kind of celebrities? people who have suffered (just like her, except that these people have lost more than their virginity) have suffered loose faces (true history), missing arts (the real story, see the end of the paragraph) and spousal abuse (too many to count) . and somehow they come on the show and tell their story, as if we hadn't heard it before tons and tons of times (Bethany Hamilton, I heard your story about losing an arm to a shark from day one, which was October 31st, 2003. don't tell me you have no wish). But probably the most important thing about Oprah was the 1993 Michael Jackson interview, after being accused of being a child molester. unfortunately, Mr. Jackson has died since then. but that particular show told of Michael's personal life, something that at that time they didn't know about many people. <br /> <br /> Oprah's real influence comes from middle-aged women and soccer moms. They seem to think that sometimes it is like a personal Jesus. but all I see in Oprah is a great lady of the ghetto who made her great, and is only showing how rich she is. <br /> <br /> I'm glad your shows end soon. we need better television programs.
