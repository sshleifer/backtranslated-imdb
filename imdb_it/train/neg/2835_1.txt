The Dereks seemed to have trouble finding rolls for Bo after "10". <br /> <br /> I worked for a marine park in the Florida Keys. One day, the script of "Ghosts Can not Do It" was circulating among trainers in the "fish house" where dolphin food was being prepared. There was a scene where a -dolphin- presumably proposes Bo (or Bo the dolphin), asking to "lay eggs". Reading the script, we have -lauuughed -... <br /> <br /> We didn't end up doing any part of this movie in our facility, even though our dolphins - they were - in "The Big Blue!" <Br /> <br /> This must have been very close to the end of Anthony Quinn's life. I hope he enjoyed this film because he certainly didn't do anything for his legacy.
