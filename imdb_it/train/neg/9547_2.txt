A video game that looks below the average turns into a sort of conspiracy to make the next terrorist discover in the courtyard of the United States. Welcome to the madness of low-cost movies directed at videos. It is full of unnamed actors and actresses with a little precious plot. <br /> <br /> However, this strange game goes on and our "hero" bets real money and does good. It's a bit like gambling, except that the part of gambling has disappeared and sucks. Instead it is an online game with little real value and you get authority on your queue if you do good. <br /> <br /> What makes it even more strange is that two strange computer programs clash in some way and everything is saved in the end. I will leave the viewer to see how all this will come about. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not even worth paying a $ 1 rent. Borrow it, please. "D-"
