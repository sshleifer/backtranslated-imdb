A warning to potential spectators: if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story "The Most Dangerous Game", look elsewhere. "Seven women for Satan" <br /> <br /> only superficially deals with the original work using the name of Zaroff and having said people who kill characters. <br /> <br /> Some of the following things may be considered by some to be spoilers. Or not. <br /> <br /> Boris Zaroff is played by writer / director Michel Lemoine. While his ancestor hunted men because they were the only prey that was really demanding, Boris's victims are usually in a position where they can't defend themselves. The film flows from one scene to another with an almost total lack of clarity. The director seems to have a totally disinterested rhythm and has left the viewer with a stiflingly boring film. Some individual scenes are slightly interesting (like a torture sequence), but as a unit, the film fails to entertain. Spectators who are more interested in an assortment of attractive and semi-attractive actresses in various stages of undressing may find the film watchable. Most will probably find that their time is better spent watching Mentos commercials. <br /> <br /> In a side note, the extras on DVD included a good deal of information on the history of the film. Apparently, he was banned for several years in his native France, which virtually ruined every possibility of widespread distribution.
