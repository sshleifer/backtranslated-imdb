actually, it was pretty funny ... in a "god, how the hell this movie was made" in a sense. if you take your life making fun of movies ... what I do ... go ahead and look at it ... but if you're really thinking "is this a good movie?" this film sucked the scene from the beginning with the worst acting I've ever seen in a movie ... usually it takes five minutes before you realize that "this movie could suck" .. but no, the you know right away. this film is about Edgar Allen Poe ... I never tried to explain it, however, to people who didn't memorize the story of Poe's life ... so I don't know if any of what was said is a fact. <br /> <This film is about an "ethan poe" writer who allies with his cousin "ann" ... they are both descendants of Edgar Allan Poe ... or are they?!? apparently, people give what their ancestors did. this ethan poe guy is actually etan "usher", which should be descended from the "usher house" story which was written by Edgar Allen Poe. Ann's brother sometimes shows up to try to rape her ... Ann is also persecuted, at one point in the film, by three different people in the same street (seriously, three ... they are like behind her that the they look straight and she doesn't even realize). the characters that are killed in everything, come to the end to try to save the day .... but they can't. in the end, ann shoots ethan while he's trying to kill his best friend. of course, before you shoot him he must shout "never again!" this film should never be seen again!
