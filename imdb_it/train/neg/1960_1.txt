I tried to finish this movie three times, but it's terrible. Case in point: mother and daughter drive up to the bed and breakfast, the mother stops for the gas, the crazy crazy people at the gas station are crazy about her husband whose B & B tries to rape her. She runs away, heads for the B & B and instead of going around the ballistic sea and she wants to call the police, the story continues with lukewarm behavior on both sides. Wow. <br /> <br /> Other deficits in the logic of action abound. Even acting is lukewarm, and the neighbor's next-door warning is delivered at a very banal and misinterpreted time. <br /> <br /> Moments of intense violence / death woven unevenly with tepid scenes of interaction between full-time characters. <br /> <br /> Less attention to blood, more attention to mood and history would have been appreciated.
