What's the point of creating sequels that have absolutely no relevance for the original film? No point. This is why the Prom Night sequels are so embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The original film included a group of children who hid a dark secret that eventually killed them all, except one, in a brutal act of revenge. Can anyone explain to me how a promising future promise will rise from the grave to the steel that the crown has to do with the first movie? Dance night 2 had continuous plot holes that left the public constantly wondering how it happened and why it should happen? But in the end, I guess you can call it one of those movies that is so ugly, you end up laughing through it.
