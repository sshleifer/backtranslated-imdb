Actually I felt bad for the actors in this thing. No doubt a school acting class could do a better job or at least a job. The actors must have thought that this would be their big chance when working in a film, certainly it wasn't. In addition to the terrible acting, the stories were boring and for the most part predictable. The one on the remote didn't even make sense. For a bad cause he had the best premise of the group. <br /> <br /> I'm all for supporting low-budget films and giving new directors a good chance, but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer. I've only seen it because of some good comments posted here. They must have been planted by people with ties to the film. You can fool people into watching this, but you can't fool them at what they saw. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 2 instead of a 1 because at least the boxer's story tried to warm the heart. Of course, he failed miserably, but he tried. I reserve 1 s for the worst of the worst. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip this dribble. I would like to have.
