I don't like this film, but then I didn't think much about the book which, although praised by many as a "masterpiece", I found lacking in character development and in the disjointed and illogical plot, although it was much more readable than the terrible first attempt at "Road to Los Angeles" infantry not published until Fante became fashionable in the mid-80s. I was curious to see what kind of Towne soup would be made with such lean ingredients. He worked hard to restore the many flaws in the book, but my money didn't save him. There has never been a movie in Ask the Dust, while he has always tried to remain faithful to the book. I consider this film Towne's folly. <br /> <br /> In a word: forgettable.
