I just saw this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is here), and I have to say that I wasn't happy. <br /> <br /> Of course, the computer graphics were surprising, but the plot needed a little tweaking. Also, I think this film would have done much better with more curses and blood, even if it had been classified as PG-13. <br /> <br /> This would certainly attract more people to see it -> teenagers. What would attract even more teenagers (especially teenage girls) would be a great success for Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster! <br /> <br /> Even if the film had critical points, I still saw it and thought it was good!
