If someone really wants to make a film, REALLY bad, "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" really establishes a yardstick with which to measure the depth of evil. <br /> <br /> Start with the pseudo-Chewbacca that follows around the main character ... A poor schmuck in a large "hairy" white costume that seems to be sewn together with pieces of discarded carpet. Work slowly, painfully, through other effects not so special that completely negate the viewer from the suspension of disbelief. Add a garden gnome (just for the fun of it). <br /> <br /> Come to think of it, skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half.
