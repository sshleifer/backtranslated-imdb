As a premise, this backwood version of the Dead Calm plot was promising. <br /> <br /> However, the inability of director Eric Red to make a hurricane convincing leads to a flood of continuity and lighting errors. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the viewer is more fascinated by the bizarre atmospheric effects than the expected plot. Even the intermittent waves of biting over-direction are distracted. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance, sucking 'backwoods hardass', does his best to save the film. But in the end, Undertow screams like a pig ... and has more ham to boot.
