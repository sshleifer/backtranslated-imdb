When I saw that IMDb users voted for this film in the 250 films after all, I thought it was too hard, but I didn't know that the low rating was absolutely correct. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the Wayans brothers. I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even liked White Chicks. Little Man, however, had very few laughs and the jokes were straightforward. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans, who plays a grown dwarf who was recently released from prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond intended for a gangster. Things are bad and the dwarf has to put the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get the diamond back, the dwarf pretends to be an abandoned child left on the threshold of unsuspecting couples. Obviously, he is welcomed and the drama begins in search of the diamond. <br /> <br /> The film has some Saturday Night Live actors and actresses like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider, as well as In Living Color. All these talents, however, cannot help the poor script and the jokes that simply weren't fun. <br /> <br /> The special effects to make Marlon Wayans look like a dwarf was OK. I mean, it wasn't 100% credible but it was fine ... nothing exceptional. I just hope the Wayans brothers have been more involved in developing a script with good lines than trying to support their poor script with the cameos of their famous comedians and actors. <br /> <br /> Wait for it by cable or television. It is not really worth any money.
