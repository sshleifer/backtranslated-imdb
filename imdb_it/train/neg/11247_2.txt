This film has been underestimated. Many viewers, who thought it was "fantastic", had to be in old school films, because the whole film is set in the past. At first I thought the film was just showing something of the past, so I expected that the faded light like the characters' one would pass, but it went on. Basically this was a film that tried to mix the future with the past, and the 2 don't mix very well in this film, even with special effects. You could actually see the blue screen with which the actors were working. There are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did, so there's no reason why critics advertise this movie by saying "it's the best movie ever made". It's just shit. It also didn't help that the plot was too lousy. I don't understand why Hollywood agreed to produce this film, and I also don't understand how actors / actresses in this film are willing to be in a movie like this. It's almost as if everyone reads the script and forgets to read the fine print ... "Everything will be done on a computer". This was a film that should have been on a movie network, because nothing about this film was revolutionary. I am very angry with myself for paying to see this. Whatever you do, don't waste time and money in this movie today or tomorrow.
