As for Spaghetti Westerns, I would put this man can't die on the dull side of the genus. It's not that the film is particularly bad, but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other SWs I've seen. Guy Madison does his best in the lead role, but lacks the charisma on the screen needed to get him out. With one notable exception, the rest of the cast is not particularly good. The management is not inspired and offers very few moments that I have never seen before. There isn't much to be very excited about. <br /> <br /> The exception of the cast I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. It is the only bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film. Unfortunately, screen display time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: The IMDb page of This Man Can not Die is wrong, Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson, she is Melin's character, I'm not sure how anyone can confuse Rosalba Neri with a boy named John Bartha listed in the titles IMDb for the film.)
