Some have commented here that this is the worst Elvis movie ever made. Well, they are only partly right. For me, this is the worst movie ever made! I've never seen anything so rude, insulting and cowardly, and against the human nature of this film. A real embarrassment to the film industry, this isn't even that bad, it's good. There's no fun campy fun to have here like in some of the other Elvis movies like Clambake. This is so disgusting to bear his pain. Pure junk Native Americans should sue for their poor clich√© and stereotypical treatment here. In reality, perhaps ALL Human Beings should sue for the crime and disservice that this film does to the species as a whole 0 Stars, seriously. Degree: F
