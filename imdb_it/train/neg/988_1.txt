This film offers NOTHING to anyone. It is not successful on ANY level. The acting is horrible, a long, boring dribble. Obviously for the length of the final sex scene they were trying to be shocking, but ended up being practically a parody of what the movie was aiming for. Full rubbish, I can't believe what a ridiculous movie was. <br /> <br /> And I am very sure that Rosario Dawson ended up in this film, even though she would have been her strident talk then hit, a wow NC-17. The problem is that no adult will take possession of this film while the film is presented as an uninteresting episode of the OC or something for adolescents. Pathetic.
