THE NATIONAL LAMPOON CLASS REUNION was a flop when it was released. He didn't stay long in the cinemas of my big city. Why? Because it is BAD !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not bad in a good but bad way in a really painfully unpleasant way. The whole cast of actors was mostly unknown then and remained unknown after this turkey. <br /> <br /> The idea is actually big (a parody of flicker slasher) but the execution is seriously lacking in every aspect. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this "comedy". Your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond looking at this embarrassing bonfire.
