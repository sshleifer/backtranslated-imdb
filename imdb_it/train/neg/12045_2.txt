Hi, <br /> <br /> This is my first post in IMDb even if I use it as a reference for some time. I would therefore like to greet all of you. The fact that I am a Greek will inevitably influence my judgment. I hope I am not irritated. <br /> <br /> I spent 2 years of my life, (everything that we Greeks actually did), analyzing the epirus of Omirus (and not Homer as you see everywhere), rhyme by rhyme. If I remember correctly it was Iliada (Iliad) in eighth grade and Odysseia (Odyssey) in ninth grade. Warner's Troy, it was a big disappointment for me and my Greek colleagues on campus (which I study in the UK). <br /> <br /> Iliad epos is one of the best literary works ever made. It was composed by a Greek poet Omiro for a total of 400 years after the actual war. Historians have placed the Trojan war around 1200 BC, and the real reason for the war is not Elena's beauty, but Troia's strategically crucial position. Having said this, we can now understand that the epirus of Omirus does not present real events (since historically it is not accurate), but this has never been the purpose of this work. <br /> <br /> Reading this huge poem, one can ask the same definitions of honor, love, anger, hatred, heroism, discipline, loyalty and so on. The best and most instructive part was these prolonged talks between the warriors before the battle. None of these, however, was revealed in "Troy". Warner's Troy was really cheap for my eyes, and also for other intellectuals, fellow Finns and English Germans of myself. It is a pity to spend millions of dollars on such an ugly scenario. Incidentally, the perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster (computer graphics did all the work), yet it's Wolfgang Petersen's best work. <br /> <br /> I conclude by saying that you'd better look at something else. I'd give Troy 2 out of 10. It's a very expensive B movie. <br /> <br /> Cheers <br /> <br /> Alex
