I have to admit that Over Her Dead Body really wasn't as bad as I expected, my mother wanted to see it, so I rented it. I just thought about going ahead and seeing the horror in front of my eyes, but it really wasn't bad. I was expecting this horrible film, but it seems that the writers didn't mean any damage, but the casting of Eva Longoria (Parker, sorry), seems a bit off-stage for the film. I think I found a little better without her, only she annoys me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the film rather pleasant. But you have to admit that there was no reason for this film, it was one of those quick checks for the type of actor. The film could have been more fun if someone had really paid attention to it and had a better cast. <br /> <br /> Henry has just lost his wife, Kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on their wedding day. But when his sister takes him to a psychic, Ashley, Henry falls in love with her, but Kate haunts her from beyond the grave. Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to move so fast and will ensure that Ashley does not catch him torturing her day and night with his walks, believe me, with Kate's voice, it's scary. <br /> <br /> Over Her Dead Body is a good film, I don't know if it's worth it, but I'd give it a rent if you want to see it or if you're curious. Eva Longoria does not have enough star power to make the film work, without offense to those who love her, she belongs only on the small screen above the big screen. Not to mention the character of Ashley, he still seems not very nice with everything he pulls, or his "gay" friend, Dan, just again, not really nice. Only with some rewriting and adequate attention, this film could have been better, but instead we get the predictable average romantic comedy that will leave with an empty feeling. <br /> <br /> 4/10
