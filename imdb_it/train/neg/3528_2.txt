There are so many comments on this film, yet I found them to be misleading. This is a distressing and overused scenario in which a normal human being becomes a partner in the crime of someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. Boy meets girl. The girl holds the boy under the threat of something ridiculous. The boy is intrigued. <br /> <br /> He knows the drill: the antagonist turns out to be a free and wild spirit instead of a sociopath ... He throws in a few words the wisdom of Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for Love. Is Sheedy's crazy or does she just need a hug? the role from The Breakfast Club simply exudes as the main character. And all that remains is a really horrible turkey from a movie.
