<br /> <br /> Once I finished my vision of "Trance" or "The Eternal", or whatever the producers call this film, I asked myself: "Of all the bad movies I could see, I couldn't have you seen at least one that was funny? "Even if a film is not well done in terms of acting, directing, writing or what you have, it can be at least fun and therefore useful. But not only is this film of bad artistic value, it's incredibly boring. For a plot of such thinness, it moves terribly slowly, with little dramatic tension. At least, in a low-profile entertainment attempt, the deaths of the characters may have been cold and / or bloody, but the creators of this dracid have failed even in that department. <br /> <br /> Does this film have it? Virtually nothing, unless you enjoy the entertainment looking at Christopher Walken, who is capable of being brilliant, putting so little effort into his acting that he falls into self-parody mode (why did he decide to make this movie anyway?). br /> <br /> I give this movie 3/10, because, God help us, in reality there have been worse films made before.
