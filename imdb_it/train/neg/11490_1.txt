I have to agree with most of everyone's opinions that this show has been poorly produced and written. The acting was not much higher than the lower production values, however I believe that an actor can only rely on the material supplied to them and get the best out of them. In line with this thought, I think it is important to emphasize that an actor has grown and persevered far beyond this field to become a respectable and talented artist. I refer to Laura Harris, a Canadian actor who has carved her way through many badly produced shows and films to find a place in the HBO success "Dead Like Me" where she plays the role of Daisy Adair and takes care of it role efficiently. I remember having a typical childhood slam on the young actress during this series in which she played Ashley as a seventh selector with a tender but intelligent tone. I felt like someone could "make it" from this series would definitely be Laura Harris and, by its nature, excelled in acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent and unique Nordic blonde allure. If you've ever had the opportunity to see this series, I suggest you have something epic to look at after departments like the "Godfather" or perhaps "Beaches" to remind yourself that there is actually a great deal of true integrity of production and value out there and that this series is just a low-budget reminder of what Laura Harris can simply say about her time on the show and I bet she would quote many words of defense from young actors saying "It's a start!"
