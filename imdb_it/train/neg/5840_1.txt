Well then. I just saw a bunch of movies - all with varying degrees of quality. I wasn't sure which one I wanted to review first. Then it hit me like a lot of mice: Rodentz. Warn people about Rodentz. This monstrosity marks no one and it is painfully boring to sit down. And these are mutant mice that kill people. Yes ... real real 'original. "Food of the Gods" or "Willard" anyone? Those were better than that, and this doesn't say much ... <br /> <br /> ** POSSIBLE SPOILER ** Okay here's the story: Inna laboratory the scientist and his brave assistant are experimenting on mice and their lab is in a lousy neighborhood and a lousy building and idiotic friends of the hairy killer are drunk and everyone becomes food for the mad rats and almost everyone dies and, oh yes, there is a giant mouse that looks lousy, but it gets killed in the end. There, all at once sentence! Spoiler, you say? Ppfff !! I beg to differ! The second we realize that there is a giant mouse, we all know that in the end it will die !! ** FINE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Here is the description: <br /> <br /> The good: <br /> <br /> - Well, I watched it for free, but for all others ... hmmm, no. There is nothing good here. <br /> <br /> I didn't do it wrong, it didn't help: <br /> <br /> --Um ... well. the blood was good. - Average high cinematography. <br /> <br /> - The CG rats are not as bad as they could have been in some shots ... <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - ... and in other shots, CG rats were pathetically low-cost. Look, if your movie has a low budget, maybe you shouldn't rely on CG. Lesson to take to heart. <br /> <br /> - Acting is extremely poor. <br /> <br /> - The characters are beyond interesting - we have a mixture of clich√©s and none of them is done well. <br /> <br /> --Booooooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - I've been done before - a lot of times. <br /> <br /> - Stupid story, just stupid. <br /> <br /> - The giant mouse looks like a fat man in a badly designed bear costume - it was pretty funny - but not funny enough to give this movie any value. <br /> <br /> - Delayed, unrealistic and boring dialogue. <br /> <br /> - All rat college students that people drink Tequila from huge plastic milk jugs - yet they don't seem drunk for anything more than a few seconds. A way to stay on, guys. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - This movie is bad. Simply terrible. Worse than you can imagine. Nor is it as ridiculous as, for example, "Scarecrow" (2002) or "House of the Dead". Now those movies are shit you can have fun. Even if they make you become more stupid. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - The end of the limping action movie, complete with wounded heroes and explosions. Because he didn't feel at all like the rest of this monstrosity - but still sucked. <br /> <br /> Acting: 2/10 Story: 1/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character Development: 0/10 Special Effects / Trick: 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 ( During the film I was dealing with my son occasionally, so I might have lost him, but he was presumably in there) Violence / Gore: 4/10 Dialogue: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (average for the time) Writing: 1/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 1/10 <br /> <br /> Watch it only if you love movies rats based on rats and parasites. Wait ... Check that. Don't watch it It's crap. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
