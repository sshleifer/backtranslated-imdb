This film is self-indulgent garbage. Watch this movie if you just want to listen to the spoken Gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack. Watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed. It should be fascinating but it isn't - it's just irritating. The characters are difficult to take care of and the acting is poor. The stories within the film are also without charm and left. I was expecting a moving family film, but even that didn't attract my 14-year-old daughter. I rarely see a movie until it ends, but it got the better of both. <br /> <br /> Although the film is set in current times, it has the look and feel of an economic East European film made during the cold war. There is not even enough in terms of splendid Scottish landscapes and cinematography to redeem it. A pity because as a film it is embarrassing for Scotland.
