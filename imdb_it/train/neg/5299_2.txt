I really like slasher movies, but this is really horrible. The acting is lame, the script is ugly and the atmosphere is non-existent. The plot is as follows: a deformed gardener Charlie Puckett massacres people in a small American town. True, this is the plot. Very original, eh! "The Night Brings Charlie" isn't even gory enough â€” if the movie isn't scary, at least they should make it bloody. Avoid this piece of cheap junk at all costs. If you want to watch some good slash movies, check out "Madman", "The Burning", "The Prowler", "Just Before Dawn" or "Humongous" - don't waste your precious time with this useless piece of junk.
