The worst movie I saw from Gingerale Afternoon. I suppose this is a horror / comedy. I pretty much predicted every scene in this movie. The special effects were not so special. I think I can get positive effects from what I found around the house. I wish I could have something good to say about this movie, but I'm afraid it doesn't. Even Coolio should be ashamed to appear in such a turkey. After a little thought, I have a good thing to say about this movie - it's over.
