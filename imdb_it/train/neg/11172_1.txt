The undeserved popular of 2002 "I Love the 80's" is a crazy, stupid, offensive and downright disgusting disaster of a show that was the first in a long series of horrible television programs that eventually defined the end of VH1, which it was once the only true music-oriented channel left on TV! In practice I lived on VH1 until spring or winter, I forget which time, in 2002, when garbage like this started to appear without any reason at all. Out of pure morbid curiosity (I would say that is what you would say), I had decided that I would continue to take a look: however, you see the first night that arrived even though the ads looked like complete crap. At least I can honestly say that I wasn't a little disappointed with this because my expectations were obviously on the lower level of a basic level to begin with. The emphasis of this show that I discovered in the first 5 minutes was less every year than the 80s and what was and was not culturally significant or popular (which is what I expected to see), but instead more than an impromptu platform for a whole string of really terrible nameless comedians to show what they most likely think is their comic ability * look up * ... more like the lack of that, if you ask me! It is easy enough to understand now why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unsociable and pathetic in their attempts at so-called "humor" that I swear I can feel my intestines knot with each single rancid who shot one after another! Overall, I have no problem saying that "I Love the 80's" was / is rubbish of the lowest denominator, and one of the main reasons why I hardly ever look at VH1 anymore.
