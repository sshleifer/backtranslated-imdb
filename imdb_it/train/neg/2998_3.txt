Only for Judy Garland fans. There are two (2) numbers that are really good - one in which she dials with an older cleaning lady (you all saw the pictures), and a pretty good number at the end. There are a couple of scenes where the lines are fun. But, after all, the script is so ugly and the film so dated that it's hard not to shudder with horror in everything. But it's worth 2.50 to rent the movie, but be prepared to move it forward quickly.
