For me it is logical that this film is becoming a delirium from Hollywood because sometimes in Hollywood it's just a popularity contest. It also makes sense when you think that people who like the film can simply react to the countless songs that you spit at rather than the contents of the story. Still, this film is overrated and exaggerated. Eddie Murphy seems ridiculous. In no way, Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles give the Oscar performance, so many have been thrilled BEFORE the film was homogeneous. I can't even believe that Condon was nominated for an Oscar director, when all he did was put together an album. Glitz does not replace a null plot. A lot of songs don't make a movie.
