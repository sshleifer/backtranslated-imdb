Anyone with a distant interest in science fiction should start from the basics. Everyone says that STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best sci-fi movies to get started, which is fine, but the truth is THE TERMINATOR and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, is a much better choice than those series. SOYLENT is probably the best kept secret of science fiction. It remains one of the biggest, but most forgotten films, but the impact of its scenario is becoming more and more reality with each passing day. Charlton Heston overestimates his role, yet it works. Edward G. Robinson, in his final role, makes the best of it in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching. <br /> <br /> It's Manhattan in 2022, the world is overcrowded and food is an incredible fortune (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $ 150). A great Soylent company executive is murdered and police detective Thorn is on the case. <br /> <br /> The secret of the soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the film. SOYLENT is nice to watch, but the whole script is a joke. It's as cheap as the entire production. The script and the drama of the actors made the film, yet they were completely hilarious. Everyone seems to be an idiot and no one knows the rules, especially the policeman Thorn who likes to waltz in people's apartments, shamelessly browse and steal everything he wants. The character's interactions keep your attention on the film, but you realize that SOYLENT GREEN sucks. A fun piece if you have time, but don't expect anything else.
