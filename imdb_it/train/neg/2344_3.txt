For me this looks like a soap opera. I imagine that any representation of dissolute people can be considered "social commentary". But ultimately, I simply don't care how you characterize this movie. None of the characters is very nice or engaging. I didn't feel any connection between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story here, it is lost in malaise. And despite the fine twist provided by a complete and immediate (and therefore incomprehensible) reversal of Dorothy Maguire on the witness stand, the story is insufficient to hold my interest. Regardless of how much Freudian symbolism and psychology are present, this story is squalid, melodramatic and banal. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is nobly made of wood. This is the less engaging role of Lauren Bacall and one of her poorest shows. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack offer more inspired performances, but his character is vile and his is pathetic. Robert Keith, as a loving and brash father of two abused adult children, is the nicest character. The most interesting of all, however, is the stern Robert Wilke in a small role as bar owner. He is remembered as an ugly follower in countless westerns, but here he is an honest and nice guy. <br /> <br /> I take my social comment with an interesting, compelling story and some nice characters, thanks.
