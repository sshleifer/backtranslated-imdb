This, and the immoral tales, have left a bitter taste. It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted with sex, and these two films are warning stories about what will happen if you have sex. As a film, it's not very well done - some of the plays are really epic (like the "American" woman with a French accent). The sudden flip-flop of the young woman to be anxious for the marriage to be interested (when it seems it should have been the opposite), and the sudden realization of the aunt of the young man's secret makes no sense - they "are not explained at all. I also didn't like how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of his family's perversion or predilection for bestiality, the central idea, the idea that there is this "sexy beast", if you want, who lives in the woods, could have been a basis for a perverse but fun story, but instead is only used as a basis for a bad, sex-negative, morality game.
