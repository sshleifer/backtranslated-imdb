I never understood the charm of this show. The acting is mediocre (Debra Jo Rupp is a noteworthy exception), the plot of most of the episodes is trivial and uninteresting, the dialogue is weak, the jokes are not funny and it is painful to try to sit even by half episode . Furthermore the link between this show and the 70s is extremely tenuous beyond the style of the dress and the scenery and background used for the show - it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unconventional scripts, clich√©s that modern sitcoms have dressed up as representing a show of twenty years ago in the hope that it will earn some nostalgic spectator or something like that. Both "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to look at in contrast to this horrible and pathetic excuse for a show
