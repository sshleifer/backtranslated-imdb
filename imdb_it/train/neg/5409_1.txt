The Christmas secret was advertised as a wonderful movie, but I was really disappointed. They even sold VHS and DVD copies of the film when it was finished, which leads me to think that the producers were really proud of this project. As a production designer, I heard that most of the performances were phone calls, although Beau Bridges, like Nick, had a moment or two. If I were Richard Thomas, I wouldn't put this film on my otherwise good resume. It was an embarrassment. I had been a fan since his Waltons, but I found myself unlucky to watch his later work, so this offer was so poor. <br /> <br /> In defense of the actors, the direction was drawn up, mechanical, and completely amateurish. <br /> <br /> I hope this is not considered a spiteful review and negative assumptions made about my qualifications as a critic. I made the film because it had a good cast and I was ready to enjoy the movie. However, I would challenge anyone to watch this movie and not want their money, even if it was on T.V.
