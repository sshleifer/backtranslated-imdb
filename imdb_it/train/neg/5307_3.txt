What happened? 'Doubt' had so much potential to be a brilliant movie - but instead it faltered with a simplistic overwhelming storyline that made me want to stop watching. The only thing the film had was the brilliance of Meryl Streep, which no DUBBIO deserved the Oscar nomination. Although it was not one of his best performances, he still gave us a solid and sincere character that blossomed through the screen. <br /> <br /> However, not even the splendor of a legend on the screen could save this movie downhill. From the boring beginning, which had no power or punch - to the less convincing ending, the film was really a disappointment - especially because it provided so much potential through its promotion and trailer. It was obvious that the director had problems with the simplicity of the plot and ended up with a boring film, which dragged on for too long, with too much chatter and not enough action. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the other The Oscar nominations were less than convincing. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance, it was not absolutely worthy of an Oscar. (Especially because they completely excluded performances like Will Smith, in Seven Pounds). Amy Adams did not deserve the nomination. Looking at Amy Adams was like looking at a cardboard box, because it was one-sided and simple. It would have made more sense to name her for a Razzie, as I'm sure she would have left victorious. Viola Davis gave a short but truthful performance, but the duration of her performance made me doubt that the academy should have given her the nomination. <br /> <br /> Overall, I consider Doubt one of the most disappointing films of 2008. It was a mess of a movie with so much potential, and I don't recommend it. The only bright light in the film is Meryl Streep, who despite giving an extraordinary and solid performance, doesn't even do enough to save this film. *** / 10.
