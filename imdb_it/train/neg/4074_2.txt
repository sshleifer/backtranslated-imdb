I expect the same excitement as I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE but I was disappointed only by junk as you can call this movie (its kind of mini-porn). It made me sick when the boy was made to eat his business. There is no trace of plot in everything that jumps quickly from every murder. If you like to see naked women or even the male parts, then there are commercials in the film and there is also a point of masturbation in the film that makes it a porn and not a movie. I've seen some stupid movies in my time but this is number 1. I want to watch it again. The actors seem bored during the film, so they probably needed money to make this film.
