When I was younger I really enjoyed watching bad television. We were all guilty of this at one time or another, but my excuse for looking at things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th century" and "Silver Spoons" is this: I was young and naive; ignorant of what makes a show really useful. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I appreciate good things now. Stargate SG-1 is not good. I would like every 12-year-old, every line of dialogue drawn up, every bit of useless technobabble. The writing is beyond insipid; so insipid and trivial to miss Star Trek: Voyager. If your show makes me want the worst Trek show ever, you're in trouble. <br /> <br /> The movie Stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure, anchored by two solid performances by James Spader and Kurt Russell, full of fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, a wonderful soundtrack and fantastic science fiction ideas. With the exception of some of the original music, none of what made the movie funny appears in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGyver accessible and legendary interesting, seems to be half asleep in most episodes. <br /> <br /> The budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like someone's basement. Cinematography is not much better, like vanilla and boring like screenplays. I am surprised that the shows with much more style (like Farscape) and the substance (like the Battlestar Galactica reimagined) have smaller and less rabid bases than this pap. He simply doesn't deserve it.
