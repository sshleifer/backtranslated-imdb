<br /> <br /> Worst. Movie. Ever. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of filming this remake (as well as turning it into an informal 90-minute movie soundtrack)? Zombies that * perform * ??? I imagine that the director has never watched the original films of "Dead", which show stiff creatures (da rigor mortis) that move and move towards their living prey. <br /> <br /> And how, exactly, did the survivors know which boat in the marina belonged to the recently departed Steve? <br /> <br /> 1/10
