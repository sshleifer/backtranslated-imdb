This film is not interesting, except for the first ten minutes. Rhythm and editing are a perfect introduction to an ensemble piece, even better than Gosford Park. Then he inexplicably slows down, loses concentration and begins to look like a traditional French film only to regain concentration, in the end, with the love relationship between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cécile (Deneuve). In the middle there are too many secondary lines and sections in history, several threads started are not finished. <br /> <br /> ******* SPOILERS AHEAD The main plot is the relationship between Antoine and Cécile. He was loyal to her after his relationship with her many years ago, despite his remarriage and home settling in Morocco. As a builder he now rebuilds his life and recovers his taking the mask of Cécile's marriage. After doing so, he is buried after a bizarre accident (literally) and becomes a coma. He wakes up only after he burns their old image as an indication that they are reconciled with the past and can resume their lives together. ******* END OF THE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> It is not clear what vision this director wants us to see because there are so many other stories here: Illegal immigrants want to enter Europe, there are frequent radios broadcasts on the overthrow of the previous Iraqi regime. Cécile's son is bisexual and is bitten by dogs (loyalty) once he meets his boyfriend, while the girl he lives with seems to be sick (of that?). His sister is traditional Islamic and enters into a relationship with Cécile's husband. It portrays Morocco as a useless backlog, despite all the buildings there is a strange colonial vision that shines through what almost glorifies the past. It portrays Islam as backward and prone to extremism, which can sometimes be true, but certainly not in general. In the end it can best be described as the addition of a local couleur and art for art. <br /> <br /> Deneuve and Depardieu are fantastic. With this material they are so familiar that they are able to shoot something extra in every scene: raise an eyebrow, a body language, radiate pride, uncomfortable behavior. The film itself is disappointing and only confirms the limited role of French cinema in the world today. With some notable exceptions, of course.
