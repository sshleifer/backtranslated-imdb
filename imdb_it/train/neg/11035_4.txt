This is the most sweetened story I've ever faced. The perfect movie for an inactive housewife with a pocket handkerchief, a dressing gown and mules with stiletto heels covered in ostrich to watch in the afternoon, lying on the couch eating candy. In fact, the bonbons have a prominent role in the film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could see until the end is that I finally managed to look at Keanu Reeves' dreamlike face in almost every scene. In most of his films, he moves too fast to get a good look. The only quick action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini shaking hands with Latin emotion - more Italian than Mexican, really. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is as rigid as wood. Unfortunately, no body is torn: the hero is shamefully perfect and mild. The aristocratic and warm clich√© of the old family world is as old as the hills. What does it matter if they are Irish or Italian or Mexican? This is a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> I knew before the titles ran out that this would not be the film I was hoping for. The shining grape seemed the benchmark of all the food announcements in Women's Day magazine. I didn't see its name listed, but the art director was definitely Thomas Kinkade, who paints the millions-dollar canvases of Irish houses nestled in fuchsia. This film was literally seen through pink glasses. If you like pink and dreamy blue sky, this movie is for you! (Even the bonbons looked very good!)
