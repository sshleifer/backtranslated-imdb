Richard Dreyfus is not the star here. He has about three 20 second cameos and what is Gene Barry doing in this whole movie? No idea, the director was probably his brother! This is a film that makes absolutely no sense. The inept writer / director (same type) massacred everyone's talent with his horrendous ... work. I got the DVD for a penny so I can't complain! But it's strange! And it makes you feel weird and it's not a good way. It was the 70s and it seems that the director had a bad acid trip and wanted everyone to experience what it's like to be in his head. It has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but like a scratched disc, it quickly plays foul. It has that "Manson family on acid" atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how the other reviewer got everything he did with this movie? Maybe they worked on it when? However, be prepared to lose more than 80 minutes of your life that never comes back. Yes, it's terrible!
