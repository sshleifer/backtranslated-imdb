In my life I have seen many great and terrible films. I'm not an expert in professional reviews, but I definitely have something to say about this. First, these actors are the worst I've seen ... Their acting is so unreal that you would also like to throw the DVD away in the first 2 minutes. I think these actors weren't interested in quality. <br /> <br /> Another terrible thing about these dialogues: they are so lame. Sometimes you feel uncomfortable when you hear them. Your 14-year-old son seems to be doing better. I feel that this film has a budget similar to the cost of my 14 year old European car ... <br /> <br /> Please, if my message reaches you, save time and money.
