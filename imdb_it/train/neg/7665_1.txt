Honestly, I can't be bothered to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence - life is just too short. What I will say is that Alone In The Dark succeeds only in three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. He can throw several useless plots into the air, but he drops them all. <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> 3. Completely disgraces the classic PC game that is supposed to have been a complete failure in all aspects of movie making. <br /> <br /> Doctor Boll, if that's really what you are (I'm thinking of proctology here), what the hell are you doing in a director's chair?
