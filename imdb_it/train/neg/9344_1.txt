As others have pointed out, this film is a bunch of pretentious nonsense for the mindless or for the masochists. <br /> <br /> We all know that after seeing the radio and the acid house, Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainpotting and acid house without a good dose of humor or gritty realism films like this, they don't work. And more importantly, without a decent script, a film will not work and there is nothing new, challenging or inspiring in the script of this film. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film has won a couple of Bafta shows shows how bad the British film industry is at the moment. I thought the Australian film industry was pretty bad right now, but unfortunately British industry is even worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I wouldn't even bother renting it from the weekly section. > <br /> Do yourself a favor and leave this movie away.
