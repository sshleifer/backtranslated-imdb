Another wave of English film flags. Real trash on offer here again. I can't understand (and I'm British) why this patriotic nonsense was made. Eight years mark you, since the Second World War was actually over! Other commentators here have emphasized the assembly and apparent use of the archive footage without interruption. This is extremely little observed. The archive's repertoire is in abundance. Model airplanes swing from the strings in "action scenes" like so many wind-driven kites. The usual room map sequences tattoo the film to make us presumably attracted by the entire Malta event. Guinness must have its worst acting performance ever. The scenes of shocking backward canine struggle are ridiculous. Hawkins bore us all to death in the map area. Ealing has made many great films. This is clearly not one of them. They must have stayed away from this unconvincing rot!
