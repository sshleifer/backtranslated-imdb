The writer / director Peter Greenaway cements his title of High Lord of Art House Pretension with his latest exercise of hateful self-indulgence, 8 ½ women. The film follows a rich Englishman and his son in their mutual search for sexual satisfaction, while they attract and blackmail women (guess how many) by entering their personal collection of concubines. <br /> <br /> Think of any possible ways this premise could be offensive, and the chances are that Greenaway did. The female characters are little more than a catalog of fetishes for the two protagonists to attend. There is the obsessed with Kabuki Mio, the ever-pregnant Giaconda and Beryl, who has something for the farm animals. Giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair, she is the "half woman", understand? Greenaway vehemently denies all accusations of misogyny, but if not, then what is it? <br /> <br /> The film continues to eroticize everything that has to do with Japan, a continuation of themes from its snoring 1996 (but less sexist) film, The Pillow Book. But where The Pillow Book was erotic and graceful, 8 ½ women become excited and exploitative. Greenaway's work is insipid and arrogant in his fetishism, and the only person who will probably love to watch it is the author himself.
