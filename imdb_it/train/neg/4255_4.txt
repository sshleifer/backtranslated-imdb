the film opens with a beautiful lady in a tattered white dress running through a stereotypical city in Eastern Europe. we know it is followed by something, because it keeps looking over its shoulder. and soon we see that she is chased by a mysterious man in a black raincoat. then we realize that the man is actually the vampire hunter and he is after her. but look is his reflection in the shop window ??? no it's just his identical twin vampire! but unfortunately both get. <br /> <br /> after this brilliant and incredibly funny return to the old hammer films of the 60s and 70s (in the closing credits the twins are listed as the evil twins, which of course is the name of the last bet in the karnstein trilogy of the hammer), the plot practically dies. <br /> <br /> That little plot concerns dracula (which conveniently changes its appearance every time it is reborn, so the producer does not have to summarize the same dracula) come to a morgue, med students realize that it is a non dead and thinks ... wow, what an opportunity, maybe I'll just ignore all those movies that say drinking vampire blood turns you into a vampire and uses the vampire's blood to find a cure for our stupid friend's ailment. obviously this is a mistake and everyone becomes a vampire. <br /> <br /> A new concept, but pulled out atrociously atrociously. The film continues to create wonderful situations and refuses to do anything with them. <br /> <br /> For example, medical students try to bring Drac back to life by putting him in a tank full of blood in an isolated and shabby home. The house itself is scary enough to be the center of the film, but are we staying there? no because they decide to take the vampire to an abandoned pool. sigh. This film has a real problem with the "freebies", as I said before the opening scene just came out of the hammer, and this house scene would have been perfect for a hammer-like film, but the film quickly changes gear and changes in a medical horror. <br /> <br /> The other problem is that they introduce so many characters that it's almost impossible to feel sorry for any of them. There are medical students and their "friend" as a professor in a wheelchair; general medical students are all: arrogant, boring, money-starved and stupid. the way they managed to attend medical school surprises me, unless the medical school has had to overcome the limit of muscle mass / muscular stem. and then there is the vampire hunter who remains mysterious through the film. hey I can respect him, but it would be nice if they hadn't set him up as if the movie were on him. then you have random priests, policemen and types of sciences. so many people are introduced and then quickly forgotten until they need that person to save the day or jump out for a cheap scare that quickly becomes boring. <br /> <br /> Basically this is a lazy movie. no real fear, just some predictable fear of jumping. The set up for these is so elaborate that it's fun. for example the bathtub full of blood. it's so obvious that Drac will come out of the dark blood. yet we must wait too long to arrive at the inevitable fear of jumping. after this he kills one of the most stupid and greatest maternal medicine students. we all know he will become one of the undead. but what do others do? bury her in a shallow grave near the house. sigh, so you know who will jump on you when the cops show up at home .......... <br /> <br /> Oh well. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone will get the hint that it's impossible to make a scary vampire movie and just go for atmosphere, and then we'll end up with a whole movie that's as good as the opening scene. <br /> <br />
