If you simply look at the cover of this movie, it's nice. DO NOT. The film itself put me to sleep. The pace was slow, the violence was minimal and the misuse of suspense. The acting was the bottom manger material and the plot, while it would have been nice for a different film, was shown wrong here. They even kill the one nice character in the whole movie! I give a 2 out of 10 because the only thing that was good was the plot at the end. In addition to this, you may want to save yourself from this movie basket.
