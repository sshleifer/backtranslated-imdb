This film was a blow to me. I imagine that little girls should aspire to be nothing more than models of swimsuits, housewives or lovers, since it seems to be everything they will ever be portrayed as in any case. It is really sad to see the work and life of an artist so unfairly misinterpreted. Inconceivably (or perhaps should have been expected), the whole Artemisia character and everything she represents had been reduced to a standard Hollywood female character; a small, merciful, physically flawless, little creature who showed none of the character traits that brought her that place in history that had been mutilated here. Even sadder, it was to see that much of the public was too ill-educated in the area to understand the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film and reality. To portray the artist as a person in love with her real life rapist, someone she actually accused of raping her even when she was under torture simply pisses me off. If the director had nothing more substantial to say, he would have to refrain from basing his story on a real person.
