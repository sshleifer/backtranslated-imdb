From a plot and movement point of view, this film was terrible. I found myself looking at the clock in the theater hoping that it would be over and lifted after 80 long minutes which fortunately did. In practice, five characters appear in the film: A son and a father, a girl friend of his son and two male characters of the age of the child who appear and disappear without context or explanation. The film and the scenes seemed to suggest homoeroticism, but in reality nothing has ever happened to reveal this in one way or another. There were a couple of fantastic scenes. At the beginning of the film, the son's friend shows up at a window outside her room and engage in a strange conversation. Photography and acting gave an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two, ending up admitting that they had another man who was "older". End of that story.
