I see probably 200 films a year both at the cinema and at home and I can say with certainty that this film is by far the worst I've seen this year (if ever, however I haven't seen "Quest of the Delta Knights" yet ). This film is just a bad joke after a bad skirmish for the thirteen year old and because I was sorry to see him on a bus trip that I couldn't get out of. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip this one in the rental hall. The four dollars could be better spent on each film with numbers produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
