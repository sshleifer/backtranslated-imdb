It's quite simple. Friends is a comedy of basic humor aimed at teenagers and young adults, with an unsophisticated sense of humor. <br /> <br /> It is also painfully obvious that towards the end they were desperately trying to make it last 10 seasons, most likely so that they could say they beat season 9 of Seinfeld. The problem is that Seinfeld has had 9 fantastic seasons with a great script, Friends had (and I am very generous here) at most 5 or 6 seasons OK and then 4 abysmal seasons. <br /> <br /> It has become a soap opera with recycled humor and recycled traits that weren't all that good, so I got worse the hundredth time you saw them. I find it so difficult to understand why people value so much. It's really terrible.
