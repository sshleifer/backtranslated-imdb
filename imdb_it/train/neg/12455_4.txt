I remember seeing him in the early evening when I was about 7 years old. At the time I was a great comic book reader, and everything about superheroes was expected a lot. The end result, however, was disappointing. <br /> <br /> I was aware of Emma Peel's "Diana Prince" stories, as they had just come to an end and Diana was returned to her Amazon form. However, there was so little action that I was bored during most of the film. The final costume was an interesting idea, but it looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero. I saw the movie again in my last teenage years. He hadn't improved much. Cathy Lee Crosby was more familiar, thanks to That's Incredible, but her acting was no better. The script had some good ideas, like the Amazon rogue, and a decent villain in Ricardo Montalban, but it didn't meet and it was still boring. <br /> <br /> I think they should have reconstructed the best back story, and built the show in a more epic climax. It was too much like a bland spy movie, crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book before. The elements of Amazon were intriguing, but they needed to be expanded. <br /> <br /> The film managed to force the producers to return to the drawing board and find something more faithful, even if a little too much camp and reduced budget. Here too the budget was rather low, and superheroes don't come cheap. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to have the movie available on DVD, if only as a historical and comparison document. Superman 4 is also available and has nothing on this film (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It is worth seeing out of curiosity and for some inspiration and caution for future versions.
