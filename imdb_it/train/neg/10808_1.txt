I was given the version of Kazaam's book for my eighth birthday, and people always say that the book versions are always better than the film, but this time they were wrong. At least with the film it's over soon. <br /> <br /> The acting in this is terrible, which I expected from a movie with Shaq playing a magical rap genius coming out of an old ghetto blaster (which was probably a good reason why he was trapped there inside). The kid in the movie who plays Max is a whiny and a terrible actor. He is bullied by neighborhood children, who do not blame them because he is a small cosmetic bag. <br /> <br /> History is simply stupid and extremely clich√©. About a boy who is always a father who works and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father. <br /> <br /> Even at the age of 8 I thought it was a stupid idea. It's a surprise that the people who worked on this film had careers after the guards because it's an embarrassment and should never have been done. I could ramble even more about how this movie sucks, but you should already know this just by reading the plot.
