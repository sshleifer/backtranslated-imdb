Ok, so the previews of this film only tell you that a rebellious girl goes to live with her grandmother for the summer to straighten up. This is actually not the case! It's about a young seventeen-year-old rebel who reveals a secret and it's up to her mother to believe whether she is telling the truth or not. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I really liked the concept of this movie. They had a really good storyline and a really good theme of a love / hate relationship between mother and daughter. However, I didn't like watching Lindsay Lohan's acting. Actually, this film would have been GREAT if they had someone else, maybe a better actress. The character of Rachel (Lohan) is a very sexually aggressive person and remembers the real Lindsay, so it takes away a lot from the movie. <br /> <br /> However, I think that if you put Lindsay aside, you will like this movie. The finish is rather large (and sad).
