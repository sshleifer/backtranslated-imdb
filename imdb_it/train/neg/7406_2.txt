Well, how could I imagine that this was "the stupid" Lordi Motion Picture "promotional ass? I mean, I realized it when that "dinosaur" costume appeared and when the singer made his appearance I was humming "Hard Rock Hallelujah" for me ... even though I hate that song. "Dark Floors" is about a young autistic girl who is being taken from the hospital by her father who is too protective when they, and the rest of the people in that particular elevator, become momentarily trapped ... When they get to their floor it's a real one surprise to discover that there is no one else around. The hospital is empty ... Except a variety of monsters that seem to haunt them for no apparent reason ... They run through the corridors and stairwells, meeting all the members of the heavy metal band in their bizarre, shocking -rock costumes. .. Nothing really memorable here, except the bad acting, the lack of blood / nudity, and the absolutely shameless promotional margin, which reminds me a lot of "KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park". Yes, do you remember that disaster? I wish I didn't ... I'd just recommend avoiding all these Ghost House movies like a mushroom and not listening to Lordi since I'm a Goff ripoff band!
