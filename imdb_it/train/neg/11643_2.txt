Although the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments, it is certainly a wrong hypothesis. This is an adaptation of 9 stories WITHOUT INTERPRETATION taken from the collection of tales "Decameron" by Giovanni Bocaccio from the 14th century. <br /> <br /> Located within a largely medieval Italian peasant population, it is a diatribe on the reality of sex (and consequences) within that world and time. A realistic view of life in this world, sometimes it seems like a journey back in time. <br /> <br /> Given the human element represented of his time, one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in his protagonists - as well as the ironies of life at times. Or it can also be seen as a general satire of the rules of the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Nothing terribly special, but certainly interesting if you arrive without expectations or hypotheses.
