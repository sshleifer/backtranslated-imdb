I didn't know that Willem Dafoe was so hard for the dollars that he would have disgraced himself with such an upheaval in this monstrosity. Devil: I will donate the money I was going to send to Ethiopia if he is so desperate. I've never seen a movie so pathetic and disgusting for a long time ... who paid for it? They are throwing some tax or insane scam. A 5-year-old would be ashamed of the plot, and I would rather get sick with cancer than spend more than an hour I suffered. All those involved should be locked up for a year in the sodomy wing of a third world prison. Avoid at all costs. I would give 10 minus if possible ... incredible.
