"When a small Bavarian village is attacked by a series of mysterious deaths, the local (magistrate) asks for answers to (sic) attacks, while the policeman refuses to believe the nonsense about vampires who return to the village, the local doctor who treats the the victims begin to suspect the truth about the crimes ", according to the synopsis of the cover of the DVD. <br /> <br /> A vampire mystery inappropriately named, dramatically unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Curiously, the second level of the film easily out-performs the film's dull stars: stoic Lionel Atwill (as Otto von Niemann), skeptic Melvyn Douglas (as Karl Brettschneider), and rather Fay Wray (as Ruth Bertin). The much more entertaining supporting cast includes Dwight Frye (as Herman), the hypochondriac Maude Eburne (as Aunt Gussie Schnappmann) and the suspicious George E. Stone (as Kringen). Mr. Frye, Mrs. Eburne and Mr. Stone have excellent performances. Is there another movie that ends with a mad dash to the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Magnesium sulfate ?? Epsom salts ?? it's a laxative! <br /> <br /> **** The Vampire Bat (1933) Frank Strayer ~ Dwight Frye, Melvyn Douglas, Maude Eburne
