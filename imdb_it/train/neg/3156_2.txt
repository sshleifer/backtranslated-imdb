I just want to make one thing clear: I love Michael Vartan! But this film really disappointed him. His acting is still superb, he is still as charming as ever, and still looks fit. But the film itself is a bunch of garbage! Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry to say, is finished a bit manly ... you're always waiting for her to run away with her best friend, whose subtlety is a bit weird. My family and I (who sat down and watched the movie with me) were also sent back from the movie's soundtrack; sometimes the music didn't fit in with what was happening in the scenes. However, even this was not the worst aspect of what I found to be a very disappointing film. I could forgive the protagonist's bite, I could forgive the bizarre characters that were thrown into the mix, and I could forgive the poor choice of musical accompaniment, but the choice was to cut out the entire central section of the film and jump straight up to end ??? The ending was obviously planned from the beginning, but the way it arrives there has been incalculable. If you are a Michael Vartan fan, skip this movie: buy yourself a poster.
