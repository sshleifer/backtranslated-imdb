I think that Elisabeth Rohm, although she can try hard, is not good at all. I guess it was because of the budget that she could be the only one they could get for that price. I watched it mainly for the performance of Myron Natwick, whose work I know very well. <br /> <br /> He was the most credible and undoubtedly the most compelling to watch. When it wasn't on the screen, it died. This was shot in Vancouver. He gave me the creeps, but I assure you that in real life he is a kind and compassionate man. He also said that playing the role gave him the creeps. <br /> <br /> I'll see anything with him, but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. It was exciting as a lint on Law and Order. Perhaps a very kind person, but no actress.
