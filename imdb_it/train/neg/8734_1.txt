Maybe I saw too much criminal film, or maybe I didn't take the right drugs. <br /> <br /> This was the most clich√© ridden, lacking plot, absurd plot, simply silly film I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> As for the direction, it seems that it took less time to show what he did to put it together. <br /> <br /> It actually looks like to make it directly to the video before it was completed. <br /> <br /> It is a bad copy of "M" the classic Fritz Lang film starring Peter Lorre. It would be much better to rent instead.
