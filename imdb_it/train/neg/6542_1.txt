The person who wrote the brilliant review of this misguided project must be related to the writer / director / star - or is, in fact, the same person who challenges rational thinking that this film would be attractive to anyone who is not connected to a tightly woven inner circle. What do you think about this? You want to make a movie - tell a story; to entertain; attract me with lively characters. Of course, you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass attraction. However, do not address the elements of artistic expression in a void in which the public is in a constant struggle to grasp the narrative strands. If I have to be moved by a dreamlike psychological thread, then it is easier to buy cement.
