I went to not know anything about this film and I came out in half an hour knowing everything about it. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm generally a good person, but if someone had told me they liked this movie, they probably wouldn't talk to them anymore. It is very likely that anyone who likes all this has an extremely dry, hermit-like personality. I will also understand that they think they are also quite intelligent, just like the bags of egocentric farts that make the voices for the film. I know that everyone has different types of humor, someone might not even like mine, but that's okay; I don't think this covers any range of humor though. This film is as flat and boring as Wes Anderson's mind. Come in and get ready to go out; it's even better to get your money back.
