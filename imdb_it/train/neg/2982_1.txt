Zombie Review # 3 <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Few movies are actually "so bad they are good", and Zombi 3 is not only bad, it's miserably, inexcusably bad in so many ways that you might need a completely new language just to describe them all <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it's a film credited to Lucio Fulci that even for his standards has absolutely no consistency, sense or reason. However we cannot blame Fulci because it was not directed by him, but by Bruno Mattei, who does not even have a sense of Fulci's style to help carry the film forward. Mattei seems to have brought little to the film, but in a disconcerting ineptitude. <br /> <br /> So, I am ashamed to say how much I liked every minute of Zombi 3's useless minutes. It has no saving features - in a genre known for skinny characters, weak stories and lack of ability to create films, Zombies 3 pushes the boat out but, in doing so, it's even more fun than Nightmare City. <br /> <br /> The action begins when "Death 1" the gas is stolen from a military base and damaged during the escape. Who is the thief, why did he steal it, and why would the US military think creating cannibal legions of the living dead would be a good idea? A Zombi 3 will not be answered to all these questions and others .... <br /> <br /> After hiding in a hotel, the infected thief gets angry with all the green plastecina that grows on his face before being tracked down by the army that somehow foolishly decides that the best way to get rid of his corpse will be to burn it, sending "Death 1" into the atmosphere giving rise to ... zombie birds! Who then attacks people and turns them into zombies !!! (if the zombies are cannibals, why don't the zombies just attack other birds?) <br /> <br /> Then we meet our "heroes", a trio of horny soldiers and a load of girls. There are also a couple of other guys with them, but they're not important - NO ONE is important here. You'll be hard pressed to remember someone's face, not to mention their name or find a reason to worry about them. They end up hiding in the same hotel as the thief ("a week ago this place was full of life, now it's full of flies!") But there is no escape from the undead. <br /> <br /> Thanks to this or you will be completely sucked or you will have destroyed that damn thing. The script is so terrifying that even the greatest acting in the world cannot save it, so it is just as some of the worst have - and not just the human characters, the acting of the zombies here is a historical minimum. There is no consistency in the way the zombies behave - a little neglected in the time-honored style, others engage in fistfighting or running around with the machines, not to mention the zombies that are still able to speak (a gimmick that gives the film is CORRECTION HORRIFYING TWIST). They die from gunshots in the chest (rather than the head) and are even thrown out by a good left hook. How can you give a zombie ??? !!!!! In fact, the emphasis on badly made 1980s action often makes it similar to an episode of V ... <br /> <br /> Zombies also spend a lot of time hiding, apparently waiting for hours in ridiculous locations for the possibility of some poor the sap will pass and will have the fear of their life. They hide in bushes, in garages, in huts, on roofs, in water and even under pregnant women. At one point a zombie follows a woman up the stairs. To kill and eat it? No! To push it into the water, those zombies and their extravagant sense of humor! <br /> <br /> But there's a lot of blood. The limbs are cut, the wounds give off green pus, and there is a lot in the way of eating meat and people get lungs. There is nothing to go with the original piercing of the eyeballs, but if the bad makeup effects are your bag, they won't let you down. <br /> <br /> All this and I didn't even mention the horrible music, the inexplicable head of flying zombies, the scientist whose acting can REALLY stand out, or the last chilling ending line ... In a ingenious twist on the original radio that is invaded by zombies, Zombi 3 gives us a real Zombie DJ !! "He went to their side!" our cry of the hero on the run, before swearing to continue fighting against the undead in a sequel that unfortunately never arrived. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 is rubbish: it wouldn't be a loss to the world if every single print was destroyed and all records of its existence were erased, yet somehow I feel that my life is richer for having seen it. <br /> <br /> Did I say richer? I meant 88 minutes shorter ...
