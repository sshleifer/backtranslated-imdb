HORRIBLE! Avoid like the plague. I would rate it in the first 10 worst films of all time. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. They seem to be made by day students ... wait, I've seen better programs than this. It opens like a soft porn show with a fuzzy naked woman doing a shower scene and then going wrong from there. Good nude scenes, but that's it. Sound and light problems persisted throughout the film. Sometimes I could swear I heard the roar of camera engines. YIKES! I'd like to see another film about this story, but made by different people. This group of actors and crew members needs more acting and film making lessons. Rated 1 in 10.
