If you could give it less than I would like. Don't worry about renting; if someone gives you the DVD, burn it. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie. A total waste even of the digital "film". I saw better on Youtube made by 12-year-olds. Lommel claims to have written it, if it is the classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages. The plot never existed, the dialogue is mainly screaming, the work with the camera is a sort of attempted artifice with an absurd cut of jumps totally unrelated to the industrial transport scenes or to a sort of strange break of the young woman. <br /> <br /> I can usually follow a less obvious plot or see the purpose in a "creative" film - I like David Lynch. <br /> <br /> This is or beyond my limited understanding. or is totally useless. I think this is a "let's see if we can grab a title that will be released soon and we'll do a strange split on it and we'll see if we can grab some dollars" with work. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why Lionsgate took the trouble to do it. Absolutely useless, it is so serious that I will not rent anyone else from this same director.
