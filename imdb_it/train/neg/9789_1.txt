They should have called this film: "The adoptive brother of mice which is slightly inspired by the vague recollection of someone from Stuart Little who has just leafed through the book a little, but mostly just remembered the cover" If it wasn't so misleading, I would give it a better review. <br /> <br /> But seriously people, do your children a favor and have them read the book. They could really learn something instead of being numb from what we all know as a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The book Stuart does not talk about a mouse, it is a person who appears to be very small and mouse-like. He was born of his parents, not adopted. The book talks about his life and his eventual departure from home and the journey he takes. There's a cat named Snowball who thinks he's food and wants to eat it, but Snowball can't talk. <br /> <br /> All this is fucked in the film. I think the only things they kept from the book were the boat ride and the names.
