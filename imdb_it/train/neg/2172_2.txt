Bottom of the barrel, unimaginable, and practically elusive remake of THE ROAD WARRIOR. This film follows the exact plot of the Filipino movie STRYKER and is far worse! Bad acting, dialogue, effects, dubbing, pacing, action sequences ... The list could go on and on. Italy made literally dozens of Road Warrior scams in the early 1980s, some good, some bad. This is by far the worst, no race. Not only was the atmosphere of the film completely dark and miserable, the experience of sitting through this is half boredom. There was 1 (one) good chase sequence towards the beginning of the film, and a nice shot of a man holding a grenade exploding. But EVERYTHING else on this film is serious! For the real post-atomic fun, go find a copy of ENDGAME, AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK, or ESCAPE FROM THE BRONX. They are much more fun than this junk.
