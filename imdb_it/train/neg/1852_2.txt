Anyone who made this film must have done it as a joke. I mean, this was the stupidest movie I've ever seen !! A killer snowman terrorizes a small town? Give me a break. I love when it takes off while driving the police car. More like a comedy than a horror movie. If you want to laugh, rent this. If you really want a horror movie, stay away from it !!
