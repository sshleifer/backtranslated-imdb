Like most people, it intrigued me when I heard the concept of this film, in particular the "filmmakers were attacked" aspect that the case seems to emphasize, with the image on the cover of the filmmakers chased by an angry crowd . <br /> <br /> So, to watch the film and find out, oh, what it means to "the directors were attacked", some children threw stones at a signal and a number of people complained loudly and made said "Someone should beat those two children". The image on the cover, "the chase", so to speak? Total manufacture Which I believe is in tune with the theme of the film, lying and manipulating to satisfy vain and stupid children with more money and more time for meaning. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what great truth the viewer should take away from this film. It's like "Roger & Me" by Michael Moore, but if "Roger & Me" was Moore mocking the people of Flint. It is completely deviated and totally alienated. Wow! Can you believe that the people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited to have markets full of food? What cretins! And it's not so much "Look at the effects of capitalism and the Western media bla bla bla", since it wasn't just that their fake market had comparable prices to competitors, it was that, as many people in the film say, prices were absurdly low, some say they should have known it was false because they were charging for the duck. This is proving nothing except that poor people will go to a store that has low prices, good friends, a way to stick it to people at the bottom. <br /> <br /> Way to make a stupid joke on the elderly You should be very proud. How about your next movie, make a documentary about Iraq and show how people will be really excited about a house with no holes in the walls and then, for example, "HAHA! TO BY THE MEDIA! ". <br /> <br /> Morgan "Please Like Me" Spurlock has unleashed this wet fart of a movie and it's no surprise since Spurlock as the One Hit Wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw its weight behind every concept of silly sound to stay relevant in a world that doesn't really need him. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague.
