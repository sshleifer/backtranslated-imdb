the filmmakers' intention for this film is quite honorable, but its history of its productions made me realize that this might not be as central as the other film producers would do. bearing in mind his 30-day television series, but also counting in his MTV production "I bet you will" that he is opposed to his seriousness in any of the things he has documented and even in his rather disappointing production "supersize me" I had my hopes up high unfortunately this film disappointed me anyway. as with "Supersize Me" after a while I wondered what exactly was the point of it all. the main assertion becomes clear enough after half an hour, but the rest of the playing time is filled with rather useless things and repetitive things that have already been shown this way or in another before in the film, so it wears out and becomes extremely boring towards the end.
