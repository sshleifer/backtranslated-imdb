Monster - It was great; I loved the special effects that created this monster that looked like an updated version of "The Creature From the Black Lagoon". The scenes with this beast that roamed the land and caught people ranged from good to stunning. <br /> <br /> SOCIAL COMMENTARY: Much of the story takes place in the quarantine area as the doctors (on order of the government) state that the SARS-like illness is out there. Simply put, we have the familiar history of government coverage. You know, I expect this liberal paranoid mentality with Hollywood movies to always depict our government as corrupt, but it seems that Koreans are copying the format, and it's very boring. Here, it takes away the excitement and suspense of this "monster". Simply drag the movie. The main family described in the film must look from afar as the girl of their family, presumably dead, was dragged out of the creature. <br /> <br /> MORAL: A typical "do not pollute the water" message because this is what can happen: a horrible mutated monster. This was the message of the 1950 anti-nuclear bomb when radiation caused giant ants, spiders, fish or anything else in those schlocky science fiction movies. Now its "environmental problems" that are at the center. <br /> <br /> THE HUMOR This was mostly stupid. Normally they laugh at slapstick, but it wasn't fun. I don't know if the Korean sense of humor is pitiful, or the film was deliberately trying to be ultra-awkward with a vision of the old Godzilla movies. We hope it's the latter. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER - Video transfer was good. This was a sharp image and the sound was decent with a loud noise from people with rear speakers. I saw it in Korean with English subtitles. This may have been a mistake since the Korean guttural voice became annoying after half an hour. <br /> <br /> OVERALL - This was a promise but it turned out to be a big disappointment and too boring in too many points, which is unforgivable for a modern monster movie. Two hours was too long for this story. How this film has attracted record crowds in Korea, I don't know. They don't have to have much in terms of movies to enjoy and support.
