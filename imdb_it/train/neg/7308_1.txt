Liongate has yet to prove its worth. Every single Lionsgate film has been abysmal. I tried and tried to give them more opportunities and they continue to slap me again and again. And Cabin Fever is absolutely no exception. <br /> <br /> I couldn't even pay attention to most of this movie, it was so frustrating and bad. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot. Guy cuts dog dead for some reason. He is infected with random viruses, he transfers them to the children in a camp, the children start to get infected and die, the city finds out and instead of helping them he kills them. then the water is infected and everyone dies. at the end. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> all the characters are completely retarded, you don't care about any of them, and the only guy should get stuck with the boy meets the world. My friend and I discovered that talking about how fat and asshole our only classmate was would have been much more pleasant than paying attention to this movie. We managed to get to the end while screaming the bulls $ @ t, because this movie will make you do that. <br /> <br /> and I am still confused by the random slow motion karate moves of the only random son and the way everyone in the country is seemingly completely retarded and insensitive. And again, why did this dog attack the girl? Why did the little boy the hicks were trying to kill sit on a chair waiting for them to kill him? was that part of their plan? Wow. best plan ever I can't believe this movie had a theatrical release. I could hardly bear the DVD, let alone having to sit in a theater that doesn't move for an hour and a half. It wasn't scary, or funny, or beautiful, or nothing. it's just a waste of 90 minutes you could use for ... I don't know, plant a tree or something. it's more productive than this piece of junk. Acting, special effects and the script are a joke. never take it into consideration. <br /> <br /> Cabin fever has a bad leg shaving scene out of 10
