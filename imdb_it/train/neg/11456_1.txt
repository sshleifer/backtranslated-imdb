This is one of those movies that makes you think: Hulk "The real American" Hogan would have done the same? Frankly I don't think so and he would have been right. I'm Italian, I can't be proud of my country for many reasons, but I wouldn't have rowed for another team (the French, for example), simply because I'm in love with Juliette Binoche. Moreover the protagonist does not fall in love with the desire of an English girl at the end of the film but with a country companion, so why row against Yale. As for acting, well, all the players play very badly. And then, you know, I hated the atmosphere of the "society of dead poets". In fact this is another film I hate.
