This film is classified as a classic on sentiment and not on any quality of the film. It moves from the improbable to the incredible, from the unrealistic to the ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The incredible plot revolves around an attempt by two British soldiers and a Hindu gofer to rescue a third soldier captured by Indian rebels. In the next scene we see a complete regiment with drum and bagpipes marching in an ambush. In the British army, a sergeant does not order a rescue attempt, and if he overcomes it, he does not tempt him with a single other soldier and an Indian servant when there is a complete regiment at hand. The Indian rebels are so incredibly inept that it's ridiculous ... there are hundreds, but they can't keep the prisoner or kill the two rescuers, obviously not. At one point we see the British soldiers throwing stone blocks from the bastions of the insurgents, which are scattered around the slope of the mountain ... you should have an eggplant for a brain to think that this could cause damage. After Cary Grant while the rescued prisoner is killed, he lies on the ground looking at the water boy ... hardly the actions of someone who was shot in the back. The water boy bravely blows a trumpet (which comes from nowhere) to sound the alarm ... he does it by standing up high on a wall so that he can be seen and hit by the bad guys, and shed a tear as he keeps trying to playing more notes while being repeatedly shot and the trumpet call breaks into faint squawks ... instead of blowing the trumpet while hiding behind the cover like anyone with half a brain would. This scene has deservedly been parodized in comic sketches. If they wanted to do a comedy of Buster Keaton, they would have to hire Keaton and do it better.
