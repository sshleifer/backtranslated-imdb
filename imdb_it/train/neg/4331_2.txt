Immediately after seeing this movie you will understand why he hasn't even arrived at the cinema! This film does not deserve the "prequel" tag. Instead this is a common theme in Hollywood, snatching already good films with disastrous prequels, sequels, etc. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film bounced everywhere like a ping pong ball, and the character's development was non-existent. I seriously felt I was watching a play in some parts of the movie because the acting was so bad. P Diddy needs to stop contaminating the films with his horrible acting, made me laugh every time. <br /> <br /> The only good thing that comes out of this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis, who looks excellent in this film and actually I enjoyed watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Carlito's Way, I advise you not to watch it. If you decide to look at it anyway, treat this film as if you were tearing it away from the original, because that's exactly what it did.
