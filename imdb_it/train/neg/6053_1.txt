absolutely rubbish. I liked Halloween and from that moment on Johnny was in a downward spiral. this concerns the boxes. we take John. the pro-lifer are scary! you don't have to make a shitty movie that bores me to death to 'tell me'. <br /> <br /> Rhythm is far from here. Looks like John doesn't have much to work here. to his credit, he seems to have written this stuff. There are countless times when the camera sits and waits for the actors to look stupid or say something stupid. I love the long cut too bad carpenter doesn't know how to use it. he needs to take parts of Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago. Please, John, stop fooling yourself and boring me to death!
