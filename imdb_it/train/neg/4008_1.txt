As a fan of Sookie Stackhouse books, I find this series to be a totally crass representation of them. Vampire Bill is not very nice and looks much older than described in the book. I discovered that they created wonderfully colorful characters that look very vulgar. One of the things I loved about books is that, despite all the crap that's going through, Sookie is still a woman, yet in TV series it doesn't look like that at all. Not only that, but the prejudices displayed in the TV series are not so widespread in books. I didn't expect an exact replica of the books, but at least I expected them to feel used to the series.
