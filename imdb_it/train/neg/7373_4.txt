I don't know what other people watch Steven Seagal movies for, but I watch them because, no matter how stupid they are, they are at least always good at laughing. Why would you rate this movie as a 1 out of 10 based on dubbing, when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie like this a favorite cult that you can laugh at? <br /> <br /> Attack Force is definitely not a great film, but I thought it was a Steven Seagal vehicle worthy of many of his other films; in fact I didn't think he was one of his worst for a long shot. Most of the time, it had a coherent halfway line, and was, for the most part, fundamentally exciting. The ending really sucked, but that too had some pleasantly trash elements. In the end the story itself didn't give what it promised, but actually I thought that acting, characterization (if I can use such a big word) and the rest of production values ​​provided exactly what a true Steven Seagal fan would expect. The same Seagal in particular was exactly the man with the stone face and no frills that is expected, and the rest of the cast supported him quite well, without ever staging it. This, folks, is what a Steven Seagal film does. Deal with it. Or even better: laugh at it. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
