A really terrible film. At first I didn't know it was a Kiwi effort, but I soon began to understand that all the characters were talking with kiwifruit accents barely concealed under false Americans. Why did it have to be set in America anyway? - could have been set in New Zealand and then the actors could have used their normal voices. Surely someone in the production team might hear the terrible attempts to speak with American accents? A bad bad movie. I'm surprised it lasted so long: how did it get out of the can? It seemed only a very poor attempt at a Segal / Willis action movie. A total of dirty money! If there was TAXPAYER money in this piece of junk, I'd be driving a revolution to put all the money back in the treasure. I'm still fumbling (take it, pun!, To the absolute garbage I just saw. Why did I keep looking? Well, I'm a movie fanatic and I can't help myself!
