I just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A group of kids, from 14 to 22 put on the "Titanic" DVD on a fantastic deal of home entertainment mega screen. Only two of them had seen him before. But everyone had seen the moment of Kate, Leo and Celine Dion so many times that many of them felt they had seen the whole movie. Shortly after the epic, they started to become restless, some of them left to ask the others: "call us when the iceberg appears". Within an hour and a half in the film, only the two girls who had seen the movie before were still there. They began to shout: icebergs, icebergs. A stampede followed, they all returned to see the sinking of the Titanic. They gasped, uttering Oh and far away. So, just like I thought when the movie first entered the scene. What is this? An hour and a half waiting for the bloody thing to sink, but as for the rest. Dr. Zivagho, for example, had a similar execution time, but think about what happens in that film over the same period of time. In "Titanic" Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands of, presumably, creme de la creme in the ship's first-class dining room. Look at the historical details, if you can find them. The plot is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shots into a sinking ship. The real sinking here is film standards. All efforts focus on special effects and opening weekends. The film has become the highest grossing film of all time, so what do I know?
