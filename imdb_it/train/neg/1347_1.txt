Inspector Gadget was probably my favorite cartoon from the 1980s. I liked both the first and the second season of the series as well as the Christmas special of 1992 "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas". Some Gadget fans are ready to criticize the second season (1985) of the show, but they have to compare it to DiC's 2002 release of "The last case of Inspector Gadget: Claw's Revenge" and then find the second season as absolute gold . <br /> <br /> Being a gadget fan, I could not resist the opportunity to see the Inspector gadget animated in something that was not related to the Gadget Boy. I bought the film and swore to myself that I would be objective; I knew that sometimes artistic freedoms would be taken from the original series. I wasn't even prepared for what I was about to see. <br /> <br /> There was just a modicum of the original show still intact. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief list of some of these the negative aspects of this film: * Humor is non-existent compared to the original series. <br /> <br /> * Penny and Brain (originally with almost the same part in the Gadget series) lack the action for fifteen years at a twenty-minute interval. <br /> <br /> * Saban & Levy's original music is not present, and the score that exists is below average. (I realized that Saban has his own production company now, but at least "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" had good music, even without Saban.) * Don't expect to see any of Gadget's gadgets that make the show as appealing as the gadget -copter, gadget-brella, gadget-mallet, gadget-coat (which was actually used but was not even called the same thing), as well as its other standard gadgets. In this film, his gadget legs were telescopic instead of springs. That kind of thing annoys the real fans of the show, and it's simply not necessary to change. <br /> <br /> * The gadgetmobile of the original series is now a "hip" convertible that speaks quickly, presumably. All fans of the original series appreciated the mobile gadget that turned into the gadget van and vice versa. <br /> <br /> * The Quimby boss is now very irascible and even bad with Gadget. He was always grumpy in the original series, but this pushes the situation a little too much. <br /> <br /> * Penny no longer has a computer book. <br /> <br /> Are there any positives for this movie? OK, here it is ... <br /> <br /> * Maurice LaMarche does a good job of taking over for the great Don Adams as Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> * In one scene, Chief Quimby alludes to an actual villain of the cartoon series: the Grande Wambini (classic "Gadget" from the second season, voiced by Louis Nye). <br /> <br /> Are you looking for other ransom factors for this movie? Well, you're unlucky. Life is making choices and living with these choices. Most situations in life have a purpose even if it is to teach a lesson. The lesson learned here: keep the original formula! "If it's not broken, don't fix it." True Gadget fans should stay away from this movie; you will surely be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Let's hope so, DiC and Shout! Factory will continue to publish more original series after the 2006 release of "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1", containing the first 22 episodes of the series. Being a true Gadget fan, lover of the 80s and many of the DiC programs, I invite the viewer to purchase "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" DVDs that are excellent and sure to bring back nice memories.
