I just saw this horrible thing on TV. Needless to say, it's one of those movies that you only watch to see how much worse it can get. Frankly, I don't know how much lower the bar can go. <br /> <br /> The characters are composed of one stuck stereo type after another, and the obvious attempt to create another "Bad News Bears" is embarrassing to say VERY minimal. <br /> <br /> I have seen some fine turkeys in my time, but there is no reason to list them because this is "Number One". <br /> <br /> Let me put it this way, I saw the Vanilla Ice movie, because it was so bad it was fun. This ... this ... is NOT even so beautiful.
