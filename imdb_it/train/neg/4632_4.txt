Maria Bello seems not to care about what people think of her choices in the roles of movies. Again he chooses a film that is very difficult and not popular to play. Maybe he needs those movies, to take off the sugar-clad clothes (or "Hollywood") he does here and then (Coyote Ugly and of course Mummy 3). <Br /> <br /> Even though I think I can't get what it proposes to do (I won't ruin it), Maria Bello is fantastic as in her other independent / small films in which she acts. It is his interpretation that elevates this film. This combined with the strange topic has almost done the trick for me. But in the end (and even if I try to overlook some flaws, like bad rhythm and dramaturgy), the film is still too long
