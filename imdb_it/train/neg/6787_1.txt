I'm sorry to report that I've seen this movie several times. When he bombed at the box office, he was repeated at night for about a month on HBO. And I looked at it again and again because television in general is so bad - or it was at that time. I no longer look, so it might be wonderful now - as Samuel L Jackson says about pigs, "It might look like a sweet potato pie, but I'll never know why I wouldn't eat the dirty beer." Let's see. Dudley plays Arthur wandering in the desert, always a few steps away from Moses. He came out immediately after Life of Bryan, so you can guess where the inspiration for this comes from. The few slightly funny parts go on too long until you close your eyes and grit your teeth. There is a scene in which Arthur and Dom Deluise meet in the desert, both dragged out and dehydrated, dying of thirst. Then they meet like old acquaintances who don't know each other very well, they promise to have lunch. It could have been fun. <br /> <br /> But the scene that I remember most clearly is a meeting with the pharaoh in which the pharaoh is a black street boy in complete King Tut's regalia. He must have read the lines well because at some point prior to publication, he overdid his scene with the Hollywood equivalent of black street jargon voiced by an aspiring Jimmy Walker (Kid Dyno-wannabe). Or could it have been Jimmy Walker - who knows? Who cares. They've managed to turn an essentially boring scene into a very racist, very unpleasant, very long piece of excrement, one of those legendary things that wouldn't blush, no matter how many times you tried, so leave it there for someone else to deal with. <br /> <br /> Well this is my review. If you rent this movie (DO NOT BUY IT WHEN YOU MAKE IT!) Prepare yourself with a bottle of tequila and a six-pack of Corona. <br /> <br /> Now that the Poseiden adventure has been redone, this one is probably at the top of the remake list. Maybe they'll hire a comedy writer this time.
