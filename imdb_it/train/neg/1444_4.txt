The film is very long and unfortunately very different from the novel. If you want to watch the film, then don't read the novel first, because it will shock you. However, cinematography was OK and if you are a person who loves the kinds of adventure that explores Africa, then go and do it. Substitutive recitations are adequate, however many important events that were present in the novel have been omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was looking for his missing brother rather than a woman in search of his father. Gagool was astute and was killed in the cave, while here he proved to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king.
