Looking through the other comments, I am amazed that there are no warnings to potential viewers of what they have to look at when they rent this junk. First of all, I rented this thing with the knowledge that it was an expertly delivered Indiana Jones knock-off. What I got was one of the most offensive films that I remember trying to sit down, made even more shocking by the film's relatively high production values. <br /> <br /> I don't think this is a spoiler, but if it is, be warned ... <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​entertainment is to watch Bimbo be raped from behind by Fearsome Tribal Chief, while she is staring at the dead eyes of her severed head from the other significant, all means, rent this movie. If not, I would recommend looking elsewhere for entertainment. <br /> <br /> Come to think of it, that scene summarizes the film so briefly that there's nothing else I really need to say about it.
