... but this must be the worst Christmas Carol adaptation of all time. And this requires some activity, something with the pleasure of various Lifetime efforts. Don't get me wrong - I have nothing against Cicely Tyson. I liked very much in other roles (look at Sipsey in Fried Green Tomatoes, for example). But the script offers her no choice but to chew the scenery. And chew it, with all the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim that binds a Christmas goose. <br /> <br /> Give me the classics at any time: Alastair Sim, 1951. With the possible exception of Scrooged, all the others are only exaggerated efforts to capture the spirit of Christmas past, present or future.
