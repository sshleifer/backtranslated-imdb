God, I was bored by my head while watching this pilot. I was expecting a lot from this, as I am a big fan of James Cameron (and not just from "Titanic", I might add), and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality (again, he also has written the Strange Days lead ..). But it failed miserably to capture my attention at any time during its nearly two hour duration. In all that time, he barely went beyond his two-line synopsis, and I would be very difficult not to try to understand any kind of coherent plot from all the chaos of wires that went nowhere. Furthermore, I do not believe that the stunts exceed even those of any regular "A-Team" episode. As for Alba, yes, she is beautiful, of course, but the fact that she shows only one facial expression throughout the film (sulky and sullen) also makes me tire very soon of her joke "gal wit an attitude". You can count on me, Mr. Cameron!
