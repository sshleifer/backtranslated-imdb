This show presents interesting places as fast as the travel channel. It is branded as a reality but in reality it is pure soap opera in the early evening. Try to use exotic venues as a fa√ßade to bring people into a fake contest and then proceed to hook the spectators on the soap opera style of the competitors. <br /> <br /> He also borrows from a precocious pioneer of CBS games - Beat The Clock - inventing situations for his competitors to try and pass. So reward the winner's money. If they can revive it with a little interaction between the characters, even better. While the format of the game is in slow motion against Beat The Clock, the real goal of this series is to escape reality. <br /> <br /> This show has elements of different types of successful past programs. Reality television, hardly, but if you are passionate about competitors, clubs or contests, this is your cup of tea. If you don't, this whole series is like I say, that drips of sauce. It's another show that hides behind the label of reality that is the trend that began in 2000. <br /> <br /> It is an elegant and well-made product, so it could last a little longer. After all, there are also replicas of Gilligan's Island, Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies and The Brady Bunch. This simply does not employ professional actors. The level of intelligence is almost the same.
