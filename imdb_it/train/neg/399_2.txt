This photo started with good intentions, Bacon the scientist to test the invisibility theory, and Shue is pretty as usual in her role. After all this is all in pieces, it's the typical Hollywood thriller now, shot on stage with plenty of special effects, without any kind of humor, spirit or soul. In other words, don't waste your time looking at this. Take instead the tape of the audio cassette with John DeLancie as Invisible Man, with also Leonard Nimoy. Now that was fine, and HG Wells is well served, unlike this mess.
