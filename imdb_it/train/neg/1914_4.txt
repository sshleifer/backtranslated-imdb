it's not bad, but it's not good. it's just fun. <br /> <br /> like a comedy that should be, it's terrible. Not a lot of laughs at all, because every line of the film has been made a million times. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because all the actors in the film are usually very good, but none of them really does much. and the ending sucks.
