This film has the potential to be really good, considering that some of the plot elements have been borrowed from science-fiction shareholder THE HIDDEN. And Dolph always makes a poor appeal to his roles. But someone somewhere has really dropped the ball on this one. <br /> <br /> Dolph plays a kicking monk (!) who travels to New York to retrieve a key that opens a door under his monastery that imprisoned the antichrist for 2,000 years. He must fight the servant, who is a spirit that jumps from one body to another very similar to THE HIDDEN and JASON GOES HELL. The servant, of course, wants the key so he can get the antichrist out. Along with the ride there is a boring archaeologist and together she and Dolph are chased by the bodies possessed by the followers. <br /> <br /> If I'm having fun with this sound, forget it. The rhythm is very embarrassing and weak, the best of acting and the fight scenes staged badly. Dolph sleepwalking through his role and makes some of the worst dialogues of his career spring up. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor really comes to an end when the follower fights against an army of monks armed with machine guns in the monastery, but the rest of this film is a snoozefest. <br /> <br /> Too bad, I really wanted to like it.
