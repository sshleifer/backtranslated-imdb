This film was definitely not one of the best films of Mary-Kate and Ashley. I didn't really like it, and I was a little disappointed with that movie. For some reason, it seemed like it was a movie they put together very quickly. In some parts it has become so boring that I had to speed it up. He had no bloopers or exciting parts like their other films.
