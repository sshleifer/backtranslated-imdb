I took it in the video store because of Tarantino's recommendation ("If you don't like it (this), go f & ^% yourself!") On the box ... it looked like a revolving signature ... I was expecting something more like "Death Proof" ... not much actual violence in this one tho, or plot, character or dialogue. <br /> <br /> See the poster. It's all there. Acrobatics and rock. Go back and forth. A week or so in the life of a Los Angeles band that makes a crappy magic show, at a level you could see in one of the smaller casinos outside the Strip, and a new Australian stuntman in town who finds his feet. .. They work, meet girls, celebrate. End of the story. <br /> <br /> The band obviously needed all those things because they were frankly second, and they played a style that was already dated in 1978. It must be said that the acrobatic parts of the film are really spinningling - that Australian it's really something, and the film seems largely motivated by love and respect for "art". I hung it there to see what crazy thing it would do next. I just hope he found a better vehicle.
