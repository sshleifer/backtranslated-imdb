The week before I saw Iowa, I saw Art School Confidential, in which a pretentious student makes a film and cannot decide if he wants it to be a work of art or a violent exploitation. Iowa could be the film he made. I can see much better film elements in Iowa - Spun and Natural Born Killers. However, in addition to craftsmanship, both films had good character development and consistent narrative lines. Iowa. This film stumbles into an absurd end. I must admit that it was consistent. This film is ugly from start to finish and not particularly bad or better anywhere. The actors did everything they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves better. Show that you are very talented, very funny and very sexy. But why must he prove it in this turd ball.
