The only saving quality of this melodramatic mixture is the scenario of southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri who sings the acronym. Stephanie Powers is mixed and betrayed by a fake accent. As has been pointed out, is she too old to play an eighteen year old and looks too young like a grandmother with a college-age niece? Lee Remick is good even though he is ageless in his later years. The talented Joanna Lumley is underutilized and even manages to look young forever when her middle-aged son (Robert Urich) finally marries grandmother Stephanie Powers. Stacey Keach's incessant arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him. Don't you know how a viewer could relate to his excessive portrait? The most credible performance is that of Ian Richardson, who makes the rest of the cast look like amateurs. It puts a strain on the credulity that handsome male suitors in this epic would always remain single as they wait patiently for the theme of their affections to finally agree to accept them. Can anyone believe that the handsome Robert Urich will remain single for decades waiting for Stephanie Powers to finally accept her endless marriage proposals? The commitment of the Second World War between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is ridiculous. To begin with, the Germans did not occupy the section of Provence in France until the end of the war, it was controlled by the French puppet government of Vichy. Do we see the French resistance staging a daytime raid in Mistral's villa to steal the sheets, after which they all sit under a bridge waiting for a tiring load of Nazi troops to surprise and destroy them? If you want to see a mini-series set in a foreign country, don't look at Mistral's Daughter. A better alternative would be The Thorn Birds.
