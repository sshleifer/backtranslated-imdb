In a nutshell, this is the worst movie from "Police Academy: Mission to Moscow" (if you enjoyed that movie you will probably like this). <br /> <br /> What were they thinking? Some ideas should remain just that, an idea. The fact that this idea could itself be filmed should be a crime. <br /> <br /> What's so bad about it, I hear you ask. A word ... EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> Rental cost: $ 4.50 Cost in time to watch: 89 minutes <br /> <br /> I want a refund for both!
