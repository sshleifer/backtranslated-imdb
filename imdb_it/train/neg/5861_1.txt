I saw this film when it was first released in 1978, when I was in my second year in high school. I made an appointment to see it. I have not "understood", needless to say, because the film was so bad! Joan Rivers' career never went as badly as she deserved after committing this horrible crap. In fact, unfunny is not a strict enough term: this film is ANTI-FUN! Come out feeling as if any laughter that could have occurred had been beaten by you before it could happen. This is not worth looking for out of curiosity, or for any sense that it is "so-bad-is-good". Not even the MST3K gang could have made it worth seeing! The fact that Billy Crystal's career has survived this first suicide attempt is a miracle.
