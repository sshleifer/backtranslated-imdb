If I had to create a film thermometer, this film would be absolute zero. Out of ten stars, I would classify it as follows: <br /> <br /> Plot: zero stars Video quality: zero stars Audio quality: zero stars Acting: zero stars <br /> <br /> It's like school students superiors gathered one afternoon with a camera, invented a plot and shot a movie. It is so devoid of any artistic value that I would prefer to watch children walking in a high school to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, something must be said about the abyssal depths. The "shooting" in the staircase is one of the most enjoyable scenes ever. First of all, the fighters simply shake the plastic guns against each other, moving their arms back and forth to simulate the recoil. The pair actually "duck" the bullets that do not exist in each other. No rings, no sparks, no empty spaces, just waving the splashes sprayed around. If you want to see two adult men playing "actor", do it one day ... after cleaning the refrigerator, combing the carpet, polishing all the handles, raking the gravel, straightening the books on the shelf, etc. .
