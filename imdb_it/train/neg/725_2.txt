This was a terrible movie! Not for the subject, but for the delivery. At the time I went with my girlfriend (when the movie came out), expecting to see a film about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression. What we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression, without any lifting at the end. The previews and announcements did not mention this! Also, for all that whoopi goldberg played, my memory is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the previews say nothing! (not that you expect it, but it's just more of the problem). If I had known how depressing this film would be, I would never have seen it. Or at least, I would have been prepared for this. This was an advertising campaign for bait and switch, and I'll never see this movie again!
