The world could be finished. Unfortunately this film survived as yet another testament to Canada's inability to make films that go beyond the execrable. Maybe it's because all our good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Short and others) go to Hollywood. In fact, it's a shame. Short has not been included in this incredibly pretentious and banal film. It may have given you some credibility. The Canadian government should realize - and this film is a magnificent example - that shoveling money into the trough is not good cinema. If the people who accumulated these public funds were to compete, they could have been forced to invent something useful. Just as they have produced yet another embarrassing embarrassment.
