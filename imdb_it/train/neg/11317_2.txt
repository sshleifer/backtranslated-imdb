This move is as bad as they are. I was, however, forced to give him a 2 for the scenario. There are many beautiful Southwestern shots including many in Monument Valley, one of the most breathtaking places in the United States. It is also, starting with John Ford, one of the most filmed. Actually a scene with Kris and the girl was shot in a place called John Ford's point.
