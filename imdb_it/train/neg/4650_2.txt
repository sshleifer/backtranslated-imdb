With a cast of brave British character actors and a pleasant picture of fifties Britain, I had hoped and expected to be more entertained by this film. Unfortunately I found myself stuck for wrong reasons - I couldn't believe how horrible it was. I must have watched thousands of old movies and am always ready to consider the products of their time, but it was really difficult. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, the main problem is that it does not work seems to know what it wants to be: a romantic comedy, a slapstick comedy or a musical. I was a little stunned when Jeannie Carson suddenly played the song for about 15 minutes! It is not credible at any level, nor the plot itself nor the fact that Daisy never seems to have an ounce of threat in her at any time. Other aspects that defied credibility included casting the suave Donald Sinden as a songwriter (a songwriter for God's sake!), The fact that he has Diana Dors for a girlfriend and doesn't seem to have the slightest interest in her (I mean, Diana Dors! Come on!) And a ridiculous scene in the office of a song publisher. The whole thing is silly in the worst way. <br /> <br /> If I had to choose a favorite scene it would be just that at the beginning with that wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson - after everything went downhill in a big way.
