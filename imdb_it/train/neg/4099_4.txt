Mulva is added to a Teen Ape sugercoma. When she wakes up it's noticeably warmer (the parts played by Debbie Rochon in this sequel) and takes revenge on those who have hurt her. Since the subtitle and the art of the box imply that this is really a take-off in the "Kill Bill" films, but it is a film by Chris Seaver, it is a wildly incompetent satire (and I use this extreme term extremely approximate). to say this is better than the first film, but actually I was so crazy when I saw the previous film that I can't even hope to compare the two right now. But I've had fun since I bought the sequel (see when I'm drunk I like it, for lack of a better word, complete movies and total crap) There are some loud laughter (very few) but I remember Bonejack is more fun though. Well, at least a little over an hour, it's too powerful for what it's worth. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: audio commentary by director Chris Seaver, actress Debbie Rochon and the Lbp band; Second comment by Seaver; 31 minutes Making of featurette; Lloyd Kaufman is a 6-minute tribute to low-budget photos; False syrup commercial for 2 minutes; image gallery; Promotional trailer; and trailer for: Mulva "," Quest for the Egg Salad "," Fiilthy McNasty "1, 2 and 3;" the Feral Man "," the Bonesetter "," Midnight Skater "," Demon Summer "and" Splatter Rampage Wrestling "
