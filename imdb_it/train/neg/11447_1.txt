Most likely the worst movie I've ever seen; I was ready to go out after the first ten minutes. The only people who laughed in the theater were the tweener. Don't get me wrong, I love stupid and stupid movies as much as the next girl, but the whole premise, the smelly writing and humor. It seemed to me that they were about to hear "Napoleon Dynamite" - strange and random scenes that would lead to a cult audience. Instead, he ended up being forced, clumsy and strange. <br /> <br /> The only bright light was Isla Fisher and I felt absolutely terrible that she (and Sissy Spacek) had signed up for this horrible thing. /> <br /> Thank God I didn't pay for it.
