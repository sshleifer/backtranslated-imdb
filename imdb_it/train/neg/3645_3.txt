A young man has a bad day, goes out on a hill and falls where he cannot escape. Then, he meets MR. ATLAS, a "mythological" guy of 2,000 years ago as his best friend, and an Arnold Schwarzenegger with a similar appearance and sound. His Herculean strength helps the boy out of danger and later adapts to modern life. So what's the big deal? This is the most suggestive idea for a "family" trip! However, this should not have been attempted at all, really! Our fictional character of strength and courage is nothing but a typical stranger who appears ordinary to the rest of the universe. Adding to blasphemy is the lack of something new or attractive, and before you know it, there is some attempt at violence that does not qualify it as "family" entertainment. However, the scene in which Atlas complains of his undershorts is a murmur. Spend a nice, quiet afternoon in the park for a change.
