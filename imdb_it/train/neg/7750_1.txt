This film was the worst movie ever made on the planet, I like BARNEY more than this movie. The graphics suck, half of the film is animated, death sucks and, above all, I was ready to SUE the people who made this film! PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR LIFE THROUGH THIS FILM. The only positive thing was when the movie ******* is finished! This film is 50% of Jurassic Park, 0.1% of Sabretooth and 49.9% of DUMB! Please don't waste your time watching this movie, you will regret it. Want to know why this movie sucks? Well, the cover sucked, the graphics sucked, the blood seemed (I mean) ketchup, people tried to blow themselves up, college students think about it and can resist the animal. I mean, there was a 5-footed tiger running straight against a woman, she throws a spear from the one 100 feet away! WAIT UNTIL YOU WOULD LIKE! Even the acting was horrible. Jurrasic Park is actually a good movie, and this just had to go and ruin it.
