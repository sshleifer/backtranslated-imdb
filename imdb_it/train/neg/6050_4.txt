I simply can't believe the number of people who favorably compare it to the first movie. I was moved to leave this comment! This is just an obvious attempt to cash in on the success of the first movie. The dialogue is terrifying and nothing more authentic or irresistible than the original film. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the portrait of the French police is ridiculous and the characterization of Doyle within a mile of the first film. <br /> <br /> How many heads of drugs do you think of going to the port in person to see a shipment arrive? The ease with which Doyle finds his boyfriend is simply pathetic. Like all French policemen, they were drinking coffee until Doyle arrived from America and did some real police work. What a joke. Try going to a foreign city and discovering the biggest memorabilia of the place with a travel map and some tourist brochures. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> A truly terrible sequel, anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy.
