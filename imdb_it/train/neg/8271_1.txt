"Handsome boys with ugly haircuts !!" "Beautiful girls with no clue !!" "Stupid gangsters who can't shoot straight !!" From the Dragon Dynasty comes the Hong Kong gangster drama, "Dragon Heat". For reasons that are likely to be completely obscured, the production and cast of this "criminal on steroids" film have somehow allowed Maggie Q and Michael Biehn to become villains. But they don't have much to do in this horrible slug festival. <br /> <br /> They are two of the best contemporary actors in circulation, each with their own curriculum and a list of successes, and Biehn in particular had the courage to take on rather demanding and non-heroic roles. <br /> <br /> Maggie Q was the super villain "Mai" in "Live Free Or Die Hard", so "he said". /> <br /> Biehn is, of course, famous for being the soldier from the future who made the 1984 "Terminator" a credible sci-fi / fantasy science fiction, crashing into Big Arnold, who is now the Governor of California !! <br /> <br /> Michael Biehn is almost completely wasted in this terrible train accident of a police drama. There is absolutely no reason for this, since the incredibly twisted plot - mostly given in Chinese, as it is a Hong Kong story - could have been better elaborated for a non-Chinese audience with a foreign storyteller. <br /> <br /> In other words, if Biehn had been used as something like an observer or Interpol coordinator, or an undercover agent, who needs to get some explanations every five or ten minutes, it would have been great. But no, he joined a strange group of special forces - like villains who seem to be freelancers for their corrupt business, in the midst of someone else's totally corrupt affair involving the local king of corrupt business. <br /> <br /> Yes, there, I said everything. Confused? Me too. "Welcome to the party, friend." <br /> <br /> In the truly exceptional Hong Kong drama, known by the English title of "Breaking News", there are also a number of fascinating characters at work, but there is only one plot in the plot. <br /> <br /> Bad guys against good cops. In this miserable and overly violent incursion into the world of a Hong Kong Triad, or gang, it seems that the hot-shot police force is little more than a parade of ducks on a shooting range, the way criminals mop them up . <br /> <br /> So, not surprisingly, there is an almost otherwise incomprehensible scene (several scenes, in fact), in which children are trying to shoot wood ducks in an arcade game, to win prizes for stuffed animals. And so well-placed police officers naturally intervene on their behalf, so the arcade owner has to give up the Kewpie dolls. <br /> <br /> There is also an unenthusiastic attempt to create an "love" interest between one of the "visiting policemen" and the only female "visiting policeman". <br /> <br / > Visiting policemen should be material witnesses against the head of the Triad gangster, who is hijacked while going to his court appearance, but not by his own team but by mercenaries (Biehn, Maggie Q and some others). murderers want something but we don't learn to know what it is, until the end of the movie !! That was a stupid mistake in the overall story. <br /> <br /> You can't create suspense in a dramatic crime without something to get, or get, or get away from, being introduced very early in history. <br /> <br /> Add to this some "cut scenes" made for purely artistic effects, all of which show the recent past of the bad guys and the regular bad guys , and any movie fan can understand promptly because this barking dog gets a vote from this fan of all that is cinematic with criminals and conspirators and Hong Kong.
