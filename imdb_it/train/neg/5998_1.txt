The basic formula for the original series was; take someone, make the audience like it, then put it in mortal danger. This formula worked for the 32 episodes made between 1964-68. <br /> <br /> Now let's take a leap forward of 40 years until 2004. We are introduced to Alan Tracy, a little boy of the college a little less diligent, with his friend, Fermat, a young saputello. They are left by Lady Penelope in her pink Ford Thunderbird at the island paradise where the Tracy family lives, for the school holidays. Almost immediately, they are left in the care of Kyrano and his daughter Tin-Tin while the adults go to rescue John from Thunderbird 5 which was damaged by an accident on stage. All this is part of The Hood scheme to take control of Tracy Island so it can steal Thunderbird's machines ... <br /> <br /> ?? To rob a bank! <br /> <br /> Yes. The plot is so soft! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is trivial, the acting more in wood than that of the puppets (in fiberglass), the effects, anything but special and the score of Hans Zimmer ??? What little of Barry Gray's glorious theme shone through Zimmer's lackluster orchestration. The rest of the score was eminently forgettable. In fact, part of the soundtrack was broadcast the following week on the radio and did not recognize it! I didn't even bother to stay to witness Busted's mediocre efforts with the final titles <br /> <br /> To be honest, Ron Cook worked very well as Parker, he and Sophia Myles while Penelope seemed wasted. With the right material, they could have been showers. The CGI work was what I would have called the vanguard - 5 years ago. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the main trade were wrong; The models of the original series at least moved as if they had mass <br /> <br /> Another sore point was that the entire production seemed to be a long series of product placements, from every vehicle built by Ford to the entire contents of the Tracy Freezer produced by Ben & Jerry's. <br /> <br /> My son (9) enjoyed the film but this cross between Spy Kids and 'Clockstoppers', aimed directly at his age group, added nothing to the Thunderbirds legend. When Star Trek hit the big screen in 1979 with "The Motion Picture", a new life was suspended in the franchise which continued for another 20 years or so. With this film, Frakes lost a golden opportunity to do the same with the Thunderbirds franchise. I predict that this film, like "The Avengers" and "The Saint", will sink into darkness within 6 months, leaving the original series in its "classic" state.
