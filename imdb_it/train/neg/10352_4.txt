I only recently discovered that Madeleine L'Engle's novel was turned into a Disney TV movie and ordered the DVD. The book was one of my favorites when I was a child and I read it several times. <br /> <br /> Despite some of the child actors who do not resemble the characters described in the novel, the Murry family is well launched, with a nice (albeit pretty) Meg in the middle and a Charles Wallace who is as convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is quite promising, doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the main characters and preparing the scene. Unfortunately as soon as the non-human characters appear, the adaptation begins to extricate itself and once the children leave the earth, the whole thing falls apart. Alfre Woodward has an air too young and too regal as the eccentric Mrs Whatsit (think instead of Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright) and Kate Nelligan is so mask and expressionless that she must have visited Faye Dunaway's plastic surgeon in recent years. For some reason, Mrs Mrs makes her look like Glinda of the Wizard of Oz when she should have looked like a benign Wicked Witch of the West. <br /> <br /> In the end what most disappoints this is the special terrible effects and artistic direction. I understand this is a TV movie, but the CGI looked like something that could have been done 15 years ago. The incarnation of the centaur of Mrs Whatsits is a disaster, as is the dress of Chewbacca for Aunt Beast, who in the novel is a velvety and elegant creature instead of the awkward Big Foot like the one shown here. I could go on, almost every artistic choice is a disaster, presumably because there was not a budget big enough to do justice, but also because the design work lacks imagination and common sense. <br /> <br /> He would really need the sense of wonder that Spielberg brought to his first films. Too bad that with the current popularity of the adaptation of the literary fantasy series for children no one has thought of adapting A Wrinkle in Time and the sequels for the big screen, giving it the purpose it deserves.
