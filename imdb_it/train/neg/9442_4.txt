I tried to appreciate this slasher, as if I tried to enjoy all the slasher movies. I mean brainless killing mixed with some nudity and some suspense, how can you go wrong. But Unhinged I think is an example of that formula that is going wrong. The main problem is the horrible acting of the three main girls who have landed at home. It was as if they were under sedation, and kept me from ever being interested in their situation. The film aims at suspense and the creepy, but the direction of the numbers makes it insignificant and leaves the film rather boring. It's a shame, because if the film were done better, it would have been an ace. The story and the characters are quite disturbing and there are some dark and strangely funny moments of interaction between the mother, the girls and her daughter in the old house. There is a bit of nudity and occasional blood splatter, not enough to give the film the calcium it needs. The ending is rather distorted and frightening, and gives the film a great success but unfortunately it's too late. So, in my opinion, one to avoid, unless you really love the dark movies. There is a good deal of potential, but the film offers too little to be useful.
