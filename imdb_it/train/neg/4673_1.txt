I love the books of Henry James and Washington Square was no exception. I was very excited to see a new movie coming out, based on the book of that title. Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin good enough to play the main roles. Albert Finney is uncomfortable and does not play the role well. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith ... or rather her foolish and insipid role. The real problem and what is missing in this latest version is a good script, music and direction. I fell asleep at the theater watching this long movie, pulled out and exceptionally boring. There are more pauses in the dialog of a Pinter playback. In the book I felt a profound care for Catherine Sloper and her life. The film had the opposite effect. I also didn't like the turn in which his aunt had a sexual attraction for Morris. Eeeeeeeek. YUK. <br /> <br /> See if you can't sleep, it's a definite snoozer. Don't watch it if you're depressed. You will need Zoloft after this. <br /> <br /> Of course, "The Heiress" was exceptional with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in the leading roles. The actor who played his father was in the sign of careless, cold father .... still grieving for his dead wife and hating Catherine for it. The film was not faithful to the book, but neither is this one. <br /> <br /> This film was a box office flop. I have no doubt as to why.
