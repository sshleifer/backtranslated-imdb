A funny comedy, so familiar, about the sympathetic Paul (Jason Lee), who after the night of his bachelor party, wakes up in bed with Becky (Julia Stiles), an attractive blonde she met the night before. After lying about his girlfriend Karen (Selma Blair), he is forced to tell more and more lies to cover his tracks. I'm sure many of us have witnessed a story like this one at least once before ... on the film or on TV. The film is formidable and EXTREMELY predictable, with an ending that you could see coming a mile away. <br /> <br /> At least the cast offers some interest and keeps it watchable. Lee is right in the lead, and Stiles has a lot of fun in a light comic role and different from the very serious roles he usually plays. Becky is a free spirit who seems to change jobs whenever others change clothes. <br /> <br /> But you know, this is not exactly written well. At least one question remains unanswered: WHAT, exactly, Ray (Lochlyn Munro), Becky's brutal ex-boyfriend investigated by the AI? <br /> <br /> And I didn't like the character of Buck (David Koechner), Paul's stepfather; he is a very hateful moron who gave me nerves so fast that I was asking someone to punch him. <br /> <br /> Add another debt: a free cameo not credited by comedian / actor Larry Miller, once again playing fool (in this case, it's a bit justified - his character is an ultra- minister conservative). <br /> <br /> Not good at all, but as usual for me, I give him a three out of ten based on the efforts of the cast alone.
