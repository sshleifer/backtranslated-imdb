Trying to conceive something as bland as THE SENTINEL would be rather difficult. The problems are many. The result is terrible and full of holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas plays Pete Garrison, a secret service agent who "got one" for Reagan during the attack on his life. Years later we find Pete assigned to the Whitehouse family, mainly as a guard for the First Lady (Kim Basinger, L. CONFIDENTIAL). The problems arise when we see Pete's close involvement with the First Lady and a sudden threat against the President himself (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When Pete fails a polygraph test, he is identified as an unsatisfied agent by investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series). <br /> <br /> As the plot of the presidential murder unfolds, Pete finds himself fleeing his own people. His only confidant is the First Lady, and is reluctant to tell any of their loved ones. for the other (which is why Pete failed the polygraph in the first place). But is Pete really innocent? Or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the president? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while escaping from the secret service? <br /> <br /> The only big, overwhelming problem with this film is that there is no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat. Isn't that what the movie should be? You might think so! But the public is never disappointed about why the killer (s) wants to kill the Prez. Hmm. Does anyone forget to put it in the script somewhere? <br /> <br /> And what is the new partner of David Breckinridge (Kiefer), Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S WAY)? It appears to have been inserted into the film as a piece of candy. What was his purpose again? Did you do anything other than look good in tight pants and a low-cut blouse? <br /> <br /> There are so many problems with The Sentinel's basic premise that it's ridiculous. The action is too easily hindered by "What the ...?" answers that will surely be pronounced by those who are unlucky to watch the film.
