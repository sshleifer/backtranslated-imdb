Let's face it; a lame child who dies and has his soul transferred to a scarecrow. It won't happen neva! OMFG This stupid unlucky boy who can't stand on his own takes his ass at the hands of a drunken bastard who fucks his mother. As soon as he dies, he looks at the scarecrow and lets his spirit enter the scarecrow. The drunk covered his death making him a suicide and he thought he was gone. Later we see that he is thrown out of the trailer and later earns another encounter with the scarecrow. They had a brief meeting that included the drunk who calls him a loser and the scarecrow that bounces with "Take one to know one, loser!" The scarecrow sweeps the building away, calls it "daddy-o" and then beheads the poor man. We can see how this fantastic film develops. He later kills many people. He mainly kills people who gave him a hard time in rl and leaves to kill some random donkey, just for a laugh. Don't laugh here. It also adds a punch line to each kill. Every time he killed someone, he did some karate throws and ended up with one of his punch signature. In the case of someone who was hearing impaired, he would have said "Here, you have a corn EAR!" then push it in the ass. Or we can really make an example from the movie! He just finished killing a policeman and was going to kill the only person who ever stood up for him. His father, the sheriff, shouted at the madman to stop, and he said "Hey, stay a while!" and he threw a dagger threw his chest and set him on a tree. At the end of the film, he killed two boys and threw "I have to split!" and killed two men pushing a scythe into their heads. Wowzors, this film made me want to smear my pants so badly. Maybe the next time this guy makes a movie, he won't be gay.
