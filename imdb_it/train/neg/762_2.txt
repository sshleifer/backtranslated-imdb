Loyalty to Peter Falk is all that prevented me from giving this terrible image the (1) it deserved. (Because of this, loyalty to Mr. Falk was the thing that kept me from watching this film from head to toe.) Even if you forgive all the glaring mistakes, this was simply the poorest excuse for a TV product Columbo "movie of all time. I'm glad I saw it on TV for free; he would have hated coughing up the dollars for a print.
