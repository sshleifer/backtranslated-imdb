This show made me feel physically sick and totally detached from British society as a whole. It was programs like this and Blue Peter that pretended there were no class divisions in Britain. They always said things like that; "Go to your loft and you could find it .." or "Go into your back garden tonight and ..." - what about us "uncomfortable" working class children who never had a "loft" and a "garden on back "" which was nothing more than a square meter of balcony on the fourteenth floor of a municipal building? Public service broadcasts - yes right! And moreover, it was terribly depressing to see those stupid, bourgeois, their children of the rear who they joke with pieces of old plastic that have 'fun' ... do me a favor, and "because you don 'you go cut your wrists or overdose on cocaine money from" mom and dad "... you make me star bad
