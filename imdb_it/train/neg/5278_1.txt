When a play boasts its wonderful soundtrack on the back cover, you know you don't have to deal with a first-rate movie. I rented this movie with friends who expected to get some giggles, but overall to get most of our laughs at each other by making fun of the movie. We could not have chosen a worse movie. <br /> <br /> The film could have gone well with some modifications. First of all, the play was painful. Physical gags have been performed and misplaced. The fat kid in the film made us want to kill us, bless him for trying scenes and scenes, but he was like a puppy begging for love. If it had been extracted from the film, everything would have been bearable. There were some funny jokes, I think one was when the group of guys stole one of their parents' porn movies and it turns out to be gay porn. But to better summarize the play I will simply say the opening gag for the fat boy. He wears a shirt stained with vomit and talks about not knowing when something is finished. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film's publisher could have saved the film by removing the fat man, cutting out 20 minutes of the film school scenes and a finale that lasts more than thirty seconds of random squabbles. <br /> <br /> OH, BTW, there are two good elements that the film has. Kadeem Hardison plays his role wonderfully and recites his lines so that no one is lost or undervalued. The other saving element of the film is the beautiful Mrs. Ali Landry. His character is ignored most of the film which is a pity. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time even renting this. I didn't like it and I was part of the target audience (18 men).
