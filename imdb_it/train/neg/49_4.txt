A very vulgar and boring road movie, with the intention of being modern and fashionable, shown in the editing style and in some strange shooting angles, resulting only in drowsiness. <br /> <br /> Casting is wasted, writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing that is worth is the soundtrack of Lalo Schifrin, really exceptional and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> Perform if you can, the negative opinions and comments on this film are well deserved; it's really pure junk. Obviously this has its charm, to watch a movie where everyone would not drop the glass of beer if it was on fire, but save it for a stormy day when you have absolutely nothing else to do.
