Seriously, I don't even know where to start. It is as if someone had given a budget in the balance of dollars to an autistic third grade and had said "give me a movie about the secret service". The editing is ridiculous, the cinematography was random at best, every single syllable of dialogues was completely delayed and directed ... well, was there a director there too? Everything was just so useless, lame and useless ... and casual ... and lame. <br /> <br /> Here is a SPOILER for you; this movie is the stupidest thing you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> However, if you liked this piece, you will also like it; Deterrance, Dark Blue and a partial frontal lobotomy.
