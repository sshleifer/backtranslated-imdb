This movie only has a 1 because you can't give a zero! if you have a weak stomach ALL do not look. people with animal rights that you don't want to see. makes vegetarian people swear I witnessed it happening! the only interesting parts are the case and the fact that it is a true story. It's really really terrifying that this guy worked at ADT while killing people! do you still feel safe when entering a small code? I do not! He had access to all the codes in Kansas !!!!!! I hated the film was not scary, it was frighteningly mental! Do yourself a favor and not rent / buy this movie, I think it cost about $ 20 to have it INCLUDED their actors OVER paid !!!!
