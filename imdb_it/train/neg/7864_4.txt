The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect it to be and nothing more. Obviously it will not be an Oscar nominated film, it is just pure entertainment where you can lose yourself for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically based on a group of National Guard trainees who are fighting against the infamous hillbillies changed on their last day of training in the desert. They are the only ones to react during the whole film, which includes a lot of violence (which is basically the whole movie), while blood and guts are constantly around the scene, and also another scene of graphic rape that is unnecessarily thrown in to upset the public. <br /> <br /> I would give The Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for fun, and just that. Although even then I found myself looking at my watch more and more as the movie went on, as it started to drag on due to the fact that it continued to try to amaze the audience with graphics and occasional jumping scenes just to make sure that the public stays awake The Hills Have Eyes II is discreet entertainment, something to pass if you're bored and nothing else. <br /> <br /> 4/10
