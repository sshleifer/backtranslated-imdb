I literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie. Of course, it's Shakespeare and this requires a certain way of being interested or not. But this film overcomes every barrier of long soliloquies and what not, this could prevent many not to worry only about a story based on Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The biggest obstacle to this production is the complete flatness of the characters. Often during character interaction, it is almost difficult to distinguish the lines of who they are. Of course, I think this film is dubbed in English. Certainly they could have obtained voice actors that could have added a little more drama to these classic and literary lines. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult to evaluate this film more than 1, even if it is perhaps based on prejudices perhaps of age and what would seem a very low budget. Still, it's absolutely painful and boring. If you insist on Hamlet, do yourself a favor and read the book again. 1/10
