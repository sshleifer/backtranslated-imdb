This film could not decide what it wanted to be. There were a couple of secondary plots that made you think that these elements would all come together in the end ... but they didn't. If you want a story of "aliens in frozen junk", continue with the 1950s version of THE THING (not the abomination that was redone in gore-o-vision more than 20 years later). <br /> <br /> I couldn I will not forget the fact that the "alien" was practically recycled by INDEPENDENCE DAY. <br /> <br /> The "bare minimum" sets would have been more effective if they had hired actors who could actually recite and complete the desired atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Many landscapes chew with little gains.
