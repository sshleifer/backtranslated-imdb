Men In Black 2 was a real disappointment for me. While the actors have done a good job, especially Smith, there is no cure for a poor script once in production. The film really had a "sequel" type of feeling, playing out partial events of the first movie. The story was, in a word ... bad, at best. It was not well thought out, and at times it seemed very discontinuous and inconsistent. <br /> <br /> In the first round, the MIB Organization had a sort of "elitist" feeling of strength. You had some special agents and had a "clandestine" appearance. In the sequel, the MIB Organization has a JROTC Summer Camp atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The film was not terrible or otherwise ... it simply lacked the "cool" (for lack of a better phrase) of the first film. Much of the same old humor has been recycled from the first to the second, and has not really added any originality to the MIB universe. <br /> <br /> A perfect analogy would be episode 1 of the first 3 films. Was he decent? Yes. Is it worthy to bear your title? Not exactly.
