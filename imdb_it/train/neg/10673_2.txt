This film was like a bad indie with A-list talent. The plot was silly until the end. It reminded me a lot of something out of the 80s home video market. I would have given him one, but there were brief moments when you could see that the actors really tried to make it work. I think the worst thing was the underwater scene held off the dock. The underwater lighting seemed to come from no, and whenever someone we had to worry about was out of air, this air tank would appear. I would avoid this, unless there is nothing else on the shelf. Good day.
