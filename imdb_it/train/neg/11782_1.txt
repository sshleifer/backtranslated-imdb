The Danish film "Slim Slam Slum" surprised me for being the worst movie I've seen to date. I didn't think it was possible to go over my list of bad b-movies, but this deserves gold. It's not funny. It's bad acting, it's bad movie and the plot is ugly. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that there are three girls. I truly believe that this film has the potential to beat the other Danish film "Stjerner uden hjerner" as the worst Danish movie ever made! And this is really something. Congratulations in advance!
