No wonder the historian Ian Kershaw, author of Hitler's revolutionary biography, who was originally the scientific consultant for this TV movie, dissociated himself from it. The film is historically too wrong. The errors begin immediately when Hitler's father, Alois, dies at home, while he actually dies in a pub. In the film, Hitler moved from Vienna to Munich in 1914, while in reality he moved to Munich in 1913. I could go on forever. Hitler's childhood and youth are portrayed too briefly, which makes it difficult enough for historically misinformed people to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man. Important figures from the early days of the party, such as Hitler's paternal friend Dietrich Eckart or the "philosopher" of the party Alfred Rosenberg are totally absent. The characterization of Ernst Hanfstaengl is very problematic. In the film he is portrayed as a noble character who almost despises Hitler. The script obviously follows his personal vision of Hanfstaengl about himself that he gave in his biography after the war. In fact, Hanfstaengl was an anti-Semite and was crazy about his "Fuehrer". But the biggest problem of the film is the portrait of Hitler himself. It is characterized as someone who is constantly hostile, has neither charisma nor charm and constantly orders everyone. After seeing the film, one wonders why a person so disgusting was able to get followers. Since we all know, what was an evil criminal Hitler, of course every writer is tempted to portray Hitler as totally disgusting and incarnate. But the facts are, that in private it could be quite fascinating and fun. His companions did not follow him because he constantly shouted them, but because he liked this strange man. Beyond all these historical errors, the film is well done, the actors are first class, the location shots and the production design give a credible impression of the era.
