So, I wonder as you watch this movie, could the producers of this film save on Sandra Bullock's clothing by dragging out her "first" Miss Congeniality clothes? Did Ms. Bullock also go through the role through the channeling of Gracie Hart's "first"? As many reviewers have noted before, the film is very formidable. Add to what the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of Cassie Maywether as a slightly darker Gracie Hart with more background and quickly becoming a snooze fest. <br /> <br /> The two evil serial killers have been done before (and better) in other films. As well as the "good guy who tries to protect his partner despite the evidence" has been seen before. In fact, none of the characters in the film ever exceeds two dimensions or tries to be anything but trivial stereotypes. <br /> <br /> One last problem: using the term serial killer is a misleading advertisement. Killing a person - even if it's a premeditated murder - doesn't make you a serial killer. You could have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer.
