After watching this episode on the MST3K episode, I have to ask myself how many movies it borrows this movie. It seems to combine elements of Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice and at least many others. At some point I really expected Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the director has any idea how many holes there are in the plot. like the fact that, although gas is not available, there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations and the stations are close enough to maintain an F1 race car that runs through the whole country.
