for a long time I couldn't wait to see this movie, here in Japanese Latin America or any oriental movie they don't have distribution in theaters, we can find some of those films in some underground stores, and I just found Avalon, I was expecting something well , but the only good thing in this film is the first scene, the rest of the film is boring and senseless, simply stupid, with many useless scenes and a boring story. I'm also wasting time writing this film. Sorry but it's the truth.
