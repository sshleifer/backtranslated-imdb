I rarely write a negative review for this site, but this time I felt satisfied. Night Listener is without doubt one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Nothing happened in this film, but I didn't care about any of the characters, I don't buy the whole plot of the mysterious type, it didn't matter how it ended ... nothing. <br /> <br /> There is no comedy, no action, no chills, no suspense, nothing. The highlights include (no spoilers - there's nothing to ruin): a man climbing through a window, a dog barking out of a hotel room, a car going over rough terrain and a truck that the horn sounds. <br /> <br /> I really liked the "One Hour Photo" and was hoping for a disturbing role similar to Williams, but unfortunately I was disappointed. The most disappointing thing is that I'm sure there's a good movie in there - the idea was interesting and I should have liked the characters, but it didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> I could also have given it 1/10 but that score is reserved for the remake of The Producers
