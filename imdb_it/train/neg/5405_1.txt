I took this movie as a turkey and was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Acting: on the whole, although many have been in other films, it is clear that they have had to work hard to behave so badly so consistently throughout this film without letting accidentally slip a little acting. <br /> <br /> Plot: being generous I could say that the writer initially started with a storyline but did his best to ignore it. the plot broke faster than a Chinese knock-down computer <br /> <br /> Scrip - now it was an abomination of nature. failed to scroll with any rhyme or reason. most of the characters' lines were, at best, pathetic to the imbecile. the script worked hard to make sure that no character could be considered memorable. I've seen other films where the extras were more interesting and memorable. <br /> <br /> Special effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! They were the special special buses <br /> <br /> Directing - until you can find your directing skills copy the style of your favorite director or you will only make failures like this. <br /> <br /> it's nice to know that your friends / family members gave you 10 stars for this movie
