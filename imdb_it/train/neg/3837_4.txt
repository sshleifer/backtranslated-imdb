I have seen (even too much) many gestures of this company - this is almost half of the pack. One of the good points, it's a bit more stylized and under control than some of their dishes - less of the sophomoric attempts at humor and more adherence to the plot (for what it's worth). Many of their titles, such as Sexy Sixth Sense, are buried by baaaad performances and an amateur sensibility. On the other hand, I found the simulated sex scenes not as hot as some of their other films (like Vampire Vixens, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe or Mistress Frankenstein). Misty Mundae is always a 10 in metro peter, as is Darian Caine. I found Barbara Joyce boiling in a school-marm kinda way, and Ruby LaRocca a sexy little hottie. <br /> <br /> Watch this with the remote control firmly in your (free) hand, in a night where you need a break from porn Don't waste time wanting to check the story: you have better things to do with your life. It's not a movie, it's pure T & A, but not bad for the standard one.
