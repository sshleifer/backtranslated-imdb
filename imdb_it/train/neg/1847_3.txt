SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER is another example of what happens when a group of talented people gather to make an "extreme" horror film. Any type of acting, production, plot, FX, etc. They exit the window in an attempt to create "shock value". Now don't get me wrong - I consider myself a connoisseur of "shock" films, and the sleazier / gorier / villain, the better - but it's still nice to see SOMEONE of some kind of talent involved in the movie. <br /> <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC tells the life of Harry Russo, a strange drug addict who takes orders to kill from the dummy of his ventriloquism, Rubberneck. He keeps making bums by killing prostitutes and other random people, and shouting about how he hates "hoo-uh" (ie "whores" for those of you who don't speak New York ...) and how he wants to rape them in the ass. There are some weak scenes of necrophilia, very little blood and some nudity to mix things up a bit - but nothing that you haven't seen in a better movie ... <br /> <br /> The only saving thing that I can find in this delayed film often (involuntarily?) exhilarating screaming shrieks from our main man, Harry. He keeps going back and forth about wanting to kill everyone and get them in the ass, and after a while he gets really pretty comical. In fact, I'm almost tempted to believe that there should be some sort of homo-erotic undertone for this movie, with all the crazy talk and constant shots of Harry running around with his expanding dong. In all honesty, that joker is more nekkid in this film then the few chicks that show some T-and-A (and some full-frontal, for good measure). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is a little funny as it used to be, but I can really recommend it to those who want to be able to say that they saw a movie called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER. To be honest - the title, by far - is the best thing about this junk ... A generous 3.5 / 10
