I'm a dumber person to rent the REDLINE DVD. The Chicago Pictures that made this stupid movie never paid Palisades Media Group to buy web ads on various automotive sites including mine that has an ALEXA rating of 16K. They snatched the deal and now I'm out $ 16,000 and have wasted much of my personal time (peter rapport of Palisades Media) know who you are! <br /> <br /> Please do not rent or buy this movie !!! It sucks and the people behind it are successful artists. <br /> <br /> REDLINE has a cast of losers and poor actors! <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke
