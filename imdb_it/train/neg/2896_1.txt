I couldn't bear to sit through the whole movie. Do families like this really exist somewhere? There have been many comments describing this family as akin to the LLBean and similar models, and I think this is a very good description of how they behaved. <br /> <br /> The most absurdly incredible writing / acting occurs when we meet a character in high school as a "pigface" who, of course, became a magnificent 20-year-old plastic surgeon, educated at Harvard, but just to good in the world, not for money, Carrel on the first date. That's when I stop looking ... <br /> <br /> If you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours, then maybe you'll enjoy this sentimental and self-indulgent waste of time.
