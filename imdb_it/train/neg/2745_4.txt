Eleven-year-old finicky Luke Benward (like Billy "Worm Boy" Forrester) moves to a new city. In his new school, the young Benward is chosen by the other boys. They put worms in his thermos. Taking the reflection of the gag under control, Benward launches a worm on the freckled bully Adam Hicks (as Joe Guire). Benward bets that he can eat 10 worms in one day - without regurgitation! <br /> <br /> High, teased Hallie Kate Eisenberg (like Erika "Erk" Tansy) uses her archery skills to help Benward. The director and former SCTV writer Bob Dolman promises: "No worm was harmed in the making of this film". On a related note, SCTV star Andrea Martin has a fun scene. "How to eat Fried Worms" is loosely based on the famous Thomas Rockwell novel. Pre-adolescent children should go out with the film. <br /> <br /> **** How to eat Fried Worms (08/25/06) Bob Dolman ~ Luke Benward, Adam Hicks, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, Alexander Gould
