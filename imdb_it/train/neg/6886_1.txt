John Heder was absolutely hideous in this film. I felt like I was watching a bad college guy for the first time in a student movie. Anna Farris was at the height of the course, not good, but not horrible (plus she is pretty). Dianne Keaton should have known. Jeff Daniels was the only thing he saved in this film (even though it was also a negative judgment on his part). <br /> <br /> All in all, I would avoid this at all costs. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it! <br /> <br /> John Heder will remain forever tied to the typographical role of "the lousy boy", unless he does some SERIOUS work on his actor chops.
