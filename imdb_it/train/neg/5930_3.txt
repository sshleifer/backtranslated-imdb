Hey, <br /> <br /> If you're making a documentary about Leonard Cohen, try doing it with Leonard Cohen! This is full only of Leonard to make the viewer angry that he will be left to wonder why they are listening to all these other singers (some of whom are questionable) talking about themselves. Puleeze .... it seems they relived their diary entries in middle school: who cares about you, and Leonard? Guess which people, if you "do something" worthy, maybe someone will make a documentary about you. I found the parry of U2 members particularly offensive as if this added credibility to this film - NOT. Leonard doesn't need Bono or The Edge to talk about his spirituality. What would have been nice would have been for the filmmakers to embody a piece of his spirituality through the film. Damn, what a concept! I will give props to Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for the covers of Cohen's songs - the rest of the performances were boring and some were unbearable. <br /> <br /> Fan of Cohen, don't say I didn't warn you!
