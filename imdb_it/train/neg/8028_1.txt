Please! Don't waste money on this movie. It is nothing but a boring German Blair Witch squabble made by some high school kids. I couldn't finish watching it, and I usually like to watch all kinds of movies. B. Why would they find a distributor for this? !!! Funny anyway: check Wikipedia for "dark zone". The guy who wrote the voice must be completely freaked out. Maybe he took a lot of money from the producers. The money he should have spent on actors, camera and editing. That wouldn't help either, since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film. Unfortunately, the "dark area" has already received too much attention. Please, director, producer and author of this film, STOP making movies like that ... you're not doing yourself a favor. The world would be a better place without this film.
