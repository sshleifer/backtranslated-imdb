This is not a good movie. Acting is extraordinarily rigid and unconvincing. The film does not seem to know if it is going for a true horror approach or to go down the field and the way of kitsch. I've never seen the first film, but this doesn't stand up for its merits, there are many unconvincing twists and the viewer is never made aware of the importance of the female vampire protagonist. It is not worth looking at
