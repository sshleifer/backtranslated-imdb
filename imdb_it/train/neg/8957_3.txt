Unbelievable. Do you get any more stupid than this? Not a possibility. The stupidity in this film would even shame Ed Wood, De Palma and Woo. If the first part of the series had a mediocre dialogue and the second had a bad dialogue, then this has a stupid dialogue. Amazing. But this time the story has also been lowered to the level of dialogue. Despite the acting and the dialogue, I liked the first two films, but "Cube Zero" will surely kill the franchise. The absolutely deadly plot obviously derives from the pen of a frustrated left wing. Sometimes I wonder if they too, as such, realize how anti-democracy and pro-dictatorship are. In this film have obviously targeted the United States ?? a democracy. Why do they not target Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe, etc. In anti-military movies? Of course, most of these places can't produce a cube like this anytime soon, but that's beyond the point. It's obvious: junk writers like this actually admire these types of regimes, whether they are aware of it or not. I would even say that ANYONE continually annoys US foreign policies, has anti-democratic beliefs at its core. <br /> <br /> Return to the film: in addition to being so far-fetched that it is not even fun anymore, the film has many obvious illogicities. For example, for some reason the two men who supervise the cube did it for a while and are unaware of the pain and sadism that the project entails, yet the first that the other suddenly turns against the system! Anyone with any idea of ​​human nature will see right through this idiocy. Or what about that foolish character, the evil eye one-eyed bureaucrat who talks like he's in a bad comedy by Mel Brooks. In fact, as soon as this creature appears, the film loses all seriousness and therefore every chance of being exciting: it really becomes a comedy.
