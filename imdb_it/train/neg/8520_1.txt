When I noticed that "Hamish Macbeth" was being shown in the United States, I was thrilled. Then I had the misfortune of looking at the damn thing. I love the books of M. C. Beaton on the wonderful Scottish Constable. The characters in the book are fun and very well written. The powers that are responsible for this mixture have apparently never read one of Beaton's books. Only the name "Hamish Macbeth" has something to do with the series. In addition to the lack of familiar characters, I find the whole show very noisy. It seems that the actors feel they have to shout their lines and scream at each other. If you love the adorable Hamish Macbeth of M. C. Beaton, don't waste your time with this garbage.
