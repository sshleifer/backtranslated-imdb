In short, full of life and full of subfloors more than Swiss cheese has holes! The director and the co-writer declare that they want to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. Well, at least here, these two mix like vinegar and oil. To boot, the comedy is not very funny and youthful. Moreover, the film is not very realistic. Freedoms are taken with regard to the legal system in committing French citizens against their will and the apparent ease of escape from drugs in French hospitals. I saw this movie on my big screen at home and found myself shouting at the movie to go on. Eventually, towards the end, I quickly advanced the last long speech that one of the main characters made to the son of his ex-lover. At that time I was tired of that absurd confusing story about a dead lover, a marriage of convenience and a mad lover. Sometimes the plot deviates to the families of the two main characters and then returns to one of them - Ismael or mainly Nora. To the detriment of the public, the views continue to change from Nora and Ismael, his ex-lover confined against his will to a psychiatric hospital. There are probably two potentially interesting films, none of which are well developed. The epilogue does not actually contain many of the secondary plots and seems to want to convince the viewer to believe that Nora will somehow find happiness even if, given her circumstances in real life, the odds are equivalent to a snowball 'hell. Actors do their best and are captivating, but this is not enough to overcome all the blatant errors of writing, editing and lack of attention.
