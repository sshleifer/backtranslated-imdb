I didn't think it was possible, but I found worse films than "Body Melt". This movie is really bad! And what makes it worse is that it's another Australian film ... <br /> <br /> Shot on what looks like VHS, and with a terrible 80s rock soundtrack, it keeps getting worse and worse, the which is hard to believe seeing how ugly the beginning is (did the male on the side hang in a white tomato sauce spray the room on someone?). And why do their accents continue to change? From bad New York drawl, to English whore, then pure Australian! And it happens to the whole cast! <br /> <br /> This film also claims to have won some film festivals on the cover (I think it was the Utah Film Festival). This must be a lie because nobody in their right mind would name this for nothing (maybe the Golden Rasberries but I think it's too bad for that). <br /> <br /> Come on guys! This film must be number 1 on the bottom 100 !!! It must be ten times worse than those films already there. <br /> <br /> Well done to the "film" producers of this garbage, to show that there is a reason not to see the movies ..... 0/10
