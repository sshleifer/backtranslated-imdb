This film was horrible. I watched it three times, and not even the whole thing. It's simply impossible to look at, the plot sucks, it's depressing and absolutely disgusting. I don't write spoilers for nothing, so if you want to know why it's so disgusting, look at it yourself. The only positive thing about this film was John Savage, his dialogue at the beginning and some funny parts of the film. The kid in this movie is annoying and the whole situation is bullshit. I saw this movie in movie stores around America, so I thought it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, I was wrong !!!! The acting is horrible and the nakedness itself is lame and bad. Another thing is that, in the past, Starr Andreef, the other main character, has never been in such bad movies, in fact, in some of the pretty good ones. Same with John Savage. This SUCK movie!
