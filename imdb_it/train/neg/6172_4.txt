I'll get to the movie in a minute. First, someone wanted a "test" of Clinton's comments in Georgetown, where he argued that the United States "deserved" the 9/11 attacks. Well, here's what Clinton said: <br /> <br /> "In the first Crusade, when the Christian soldiers took Jerusalem, they burned a synagogue with 300 Jews and killed all the women and children who were Muslims on the Temple Mount. tell you that the story is still told today in the Middle East and we are still paying for it ". <br /> <br /> ARE we still paying for this? Whaddya means "we", pale? The Marines did not storm the Temple Mount. <br /> <br /> But in reality, Clinton never came out and made it clear that we "deserved" 9/11. Like all his statements during his presidency, he implied that we deserved 9/11. Just point out "facts" A, B, C, and maybe D, and let the listener deduce that they must add up to conclusion X. When in truth, most of Clinton's "facts" were added to guacamole. <br /> <br /> But this is beyond the point. We are here to talk about films, not politics. Unfortunately, when Oliver "Captain Conspiracy" makes a movie, you can't escape his distorted politics. It was only a matter of time before he concentrated his paranoia and bitterness in the Reagan Era, and what better time than when Stone's dreams had almost come true, on the day Reagan had almost bought the farm. Unable to find plots or nefarious schemes in Hinckley's murder attempt, he invents one with Al Haig. From a simple misunderstanding of the chain of constitutional authorities, Haig has transformed himself from a public employee who really should have dusted off his civic education into a devastating megalomaniac. You almost expect Haig to rub his hands like Montgomery Burns and tell Cap Weinberger to "Release the hounds". Stone even recruits the most outspoken Hollywood person to play our former Secretary of State, Richard Dreyfuss. A boy you love to hate on sight. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is OK. Average, hovering below average. Don't worry about renting or buying. Try taking it on cable. 4 out of 10.
