I can sit in this movie once, but I doubt I could make it a second time. Sweetly funny especially for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon (I think of Something About Mary) and the re-emergence of a more serious acting Michael Keaton. This is not the funny romp The Love Bug was but it is watchable. One of my main deductions from the film was the fact that Herbie evolved into most of the antics of R2D2. I was bored with the effects of headlight eyes for the second time around 30 times they were used and the bent front fender caused the same reaction on my part. Go see this with your little ones, that is "one-digit kids" and don't expect much from this movie. <br /> <br /> _X
