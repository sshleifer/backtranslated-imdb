Within 15 minutes, my whole family was rooting for Goldie Hawn's character to die, or at least for Steve Martin's character to leave her. At 40 minutes, we turned it off. There are only a couple of films a year that we prove to be so annoying that we can't even fall asleep long enough for the story to get consolidated. <br /> <br /> Normally I like both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn and I remember enjoying Neil Simon's original. So I blame Marc Lawrence and Sam Weisman. Combine the "Whats The Worst That Can Happen" director and "Miss Congeniality 2" screenwriter, and I imagine this is what we end up with.
