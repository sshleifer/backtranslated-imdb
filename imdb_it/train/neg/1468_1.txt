Wonderful cast wasted on worthless script. A dozen adults gather in the summer camp in which they participated as minors. Could this ever happen in a million years? It's simply a fantasy, and boring for that. Do they become teenagers again? Do they restore their jokes, games, good times? They could try but in the end the answer is: No. Is there any intrigue? Any suspense? Horror? Comedy? None of the above. How anyone can be entertained by this fright is beyond me. I wanted to like this movie; I tried to appreciate this movie, but my brain refused.
