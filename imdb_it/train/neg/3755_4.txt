I adored this movie, I admit it. This must be the best video (straight on?) I've seen. Well ... my friend and I decided only for the bullshit and giggles that we would have rented this movie. We knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected, and more. When the red neck is slammed against the tree by the Sasquatch, we literally saw that part about three or four times, it was amazing (hysterically, of course). And why? Oh, why should the protagonist roll so much? As honestly, we know you're in danger, rolling so much won't help much. But really, if this movie is in your local RENT IT video store. It's worth it and it's not even that bad, like it's bad, but not incredibly bad. Overall, it will be perfect for you if you rent this movie.
