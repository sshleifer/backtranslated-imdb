"Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah" is a perfect example of how a great idea can be ruined by pathetic arguments like pseudo-patriotism. Here, travelers of the future seek to ruin Japan by replacing the local hero Godzilla with their monster cub, the three-headed golden dragon, King Ghidorah. They fail, however, and eventually Godzilla fights Ghidorah. The battles between the two behemoths are very beautiful, but the plot of the film is full of holes and the whole of "Japan is fantastic" is really stupid. The creators of this film have not even threatened the enemies of Japan, making them stupid big blondes, who are easily defeated by the intelligent Japanese. The good thing is that in the end Godzilla and King Ghidorah almost destroyed both Japan and the ridiculous enemies in one (actually two) spectacular fights. But until this royal battle, the film was really boring and pathetic.
