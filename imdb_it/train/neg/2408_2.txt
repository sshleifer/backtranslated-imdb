This film is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re-animates the dead. He uses it for the first time on his brother when he is shot to death. His brother then infects the other gang members. In some scenes the zombies are seen walking very slowly and in other scenes they run rather quickly, which makes little sense. The acting is mediocre but the story does not help the film. The trick is the blood on the face of the zombies. The budget for this film I'm sure was very limited. I think the film could have been done better if the story had been more original and with a better budget. If you don't want to see a good zombie movie, don't see this.
