He really started the 1980s trend towards the disgusting violence disguised as a "horror film". I was the target audience for this piece of repellent garbage and then I was as disgusted as it is now. <br /> <br /> Oh, where do we start. Let's see, the setup: you can bring people back to live IF they died violently. So this ridiculously weak premise is the excuse to slaughter people in horrible ways, because, well, it's necessary to bring them back to life! This could have worked if played overhead for black laughter at the Re-Animator or something like that. But no, it's played straight. There is an entire family terrified in a chariot being hunted, one of the few scenes, at least where their disappearance is off screen. However, almost everything else is on the screen. There is actually a scene in which a walking girl is beaten and killed by zombie citizens, who are filming her and smiling with different cameras. Then, there is a close-up of his face while the filmmakers lovingly - and consuming time - reveal in time-lapse photography his beaten face that is carved on a skull and rebuilt to look "normal" again. This fact, of course, from a sloppy Jack Albertson as the mortician behind it all. He likes to walk around in an ambulance / hearse playing old Tommy Dorcey songs, I guess it should be nice. <br /> <br /> In the end, of course, even the Sheriff is an undead and the doctor kindly offers to fix his rotting hands. It is not clear why the sheriff is not out with other citizens who joyfully kill children and slice their faces, sticking needles in the eyes of burn victims, etc. <br /> <br /> I wonder, I really wonder, what do people see in a geek show like this to give them any kind of evaluation. It's not scary, twists are laughable, and it's a little sick overall. It's not even done well enough to "see him on a nerve" or have fun at a level you could see a bad HG Lewis movie. It's just a terrible garbage, made for people who go around with this kind of useless gore, and made by people who stagger for a salary. <br /> <br /> Sad that Albertson was even involved.
