This is the worst movie I've seen for years! Start ridiculous and continue in the same way. I think when something happens in this movie, and that acting is worse. The final raises it a little and saves the film from a total flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. Sorry Tim Burton Batman was good but this sucks.
