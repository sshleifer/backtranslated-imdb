Well, I had to be generous and give this to 2. This is mainly due to the free holes in that woman's shirt where her breasts are. I found it slightly funny. Besides this, this film does nothing but offer some good laughs with a friend. Funny if you're willing to comment on the "mystery science theater" with someone, but it's not better than a 2. And a 2 sucks.
