I'm sorry to say it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although visually fascinating (for example the use of color was absolutely stunning), it was rather boring and disturbing (see incest between father and son). <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the music is totally absent, and if you think of those wonderful soundtracks by Michael Nyman (who wrote the soundtracks for most of Greenaway's films), then you can imagine what a difference it makes . <br /> <br />
