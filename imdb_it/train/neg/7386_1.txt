I tried to restart the movie twice. I put it in three cars to see what was wrong. Has Steven Seagal's voice changed? He died during filming and the studio had to dub the sound with someone who doesn't even look like him? Or has the sound of the DVD been destroyed? After about 10 minutes, you finally hear the true voice of the actor. Although during most of the film, it seems that the audio was recorded in a bathroom. I would be ashamed to donate a copy of this film to Goodwill if I had a copy. I rented it, but I'll never do it again. I will check this database before renting his other films, all of them were (more or less) good movies. You usually knew what you were getting when you were watching a Steven Seagal movie. I guess it's not anymore.
