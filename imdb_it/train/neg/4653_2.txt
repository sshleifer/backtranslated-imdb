A vampire's henchman wants to call her after falling in love with a five-dollar prostitute in this ultra-low-budget horror comedy. I can't explain all the positive comments on this film. I'll give it to mass hallucination, but it's still disconcerting. The only saving factor (and here I am extremely generous) could be the grandfather who is the only semi-funny character in this whole mess. Don't waste money or time. In fact here is a word of advice, if Troma puts it on DVD, but does NOT do it by itself, in all likelihood it is crap. <br /> <br /> Troma DVD Extras: Commentary with Omar and Kirk; second comment with scenes of the cast and crew eliminated; Ducks; troma interactivity; radiation march; "Terror Firmer" clip; Theatrical trailer: trailer for "Rowdy Girls", "Teenage Catgirls in Heat", "Cannible: The Musical" and "Toxic Avenger 4" <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
