This quasi-horror film follows a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on Shikoku island to sell the family home and meet with old friends. He finds that the daughter of the village priestess drowned several years earlier. She and Fumiko (another childhood friend) learn that Sayori's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. The links between the dead and the living are already weakening and friends and villagers are seeing ghosts. Nothing was exceptional or even very beautiful in this film. Unlike stellar J-horror films, the suspense does not actually grow, the result does not seem too threatening and the ending touches the absurd. <br /> <br /> This film is like a simple white rice cooked a little too long so that it is bordering on sweetened. Sometimes it happens in poor Asian restaurants or you cook your white rice a little too long. You end up eating it, because you need it with the meal, because what is Chinese or Japanese food without rice, but almost ruins the meal because of the glutea, sticky blandness of all this. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
