This is one of the most irritating and senseless films I've ever had the misfortune of sitting down. Whenever it seemed that it was becoming good, more sepia flashbacks came out, followed by paranoid idiocies disguised as social commentaries. The main character, Maddox, is a manipulative, aspiring rebel who lives in a villa apparently without parents or responsibilities. The supporting casts are all much more fun and interesting, but unfortunately they have never been developed. Nor do we ever really understand that John Stanton's character influenced Maddox to commit acts of rebellion. At one point, I thought, "Aha! Maddox is just crazy and he's secretly making all those communications from Stanton's escaped mental patient! Now we're coming somewhere!" but of course, this ends up not being the case and the whole film turns out to be useless, both from Maddox's point of view and from that of the viewer. Where is Ferris Bueller when we need him?
