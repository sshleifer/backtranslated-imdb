This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The acting is poor and the plot is almost incomprehensible. It doesn't matter if you like spaceships or any other ship. As for the special effects, the film has none. The entire film crew was probably on a boat in the open sea rather than in a studio and when some of the men are "stabbed" (if you can call it that) their reactions are totally unreal. Guns are quieter than mutes. How this film could have two awards raises serious questions about the state of the human mind. Well, that's all. This review is probably more fun to read than what the movie is to watch. If someone is thinking of watching it or buying it, I would seriously recommend it for obvious reasons. I said it includes a spoiler. If the fact that some people are stabbed and a gun is fired is a plot plot. I suppose it's because they're the only good parts of the movie.
