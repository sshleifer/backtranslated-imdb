I saw the first of the Nani-Movies and sometimes I had a little fun watching it. There are many famous TV / Comedyactors that appear in the first part and presented, in fantasy costumes, typical small episodes of their Stand-Up Program and exactly this is the problem with which the second film must fight. Everything was already there ... nothing new to get. You are familiar with most of the often boring and stupid "jokes" and you always have the impression that their goal was to put every Comedylooser of the last decade who wants to return to the stage. There is nothing important in the story: the typical fairy tale story of Rumpelstiltskin, without any importance. I was expecting something like that but I couldn't complain about anything. Actually I'm complaining about the writers of lazy stories who had a whole story; their only activity was to get lots of jokes and spoofs inside, but they didn't get it anyway. This crap is except for the great appearance of Helge Schneider a total waste of time and money (if you do not like it, then remove 2 points of my evaluation) If you like to save your money and make bad jokes, look at the crap that is ample merger every Friday evening on SAT1 or RTL for free. I'm sure you'll recognize some "laughs" that I saw last night at the cinema.
