This Hitchcock film bears little resemblance to his last suspense films and looks much more like a very old-fashioned morality tale. A young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy. They spend money traveling the world and live a very hedonistic existence. However, after a while the excitement begins to decline and the couple becomes dissipated and useless in their existence. However, nowhere, when they are on a luxury cruise, does the ship sink and they lose everything - and eventually end up being happier because they now appreciate life! What a strange, foolish and favorite movie! Personally, I'd like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me unhappy! <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are relatively poor compared to subsequent productions - a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateur acting.
