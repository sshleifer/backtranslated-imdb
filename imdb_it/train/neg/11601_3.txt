A Nightmare in Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth episode of the Nightmare on Elm Street series and the worst sequel ever in the series, even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was lucky enough to have the nightmare on Elm Street DVD box for my birthday and I watched all the sequels. The child of dreams was the worst, no doubt, I too was surprised that they were doing so well with the last two sequels. But I guess they lost their charm, the story was just ridiculous and I wasn't happy with where it went. Alice has become increasingly annoying, it's not Nancy or Kirsten, so her wearing this movie alone didn't work for me. Freddy is also losing his fear, this is just a little silly. <br /> <br /> Alice is back and she's carrying a baby, she couldn't be happier with her life. But even Freddy is back and he won't be too light with her since he defeated him so easily in the fourth movie. But anyway, he wants his son and be reborn in the world. Have you ever wondered if Freddy also had parents? Well, that's what A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child investigates and Alice soon discovers Freddy's childhood and maybe that's the only thing that can defeat him. <br /> <br /> A nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child is all in all a bad movie and an insult to the series. I don't think anyone could be happy with this sequel. Only the story was really stupid, I mean it could have worked, but again it was done the wrong way. I know that if you're trying to watch the sequences of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, you should watch it, but I really wouldn't recommend it, it's not worth it, at least in my opinion. <br /> 3/10
