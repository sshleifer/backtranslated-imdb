Friend, what the hell were the people who made this movie? And more importantly where can I get some? The opening scene sets the tone for the film: a woman writhing naked in a circle of fire, turning into a werewolf. And this is not the transformation of an American werewolf by Rick Baker, folks. We're talking about the worst trick we've ever seen here. I can only imagine a bit of Italian breaking the glue on the bare Annik Borel (who plays Daniela, the protagonist of the film (is it a word?)), And asking her to roll up the fur. It's so ugly. <br /> <br /> From now on it does not improve much. The minutes are wasted while the scenario chews the male actors chatting about Daniela and her condition or something like that (I don't remember, but the dialogue is so bad if you don't laugh at this you cry). <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that Daniela is not even a werewolf, she is a psychopath who becomes mentally whenever there is a man around (understandable, since she was raped as a child) so she thinks of becoming a werewolf as his ancestor (the opening scene). He can't help but take the throat out of every man he meets and just wants to be loved! Things start looking for Daniela as she meets and falls in love with a stuntman who doesn't trigger her "episodes". Watch the montage here, one of the biggest you can ever see (laughing and hugging after plunging headfirst through a window). <br /> <br /> Daniela's fortune does not hold up because the film takes a brutal turn, is suddenly beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the stuntman. Remembering "I spit on your grave", Daniela draws bloody revenge on her rapists. <br /> <br /> It is 100 minutes of my life that I will never return. But hey, this is the game you play when you're a movie fanatic.
