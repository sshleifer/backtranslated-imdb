After watching the film, the first question that arose in my mind was: is it supposed to be an irony or not? After reading some comments on the character of Doc Savage and the comic book series, I knew this film didn't want to be ironic. So history tells us about an American-American Super-Doc that saves a South American republic from evil. It looks like a typical story. But this comes so unrealistically that it becomes ridiculous. The mandatory final fight shows the worst martial arts presentation I've ever seen. The film could be interesting for low budget filmmakers as a bad example.
