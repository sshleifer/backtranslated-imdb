Alone in the Dark is Uwe Boll's kick in the nuts for Hollywood after House of the Dead's punch in the face. <br /> <br /> At least it shows how great the Boll manipulator is. After forcing the Artisan out of the flop that was House of the Dead, one can only assume that normally credible Lion's Gate Films have issued the AITD only on the basis of the contractual obligation after the acquisition of the assets of Artisan. Because AITD is an even bigger example of complete lack of consistent film production capacity, plot exposure and simply simple theft from other films because it should have looked nice instead of because it fitted into the structure of the film. <br /> <br /> But then that's the point, isn't it? Boll is not trying to make a coherent film because he is not trying to direct Alone in the Dark. He's just trying to manipulate Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Alone in the Dark, as House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are "announced" or "pre" production. <br /> <br /> These are not films to be directed, but investment portfolios. Each of them has rushed into production with the excuse that the tax law that Boll and its investors are exploiting could be closed within the next 2 or 3 years. can bomb projects release within that time period, more money can he and his investors get in. Why bother making a good movie when a bad movie makes you a neophyte anyway? The result is films like the horror of Alone in the Dark . <br /> <br /> Alone in the Dark, like all his other films, are just a cynical exploitation of the current Hollywood trend for lazy movies. <br /> <br /> And to those who support Boll by calling him misunderstood or the next Ed Wood, congratulations, making a cult figure by man, you're just making it easier for him to get investors but giving him notoriety. <br /> <br /> For more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s= & threadid = 21699 Incidentally, don't ask me how to put together his lists. Unless the actors are involved in the investment scam, somehow, that mystery has yet to be discovered.
