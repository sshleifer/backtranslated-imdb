I saw this film because I like Nicolas Cage and, I found it strange and completely useless ... so I decided to shoot a little and I got my hands on the copy of the 70s. Wow. What difference. The original one was definitely better. I would like you all to know that he had actually made a statement, his existence had a purpose. It was really the Christian public that expressed their fear of paganism. If you go deeper, it also makes comments about life, but I don't want to go into details simply, simply, if you were disappointed and would like to know how it should look, feel free to look at the 70s version, a little dated, but much better.
