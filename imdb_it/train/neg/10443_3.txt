I saw a preliminary screening of this film in New York and I, along with my friends and practically the entire public, were very disappointed. The film wasn't even that bad that it was good; he was lifeless like a snake bite victim. Samual L. Jackson seemed surprisingly tired from most of it and the effects of the snake were lame. It reminded me of one of those SciFi cheese films, apart from the fact that this movie wasn't funny or even campy. It all looked worn, flat and openly formidable. I'm shocked to say that I actually think Anaconda is more fun. It is easy to understand that SOAP realizes that it is a piece of it and plays along with it, but what the film fails to undertake is a script that has some fear of suspense. It's the worst kind of lame film: it's joyless.
