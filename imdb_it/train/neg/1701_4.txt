The rough and coarsely elaborate interpretation of David Lynch of South Park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing clich√©s about suburban middle-class families. The father is a horrible monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular mouth hole from which the most horrendous guttural noises are emitted, the son and mother are permanently horrified and incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life. A number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not famous for his comedies (eg On the Air, aspects of Wild at Heart), and I don't particularly like comedies in general. However, there were a couple of scenes in Dumbland that made me laugh out loud. There are some clever pieces of animated cinematography - in which Lynch transmits a wide range of reactions in his characters through a syntactic arrangement of shots in contrast to facial expressions (which never really change in Dumbland). <br /> <br /> I think Lynch was really trying to give his audience a direct, if disturbing, animated comedy here. It is interesting to note that he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra-low-low humor (ie most of Will Farrell's films) by adding elements of vicious social criticism and classic cartoon violence and crass humor. Even if the mixture doesn't work very well here, it's nothing but Lynchian. <br /> <br /> To see from Lynch fans.
