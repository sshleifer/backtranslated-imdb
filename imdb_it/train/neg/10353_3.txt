I have never read the book "Una ruga nel tempo". To be perfectly honest, after seeing the movie, do I really want it? Well, I shouldn't review this movie, I'll start with that. Later I will say that the TV movie is rather forgettable. Do you know why I say this? Because I forgot what happens in it. I told you it was forgettable. To be honest, no TV movie will ever be better than "Merlin". <br /> <br /> How do I describe a TV movie? I've never written a review for one before. Well, I will simply say that they usually have celebrities. A wrinkle over time includes only one. Alfre Woodard (or Woodward, I'm not sure), the Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> The film has special effects like that, a slightly interesting plot, scenes that make you go "WTF". The film is incredibly bad and makes you go "WTF". What did I expect? It's a TV movie. They are usually not good. How is this A wrinkle over time is a waste of time and a big waste of time. Finally, you will most likely forget it when it is finished. Well, maybe not the second one is over. But within a few minutes. <br /> <br /> A wrinkle over time: * / ****
