A really unpleasant film. While the special effects of Rick Baker are quite impressive (if the stomach turns), it has no other saving characteristics. Like many movies from the 70s, it makes you feel like you need to take a long shower and rub the slime yourself. The characters are uniformly unpleasant and the plot makes no sense.
