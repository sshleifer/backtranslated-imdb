Thank you for killing the franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This movie sucks on so many levels it's pathetic. The first VAMPIRES was fun, but this low cost makes me yawn. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi (poor Kevin Bacon) travels around Mexico with a surfboard that contains a hidden compartment with his vampire who kills Antonio's wing Banderas's guitar case in DESPERADO . It gathers some crooked "hunters" along the way (including an annoyed infected feminist who takes the pills to not turn into a vampire), and they set off to stop a female vampire master who is not given a backstory so we could take he cares less about his research (walking in the sunlight by stealing the Black Cross and performing a ritual to let her do so). If you've seen the first VAMPIRES, you've already seen this, and done a lot better. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately. Frankly, I think it surpassed its maximum and unable to do another classic of horror. The only decent film he made from THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. All the rest is complete crap, until the incredibly cheap and delayed appearance of MARS 'FANTASMS ... and now this celluloid waste. Where are they as big as ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and WHAT? <br /> <br /> Carpenter crony Wallace demonstrates that he cannot write his way out of a paper bag with his paper - the same script full of yawns, groans and gags recycled from the original. Did I mention that I hated all the characters in the movie? There was not a single memorable character in the whole movie. How does it happen? This film has nothing to recommend. Not even the DVD presentation is good; the menu looks horrible. <br /> <br /> In comparison, JASON X: "FRIDAY THE 13TH IN SPACE" was a masterpiece. This is how you make a sequel and (re) energizes a franchise, women and germs, as well as creating an exciting DVD menu.
