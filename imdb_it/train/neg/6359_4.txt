Woody Allen, when he is at his best, has one of the sharpest pens on the market. He can make a sharp observation and wrap it around a joke like no other. However, when it is at its worst, his films may smell of pretentiousness. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" has this smell from opening to closing. The set up is one of his most intriguing ideas in an instant. Four friends sit in a restaurant discussing whether the essence of life is comedy or drama. To help resolve the discussion, a man tells the beginning of a story and asks the other two men to discuss (one a comic dramatist, the other dramatic dramatist) whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy. The two men continue the story and the film reproduces the stories they weave. Now, when I heard about this film for the first time, I realized that they tell the exact same story, the genre (comedy or drama) changes only by how you look at it. Now it would have been interesting. However, the stories share only one main element and some side elements. They are completely different stories with the main plot differences. The drama is so rigidly scripted and pretentious that it can really only work as a self-parody. If this was the point, then it failed because these elements prevent the public from experiencing any emotional investment in any of the characters. Comedy is the story that has moments of success, but they are still short and fleeting. Will Farrell is obviously destined to be Woody's replacement, but he could have played this character in a much more believable way without adding Woody's stuttering and ticks. Woody is the best at being Woody. When someone else tries, they are not playing a character, they are modeling a recognizable actor. This kind of thing brings out the public from history. <br /> <br /> My favorite Woody Allen films make me abandon the theater in a spirit a little lighter than the one I entered. This made me wish I could get my money back.
