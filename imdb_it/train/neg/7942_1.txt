Really. Does a week go by when Oprah doesn't remind us that she was abused as a child? <br /> <br /> You focus on each interview. <br /> <br /> Oprah cannot resist the comment on the answer to every question you ask. He often interrupts guests before an answer finishes questioning his own anecdote or anecdote. The directors are of course in charge of focusing on his main reaction rather than on the faces of the guests, because that is what matters - what Oprah feels, what Oprah says. <br /> <br /> Oprah, Oprah, Oprah. It's always all about Oprah. <br /> <br /> Oprah says: feel sorry for me, I was so poor. Feel the pain of my battle with my weight. Feel my pain when I left a luxury store after they closed. Feel good to buy my magazines and books. Feeling good for my success Feel good when you give my charity to make me look good. Feel good to make me rich beyond imagination. <br /> <br /> My interpretation of your point of view: VIEWERS ARE ALL DEEP DISCOUNTED AND YOU NEED MY DAILY ADVICE. I have all the answers for your life even if I have nothing in common with you, plebes. I have never been married nor do I want to be. I never had to raise a family, but I know everything. I have little respect for men or marriage. I clearly prefer people like me over others - witness of "Legends Ball 2006". Gayle is my best friend but we're not gay. <br /> <br /> Starting from 7/31/2006, the voice on its website actually reads: "Oprah.com is the main source for information on love, life, self, relationships, food, home, spirit and health. "How presumptive and hateful? <br /> <br /> In June 2006, it crashed into two private wedding receptions in Oklahoma to collect footage for its September 2006 shows. It continues to promise to leave TV, but its success drags on no end in sight. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what he thinks, Oprah is neither a queen nor a goddess nor a personal mission from God. She is just a very lucky, overweight black woman who copied Phil's style Donahue and defined her as his. He was in the right place at the right time and he knew exactly how to aspire to the right demography. <br /> <br /> Oprah is the P.T. Barnum of this age and amazes me that people cannot see through his facade. <br /> <br /> So, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls and you too Oprah, if you can get that ego swollen through the door - That way now at the big exit ...
