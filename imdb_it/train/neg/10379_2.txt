The film begins in 1840 in Japan, in which a man kills his wife and his lover to death and commits suicide. It is a bloody and bloody sequence. Then jump to the present day ... well, 1982 to be precise. Ted (Edward Albert), his wife Laura (Susan George) and their nagging child move to Japan for work as a husband. Rent a house and - surprise! surprise - it seems to be the house where the murders took place! The three dead are around like ghosts (the trick is hysterically bad) and make life hell for the family. <br /> <br /> It looks OK - but it's really hopeless. There is a damn opening and end and NOTHING happens in the middle. There is an attack of giant crabs that is simply amazing! They look so fake - I swear I saw the ropes pull one - and they're muttering !!!!! There is a useless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes (probably just to show George's body), another about 40 minutes later (but it was necessary for the plot) and a really silly exorcism towards the end. The fight scene between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> As for acting, Albert was OK, as her husband and McClure were good as family friends. But George - as always - is terrifying in a bad movie. You give this film a much needed push - but it can't save it. I'm giving this a 2 just for her and the bloody opening and closing. Apart from that, this is a very boring film.
