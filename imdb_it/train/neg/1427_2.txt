The British claymation series that made "witty" conversations recorded by "normal" people in the mouths of fanciful "cute" creatures at least had the advantage for non-British viewers to look funny and the kind of cultured and rarefied humor that could not be obtained United States Television. Someone made the mistake of putting it on American television. <br /> <br /> A bit like the sad unrecognized American version of the sublime Brit-com COUPLING that died in a month on NBC when the same basic scripts didn't do it "Traduce" from British English to American English, what seemed strange and cultured (and just a little boring) in England, is encountered in CREATURE COMFORTS, the American version, as simple boredom with puppets. There is no plot, no characters and after an episode and a half watched (of the three eventually sent on the air), no reason to suffer more. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing to say about the new summer series and the lucky short run he had is that the claymation is at least professionally made and came as a set-up for the only worst show on the program of CBS, The New Adventures of Old Christine (or "how to be a HORRIBLE mother"). - or person - in an endless and unpleasant lesson "), children who wanted to keep up with going to bed happily ran to bed rather than sit in this show, and adults could wait to tune in until 9pm when" Two and a half men "" (guilty pleasure) and "How I met your mother" (real quality writing), come on.
