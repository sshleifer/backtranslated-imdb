Hated If you believe that everyone in the South is stupid, morally bankrupt, stupid, violent, a crazy religious or a child molester, then this movie could be for you. All are poor and seemingly ignorant. In one scene, two older men are talking in a department store and one claims to have molested a group of sisters before they could tie their shoes. The man seemed proud of his actions, and the other man clearly regarded it as a normal part of life. Very beautiful. A teenager walks in the back streets looking for her sister and no one offers to help her - despite an obvious lameness and lack of food or water (no backpack, etc.). The character of Strathairn is not only completely disgusting and slippery, but proves to be a religious believer (typical of Hollywood) that reflects the vile nature of Christians. A scene from the film is reminiscent of the end of Cape Fear (the one with De Niro) - biblical verses launched by the villain. I come from the Great Northwest, but I found this film offensive because of the wonderful people I know who come from NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN, etc.
