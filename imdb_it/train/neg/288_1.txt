There was nothing of value in the original film, this was even lamer. The fact that he even found it for rent was absolutely incredible. Anyone connected to this film must be on top of something! So what was the plot? What was the girl? The viewer should have obtained the plot in the first four minutes of the film. Unfortunately, I tried several times to look at this. I also borrowed a child from someone to get feedback. Kid said he was stupid and he was four. I find that perhaps a little credit could go to the director, as perhaps some of the shots have made the film more than a B movie. It could push it. I loved the theme song. Fortunately it was only a dollar, it was worth it. I guess you'll like the movie if you were as tall as the cast and crew should be. Is the pot legal in France?
