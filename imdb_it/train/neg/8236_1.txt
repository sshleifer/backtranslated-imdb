I can't believe this is on DVD. Even less was available in my local video store. <br /> <br /> Some argue that this is a good movie if you take into account that you only had a budget of $ 4000. I find it funny I would find it very bad what the budget was. <br /> <br /> Even more fun, I read the following in another review: "Drama aside, if you love horror and love something along the lines of Duel (1971) updated with a little more history and some pretty girls thrown in, you'll love this movie. "<br /> <br /> What?!? This is a shame to compare these two films. <br /> <br /> Give a "1", since I can't give a "0". I simply don't see in any way that this movie can be fun.
