I have to admit I laughed when I saw a reviewer compare it to LOTR. Yes, apart from the dwarves, the cast of thousands, the great special effects, the great battles, the strong characterization, the decent plot, the good acting, the class direction and all the rest. That leaves you with walking. And boy, this movie makes you walk! If Mr Piano had done his way, this would probably be an unbroken three hours of hardcore walking through the Wisconsin countryside, but every 40 minutes or so these pesky Martians jump out for a few seconds to interrupt him before he does any more a sensation. You've never seen so much walking in a movie. If this really had a budget of $ 20 million, most would have had to go to Mr Piano's shoes, because he had to go through a lot of couples with all the walks he did. Which explains why there is no money left over for decent effects, a decent video camera or adequate actors. Honestly, it's like watching some bizarre fetish videos for people with something that takes long walks in period costumes. Even in fast forward, this is a looonnnggg walk. <br /> <br /> As for science fiction things, I think it was a mistake to put the Martians in the film: they only intrude on walking, which is clearly much more interesting for the director than for the story. <br /> <br /> I wonder how much Mr Piano accuses himself of walking dogs?
