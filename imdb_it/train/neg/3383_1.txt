I first saw the live musical at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts and it was absolutely amazing, Stunning and it had such a fantastic continuity of plot and dialogue that I liked it more than most of the musicals I saw on stage. The interesting thing is that you have NEVER got to see Zach's face. He was always in the dark, but his presence was powerful and guided the direction of all production. When I heard that they were making a movie, I waited with bated breath, but when I saw the version of the film I was so disappointed that I felt cheated. The film lacks the captivating mood set in the live production and never lets you be completely in close contact with each character. Personally, I'd like to see the live version again and if it ever gets revived, I'd strongly recommend doing everything to see it. It will be one of the most memorable experiences that you will like.
