This is a slightly interesting gore festival from the late 1980s with some ugly snails with a taste for human blood. If you can overcome the ridiculousness of the whole thing, you could get some fun out of it. The acting is horrible and the plot is simply there to hold the film together between snail attacks, but the film is not a complete waste of time. The special effects are actually quite good, and the blood is well done. It reminded me of the remake of the Blob, probably due to the stickiness of it all. All in all, you could certainly get worse with an hour and a half of your time, but I wouldn't suggest seeing this movie unless you have a strong stomach and are in this kind of thing.
