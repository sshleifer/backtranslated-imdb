This is the worst adaptation of a classic story I've ever seen. They do not modernize it unnecessarily and some points are simply sick. <br /> <br /> Songs rarely move throughout history. They seem to be thrown at random. The flight scene with Marley is useless and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's not just one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's definitely the worst musical I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is probably considered a classic only because "A Christmas Carol" is such a classic story. Just because the original story was a classic doesn't mean it's an economic adaptation.
