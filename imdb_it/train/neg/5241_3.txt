Truth be told, I'm a little stunned to see all these positive reviews from so many people, which is also the main reason why I actually decide to watch this movie. And after seeing him, I was really a bit disappointed, and this comes from the guy who loves this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> I am completely surprised by this film - it is like a movie for children with nudity for absolutely no reason and involves all children swearing and swearing. I'm not virtuous at all, but in my account this has really gone too far. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: The story of two boys was sent to the older brother's program for their reckless behavior. There they met with a guy with an obsession with tits and the other is a medieval monster. <br /> <br /> The name alone is not connected to the story at all. They are not making a model and they do nothing but serve their time for what they have done. The story is very predictable (even if expected) and the humor is lame. And we haven't seen the same characters (played by Mc Lovin ') in many other films (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laugh three times and almost fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Well, the casting went well, after all he is the one who produces the script. And the acting is just as expected when you watch this kind of movie. And the management, what do you expect? This is the same guy who brought us Wet Hot American Summer, and even that movie sucks. But somehow he always managed to bring some stars to attract his horrendous film. <br /> <br /> However I have not heard the total riff off but a waste of time. Only the nude scenes seem to be the best part of the film. I really don't see any reason why I should recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> Pros: Elizabeth Bank? Two topless scenes. <br /> <br /> Cons: Not funny, terrible story, nudity and children don't mix. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.5 / 10 (Rating: F)
