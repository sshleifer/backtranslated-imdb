No one should ever try to adapt a Tom Robbins book for the screen. While the film is fine and the performances are good, the dialogue, which works well on reading it, is crap when it's spoken. Or to put it another way, no one could suggest that listening to someone else's name was like watching it written on a pearl on the radio. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film looks like a badly adapted Cliff Note for the book - most parts have been reduced to one fifth of their size in the book, in terms of background and current history, and the final is wildly (and unpleasantly) different from that of the book. Most of the storylines in the book have been lost, including the one that makes it all make sense in the end, and there is more than one reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say "Huh?" Unfortunately, it was not a worthy effort - the script should have been read, compared to the book, burned and all the actors sent to do something much better. I very much admire Gus Van Sant, but not even someone of his caliber could have made a decent film of such a complex book without making miniseries.
