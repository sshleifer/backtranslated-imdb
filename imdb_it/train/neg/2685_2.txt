I never made an online movie, but I felt moved to do so after seeing this. One does not show up at someone's funeral and tells the deceased: "My relatives are dead, so why should I worry about yours?" <br /> <br /> Apart from the propaganda, there was little, if anything, that could be called "art". As the daughter of deaf parents, I was particularly irritated by the use of deafness as a device. Any deaf person who felt a vibration of that immensity would probably have investigated, not ignored. <br /> <br /> The word "chutzpah" comes to mind. As a writer, there are some topics I would be away from: the Holocaust is one; this is another I wish these filmmakers had not been so arrogant (and inept).
