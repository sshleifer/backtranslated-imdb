I felt brain dead, I'll tell you. This is the worst movie I've ever bought. (In my ignorance I thought this was Peter Jackson's movie of the same name). The performances are so terrible that they are ridiculous. The special effects have not stood the test of time and look terrible. The screenplay promotes that kind of TV movie, setting the type of acting at medium distance. The cast seems to be taking lessons from Joey Tribbiani, they have a look at each, and they stick to it. Also I have never been confused by a movie until I sat down to watch this. It is a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration is resolved in a few minutes. Avoid like a plague.
