Mouths with a ridiculous appearance that generate foam and reproduce. So far for the horror elements of this film. All the rest of MUNCHIES takes place like a very late comedy that is so stupid that you won't find it more fun after about 15 minutes. I can imagine the young children cheering for these little boogers, but adults will be left with only those apparently "intelligent" references that translate to things on the screen like the log entries of Capt. Kirk from STAR TREK, the most famous scene of ET, a resounding statement from the directors that reads "Look! We're cashing in on the success of GREMLINS here!" and a cardboard cut-out by Clint Eastwood telling us ... what about his westerns exactly? The latter was completely lost on me ... Oh yes, and the disposal of chemical waste in the caves seems to be a bad thing. I don't know where they got the idea from. <br /> <br /> Don't say that MUNCHIES is the most unbearable film to sit on, after all. He's really, really stupid. And if you can make a smile while you look at it, you'll probably feel stupid for doing it after the movie is finished. <br /> <br /> Good Badness? Yes, but only if "stupid", "retarded" and "ridiculous" are criteria you are looking for. 3/10 and, well, uhm, 6/10.
