The only reason "The Norliss Tapes" deserves ANY stars is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. In addition to seeing Angie Baby in a pre "Police Woman" performance, there is nothing else to see here. <br /> <br /> THE SYNOPSIS: <br /> <br /> *** MINO SPOILERS ** * <br /> <br /> David Norliss is exploited to write a book on the supernatural. One day he mysteriously disappears after phoning his publisher and suggesting that he ran into something that put him in mortal danger. The entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended as a series of flashbacks through the "Ribbons of Norliss" - a series of audio tapes that the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural. <br /> <br /> In the pilot episode a rich sculptor dies, but not before buying an ancient Egyptian scarab ring from a local occultist who assures him that the ball will give him immortality after death. We soon discover that the ring itself does not guarantee immortality. Instead, he revives only the sculptor's corpse, allowing him to escape from his crypt so he can run around town emptying out the pretty girls of all their blood. <br /> <br /> Face blue, yellow eyes and growling out of ARRRGHHHHs you have heard since you watched the last cartoon "Scooby Doo", the sculptor attacks his wife (Dickinson) on a dark night. She runs away and, through mutual knowledge, contacts Norliss to get her help in solving the mystery behind the mysterious reappearance of her late husband on her estate. <br /> <br /> So this guy is a vampire? No. There is no vampire in this story, despite what you may have read or heard. The sculptor does not drink the blood of his victims - he collects it. Such as? I don't know. We only see it attack, never collect. Why? To satisfy the second part of his offer for immortality. It turns out that the reanimated sculptor will be allowed to live forever only if he builds a life-size statue of a demon named Sargoth with a mixture of clay and human blood. Once finished, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue, using it as a gateway to our world. <br /> <br /> FINAL ANALYSIS: <br /> <br /> "Norliss tapes" were not collected as a series for good reason ... it was rubbish. As you can see from my synopsis, the story is a petty and ill-conceived disaster. Acting and dialogue offer no better. This isn't even a contender for a "So Bad It's Good". Sometimes the ugly is just ugly. <br /> <br /> After listening to the underground sounds of the great merits of "The Norliss Tapes" for years, I was very excited to find it on the Fox Movie Channel on 10/15/03. I wish I hadn't made up for it in the fall. <br /> <br /> After trying this groan for the first time two days ago, I can only assume that any applause you've heard so far from other IMDB reviewers is from those who are reviewing the show based on dark memories and the nostalgia of youth. Or maybe they are simply loyal Dan Curtis fans. In any case, they offered you misleading reviews of "The Norliss Tapes". <br /> <br /> Pauly Orchid - October 17th 2003
