Drones, ethnic drums, bad synthesizer bats, singing children. The most paternalistic "world music" imaginable. This is a tourist film and a lousy one. What really kills it is the inconsistent sequences. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc. Etc. No transition, no visual explanation of why we are suddenly ten thousand miles away, no idea expressed in images. Just a bunch of footage of Third Worlders with "baskets on their head" as another reviewer said. To walk endlessly as if it had a deep meaning. If these guys wanted to make a third world music video, all they had to do was head a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of Koya and movies were shot in Mexico. It would have been a much better environment for "life in transformation". <br /> <br /> But no. What they decided was an encrypted tourist itinerary that covered half the globe and shots filtered in supernatural shots. The only thing to recommend to this film is that it doesn't suck as much as Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> RstJ
