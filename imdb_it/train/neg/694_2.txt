It's the early 80s. There is a group of suspiciously old teenagers. And there is a maniac who is around. Yes, this is slasherville. <br /> <br /> This film is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I have not the foggiest idea. Unless your idea of ​​a great joke is to repeatedly hit someone's dinner with a baseball bat - on balance, not a big joke; in fact it is rather a garbage prank, to be honest. But you go there. <br /> <br /> The film itself is about a group of teenagers who have the task of cleaning a disused dormitory. They realize that a psychopath is on the loose. To combat this development, they separate and wander in the dark. It ends in tears for most of them. <br /> <br /> Pranks is a poorly made slasher film. The DVD version I saw was the Vipco version. Seems to be cut by a lot of violence. This makes the DVD even more useless because, let's face it, a slasher film without violence is a waste of time. Only for the makers of slasher movies and bad videos.
