A dog found in a local kennel is paired with Satan and has a litter of puppies, one of which is given to a family that has just lost its previous dog for a success & run. The puppy doesn't need time to do as Donald Trump and fire the Mexican housekeeper, what a party. Only the father suspects that this dog is more than it appears, the rest of the family loves the demonic big dog. So it's up to dad to say the day. <br /> <br /> The late 1970s, made for the TV horror film, makes little sense, if not a misplaced nostalgia. When I saw him as a child, I discovered that he was a bit tonic, but revisiting him as an adult now I realize that he is just a little boring, boring and not very well acted. <br /> My Grade: D
