I totally disagree with those comments that say this is a good movie. This is a totally SUCKED movie. I mean SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. The development of the story is strange. Mia Kirshner went from an innocent girl to a girl looking for fun without any convincing reason. Moreover, all the actresses seemed too old to be university students - the university students were about 30 years old - you understand the rest. I only watched about the first ten minutes and started the fast advance to search for sex scenes. all the sex scenes are lame, hurried and, above all, nothing frontal. All the sex scenes are ridiculous, considering how many clothes they wore. Do yourself a favor - put it down and save some money. Conclusion: History - 0, Sex - 0, Acting - 0, Score - 0 of 10.
