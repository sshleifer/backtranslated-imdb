I think this is one of Kenneth Branagh Shakespeare's weakest works. After great efforts like much noise for nothing, etc. I thought he was poor. The cast was weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???), but my biggest gripe was to mess up Bardo's work and cut out part of the game to insert the music / dance sequences. <br /> <br /> You simply don't do Shakespeare and then play with the play. Sorry, but it's wrong. I love Cole Porter, just like the next person, but jeez, don't mess with Shakespeare. Skip this and look at "Prospero's Books" if you want to see a brilliant Shakespearean adaptation of the Tempest.
