Having decided some time ago to collect Billy Bob Thornton's films (on the strength of class movies like "Sling Blade", "A Simple Plan" and "The Man Who Wasn't There" among others), it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there. What I didn't realize, however, was that there could be THIS bad. I'll give you an idea of ​​how incredibly poor this film is - the most fun dialogue in it is: "Knock Knock", "Who's there?", "The big fetish man", "The big fetish man who?", "The great smelly man - you are YOU! ". Yes folks, it's really that bad. Billy Bob is only for about two minutes (I suppose he needed work at that time in his career), and the rest of the film is painful. But for some reason, even if it's undeniably terrible, I don't hate it. It's probably because I saved my wrath for any burden full of high-level special effects like "The Fast and the Furious" and not like a "no-budget" movie like this. 2/10 to a push.
