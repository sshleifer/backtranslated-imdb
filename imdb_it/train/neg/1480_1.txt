He pulled the boys out of his ass! Is this a parody ?! No one really writes that it happened as a horribly wrong improvisation. I think anyway. This film must be a parody because someone would say that he wrote that script otherwise. Someone can imagine the whole cast sitting while the director and screenwriters pass over the storyboard. <br /> <br /> The director says, "our bad complexion uses his 24-inch machete to gut our creepy neighbor token. He's going to pull his guts out of his belly" <br /> <br /> "Brilliant!" The entire cast proclaims. <br /> <br /> It can't happen, nobody writes that stupid! I must be a parody. <br /> <br /> I liked the part where the skinny and introspective girl beats the inbreed with the cast iron pan on the cave floor. I wasn't sure if the unpublished types of cannibals worried about cooking a lot. Perhaps this explains why the pan was lying on the floor in darkness at just the right time to kill the malformed carcass. It seems ironic that after the bizarre boy beat the martial arts queens and a pair of goalkeepers out of doors, he falls so easily into the pan of a skinny, helpless girl next door. <br /> <br /> What the hell is that Richard Greco guy doing in this? Did you fire your agent or something? <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain the ending to me because I didn't understand it? I can't understand why the beautiful girl of the hero wanted to kill the nice lady who was making her tea. It doesn't matter, I don't want to know.
