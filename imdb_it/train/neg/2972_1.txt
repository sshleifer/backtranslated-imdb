My teacher registered this and showed it to us in Child Care to show how teenage pregnancy affects people. He has just shown how much adolescent pregnancy affects an inadequately educated infant athlete on how sex works and a complaining and unloved girl who throws fruit when she is angry and cannot say that she was with the wrong man even if she carried a sign who claimed to be such. I wouldn't be surprised if the child's father had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script. Stacy's mother (the bearer of the child) is a revolt. She is unaware that her daughter has passed the age of four and is apparently unshakable when people spy on her through her dining room window. The name of Bobby's best friend (the father) is Dewey, and is an obvious rip-off of Sean Penn's character in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This film is horrible, simply because none of the characters is credible. Thank goodness it's only made for TV, limiting the audience's chances of seeing it.
