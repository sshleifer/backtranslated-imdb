I saw this film over its period of time, when having a child out of wedlock not only ruined your life, but marked your child like a bastard. In these days of "single mothers" may seem very far-fetched, but it was very true. And I'm not crazy about laughing with someone who's stuttering, either. Among these two problems I had difficulty finding this funny movie. At that time I didn't know who had directed it or what a wonderful reputation he had. I knew who Betty Hutton was and she made me nervous because she was so hectic. I love "Bringing Up Baby", but I find this film simply embarrassing. I'm sure the punch in some church functions was probably spiked, but I was the one who needed to drink after seeing it again. The idea that the girl should have been drunk to "get married" and get pregnant added to the misery. An entire city could turn on under these circumstances, so the result of this film is really the fun part. Sure, shoot me, I don't even like "It's a wonderful life".
