I had not seen the trailer of the film when I went to see the film, instead I based my judgments on the opinions of a friend. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie falls on his face. <br /> <br /> During the movie Rock offers a couple of funny jokes, but unfortunately the film is definitely devoid of comedies. The film seems to want to integrate both laughter and love into one, and what it tries does not succeed. The film's love story is direct (fortunately), but it takes away too much from the film by making Rock serious and insipid. After all, the film is primarily intended to be a comedy, where laughter should be the main concern. Not much of this in the film. <br /> <br /> The plot is also rather uninteresting as a whole. Some parts were discontinuous altogether. If the supporting cast was meant to be fun, it certainly didn't do a good job. The pair of angels from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes, which were dry and boring. Even the subordinate couple of the first incarnation of Rock was insipid. If there's one thing they did well, though, they made Rock more fun by comparison.
