Anyone who has seen "Shine", the Scott Hicks movie of the harrowing but ultimately joyful life of pianist David Helfgotts; I'm sure the "SOLOIST" is very poor in comparison. It's slow as a lullaby (I took five breaks answering emails just to wake up). The representation of the homeless area is above the summit and extremely self-indulgent, at the same time I fear with the horrible description of the Joe Wrights beach battle, another Attonment disaster. .J Fox's performance was an extremely poor example of acting and lacked credibility with respect to the offset.Downey on the other hand; although struggling with a fast-paced film, he still manages to charm, am I or is he turning into George Clooney in more than one way? The comparison between these well-known 'STAR'actors' is not necessary, since the light that shines brighter as far as acting is concerned must be to "shine" Geoeffry Rush, whose brilliant performance is certainly brighter in my sky. With "Attonment" and "The Soloist" the written word wins many more prizes for the subject's empathy. Read the book and the articles or wait until the DVD is destined to be soon in the basement of business.
