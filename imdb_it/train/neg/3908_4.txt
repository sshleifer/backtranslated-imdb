There is enough stellar power in THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS to create another galaxy, but the final product is rather questionable. The film and its messages are very noble and I think perhaps most would agree with them. (Good liberal democracy, violent bad fascist regime, good openness, bad racism, etc.). Unfortunately, we are abused from head to toe with these, and the same subtlety is used as I described them. <br /> <br /> After all, we were left to look at very noble people with no faults that overlap with unpleasant idiots that have no salvific qualities. It radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated "pro" wrestling match. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays the patron, a man of many contradictions. Meryl Streep as her gifted bride and Glenn Close, as his sister-in-law. When the camera stays with these people, the film tends to move and is quite funny. Unfortunately, THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS simply interacts with too many secondary plots, and the characters appear and disappear as targets for shooting galleries. We don't know them, so we don't take care of them. The result is boredom. <br /> <br /> If Bille August, director and screenwriter (based on the book by Isabel Allende) had lengthened the film or cut some characters, this film could have worked completely. As it is, it was a nice attempt, with good messages, and a stunning bewilderment. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
