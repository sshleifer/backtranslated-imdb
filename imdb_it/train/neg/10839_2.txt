This was shown on the biography channel and was almost as informative as a children's comic! I gave 2 out of 10 for his attention to detail because for the most part he looked 70s and the three women who played the three original angels looked like that, the trick was good. <br /> <This was to be a biography of the biography channel, but it was empty of everything that is normally / usually seen in one of their biographies. No interview with cast members, crew members, production team members etc. Survivors, or with their friends, families and any biographers of those people. In fact, I now know as much about the program as I did before seeing this film based on the (alleged) biographical book. As for actually learning something that no one knew about the program and it was not common knowledge that well never happened.
