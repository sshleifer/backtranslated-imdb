The two things are good for this film are two unknown celebrities. <br /> <br /> First, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in a film, young and elastic, with the looks that still surround her body, steals at the very beginning, which is all that is inside, and this is it. Obviously it's only starting because his acting has improved with his next projects. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the soundtrack of the famous composer Christopher (Chris) Young is what prevents this star from getting a star ... yes, I know that one more star is not much, but in the case of this film, it's a lot. <br /> <br /> The rest is just a stupid foolish horror of a couple of university students trying to clean a dormitory that is due to be torn down, taken away one by one by an unsuspecting killer, blah, blah ... we all know where he's going. <br /> <br /> Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga, then turn it off.
