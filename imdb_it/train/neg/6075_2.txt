One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a useless clich√© of a slasher movie exercise. Try to turn or distort the genre with absurd plot lines of a crazy fan turned psychotic - the film turns into nothing. (spoiler) Do we have to believe that an idiot armed with a knife has access and kill a baseball player in a luxury hotel without witnesses, security or cameras? The film is nonsense that tries to jerk the strings of the heart through the hustle and bustle of baseball and ends up being mocking and deceptive. I'm not sure what all the actors were thinking when they boarded this raid. This is a real disaster as they come. Stay away if you prefer to think in your films
