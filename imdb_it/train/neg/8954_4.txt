I had high hopes for this film, because I loved the book so much. However, I don't think I would have understood the premise of the film if I hadn't already read the book. The film is a noble attempt to show the desperation of people trying to break the bonds of the dominant government, but the book describes suffering much more deeply. Corrupt government officials have comfortable and almost luxurious lives, while ordinary people struggle to achieve poor survival needs. Perhaps most people feel this way towards their leaders and rulers, regardless of whether they are actually oppressed or repressed. Orwell's dystopia seems as if it could exist in many places in our modern world. It's been several years since I read the book, but references to Big Brother, Thought Police and Newspeak are often heard in the media and in casual conversations. Probably many people who use these terms do not understand where the terms come from. I highly recommend reading the book.
