From the beginning of the film, it gives the impression that the director is trying to portray something, I mean that instead of the story that defines the style in which the film should be made, it went the opposite way, it had a kind of move that he wanted to do and he wrote a story to put it into practice. And he failed very badly. I imagine he was trying to make a fashionable movie. Anyway, I think this film is a total loss of time and effort. On the merit of the director, he knows the media he's working with, what I'm trying to say is that I've seen the worst films of this. Here at least the director knows he maintains continuity in the film. And the actors also gave a decent performance.
