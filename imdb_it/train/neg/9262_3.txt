On the surface the idea of ​​Omen 4 was good. It's nice to see that the devil could be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the exorcist, when girls are possessed or are diabolical, it is very effective. But in Omen 4, it's smelly. <br /> <br /> Delia does not make me think she could be a diabolical child, rather she is a child with problems. Problems that perhaps only a therapist, rather than a priest could help. It doesn't look scary or diabolical. Rather, she seems sulky and moody. <br /> <br /> This film had potential and if it was made by the same people who made the three previous films, it could have worked. But it's actually quite offensive to actually make a sequel to one of the most popular horror trilogies, like a special TV movie product. <br /> <br /> On so many levels that lets it go. It has an economic aspect, acting is an Amazon and the effects are typical of a television drama. The characters carry no sympathy and do not route them for them. I recently saw him again after someone brought him for me at Christmas, and he's dated scary. <br /> <br /> If you think you are looking at this, then I suggest you not do it. Look at one of the others, or look at the exorcist, or look at the good son. Don't waste your time with this drivel!
