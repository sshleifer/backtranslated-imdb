Here is the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea. Is this the problem is not? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and its execution have no real substance. You should grab yourself from the start and then pull your emotions a little, get them interested and invest in the characters. This film doesn't have what it takes to take off and sustain the flight, and here's why. First of all do not worry about the characters because they are not presented in a way in which people can identify themselves, I mean that this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, but normal people who are in a stressful situation. They are not credible in the way they act and interact. Example: Jeffrey Combs is a policeman who is chewing gum, frowning and looking intently all the time is not the way to go here. I mean what is it ?, it looks like it's in the bathroom or something. I loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the genius of the intense / neurotic and not appreciated medicine was right for the money. But not for this, he tries too hard to compensate too much by looking so intense and nervous, but in a still mild neurotic way, it's not natural, I'm surprised he didn't dislocate his jaw during filming. The film is basically based on life support, has just a pulse and made me wait for something that would never come.
