Karl Jr. and his father now run an army on a remote island. They capture a trio of kids who stumble on the island. Those who fight back after a while. (well the survivors) This has relentless blood, blood and carnage, which would have been good if any of them were apparently remote, or if production hadn't been done with a week of saving money (maybe I'm going too well, probably it was only a couple of days). The horrendous dubbing didn't bother me that much and I suspect that if I was really drunk, a little COULD have been slightly witty ... maybe. But as it is, at only 78 minutes the film still seemed too long ... Oh, I don't know ... 78 minutes. Do not waste time. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: bonus movie: "Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence"; and trailers for other films released by Shock-o-Rama
