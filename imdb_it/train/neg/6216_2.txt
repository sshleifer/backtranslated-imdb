9, the film that I had been looking forward to for months ... was little more than a disappointment. <br /> <br /> I was deeply surprised by the lack of stories and the strange development of the character. All the fantastic action sequences in the world do not compensate for a single obnoxious character. <br /> <br /> The strange, almost thrown into the occult sequences were not only out of place, they were exasperating. The story is about robots and scientists ... why does it suddenly turn into a horror necronomicon wannabe with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could have been an extraordinarily scary story device ?? <br /> <br /> How, what, when, why .... questions that presage only asking if you are interested and it becomes less and less likely that you will leave the theater. <br /> <br /> A film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth ... I would like to watch this pastel-drawn film if the story was good. But the filmmakers relied on the magic of the CGI and the name of Tim Burtons to attract the crowd. Which ... is what attracted me but failed to achieve my respect. <br /> <br /> 9 would have been fantastic ... with some more rewriting and a little more respect from its own creators.
