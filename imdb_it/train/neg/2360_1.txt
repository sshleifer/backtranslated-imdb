This will be the most useless comment I've ever made, but I have to do it to warn you of the atrocity in the cinema that "Freddy's Dead" is. It's not just the worst chapter in the Nightmare series, but it's right there with the worst sequel of all time! He was boring, useless and almost dead. The horrible 3-D end and exaggerated CORNY killings are enough to bring this "movie" into the ground. However, it doesn't stop there, just add a bad acting, a terrible script and a number of cheese cameos and you have yourself this pile of guano! No wonder Freddy, as always played by Robert Englund, has made two post-mortem appearances. I would do it too if I went out like this. This is a film strictly reserved for fans, not staring at our shame.
