The film's main flaw is its uninspired script. He moves back and forth between the cartoons of Bettie's story and the re-creations of Klaw's short films. While Klaw's re-creations are well done, it is not necessary to recreate them in their entirety. Page Richards, while not an extraordinary actress, does a decent job overall. And, at times, it bears a remarkable resemblance to Bettie. The attention to detail is also noteworthy. Well-made costumes and clothes, like some of the management sets. The sets are generally scarce and can be heard on stage, but feel the era. Sometimes it is surprisingly well lit, and the color palette has been clearly designed to give the overall look a lively and retro look.
