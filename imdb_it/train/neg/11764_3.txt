I must say that I was looking forward to watching this film and finding a new life in it that separated it from the most boring and elaborate Mexican films. I have no idea why, but I trusted Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas to be the one who injected freshness and confidence into our non-existent sector. Perhaps because the soundtrack (which I listened to before seeing the film) seemed different from the others, perhaps because it had the courage to include new faces (apart from Demian Bichir, who is always a favorite of Mexican directors) and presumably treated inside of the script with a modern social behavior, perhaps because the photography I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical. The film turned out to be a big audience and a big disappointment. What Serrano actually deals with is the very ancient "battle of the sexes", as in "all men are equal" and "why all women ...?" blah, blah, blah. Nothing new in it, not even that, uses so much common ground and cliché that in the end it taunts itself without leaving any precious reflection on the female / male condition. Full of the usual tramps on the public as gags on the safe side of the clichés of which I spoke before (those that always work, always) and of screaming performances (it is a well acted film in its context) .. and screaming I mean, literally. According to Serrano, the first most compelling characters played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir are the most pathetic. I totally disagree with Serrano, they should not have been treated that way just to serve as puppets for his lesson to deal with ... he made sure we had his message and completely destroyed their roles which were the the only solid ground in which this history could have resisted. However, after all it's a very funny movie sometimes and you'll probably enjoy seeing it (if you agree to be manipulated by it).
