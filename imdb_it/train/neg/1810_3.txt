Think of this film as a live-action program on Saturday morning many years ago. Even the small tykes will find this difficult to please because it runs like treacle! I can't fully understand how horrible it is to do something too typical and uninteresting, especially in the costume department! Too many wizard warrior movies out there have used the same old plot many times, but this is very scarce considering its appeal to little treasures. And who in the world would have ever let a topless siren be launched? I thought it was a "family" movie! MST3K, here's another jewel for your 1999 television season!
