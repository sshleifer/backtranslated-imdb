A misinterpreted two-person dramatic comedy suddenly turns into a weren't-we-awful-to-the-Indians controversy, with very bad special effects, exploitative use of nudity and ugly violence. It is as sincere as a politician's handshake, as obvious as the tone of a car salesman, one of the worst films in the history of the universe. Absolute and total dreck.
