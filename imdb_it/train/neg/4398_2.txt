Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors that I've enjoyed throughout their career, and this was the only reason to choose to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is that I completely regret it! These two great actors humble themselves to the hilt by performing a number of irrelevant objects, devoid of imagination and kitsch to the extreme (not that this is bad in itself) sketches that should make people laugh, but don't do it. The only reason I can think of is that the director was a friend of theirs, and they decided to support his film by playing it - I can't think of anything else because this movie is SO cheap! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Cusack have never failed me since. I would advise you to avoid this movie, unless you want your opinion on the two actors to be flawed.
