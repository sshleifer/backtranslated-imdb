Don't spend your money or your time in this pitiful film in the role of cinematography. When every third word is dedicated to vulgar language and there is no real storyline, besides having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same outdated performance of the past and have not evolved in their career, it leaves a lot to be said. I expected something better from the award-winning actor Benicio del Toro. The view that others might have of the Puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such garbage as Maldeamores. A bad word at a given moment in a film can be used to emphasize a given point of view and can also be fun or sad depending on its context (see the movie Elsa and Fred for example) but should not permeate the plot. The film is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this movie.
