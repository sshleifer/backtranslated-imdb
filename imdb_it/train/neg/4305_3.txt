I saw this movie some time ago on a Video CD. <br /> <br /> First I will mention the good points. <br /> <br /> The film, at first, at least tries to appear which is not distorted, as if it did not show a character like black and the other as white. Both main characters are friends and live very well in a country and an economy that are not exploding and at the same time there is no shortage. Their families get together and have parties and practice their favorite sport, shooting with sports rifles, as companions not as competitors. <br /> <br /> But, after the first 15 minutes, the plot runs into a crossroads. The public is expected to believe that for some unknown reason these friends must hate each other. That for some unknown reason Bosnia is now on its way to conflict. Of course, the script adds in television footage that the characters seem to watch live programs in English, but the films are from 1993 and not from 1992 when the war began. <br /> <br /> The story, the 1990 elections, the people who caused the war are not mentioned. The film tries to blame Karadzic, who had been a presidential candidate and leader of the 2nd largest party in the Bosnian Parliament (SDP). According to the Bosnian Constitution, the SDP would have had the Presidency in 1992, but in January there was a coup. The Bosnian Islamic Democratic Action Party took total control and held a segregated referendum in March in which it declared itself law in Bosnia and announced the Secession. <br /> <br /> The history of IDAP begins with the Bosnian Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, a suspiciously absent man from "STtH". He was a student of Nazism in World War II. He also wrote his "Mein Kampf" in which he stated: "It is not possible that there is any peace or coexistence between" the Islamic religion "and non-Islamic social and political institutions". <br /> <br /> In 1990 he lost the IDAP elections for "moderate pro-Yugoslavian" Fikret Abdic, a Bosnian Muslim, who worked with Christian Serbs during the civil war, and who treated his supporters as brothers . Abdic was prevented from taking power by Izetbegovic, who lost the election but won the seat of power. <br /> <br /> The events mentioned above are not present in the film, but are the real events that lead to war. <br /> <br /> There were also problems with props. Serbian soldiers in the film wore Soviet helmets from World War II, which they had not used. Even a soldier was holding an M-1944 WW2 rifle used only by the USSR and not by Yugoslavia. <br /> <br /> The director and screenwriters had a chance, but they chose to rewrite history.
