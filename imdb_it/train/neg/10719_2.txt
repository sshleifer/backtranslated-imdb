I wouldn't say it's totally sucked, but if it wasn't for Netflix I wouldn't even have that in my house. The eccentric president of Steve Martin of a chain of health food stores collapses. He's not funny. It is another in a long series of SNL scraps that can only find work to devote to the next SNL film. The birth instructor with the Elmer Fudd blur is as much fun as it is original. Amy Poehler simply goes through the same moves she would like to make for a 7-minute SNL skit that is as fun as SNL lately. The only thing that stands for this movie is that Tina Fey is easy on the eye. The ending was predictable as soon as you heard that his character couldn't get pregnant. The topic could be open to other attempts at comedies, but it simply seems to simmer, not very funny or create laughter.
