Almost from the word, this film is poor and unconvincing, but then again most people would find it hard to show commitment to such an uninteresting script. Dialogue does not actually flow and sometimes, as in this case, it is lower (or should have been). This is also the backup of strange scenes (for example Cemetry's slow motion walk) that you think might lead somewhere but they just seem to waste more seconds of your life. <br /> <br /> The plot is a strange combination of gangster / comic situation that I'm sure has seemed like a good idea at the time but if there was ever a case for someone who needs to be honest with the writer, then here it is. <br /> <br /> Martin Freeman is fine but then he seems to have a character that always plays so I'm starting to wonder if he was given a script or just turned and said he would react normally. <br /> <br /> Finally - humor. This reminds me of the Python quote (I think) on Shakespere, of his "comedies" - If he wanted it to be funny, he would have put a joke on it. Well, I haven't seen one. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time - I did it because I was watching it with a friend and I kept hoping it would improve. <br /> <br /> He didn't.
