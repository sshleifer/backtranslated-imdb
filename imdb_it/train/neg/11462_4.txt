I like monster movies in general. Although they are far-fetched and foolish. But it's hard to appreciate this movie when it's so implausible and stupid And try to take everything seriously at the same time. As in a very elegant way. <br /> <br /> Although the idea is somewhat real, as Orcas is famous for killing Great White Sharks, it's really hard to find it scary when I can't help but see an angry Shamoo destroying stuff. Especially that scene where some buildings exploded due to the making of the Orca ... and as it explodes, it comes out of the water and it looked like I was watching a show at Sea World with fireworks. They also kill a lot of scary moments before they even suggest they are going to happen. Beyond that, it takes a few shots at JAWS. It's like "hey look, we are made in fact and we can find BETTER reasons why the Orca is attacking". <br /> <br /> Yes you are, ignoring your scandalous **** ups in logic of course. But JAWS had something your film doesn't have. It's scary. Yes, it is implausible. Yes, it's a bit outrageous. But frankly, factual or not, a killer shark is not close to being scary as a big white man. And the poor attempt to develop and write the character only hurts more. Even JAWS the Revenge is scarier than this.
