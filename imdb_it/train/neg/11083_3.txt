This film was late at night when I saw it. It was interesting at the beginning but it didn't convince me as a whole. I'm not a Tyson fan. In fact, I don't like boxing at all. It is barbaric, obscene and double-sided (by society) that some people get money to beat each other. <br /> <br /> However, I heard that the beginning of the film was OK. Actors well, especially George C. Scott (as Cus D'Amato). I don't know how reliable the film is. I haven't read books and books on boxing or Tyson. I don't know anything about man, but it was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> As the film progressed, I felt I had lost some of its charm and I also lost interest. I managed to stay awake but the last hour wasn't good enough.
