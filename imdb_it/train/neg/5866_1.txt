I remember this film when I was 13 (it seems that many reviews are saying the same thing 13 YEARS!) With a group of classmates. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in his first film and we fell in love with the typical commercial ads that told us it was a great comedy. We suffered for about 45 minutes and everyone agreed to leave the theater. It was grotesque and insipid, and far from the ability that Billy Crystal had to make us laugh, we weren't laughing. I came across this review by accident, and I decided to register just to tell the rest of the world what a waste of film this was, now if you entrust it, you deserve what you get, YOU WERE NOTIFIED !!
