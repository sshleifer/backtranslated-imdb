The book is so beautiful that at least the opening of this TV movie will move you, but then, as it diverges more and more from the book, removing all religion, love and mathematics and inserting clich√©s of cotton candy becomes boring However, from the comments I've heard, people who haven't read the book tend to like it, and if it even leads the child to read A Wrinkle in Time, it will have served its purpose. The most embarrassing change is to make the Happy Medium a clone of Uncle Albert by Mary Poppins (I love to ride). Nothing is so strong that they cause the characters on the screen to laugh hilariously for things that are totally unpleasant.
