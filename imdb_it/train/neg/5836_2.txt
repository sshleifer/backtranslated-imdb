From the pen of Richard Condon (The Manchurian Candidate 1962) comes this confused story of political intrigues and murders. The story, told in an almost comic way, is difficult to digest. Considered the cast of all the actors, this poor effort is not entirely attributable to the cast and the crew: the novel was full of the same deficiencies. It seems that sometimes the story is actually making fun of the most sincere effort highlighted in the "Manchurian Candidate". A disappointment for everyone.
