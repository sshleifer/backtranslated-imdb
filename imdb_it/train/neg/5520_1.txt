This film was played in the trailer as a comedy. It is an extreme tragedy. It left me sick to my stomach. I hated it. I think if they want to make a film like this they should be men enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. I wouldn't have seen this movie if I had known. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a film. I'm tired of it. I really wanted to do a funny comedy and I'm extremely disappointed. Several days have passed and I still have a bad taste in this film. I've never been more disappointed in a film, nor have I ever written a comment about a bad movie. I really think the real deception was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intention of the movie, nobody would see it.
