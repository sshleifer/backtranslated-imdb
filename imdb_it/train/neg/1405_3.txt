"A Damsel in Distress" is definitely not one of Fred Astaire's best musicals. But even Astaire's bad films have always had good moments. <br /> <br /> In "Damsel", Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an American musical star who is in London on a tour of personal appearances. Meet Lady Alice Marshmorton (19, Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heiress, who jumps on the back of a taxi she is taking to escape a crowd of admirers. <br /> <br /> Jerry believes that Alice is forced to marry her rich aunt. He tries to save her from his family's country house, but soon discovers that the house staff is betting on which married Lady Alice will marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner), the conniving butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the rascal kid, alternate alternately helping and sabotaging Lady Alice's love affair with Jerry to make sure they win the bet. <br /> <br /> This musical has numerous problems. First of all, there is the plot, based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse (who co-wrote the script). The story is slow, painful and nervous. When Fred doesn't dance, we have to endure endless interminable scenes of (a) Fred enduring Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert conniving against them and each other. <br /> <br /> The butler and the house boy are particularly irritating. They're characters in a one-dimensional stock of cattle, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. Maybe they would like to get off the screen and let Fred dance. <br /> <br /> Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a lackluster young lady in this film, and is uncomfortable in a musical. She has little for her, from the point of view of the character, in addition to her adorable face and her beautiful smile. <br /> <br /> George Burns and Gracie Allen are ready for the journey, like Jerry's press officer and his brazen secretary. The duo adds some chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny jokes, but sometimes it's boring too. <br /> <br /> The direction of George Stevens' film is not well done. Sometimes, cinematography is horrible and out of focus. There are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy roads to try to convince the public that we're in London, not Hollywood. (They must have used tons of dry ice in this film.) On the plus side, George and Ira Gershwin's songs are fantastic, and have become standard for classic songs. And, of course, the dance in the film is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and her choreographer, Hermes Pan. <br /> <br /> But the music and dance numbers are poorly used and poorly positioned. Sometimes, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers seem to be inserted at random in the tortuous plot. (At one point, the butler leaves the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo without a clear reason.) The numbers include:  "I am dancing and I cannot be disturbed now" - Fred dances well on a foggy street full of traffic in London. He does a nice "cane twirling" with a rolled up umbrella - but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (In the Broadway musical, "Crazy For You", Harry Groener made a much better version of this issue with a group of choir girls.) <br /> <br />  "Put me to the test" - Fred, George and Gracie make a tap-dancing trio in an English cottage. George and Gracie pair up with Fred step by step, but the number ends badly when everyone kicks each other for no reason. <br /> <br />  "Stiff Upper Lip" (The Fun House Number) - In an amusement park home, Fred, George and Gracie enjoy dancing on the revolving floor, on the rotating barrel and with the nice mirrors home. It's the best number in the film, but sometimes it gets a little repetitive. <br /> <br />  "Things are looking up" - Fred and Joan Fontaine do their dance number together in the movie, hopping around the woods at the back of the country estate. Fortunately, it is a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer. <br /> <br />  "A foggy day in London" - Fred wanders through the misty estate at night, chanting for the foggy day when she met Joan for the first time in London. Sometimes, it seems like I'm not sure which way it's going in the fog - just like the musical number itself. <br /> <br />  "Nice work if you can get it" - A great song that is abused in the film. During a social event at the manor, Fred is attracted by a chorus of serious-looking singers who sing this song at random. Whenever Fred joins, the other singers look at him as if they wish him to leave. (Again, Harry Groener made a better dance number with this song in "Crazy For You.")  "Drum Dance Number" - While Fred and Joan are running away, Fred has to stop and make one last tap while. beats a group of drums. As usual, it's a great number of dance. But there is absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the film. <br /> <br /> The most ingenious moment of the film comes when Fred decides to skip a stone balcony on the country estate to demonstrate his love for Joan Fontaine. While jumping from the balcony, he finds a suitably positioned trapeze - it's true, a * trapeze * - hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather, a stuntman in the role of Fred) grabs the trapeze and throws himself on the ground from it. <br /> <br /> The film is worth having on DVD only for the dance numbers, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote control. The >> FF button lets you skip the other boring scenes of the movie to reach the dance numbers.
