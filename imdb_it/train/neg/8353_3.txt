Beaudray Demerille (a weak Peter Fonda, who also directed), an old gambler, wins the young teenager Wanda "Nevada" (pretty but not talented Brooke Shields) in a poker game. Together, the unlikely couple (of course) embarks on a search for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> This is the story and there is really no need to look for a deeper meaning in it. It simply isn't there. Even the acting is very weak, and it was a surprise given the fact that Peter Fonda was in the lead. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something interesting in this movie, take a look at the scenery and look good on a young Brooke Shields. His character, however, is so irritating (especially at the beginning) and stupid, that he is never so sexy or attractive. Too bad, but, given the story, I doubt he could do more. I wonder why Peter Fonda directed and starred in this film. He must have even talked to his father (Henry Fonda) in a (useless) cameo in this ridiculous mess. Unfortunately, this was their only film together. For example, Henry might not be in EASY RIDER? 3/10
