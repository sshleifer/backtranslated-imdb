This must be the worst movie I've ever tried to watch. In the first 15 minutes, there was nothing to keep my interest in this film. At the time I was on vacation and I had plenty of time to dedicate myself to a movie just made for fun. The apartment we stayed in had this film in stock - they must have taken it from the $ 1 store or something. <br /> <br /> If you like Adam Sandler, this is nothing like any other film he has made. This started with a bad premise and then got worse. There is nothing even remotely funny about it. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of movies, including some that I didn't care about. But if you decide to waste time on this film, don't say I didn't warn you.
