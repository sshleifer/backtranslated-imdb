Annie's wig doesn't look good. she's not pretty and pretty enough to play Annie. Annie stands out in the film, as her clothes look like Halloween costumes. terrible acting and terrible plots. This film is such a change from the 1982 version. I think a younger and smaller girl should have had the lead role. Ashley Johnson plays Annie very childish. It is not at all attractive. At least the casting director got it right with Daddy Warbucks. Mrs. Hannigan was also strange. Camilla Belle played Molly well. "Warning" this film could insult your IQ so you can just show it to very young children. 8 and younger. Some plots are too fictitious and could hardly take place in the real world.
