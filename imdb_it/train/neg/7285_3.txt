The sun should settle into this film, forever. <br /> <br /> It goes on indefinitely (which is not usually a bad thing - The English Patient, Schindler's List) but it's so boring. The aging of the actors is incredible and so is the endless plot that really seems to go nowhere. <br /> <br /> In short, a waste of talent and film.
