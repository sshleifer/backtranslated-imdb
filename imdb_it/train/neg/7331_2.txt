this film was clearly hurt and fast. I realize that funding for any such film is hard to find. However, if the plot had some kind of original substance, someone would see that it had the necessary funding, but it was not, and films like this are not necessary and have no purpose. The plot of this film was made and done better than I could add, many times before. There is no reason to make a film that has no chance of competing with others. I was informed by my computer that I need a minimum of ten lines to send my comment so that the following lines are only bull to fill the space. In my opinion there is no need for anything else to say about this film. what I said is a lot and if you lost enough time reading this review, that for God's sake don't waste any more time watching this movie. The only exception to this is if you are the kind of person who likes to watch bad movies that are played on the women's entertainment network at 2:00 in that case go ahead and see what interests me.
