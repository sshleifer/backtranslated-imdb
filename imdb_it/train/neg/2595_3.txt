You're kidding that it was terrible !!! <br /> <br /> But despite this I gave this movie and 3 others and they were all on DVD. The film starts practically an OK movie, but goes downhill from the middle. <br /> <br /> And the final well let's say it was one of the most anti-climatic endings in recent cinema history. Lots of blood in the final sequence and if you like a dose of horror schlock then this is the movie for you .... <br /> <br /> 3/10
