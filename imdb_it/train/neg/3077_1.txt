Hobgoblin ... what a concept. Rick Sloan was a master of this film. He had the genius to produce a film with actors who could not act. In addition to this, he chose to write a screenplay based on a kind of ugly acid journey that was serenely wrong. Put it together, finish with a movie that sucks more than a warehouse full of suckers and vaccine cleaners. This film was very painful. The pain it causes is equivalent to the pain caused by the production of the genitals with a spoon and the entire wound covered with salt and hydrochloric acid.
