This is a typical production of Steele's novels in which two people who have suffered a sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds. I wouldn't call it a spoiler because anyone who has read a Steele novel knows how EVERYONE will end up. If you don't want to know much about the plot, don't keep reading. <br /> <br /> The character of Gilbert, Ophelia, is a dignified French woman who lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop making films that require an accent because she, otherwise a good actress, can't realistically pull out any kind of accent. Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a rather ugly divorce. He is kind, convincing and compelling in this role. <br /> <br /> The two meet on the beach through his daughter, Pip, and initially, Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked about art with the child. Everyone becomes friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two protagonists is not great, even if the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. They did the best they could with a predictable storyline and a script that bordered on stereotypes. Two people meet, tragedy, bigger tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then get together. I wish there was more to it than that, but it's short. <br /> <br /> I wanted mindless entertainment, and I understood it. As for the genre of romantic films, this fails to be memorable. "A Secret Affair" with Janine Turner is far superior (not a book by Steele), as well as some of Steele's previous books turned into films.
