Pok√©mon the film was a terrible film. unlike the first, this is not a good movie at all. the graphics were decent, but the story was flat and there was no real drama. in the first the interaction between the characters was decent. the brock subtraction and the addition of tracey were bad. Tracey doesn't really have much to say or do, and unlike Brock it doesn't offer comic relief. the only good thing is that you see the mist that actually becomes jealous for the ash, and his first thoughtful of being called his girlfriend was fun. overall this film is not worth hiring and the first short film did nothing for me or my wife. and we consider ourselves pokemon fans. Oh well, maybe the next one will be better, but much worse
