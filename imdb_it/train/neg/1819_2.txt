I searched for this movie for a reason - Al Adamson. He's among the worst directors of all time - right there with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the pantheon of horrible. However, I was a little disappointed because, although the film was really bad, it never came close to the horror levels of some of its previous schlock movies. For this reason, this film was not particularly fun to watch for us fans of bad movies. <br /> <br /> Now I was wary of watching this movie, since the title "Naughty Stewardesses" makes the film like a pornographic movie film - something I would not like to review on IMDb. However, this film seemed to be this sometimes - especially the first 10 minutes. But one could say that the script has undergone many changes, given that for most of the film there is no titillation and towards the end of the film there is a plot that comes out of where it is violent and certainly NOT sexy! The result of all this is total confusion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the many parts is even good. For example, like a porn video, it shows surprisingly little and is incomprehensible because they would put a 71-year-old boy in some love scenes. Of course, for a 71-year-old Mr. Livingston seemed pretty good - but he was still an old man and nobody would want to see him doing it with the young nymphet! Then, when the last 20 minutes become very violent, as Livingston has become a Rambo type! Talk about strange and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> In general, there is little to recommend this sad film. He's not bad enough or sexy enough to worry and the movie manages to be rather boring even with such a crazy title as "Naughty Stewardesses".
