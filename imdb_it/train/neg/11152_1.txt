Why worry about seeing this movie if you have great movies to watch. It is a total waste of time and money. The film is so ugly that I felt bad about watching it. Everything in it is BAD. The actors were bad. The script was REALLY bad. The story is stupid. And the worst CGI EVER. The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the film in the strip club. An interesting thing is that there is a character we want him to die because he is so stupid that he has enough of him. (I don't remember the name but it was the "Prescelto" BOY.) <Br /> <br /> NOTE: if you want to see a good movie, this film is not the right choice. 0 stars out of 10
