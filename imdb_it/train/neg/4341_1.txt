It was so lame that I turned off the DVD ... maybe halfway through. He was so weak that I couldn't even pay close attention to tell you how far I had gotten away. Although I really wanted to believe that the depiction of the young Carlito was a little different, I could not buy it. I don't really blame the actors, because I think it was the script that was down. I found myself laughing a couple of times, but I don't think those lines were meant to be funny. <br /> <br /> It's just a matter of saving that I bought in a 2 DVD set and I would have paid the price I only did for the original. This is one of those cases where they should leave the classic stand alone.
