believe it or not, this film is worse than the number tre.it is slower, the acting is worse, and the story is very weak. There is not much good to say about this film. Even the fight scenes are more boring than number three, and I thought it was impossible. This is a very slow 90 minutes. In fact. I blocked it, hoping it would improve. If you really want to see this movie, you should try to find one that is hard to find (for buying, ie) and probably for a good reason. Like the number three, this film has nothing to do with the first two. It is the same as a single name. In any case, the more I can give the best of the best: without warning it is 2/10
