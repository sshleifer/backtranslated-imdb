It had all the clich√©s of films of this type and no substance. The plot didn't go anywhere and at the end of the film I felt crazy looking at it. Production was good; however, the script and acting were B-movie quality. The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed with crumby actors. Good actors have not behaved alone, nor have they raised others. <br /> <br /> This film is not worthy of words, but I will say more to satisfy the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. interpret their caricatures in other films. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for mindless entertainment, I wouldn't recommend this movie.
