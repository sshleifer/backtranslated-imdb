Spectacular drama comedy strangely, though petty about a strange boy who hopes to fly like a bird through the Houston Astrodome. The quasi-comedy directed by Robert Altman with eccentric characters is so overloaded with oddities that it begins to creak soon from the weight. Part of the film is evocative, Shelley Duvall is a point in her debut as a tour guide, and Sally Kellerman looks at every corner of the glamourpuss like Bud's vision of a "mother bird" (imagine Altman and producer Lou Adler explaining that role to her !). In the lead, Bud Cort is - once again, after "Harold & Maude" - a true original; not as daunting as, for example, Michael J. Pollard, Cort manages to be brilliant, extravagant and harmless, a difficult act to carry out. Unfortunately, this is one of Altman's failures. He manages to put together a cast and a strong piece like no other, but let it be heated by an inspired inspiration and spiral downwards. ** from ****
