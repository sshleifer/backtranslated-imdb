Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but it's ridiculous to interpret him as a romantic and cuddly guide. The fact that he dances so well, swallows so effectively, and throws himself in the part so completely somehow makes him look even more scary. In his quieter moments (with the girl in the train station, in the final issue with Rosie), I couldn't take my eyes off of him he was so repellent. You keep expecting the handsome guy to fall and start snarling. Vanessa Williams was the real star, the only performance that was better than the 1963 film. By the way, if you see a production of the theater musical, the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie, you'll see three versions that have more revisions (different songs , same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations) compared to any other musical I've ever seen.
