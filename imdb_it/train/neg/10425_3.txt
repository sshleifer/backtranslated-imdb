This film is fantastic, mind you, but only in the way it tells a very BAD story. Stella is so terribly raw, and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobbish and mean. Neither of them ever learns better. Is it realistic? Somehow, Stella realizes that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy clothes and clothes, but can't understand that she just needs to flatten everything? I don't think so. Stella is a GOOD woman and a VERY GOOD mother. Giving up on herself, so the daughter can be associated with a group of bigoted snobs is disgusting. <br /> <br /> Much of what we see may have been normal for the times: people who drink beer or two, have fun with a pianist, dance, but this is a sort of moral inferiority. "I can't have our son living this way!" Spare me. <br /> <br /> This story tells me one thing: that the unwashed working class can never hope to aspire to the heights of the upper classes. And this is simply a load of nonsense.
