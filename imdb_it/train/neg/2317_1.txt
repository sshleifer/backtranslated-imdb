The director had clearly stated that the idea and the plot of this film are totally original ... however, as regards those who have read the "slam dunk" comic, we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some lines ... <br /> <br /> Another note is that Jay Chow himself DOES NOT know Kung Fu, it will not impress anyone if he tries to behave as he can, many people today can see the differences .. Fortunately the film does not contain much part of KunG Fu's fights and many are enchanted by stunners and visual effects ... <br /> <br /> I think Jay's acting is still painful to watch, especially when almost everyone else in the film is much better. The only reason I think Jay is the main actor is simply because of his popularity. <br /> <br /> Despite what I want to prevent anyone from watching it, making this "original" film get what it shouldn't have become one of the best cheap films in China for this year.
