I must say that during my childhood I am quite proud of many of the films I rented. The exception is Theodore Rex. Talk about the all-time swindler movie in any actor's curriculum. You could only imagine which fired agent of Whoopie must have told you to sign this piece of shit "Hey Whoop, have you ever seen that Dinosaur movie, yes, well, they're making a movie of it, and you can see Germany!" agent must have made reference to Star Wars a lot. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad that I thought that Whoopie must have bought all the copies of this movie and destroyed it. I just hoped he could do the same thing in my memory, because my sister still gives me shit for watching that movie. I mean, I have to admit that I saw Mr. Nanny and Kazzam in the cinemas (good reasons why I gave up on Hulk Hogan and Shaq for a while), but this comes to mind as the worst of my childhood, and the biggest I regret renting my life, and that was 16 years ago. Now I'm 24 if you want to deal. <br /> <br /> Whenever I think of my list of all the worst movies of all time, I don't even mention one, because as a half-sister raped, I try to suppress that ever happened. Fuck Whoopie, be glad that people only recognize Eddie and Sister Act 2 as your worst luck.
