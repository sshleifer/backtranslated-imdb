This is a disconcerting film. <br /> <br /> The beauty of sexual relations between men and women is shown degraded by a group of men and women who can only be described as a collection of extravagances and misfits. <br /> <br /> Greenaway awards his inspiration for Fellini's "8 1/2" movie, but while Fellini is a titan of world cinema, Greenaway is not. <br /> <br /> It does not have the lightness of the master's touch nor its ability to convey feelings and emotions with some clarity. <br /> <br /> It is pretentious, the film is divided into chapters with a written introduction to each one, as if the viewer were to be guided in the film, except that the written notes remain only on screen for a few seconds, not enough long to be read by the public with the result that they are mostly ignored. <br /> <br /> As for women, only two can be described as spectators, Palmira, played by Polly Walker and Giaconda played by Natacha Amal. The rest exudes ordinariness. Both women and men withdraw from the harsh light of reality in the nuances of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Obviously Greenaway wants to emphasize that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness. Women themselves are depressing because they lend their services for money. Relations between men and women are degraded in a commercial transaction. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of joy, happiness or love in the film, in fact there are many scenes that are deeply unpleasant: <br /> <br /> The suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son , Philip and Storey Emmental played respectively by John Standing and Matthew Delamere. The insensitive contempt of both men that Giaconda is taking their child with him, in fact, gets pregnant twice, the first fetus is aborted and the second time, she is sent to a destination chosen by men from a flight book. Both men have sex with a woman who has no legs, (the half woman in the title). The beastiality that exists between Beryl, played by Amanda Plummer, with a pig named Hortense. Father and son share women with each other. Women enjoy being sexually beaten. The father who sleeps with the corpse of his dead wife. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, none of these scenes are shown sexually, only mentioned. <br /> <br /> The aforementioned degradation of women is such that there is no wonder that the film was booed when it was first presented in Cannes. The most extraordinary thing is that the actresses of the film take sides to defend it, showing once again that there is no limit to the naivety of women and that women are deceived to be exploited by men. <br /> <br /> The directional style of Greenaway is pretentious, it is a triumph of style over substance, a representation of Film as Art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense. <br /> <br /> Greenaway tries to reach the sublimity of surrealism but manages to show the banality of human relations.
