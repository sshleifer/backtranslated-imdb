I almost burst out crying watching this movie. Not from laughing, but from the memories of a great Rodney Dangerfield film. Candyshack was his first and he stole the film, Easy Money did it at his best, and Back To School is by far a classic masterpiece of the 80s. Then there were the Coccinelle and it was then that he started to show. Poor Rodney was getting old (Meet Wally Sparks was a small step up from Ladybugs but he didn't say much). <br /> <br /> In My 5 Wives Rodney plays Monte (a name he must love because it is his name in Easy Money) a rich boy (it is not always him) who loves women and marries as if nothing happened . Well now he inherits a huge piece of land and since the land was run by the Amish, he inherits 5 wives. Sounds like a great idea for a Dangerfield movie. The problem is EVERYTHING. The script is so scarce that Rodney seems to say his linings to the camera and all the side characters have nothing to do. It seems that the film was shot on video with some really poor sequences of stunts that obviously aren't Rodney. Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster who seems dying to say the word F (which should be seen from the movie R but plays as if he were PG) and Jerry Stiller has a nice 2 minute cameo. Don't get me wrong, sometimes I laughed at some of Rodney's jokes but the poor guy is getting too old and too slow. We can see his lines from miles. And the film becomes too much of a PC that, thanks to the horrible 90s, the 70s and the 80s, Rodney doesn't work anymore.
