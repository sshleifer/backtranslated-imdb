Bad plot (although good for a B-movie), good fast-paced scenes, at most 5 out of 10. But something has always bothered me about this movie: why is Mariska Hargitay never talking? In the TV version, he shares several intimate moments with Jeff Speakman, even a kiss in a garden. Yet in the normal version (video), most of her scenes are cut off and she never speaks. This annoys me because not only does it bring out a feminine point of view (even if a clich√©) for the film, but it also makes the final frame disturbing. This film would have been better if they had kept their scenes, because in those scenes at least it has a personality, one that subtracts anything that says Speakman.
