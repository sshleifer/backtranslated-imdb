I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare lesson and unfortunately I chose this version. Everything from acting (the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all medium or close-up shots ... no scene shots and very little back in the shots) were absolutely terrible. I watched it during my spring break and it's very safe to say that I felt like I was shelled out for 114 minutes of my vacation. Not recommended by any stretch of the imagination.
