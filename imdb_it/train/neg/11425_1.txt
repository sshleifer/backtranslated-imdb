I don't know what this movie was that made me react so visceral against it. Perhaps the characters were so unlikely and not convincing enough to care. Perhaps it was the disorganized plot. Perhaps it was the fact that Rob Lowe wore a long earring and an eyeliner. Perhaps because at some point in the film they all burst into a song. Maybe it was because the 80s were never the 80s. Perhaps because everything was a showy hyperbole. Maybe it's because a character pulls his fist while moving away from the camera during a fade out. I don't know what made me hate him like that, but if it means trying to look at him again, I'm not willing to find out.
