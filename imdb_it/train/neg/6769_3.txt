A failure. The film was not good. He has the humor of 5-year-olds who won't even giggle. I mean, of course, some parts were fun, but most are not. Lindsey Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer) and should work on better films. The film should have been broadcast as a Disney Channel original film, which is FREE. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was well done about this film was the music. Nothing like a rock soundtrack redone to brighten up your day. These songs are so good. Especially Alyson and Amanda's Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter's, Beach Boy song, Fun Fun Fun. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. If you had given it a ten, 9 would be music and 1 would be the movie. It's not worth your money, but the soundtrack is.
