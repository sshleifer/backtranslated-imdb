Many things become clear by watching this movie: 1) acting is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so-so, but the parent-child conflict borders the soap opera-ish. The other two boys: an excessively sullen child prodigy and your stereotypical blonde-are-but-I'm-really-sensitive-in-love dream; 2) the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing; 3) Robbie's dreams and episodes are disturbing (recited by Tom Hanks); 4) the inclusion of the first ballads of love is a strange choice ("we are all special friends"); 5) the strange lines and the side plots are not improved by the terrible acting; and 5) this is a really bad film. Expect to be disappointed - and probably disturbed.
