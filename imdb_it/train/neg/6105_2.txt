If you are the type of person who can get a kick from a very bad movie, then I highly recommend this. If you are not, stay away. This is an incredibly cheap film and sometimes you may find yourself wondering if it's not just a joke someone is throwing you. The most positive comment I can make is that the perpetrators seemed to realize that it was nonsense at a very low budget, so here there is at least a sense of fun. <br /> <br /> But this is as amateur as it gets. Their idea of ​​giant killer mushrooms are simply boys covered with beige-colored sheets with those that look like junk on their heads. Obviously it is not meant to be taken seriously (to say the least), but even with that disclaimer you will find yourself shaking your head at the incredible joy of it all. Or laugh often, like I did.
