This film is simply horrible. John Ritter takes ciak, 75% of the actors distribute their lines as if they were reading the same from cue cards, poor editing, horrible mixing of the sound (dialogue is difficult to spot in background noise) and a plot that it's not going anywhere. I didn't think I'd ever say that, but Dorothy Stratten isn't the worst actress in this movie. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen expresses his lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started wondering if she had died inside. Even Bogdanovich's children are horrible (the older one is surely reading his lines from a card). This film is seriously horrible. There is a reason why Bogdanovich failed to get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your TV ads, delete the cable. If a friend suggests it, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, it's best to find another soul mate. I'd rather splash around with lawn arrows than sit in this piece of trash again. If you could summarize this movie in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity
