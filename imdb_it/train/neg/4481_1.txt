I was skeptical when I first saw Calvin Kline commercials, but I thought I'd give it a chance. So I saw it and all I can say is bleh. This film was so bad. It is rare that I hate a movie so much. Watching this movie reminded me of those funny scenes in Altman's "The Player," when the writers cast their bizarre ideas to the producers. I'd like to know which MTV producer decided that an hour and a half of Bronte's music video adaptation (but this time Heathcliff is called Heath and he's a rock star, and Hindley's name is Hendrix) would be a good idea. /> <br /> Even that couldn't have been so bad if they hadn't got all the other aspects of the film so horribly. The direction must have been "you're alone, pout for me". I laughed out loud during all the "serious" scenes and was bored for everything else. The camera work was jagged and repeatedly reminded me that I was watching a bad movie trying to be edgy. My theory is that the soundman got bored and went down to the beach for a couple of beers with his boom - all I could hear in the middle of the scenes was the waves. And in the other scenes, I wish it was all I could hear. And speaking of sound, what they did to the song "More" by Sisters of Mercy is absolutely unforgivable, so once again, what they did to Bronte is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, there was a fun scene - especially the moment when Johnny Whitworth licked Katherine Heigl's face - and if you can tell me what that scene has to do with all the rest of the story, more power to you.
