Wonderful. Yet another film about America of someone who has visited here probably half a dozen times, a day a piece, and is believed to be an "expert" of the country. Sheesh. I should take a trip to Germany for a week and then come back and shoot a film about Germany as "the land of the Nazis" or something like that. Wim IL boy, you should be together with Lars von Trier and make the ULTIMATE film about Americans. Of course we all know that we need a pretentious left-wing "we are the European world" approach to make a "real" film about America. <br /> <br /> Yes, right. For a continent that did not start one of the two world wars, Europe certainly has many opinions on America's wrong "foreign policy". <br /> <br /> P.S. Don't worry, Wim IL boy, there are a lot of American UC-Berkeley who will love your movie. Of course, these are the same people who think that George W. Bush is worse than Hitler, and that a painting of a can of soup is "pure genius" !!
