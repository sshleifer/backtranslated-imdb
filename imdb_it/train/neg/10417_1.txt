This would have been a * great * silent film. The acting is really good, at least in a look. But, I'm playing really well! sort of road. <br /> <br /> Everything is HUGE. Every line is PROFOUND! Every scene is CONDUCTED BY THE HUMAN TRAGEDY! <br /> <br /> Mostly, I felt like vomiting. And yet, like any train disaster, I couldn't take my eyes off it. This dialogue may have worked on stage, though I doubt it. On the screen, it was cluttered, random, mince and practically every other stereotypical negative adjective that you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work. <br /> <br /> If you like your melodrama in huge massive doses, * you could * enjoy the movie. Prepare to wait, however. As for the melodrama, this thing definitely follows its rhythm. <br /> <br /> This script must have looked very different when the actors involved read it themselves. It just doesn't work when they come to deliver it in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> IMDB does us a great disservice at times when it uses its goofy "weighted score" computer controlled. The curse of the Starving Class deserves less than a 1. <br /> <br /> The character-based fiction is great, but when you develop your characters simply by pushing them through the circles without any plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution, don't it's character development! Your characters must have a motivation. Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is * not * character development. It's a plot plot. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie. Or at least, watch it quietly. Maybe you'll have some fun with all the moves of the characters. <br /> <br /> Oh, and give the word to the essay - to show that this is truly an artistic film, see James Woods in all his masculine glory "look-at-me, I'm-the-figurative -and-literal-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of-man ". <br /> <br /> Don't say you haven't been warned.
