I can't believe I wasted my money to rent this movie. I thought it was a porn movie when it started and it was never better. The acting, the music that drowns the actors. Horrible. Save your money! You have to read the film to the end b they knew that the music would choke the talking lines. I never had the part about slaughter or the need to continue to show slaughtered cows and pigs. What does this have to do with the "real" killer BTK? I understand why there were no famous actors and actresses in this film. The script would take me away from the first reading page. You better watch the paint dry.
