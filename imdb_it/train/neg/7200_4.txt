I really wanted to like this movie - most of the shots were shot in Pittsburgh and the trailer took some great pictures. But, even for a cartoon, it was a really bad film. Continuity and rhythm were both simply terrible. The best pieces of the film are under the credits, so it's (almost) worth putting it off until the end (although, strangely, it picks up a bit in the last half hour or so). <br /> <br /> When Andy Dick's best film performance, you know there must be a problem ...
