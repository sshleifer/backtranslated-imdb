This is one of those "so bad it's beautiful" movies that you always hear but never see! Unlike the Troma films that are deliberately bad and campy (and I'm not amused) this is 100% pure. <br /> <br /> However with features like an alleged super-lethal killer robot that leaps like one of the Solid Gold Dancers on an acid journey and a magical first mate who calls lightning and turns into the Good Witch of the East , the fact that he pushes himself seriously pushes him so far beyond the limit of evil that he returns to the funny starting point. <br /> <br /> Visible enough due to this.
