This third Darkman was definitely better than the second, but even worse than the original film. What made this better than D2 was the fact that The Bad Guy was changed and Durant was not brought back. Also there was actually some mention of the character's development when it came to the bad boy's family and to Darkman himself. This made my heart softer and I gave this film up to 4/10, ie ** / *****.
