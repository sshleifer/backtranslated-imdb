good God! (and the one from an atheist), this "film" is ugly! <br /> <br /> a lot has already been said by reviewers before (those who voted this piece 3 and following) that I fully agree, I just like to add some things: <br /> <br /> among the three boys who had to eat their digestive end products, they were torn to pieces by an ax, raped by a broomstick, their balls were blown away - the ex-boyfriend suffers the worst tortures while must listen to the girl's endless and useless babble at the kitchen table (as we do, but at least we have the grace of the silent button). <br /> <br /> the director cut off the point and the endless graveyard and the scenes reversed, our suffering would end after 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> the only things that made this movie a bit bearable are Emily Haack's tits (one point). <br /> <br /> forget it. don't buy it don't waste time and your sanity. my brain is so fried after seeing it that I feel the urgent need to look (and suffer?) "Scrapbook" now.
