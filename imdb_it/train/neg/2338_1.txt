How is it possible that no journalist or critic has reminded us of the similarity with that other best Flemish film "Congo Express (1986)"? There are also some characters in Congo Express put together without having a relationship between them: Jean, (de Congolees), the worker, the two taxi drivers, the street singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels is not. This should not be a reason to excuse the flaws in the script (if there is a script) by Anyway the wind blows. The joke (the only one!) At the ice party in the fridge is taken from that great Flemish film "De Witte (1934)" in which De Witte is putting too much salt on the potatoes. Some accidents happen in the film but there are no explanations later. Tom Barman offers us a film here that is more like an experiment to watch on television than a movie for theaters. Another missed opportunity for Flemish cinema.
