How did I ever like this episode of a sequel? All he does is throw the balls! Worse, it doesn't even compare to the first episode of the series! The play suffers from not being funny. Where did all the involuntary laughs go? Just a slapstick action on the field that lasts too long. Bob Uecker has literally saved this from a complete shutout of nine. What's next, GREATER LEAGUE 4: BACK TO LITTLE LEAGUE? Ehh, it could be! Leave this on the shelf and plan a trip to the All-Star game. This had three too many hits.
