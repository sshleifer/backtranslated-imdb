Some may fool you, but in reality there is a real art with particularly bad films. Missing on all fronts. <br /> <br /> A group of young people - women with heavy breasts and constantly wet t-shirts, of course - go to film "blood surfing" and end up running in a 31 foot crocodile. <br /> <br /> Not only was the crocodile obviously fake, but some of the props [note that the boat hit the reef in particular] seem to have come out of the thunder! <br /> <br /> Not good from start to finish. Don't see it!
