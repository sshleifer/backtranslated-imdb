Weak storyline, improbable machine malfunction and characters unable to tinker. At first I thought this film had been made in the seventies, since the quality of the images, as well as the plot and drama seemed taken from an old episode of Kojac. When I checked and found out that it was actually done until -97, I was amazed. This is by far one of the worst movies (thrillers) I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If you read this, keep in mind that if you see it you waste time when you might have done something more exciting, like looking at dry paint.
