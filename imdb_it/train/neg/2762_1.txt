... there is no one else to watch the movie. My husband and I went to see him last night. It's just a small theater, but there is usually a fair amount of people. Not this time! My husband and I were the only people watching Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why. <br /> <br /> The film was by far the worst I've ever seen. Yes, the CG was good, but it wasn't. Acting, screenplay and dialogue, directing, editing, etc. They were terrible! Since we were alone in the room, we felt free to talk during the film. I mean, we talked about how bad it was that reminded us of The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Godzilla, Mortal Combat and The Lord of the Rings. It was as if we expected to see Rita and Lord Zed playing the commanders of Sauron's army. <br /> <br /> The creatures were ridiculous. You can't just introduce legions of things Dino / Dragon / Lizard loaded with cannons without explanation. The Lord of the Rings has a wide spectrum of characters, but introduces them and develops them into 3 films, not in an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Scene transitions are horrible. I didn't fall asleep during the film, but even though it was too simple, I found myself getting lost in the holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> The characters were Caucasian Americans, but they spoke almost with broken English due to the poorly written dialog box script. <br /> <br /> The final scene that could have redeemed a certain value of the film ... failed. Ethan didn't cry when Sarah died ... though he had never known her for a long time during this life. He didn't seem too upset to be left in "Mordor", not knowing where he was or how to get back. We could not for the love of God figure out where he was or how he got there, but if he wasn't angry we shouldn't be either. <br /> <br /> Oh, and why was the dress that Sarah's spirit seemed to have borrowed from Queen Elizabeth? Another thing ... all 3 main hero characters were reincarnations reported to complete the work. Sarah completes her task and moves on to the afterlife. Jack does it too. So why does Ethan get screwed? He is left alone, without the girl, without a map / compass / helicopter to help him return. What should he do? Send smoke signals? And if he comes home, does he just go back to his job? He should have had the same mercy of being killed by the movie that the other heroes had. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money on this movie. We stayed until the end because we had paid, but as soon as the credits hit, we were out of the door.
