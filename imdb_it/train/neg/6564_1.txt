This is one of the worst films I've ever seen so far, the best part was Christian J. Meoli "Leonard" who tried to behave by jumping up and down outside the bar, like, like I wanted to do on the DVD, to save the rest of the humanity the agony of watching this shitty movie. He has a fantastic cast so keep looking at him and wait for him to become good, I mean with Sean Astin "Andrew" (he played perfectly, he did a great job, too bad it was in this film), Kyra Sedgwick "Bevan", Ron Livingston "Chad ", Ren√©e Zellweger" Poet "(they put her name on the cover has a total of 1 line and less than 4 seconds in the entire film ... <br /> <br /> If the cast had any dignity, they would go to buy all copies of this film and burn them with writer / director George Hickenlooper and writer John Enbom
