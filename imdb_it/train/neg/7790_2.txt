Like some of the other people who reviewed this film, I was also becoming nostalgic about this ... before having the misfortune to watch it again. Alas, my childhood memories of this film were completely unreliable, and The Perils of Pauline now turns out to be an embarrassing exercise in trivial, racist and banal films. Even the presence of old professionals Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas cannot overcome a rancid script, a horrible musical theme and some miserable "special effects". Furthermore, the stereotyped depictions of African and Arab figures make the vision painful, especially considering that this was produced in the immediate wake of the civil rights movement. Michael Weldon's original Psychotronic Encyclopedia reports that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television, but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical publication. Judging by the results, this is a completely credible (and disconcerting) scenario.
