"The seventh sign" borrows a lot from "Rosemary's baby" and "the omen" (actually it combines the two stories). The title also reminds Bergman of "the seventh seal". <br /> <br /> However, it starts quite well, with all the omens scattered all over the earth and, in parallel, a seemingly distinct storyline with Moore's husband trying to save a poor boy (who killed his parents who were brother and sister) by the death penalty. time, both Christian and Jewish religions are called to the rescue (even the wandering Jew is involved), which makes the jokes sometimes unintentionally funny (have you ever been to Sunday school? But they taught me that God was love!). IMHO scene, it is the brief dialogue between the priest John Heard - who does not seem to take things seriously, too bad that he was not given a more important part because his relaxed acting is priceless - and the young Jew. <br /> <br /> Demi Moore probably recorded the same desire as her ex-husband Bruce Willis: to save the world. It doesn't save the film for all this.
