The acting wasn't great, the plot was full of simplistic twists and transparent characters. It concerns the repercussions of the struggle between the right-wing voters of the Flemish bloc on the one hand and the Moroccan people living in the Belgian city of Antwerp on the other side. Is it a political analysis? Is it a kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet? The film is not strong enough to answer both questions (assuming they were also the director's questions). However, some scenes may function as a sort of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp. After all, this city was the starting point of the extreme right wing Flemish party and is struggling with many problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It is very difficult to make a film about this situation and unfortunately this is not successful. Yet he is telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present-day Belgium. The few foreign viewers who watch should try to have fun and realize that it is not the film that is important but the lines of social division behind it that haunt Belgium, a country of 10 million people, in the 2000s <br /> <br /> Dries Van Dongen
