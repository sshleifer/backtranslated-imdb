I absolutely love the "Toxic Avenger" series, but this weak offer of the people of Troma made no sense, and made me yawn all the time. <br /> <br /> A nuclear power plant that loses weed next to it) drives the young of Tromaville High crazy, which causes them to join a gang, have sex, explode and whatever. There's also a kind of monster breeding in high school ... my God, this movie is a mess. <br /> <br /> Actors have virtually stopped their efforts after this and should do so. The (intentional) overacting started getting on my nerves in about 5 minutes ... <br /> <br /> Disappointing. 2/10.
