This was recently on the vibrant classics of AMC films and I had to laugh. I had high hopes for this adventure that follows the trend of "Voyage to the Earth's Core" and "Mysterious Island". I was deeply disappointed not only by the recitative credentials, but also by the stupid plot that reads from the comic strip of a five-year-old child. Make sure you see the wires that hold on to the wings of the Pterdactyl when they grab "Ogar" a half-pre-modern idiot man who makes friends with lost adventurers. The finale left open the possibility of a further redesign of the same effects in "People that Time Forgot". Do not waste time.
