There is absolutely nothing in this film that shows even the smallest talent gap. No one in it has ever tried to act before, even the extras of the bar seem to have been glued on the spot. Nothing seems proven. The quality of the film is terrible. Most of the "action" takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman crammed like an afterthought, swinging a cheapo camera back and forth between "actors" as they deliver their lines. No tripod and no suitable microphone, the sound quality is terrible. Even the 'Manos' rates are better than this, at least they had adequate equipment. What plot is simply lost in the chaos of production. <br /> <br /> Attached to home videos, preferably made by a 5-year-old who tries the video function on Dad's new camera phone. You will find yourself for a long search to find a more inept film than this.
