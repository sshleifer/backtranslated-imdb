My score for this shit: 1/10 1 only for the technician. Everything else is bad. <br /> <br /> Another film that makes no sense. Clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost an impossible mission. <br /> <br /> While it's easy to see why politicians never tell the truth, they are among the greatest liars on the planet, it's hard to understand how to make films so pathetic. <br /> <br /> We have to believe that taking people for morons. Maybe it was a reason to believe, since 99% of films suck. Because they are stupid, ridiculous and terrible scenarios. <br /> <br /> When you look at the price we offer at the Oscars, we understand better why we continue to make films more ridiculous than others. <br /> <br /> And strangely it was always money for such nonsense. But it was not for education and health. <br /> <br /> If you still want to hear this s ** t, press the super fast forward button (at least 20X).
