I took this movie in the $ 5 basket at walmart. I would not recommend looking at this move. I could give it to one of my friends if I'm angry with them and I want them to suffer for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I looked at the cover and flipped through the summary and thought it was a war movie. I would like to know how boring this movie would have been before turning it on. It was my mistake to think that something would happen in this film. It is a group of people who go from one training camp to another. Drilling enforcers treat soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of the fighting in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Ok, here's my outburst on this movie: for me, this movie is slow and hard to watch. It was just one of those movies that you put in and you're stuck watching because you want to turn it off, but you're holding on to a series of hopes that could come back towards the end. It is not so. After the movie ended, I passed my T.V. because I was angry because I lost almost 2 hours of my life watching it, and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people.
