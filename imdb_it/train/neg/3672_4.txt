I saw the whole film recognize the participation of William Hurt, Natascha McElhone and Desiree Nosbusch. I'm glad you had no idea of ​​Peter Weller's presence. At the end of the film I said "THAT was Peter Weller?" Congratulations to Mr. Weller for an exceptional performance. Weller played an important character, and his performance was such that I didn't even recognize him. <br /> <br /> Overall the plot was bad, the screenplay was bad and the performances, apart from those of Nosbusch and Weller, were poor. The scenery and the setting were interesting, and Weller was incredible. <br /> <br /> 4 stars, of a possible 10.
