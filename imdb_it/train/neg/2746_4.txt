I was afraid of bringing my grandchildren to this film, because I didn't think it would be well done. The children, aged 6 to 10, were ready to see it, so I gave up. I have to admit that it wasn't as bad as I thought, but it was still a long way from the book. The film seemed right with the understanding and sense of humor of 10 years. I discovered that the six-year-old child understood what was happening and was presenting solutions to the problems that were happening. In the end I had to explain that sometimes movies don't show the best solutions to problems because it's more fun to watch what happens if they make "stupid" or "stupid" choices.
