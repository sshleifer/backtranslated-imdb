Actually I had hopes for this movie since I saw Kari in some other things and I think she has some talent. Alas, this disaster is a case study of what not to do in a script. Completely undefined characters without a hint of sympathy and no plot. Is it a street / friend / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? Filmmakers have no idea, nor do we.
