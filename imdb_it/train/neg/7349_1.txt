Polyester was the first John Water film I saw, and I must say that it was also the "worst" film I had seen so far. <br /> <br /> The "talents" group of Water included several people I'm sure it worked for food, and I was willing to say the lines written by Waters. Everything about the film is terrible, acting, camera, editing and the story of a woman played by a transvestite of 300 pounds Divine was purely absurd. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I have to recommend this film because it's so much fun, and you won't believe the crap that happens to poor Francine. His son annoys solvents and treads unsuspecting women's feet at the grocery store. His daughter is the most slutty bitch in town. Her husband is a crap from a pornographer who does everything in his power to embarrass and humiliate poor Francine. <br /> <br /> Francine's only friend is played by Edith Massey, perhaps the worst actress ever. Edith seems to be reading the lines of a cue and never saw the script before filming. <br /> <br /> Despite all the Francine joists, Waters prepares a fabulous Hollywood finale and everyone (who survives) lives happily ever after.
