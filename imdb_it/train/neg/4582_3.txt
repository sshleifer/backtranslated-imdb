If you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend your $ 9 on a used textbook, not on this movie. I'm a little worried that the money I've spent is used to buy Kool-Aid for shipping in Guyana. <br /> <br /> I don't think filmmakers really made sense, but they seem to be trying to do different things: 1) science can explain everything we do, which means our lives are deterministic; 2) Science cannot be used to explain everything we do, in the sense that we have free will; 3) Science is, like, really cool, brother; 4) We are God; 5) The world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is a difficult role to follow and 7) here, put this little square of paper in your mouth and you'll see some really fancy stuff.
