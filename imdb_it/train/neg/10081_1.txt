I have read some of the comments on this film and can only assume that some people are easily entertained. This film is nothing. It is so badly written, direct and recited that it almost makes no impression. The characters speak in a dialogue made of clich√©s and the situations are completely unlikely. While this could make this campy and fun, not because everything is so lifeless the film gets boring. It's as if Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality, but then he wasn't allowed by the studio directors to give the story a taste for life or not to have cojones. This film could go into the encyclopedia as a standard TV series poor movie.
