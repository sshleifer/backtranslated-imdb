Although Jerry Jameson's production and direction are definitive improvements, "Airport '77" is not much better than "Airport 1975": commercial garbage, commercial garbage (this time literally) a decent cast. Jack Lemmon is the pilot of a crowded airliner that is hijacked by art thieves and crashes into the sea (all the advertising claimed that it was near the Bermuda Triangle, but in the film itself there is no hint) . When rescue ships arrive to lift the plane out of the water, we see all their cranes falling (rather blindly) into the ocean and it's hard not to laugh (imagining the cranes connecting the plane, the passengers and the impregnated script) of water). NBC used to broadcast what appeared to be the "director's cut", with at least an hour of extra footage - mostly flashbacks - injected into the proceedings with all the subtlety of an "Gilligan's Island" episode . The most exciting moment is the plane crash, and some of the players are having a little fun: Lee Grant is a hideous drunk, Brenda Vaccaro, an unscrupulous hostess assistant, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland are flirting the old ones. However, personality conflicts and atrocious military detail end up snatching patience. ** from ****
