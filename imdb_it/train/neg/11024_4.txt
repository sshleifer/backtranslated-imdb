I saw this film first in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were simply modified by the censorship committee. But then, in Poland in 2000, I saw it in full form. And thereby? The plot is incredibly unwise: 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of strong, direct and fundamentally strict feminist women. Men are now trying to fight it and then follow all the extremely stupid clich√©s: sexual desire, constant male desire for sex, feminists shown as complete idiots (you may or may not agree with them, but idiots certainly aren't), and etc. The performance of even the stellar Jerzy Stuhr is here in wood and strangely bad - he only pulls non-trivial faces and repeats saying phrases like "I'm in the elevator with a naked girl and I didn't do anything to her!" This was meant to be a comedy, however, turned out to be a despicable farce, full of predictable jokes and allusions under the waist. Don't waste your time on it - this is just bad.
