Twins separated at birth (due to the death of their parents) gather twenty-five years later to avenge their parents and take back their million-dollar tunnel. Double Impact runs for two hours and basically does not add a real approach to the course of the Corsican Brothers and Jean-Claude Van Damme, while the evil twin brother is simply as embarrassing as the twin brother. Also the action sequences are not so exciting this time and Jean-Claude relies more on firearms and his martial arts. Even the supporting cast is wasted and in two hours the film is simply boring. <br /> <br /> * out of 4 (Bad)
