Ordered introduction. Very unrealistic. What I learned from this movie is that driving madly out of control to go to the weekend cabin might not be the best idea after all. I loved the way Bill comes out of the car and down the hill without injury! Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for his girlfriend. Oh, and the police never seemed to find the car or track the wreck owner. <br /> <br /> Many scenes dragged, including a simple stripper (they still have nightmares from that scene). Poor assistant and his useless hand. I admit I was intrigued to see what a mysterious "thing" was behind the door, but when it appeared, I simply laughed. HAHAHA !! The girl seemed really sadistically angry to be revived. Personally, I would really like a new body after such an atrocious experience!
