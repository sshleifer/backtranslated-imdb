This is a horrible little film - and unfortunately, the company that made this short film has made many others. The short is essentially an idea of ​​a joke that wasn't fun at first and could even offend you. It certainly made me uncomfortable watching very young children (most of whom appeared about 2 years old) who complained and pretended to be adults - in this case, a ballroom girl and bar-hall patrons. It's the kind of humor that you might be forced to laugh by your kids if they pretend to be adults, but I can't see anyone WANT to see it - especially when a very young Shirley Temple is dressed rather slinky dressed and behaves like a vampire! ! And then, other children behave like adults in some rather adult situations. At that time, I'm sure they weren't trying to attract pedophiles, but looking at them today, that's what immediately comes to mind! For this reason, this boring movie also scared me and I hope I don't see it anymore !! Rather strange and rather horrible.
