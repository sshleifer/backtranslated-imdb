SAKURA KILLERS (1+ outta 5 stars) Maybe in 1987 this movie could have looked cool ... if I had never seen a * good * ninja movie. 80s cheesy music ... cheesy dialogues ... cheesy acting ... and martial arts sequences far beyond cheese. The best scene is at the beginning ... with an old Chuck Connors playing golf on a beach ... several ninjas dressed in black try to sneak up on him and he seems to be too determined to hit the ball ... suddenly he reaches his golf bag and ... no, I don't want to ruin everything for you ... if you have the misfortune to see this movie, you'll thank me. The story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen video tapes or something. A group of Caucasian heroes with the bullet is trained in ways that the ninja because "only a ninja can fight a ninja" or something like that. Strange, these guys don't seem to be fighting any better after their workout than before ... oh, well, the movie moves pretty fast. The fighting scenes might not be great ... but they are plentiful ... and the exaggerated sound effects are good for some laughter.
