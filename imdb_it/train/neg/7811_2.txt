Here's how you do it: believe in God and repent for your sins. So things should change by the next day. <br /> <br /> Until the last fifteen minutes, this film is just a bad summary of the drunken life of a drunk. His mother dies. His stepmother is a b_tch. His father dies. He drinks. Marries. He has children. He drinks a little more. His wife gets angry. He disappoints his children. The wife threatens to leave. Call a reverend late at night b / c who wants to kill himself. Then, after the recap has occurred, it is then that we receive the subtle "Left Behind" message. <br /> <br /> "He needed a salary". This is the phrase that I had to repeat several times once the credits started running, so I wouldn't lose my respect for Madsen. <br /> <br /> Madsen kneels and begs for Christ's forgiveness. Once he does, he walks outside and actually says he sees the world in a different way. He tells his wife that he has found God and this is good enough for her. Flip scene four months and his wife is tired of going to church. He finishes the film while Madsen walks near the bar and makes a soliloquy on how happy he is with Christ and without alcohol. Final moment? He gives a little greeting to the bar (eg. The house of sin) and sends a gay man, Miami-Vice, a special congratulatory leap after school in the air, like the still image of the camera. See why I had to repeat the sentence? "He needed a salary." <br /> <br /> Man this movie is bad. The production values ​​of B-Grade 80 do not help much. The script could easily have been an "Touched by an Angel" episode. More advertising could have been eliminated in 30 minutes. The acting is wooden and never credible. Even Madsen, of which I'm a big fan and that's the only reason I sat down for it, makes me realize that this is his first acting job and he doesn't know his $$ from the elbow, but from the camera. After 45 minutes I started to get discouraged. This was like doing homework. I just wanted to put it away and say it's okay, I saw half of it. It's good enough But no. If I sat down through Cheerleader Ninjas, I could sit for all this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm not giving this to 1 is for two points: 1) I love Madsen. I know it's not right. But it's nice to see the opening title "Introducing Michael Madsen". Let me sue. 2) Some of the Dialogues are so negative that it is classic. In the end I will remain a few quotes to be able to appreciate them. <br /> <br /> That's it. To conclude, this thing is a piece of shit that should get red with the rest of the assholes. But hey! Look! Michael Madsen! (See also TILT, EXECUTIVE GOAL, DAUGHTER OF MY BOSS, etc.). Now I have to review Reservoir Dogs and watch Madsen torture a cop to get my respect for him. See you guys. <br /> <br /> "These things will make me blind, but I'll drink it anyway" - Madsen's first taste of cheap alcohol <br /> <br /> "I don" t understand! Everything looks so beautiful! "- Madsen walking out after confessing to God <br /> <br />" I go downtown later and pick up a bible and I'll even have a haircut "- Madsen after converting to table, because Satan lives in your hair
