Welcome to a bad ghost story and someone's nightmare. This horror story finds a newly married husband (John Hudson) and a wife (Peggy Weber) obsessed with the memory of his previous wife and the screaming skulls found throughout their empty building and the lily pond. Is the husband really trying to drive his already anxious bride crazy? Or is the challenged gardener apprentice Mickey (Alex Nicol) who took care of the grounds of the villa since the death of the original landlady? This low-budget horror movie has a plot that involves you throughout the finale. The special effects are quite negative even at the standards of 1958. I swear that sometimes the screaming skull sounds a lot like it should be in a Godzilla film. Also in the cast as Reverend Snow is the character actor Russ Conway. By the way ... the lurking gardener (Nicol) is the director of the film. You can take this as part of AMC's Monsterfest.
