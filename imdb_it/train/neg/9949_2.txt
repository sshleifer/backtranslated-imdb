This film could have been much better with a script rewrite. Not that I expect great plausibility in the movies, but you'd think even the homeless and city-dweller Jack Mason wondered why a group of experienced hunters would like to hire him as a hunting guide. And after reaching the hunting grounds, poor Ice-T plays his part as if he were going to lead these men through woods he had never seen before. And how does Jack Mason find Thomas Burns in Seattle? <br /> <br /> I suppose this film was based on Richard Connell's short story "The Most Dangerous Game". A few years ago I showed this film to a class of students of the ninth class after reading the story. I re-edited the film, cutting out all the useless scenes and all the bad words. It ended up being 43 minutes long.
