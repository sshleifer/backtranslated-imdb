I was looking through the list of Richard Burton films when I came to this title that I remember vividly since I first saw it on TV in 1982. I remember the talks of Tatum O'Neal that were incredibly bad. I remember that the character of Richard Burton seemed to have lost so desperately, and then he remembered how his motives did not translate into me. In short, I remember "Circle of Two" because it was so extraordinarily terrible. <br /> <br /> This film came out at a time when America was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or distorted angles on teenage sexuality. We remember "The Blue Lagoon" (and other annoyances of Brooke Shields), "Lipstick", "Little Darlings", "Beau Pere" and other films that seemed to simply dwell on teenagers having sex, particularly with adults. As a teenager, during this time, I found the obsession, combined with the sexual excesses of the 70s and 80s, created for an unconsciously disturbing environment in which to understand everything, so to speak. <br /> <br /> "Circle of Two" is not recitable or unnecessarily itchy, like "Blue Lagoon". In fact, he addresses the issue of love among the young and the elderly in a courageous way, if completely failed. But honestly, it's one of those movies that you * won't * ever see if you didn't see it on the first try because it was really terrible. No one would like to have this junk ever on the surface to be re-distributed publicly.
