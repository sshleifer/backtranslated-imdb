When we were in middle school, some of us kids occasionally started with a bomb. It was considered fun then. But the producers, the directors and the cast of "Semana Santa" ("The angel of death" in the DVD section of your local video rental) are adults and I'm STILL shooting them. <br /> <br /> As the previous reviewer Who wondered if the cast was anxious to get off the set and go home, I doubt that more than one scene was taken for all the scenes. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino, warm in "Mighty Aphrodite" and other top-rated movies, seems to have underestimated herself for this project. His acting is non-existent, confined mostly to melancholy glances that should indicate how "sensitive" he is to the sad condition of the various victims of the film. <br /> <br /> But let me warn you - don't be the next victim! Move away from the DVD if you find it on the shelf. There are not many good shots of Mira (the only high points I found in the film) and the supporting cast is of lower quality, offering a mixture of battered dialogues with embarrassing "Spanish" accents worthy of the best high school theatrical production.
