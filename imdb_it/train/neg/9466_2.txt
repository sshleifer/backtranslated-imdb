This film was physically painful to sit on, perhaps because (like many people my age and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books - funny, intelligent, capricious and subversive at the same time. "The Cat in the Hat" awakens all the interest and spark of the story, and Mike Myer's performance as a Cat is mostly disconcerting. Why the accent of the Borscht Belt, the unbridled mess, the inappropriate jokes, the costume without charm? I had to go back and reread the books to see the real problem: the books are SIMPLE. This film is OVERBLOWN and much, too long. <br /> <br /> You don't expect each child's movies to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but this gave a new low. How could Mike Myers need the money?
