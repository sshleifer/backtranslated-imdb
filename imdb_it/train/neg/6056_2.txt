To be honest, this film is another in a series of huge disappointments ... most of these so-called "masters of horror" films are just terrifying in terms of secondary effects and laughable narrative lines ... apart from Ron Perlman, everyone else in this film can't act to save their lives ... the shots sounded like someone was playing Bop-it under the boom microphone or something, and it seemed completely unrealistic ... overall, this movie It's just as scary as Home Solo ... the only good masters are Cigarette Burns, Jennifer, and maybe Pelts ... I don't know how these directors can sleep at night knowing they've ruined the genre that some of them used to understand. .
