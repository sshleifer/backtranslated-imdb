May the saints preserve us, because this film will not help. <br /> <br /> Someone with access needs to send an email to Mel Gibson and tell him that we need a faithful production of Beowulf. Something that actually has something in common with the epic poem that is the foundation of all modern Western literature. <br /> <br /> The recent (since 2000) versions of Beowulf make us think about two things. First of all, because there is so much interest in history. Secondly, because all these filmmakers are squandering mountains of money with this shit. <br /> <br /> The only reason why one came out is that the version with Lambert (Beowulf 2000) was worse and needed 1. What is even worse , some people will look at this and have the wrong idea about the poem. How can a sector in which Peter Jackson gets a literary conversion into a film so right can be wrong. I mean, the Roman Forum as a model for Heorot is too much. <br /> <br /> AND PLEASE, the horns on the helmets? Spare me. This is offensive. <br /> <br /> / hjm
