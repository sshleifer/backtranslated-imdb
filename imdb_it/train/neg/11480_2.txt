I watched this with my girlfriend after tripping over it while zapping channels. <br /> <br /> I think we both hoped for some kind of happy cute family Christmas movies, but we were extremely disappointed. <br /> <br /> actor who plays the soldier, seems to have at least 0 emotions, his face looks the same, if he is cutting down the Christmas tree, seeing the girl he loves being kissed by his boyfriend, or when he is happily surprised by the girl he loves, he is a terrible actor, and in no way did any of us do anything but laugh at him. <br /> <br /> Then there is the pretty blonde girl, blessed with the ability to count points and cheat her boyfriend, what a trap! and his ambition in life is to live with his parents and count more points. <br /> <br /> So it's basically a story of a boy with no emotions or feelings who falls in love with a boy who counts dots and tricks on his boyfriend, it's as predictable as it gets, and really a waste of time, you don't earn nothing looking at this, except for some strange laughter, because it's all so trivial. <br /> <br /> I like it when your father says he only eats french fries and not French wine, and everyone laughs, this is the hilly attitude that this film talks about, moreover, if my girlfriend daddy was commanding me around, I'd tell him one thing or, but not our veteran army, no sir, let everyone be the master. <br /> <br /> The film is what First Blood would have been, if John Rambo were burned as the greatest in the world.
