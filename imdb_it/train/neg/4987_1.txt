This film is so bad and gets worse in every way imaginable. It's not just the poor acting and the script, nor the lame and perverse time that is wasted looking at it. What really puts this film in my room of shame is the apparent struggle that writers and producers make with the film to try to make it fun. The actress who replaces the descendant of Jean Reno is old and has learned her lesson in the first film in order to add a new girl who must marry. Almost all the original extras and gags come back but this time it makes me want to take my eyes off my grips because it's a perfectly good film waste. The torture of the camera's constant cuts and shots in any scene of this film can lead the viewer into violent beliefs. This second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and shows off the corpse in the public square and degrades in a perverse way not only the original idea and its legacy, but also our intelligence. This film, unlike the spruce goose, could not fly because it did not have a plot in the main that returned for a "necklace". No script since it was apparently written and added daily. No attention to the camera or to shots in mind. Poor lights and special effects made for the sake of it. This film would not even have passed for a student film in the film 101 base. As this whole pile failed to understand. It was a huge investment and it seems that no one has had the strength to put this cruel and unnatural error out of our miseries. This film has a good part ... its END! This film is my worst film number 1 of all time, finally "Howard The Duck" is no longer the goose.
