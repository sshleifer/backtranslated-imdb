For me, this silent version of The Merry Widow is the worst version ever made. There is no tenderness, love or spirituality in this version, it is all macabre, Germanic, sinister nonsense. It reminded me that the Nazis fall in love; who cares? <br /> <br /> This silent version of von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story. In this we have licked John Gilbert and his coarse relative that the Prince craves this stupid American actress, played by Mae Murray, with a modern permed hairstyle and an implausible feminist way that threw me away again and again. I like my light and beautiful novels, with slow accumulations; not harsh and sadistic like this. Come on, those bees point their lips, get rid of them, girl! <br /> <br /> Go see a live performance of the show if you want to have a real idea of ​​the sweetness of Franz Lehar's original operetta. Otherwise, wait for TCM to show the audio version of Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier. It is much better.
