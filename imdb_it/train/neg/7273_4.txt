This first role for Barbara Shelley (in fact, her first in Britain after working in Italy), was realized when she was 24, and it is certainly safe to say that she made an extraordinary debut in 1957 "Cat Girl". While blondes and brunettes attract the most attention (I will always be dear to Yutte Stensgaard), the adorable actress with auburn hair with a deep voice always emanated intelligence and vulnerability (an example like "Village of the Damned" of the years '60 in which his screen time was much less than his character's husband, George Sanders). It is the only reason to see this meager update of "Cat People", and it is seen in great advantage throughout (it's hard to tell if her beauty has found her character apparently sleeping in the nude, and we are exposed to her gorgeous back naked when awakened ("Rasputin-The Mad Monk" also displayed 8 years later, in 1965). The charming dress she wears during most of the film is a wonderful strapless wonder (I don't see what kept him dressed, but I'd love to do it.) All in all, the proof is that Barbara Shelley, in a badly written role that would have defeated most actresses, rises above her material and makes the film constantly watchable, a true test of stellar power, which he would soon find in Hammer's studios in Bray, for the duration of the 1960s.
