I had the feeling that after "Submerged", this wouldn't have been better ... I was right. He has to look for money for champagne, and he doesn't care about the final product ... his voice is repeatedly dubbed by a stranger who doesn't sound like him; the editing is - well - only a degree above amateur. It is nothing more than a quality B or C movie with only a little money to hire a couple of talented operators and an "OK" sound designer. <br /> <br /> As the previous poster said, the problems seem to appear in post-production (... voice dubbing, etc.) Too bad, because the plot is actually OK for an SG movie. <br /> <br /> I will never rent another SG movie unless I ask for an email asking for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Too bad - I miss Kelly LeBrock ... <br /> <br /> --jimbo
