Being the only film I could see at this year's "Nordische Filmtage" in LÃ¼beck, this year's festival will be remembered as the historic minimum for me. <br /> <br /> This film, which was announced as an erotic thriller, is nothing but a sick piece of shit! Excuse the language, but there are no decent words to describe it. <br /> <br /> First of all, the actors are not the best. But even the best actors would not have saved the film. For example. the plot: after the first 15 minutes it was pretty clear that John was sick, the girls nearby were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend. The so-called "sex scene" was nothing but disgusting (hitting the other until the blood flows to me has nothing to do with sexuality), but unfortunately they weren't the only disgusting images to be shown. Everything else has been copied by other directors such as Lynch, but obviously without their genius. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize the whole film and save other spectators, time and money: the boy loses his girlfriend, the girl returns home, the boy kills his girlfriend and becomes mad afterwards, boy imagines hot, but crazy neighbor girls, guy has a very disgusting sex with one of them (or so he thinks), eventually he realizes, he's crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover lie in his apartment all the time .. bad story, bad actors, images, that make you want to vomit ... <br /> <br /> 1 in 10 (1 point for the fact, that you realize how good you are at understanding Norwegian if you learned Swedish - at least one benefit of the evening - and you can't choose 0 points here).
