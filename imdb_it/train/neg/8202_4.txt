It's a remake og the Thing (1982/1951), I think it is, there are so many factors from the det the previous films deny it. <br /> <br /> So the acting is bad, James Spader makes a superlow stargate the re-enactment of himself, with his coffee pot and his strange ideas / movements, but that's all, the other actors who don't I didn't even notice. You don't feel like you know any of the main characters. And the evolution of the plot is slow, boring and, I know what's going to happen in 30 minutes. The score / the music is exaggerated, I believe there are many successful people who would score for a coke and a credit, but this is crap. Some of the special effects are beautiful, if it was made in the early 90s. If you like thin aliens, chills and thrills, don't worry about this movie. it's a boring combination of Thing, Alien 3, Outbreak and Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay's production gone really bad. Now this combination would be nice if someone knew what they were doing, and the only ones on this production that knew it, none. <br /> <br /> Even though I've seen a lot worse, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, but if you're on a cold night, and you just want to throw something, time will pass slowly.
