What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking? Was Hollywood responsible for this disguise, or can I comfort myself in the idea that someone who does not speak English as a first language has simply lost the point of view of the Charlotte Bronte classic? I don't think I can improve on a comment I read below, so to paraphrase it: "Jane Eyre is a great book, the writer should read it sooner or later". It is true that the two contacts of this film have been sadly broken up. Too bad for the actors, because the writer left out all the best scenes. The dialogue that makes you understand that Jane and Rochester have a meeting of minds and a sense of shared fun ... deleted from the script. The marriage proposal, the fortune-teller ... gone. The allusions, half joking, half sincerely felt, for Jane as a fairy elf from old England, who came to save Rochester in her despair ... eliminated. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and Jane's interactions with the Rivers family. But it is unforgivable that he surgically removed love from one of the best love stories ever written. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and go find the 1983 mini series (?) with Timothy Dalton.
