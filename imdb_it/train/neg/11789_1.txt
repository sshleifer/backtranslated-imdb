In reality he had to stop it. Don't get me wrong, love bad monster movies. But this was too boring, regardless of the suspenseful music that never takes you anywhere. The actress had too many teeth and that moment when she came into contact with one of the beasts was an obvious clich√©. This film totally betrays the cover of the DVD which seems quite interesting. A giant monster is expected from the cover, but these cute ones are not obtained as gigantic electric eels as expected. He went on to watch another movie called The Killer Rats but this is another review. Deep Shock was really bad, a big shame considering the fact that it looks like a pretty high budget.
