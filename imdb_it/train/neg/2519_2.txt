Actually I paid to watch this movie at the theater. <br /> <br /> He would get a score of 1, but the fight scenes between the robots are ok, and there's a surprise. <br /> <br /> I realize that some movies have bigger budgets than others. I have no problems with this. Unfortunately, sci-fi movies probably suffer more on a small budget for obvious reasons. But one way this film fails is that almost every piece of each set seemed cheap and cheap. I mean, couldn't they even make it "nice"? <br /> <br /> The other main reason why this movie is horrible is acting If you watched the movie now and knew what to expect, I could just enjoy the cheese factor, but at the moment, I was expecting a good movie I had no idea how horrible it would be. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the experience was over in just 85 minutes.
