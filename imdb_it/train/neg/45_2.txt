Since the number of Video Nasties has not yet been seen, this small pile of garbage has appeared on my "to rent" list when I saw that it was available. <br /> <br /> The premise concerns a fashion model or something is kidnapped and taken to the jungle to be held hostage by a diverse group of idiots. Some other greed is hired to bring her back and he is given a lot of money to use as an exchange currency, even if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut. He brought with him a helicopter and a pilot and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors ever! Of course, they are all terrible and dubbing will make you cry blood. After making their way into the jungle, we learn that nearby there is a cannibal cult whose terrestrial god in flesh roams the woods like a human King Kong seeking tribes to devastate and devour. Now, this guy is just a naked guy with the worst make-up ever, ping-pong balls for the eyes and that's pretty much it. His growls and groans are a feature that is always present in the soundtrack, and I found myself silencing many of those scenes. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason why this film was banned, even if there is a specific scene, about a second long, in which the god attacks a girl and brings out courage, but it is not a saving factor for the fan of ordinary people. Furthermore, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows long close-ups of female genitals and, unfortunately, also male. So, if you want "fair" in terms of exploitation, you understand. <br /> <br /> I cannot recommend this basket to anyone. It's not even the bad movie. It's just an atrociously filled basket that only a fan of Video Nasty will probably see and even then, if you're making your way through the list, leave this last. If you look at it first, you may have the idea that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.
