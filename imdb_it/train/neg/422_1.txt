A lot of death happens in nature. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure it out! But should it be the focus of a nature documentary? What is this fascination with horrible death? Do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to shreds from a pack of hungry lions? Or a cheetah grabbing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion, no less! I thought it would be a natural family film! <br /> <br /> And why not have the courage to show the gruesome violence in the movie trailers? Were the directors afraid of losing money? <br /> <br /> So, in typical comic relief style, we can see the magnificent Birds of Paradise perform mating rituals with the most boring and stupid humanly possible narrative. It was surreal! It is as if the directors believed that they were only addressing a room full of first and second grade students during a school trip! Wow! From the medium to the most faithful in the blink of an eye! <br /> <br /> If there are future nature documentaries waiting behind the scenes reading this review, why not focus on: The animals actually copulate; giving birth; lay eggs; bathing; sleeping; clean each other; socialization; playing; emotional manifestations other than fear and anger; unusual behaviors, such as the hatching mouth; migration; Problem solving skills; culture (yes, many animal species have what humans call culture); communication skills; parenting, healing skills, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or amaze beauty, and why not be much more rounded - and focus instead on delight and inspiration?
