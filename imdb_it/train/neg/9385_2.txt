IMDb's "Trivia" page claims that the filmmakers protested because this film was cut from the studio to "simplify the plot". If so, this effort was a total failure, as this is one of the most inconsistent narratives I've ever seen in a movie - I hate having seen it before the plot was "simplified". <br /> <br /> It is sad to see Warren with so little character to continue that he too cannot do anything with the inept material. It is interesting to see Caron in the modality of the 70s instead of his role and glamor character of the Hollywood era, but it is sad to see her unfortunately wandering in this cretin who does the favor of her husband-producer. In reality he would later connect and marry the director, instead - who, you will notice, has never directed anything new, but has strictly done the 1st and 2nd A.D. on TV from here on. This should tell you enough there. <br /> <br /> I call it "interesting" because I have an automatic fondness for American films of this period, and this role adds perspective to Oates' otherwise fantastic 1971 production (Due - Lane Blacktop, The Hired Hand). But the detective of the 40s as a fish out of the water in the 70s L.A. the theme, which is the only thing the film really has to say, is sold too heavily. A similar theme would be handled much more effectively two years later in Altman's The Long Goodby. And as for Oates who played a tough and crazy man on a doomed mission, three years later, he would give his final performance in Alfred Garcia's Bring Me the Head. If you haven't seen them, don't waste your time with this!
