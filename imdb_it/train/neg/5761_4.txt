Hollywood still does it. Lots of money, no creativity. I'm sure the writers were on something other than oxygen when they wrote this. Based on the previews, I thought it would be a fun movie. But if you're not up to the latest stupid pop culture, you'll lose most of the silly humor in this movie. Why waste your time You can sit on a log without doing anything and have more fun than what this movie will provide. <br /> <br />
