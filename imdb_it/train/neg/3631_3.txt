Of course, Parsifal is not a work that can please everyone, even if it is my favorite, Knappertsbusch, in 1951, in particular. Syberberg's entire approach is so static. Every time the music suddenly starts to swell ... Syberberg keeps the cast in motion with the same rhythm. The shots of Amfortas and Klingsor are endless. Whatever happened to the editing of a film? The result is physically exhausting to watch. The viewer is never spiritually transported. Your impulse is to rush home and play a recording again to confirm that Wagner understood, Syberberg was wrong. And who decorate the decorations with those "intelligent" memories of Wagner's anti-Semitism - will there ever be a spectator of this film without a previous knowledge of Wagner?
