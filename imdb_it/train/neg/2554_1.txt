Honestly, I'm not even kidding when I say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! This film has not a single ounce of originality in its fragile diary or its blatantly plagiarized plot. I can't even count the number of things in this film that are obviously taken from "The Omen" and other movies like this. For example, the "Lucy" nanny in this film is actually one of the devil's servants sent to guide and protect Satan's spawn ... this sounds very similar to Mrs. Baylock for anyone else. Another thing is that the orphanage had first burned the child to the ground a few months after being adopted, just like in "The Omen". However fortunately a priest survived the flare and fled with serious burns all over his body .... yet another coincidence ?????? And to top it all, the burned priest is in a hospital room with pictures of Jesus on all the walls, just like the priest of "The Omen" with pages of the Bible plastered on the walls like wallpaper. Please don't even let me start drawing comparisons between the end of this film and "The Omen" for you because, as I stated above, there are too many things to say here.
