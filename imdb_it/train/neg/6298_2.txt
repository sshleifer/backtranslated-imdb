A terrible plot (Amis at its worst), useless and self-conscious "decadence", tactics of obvious shock and irregular acting make this film (a bit like "Rancid Aluminum") embody everything that went wrong with the much vaunted revival of British cinema. Humor is flabby at best, and the pretentiousness of the entire set-up (including a kind of "Internet terrorist group" - ooh, how contemporary) really starts to scratch. <br /> <br /> Final summary - a half-hearted attempt to be "edgy" that doesn't do anyone any favors. Still, it's always a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on the screen ... <br /> <br />
