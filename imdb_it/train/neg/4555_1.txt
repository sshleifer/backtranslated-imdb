This film fails to capture any of the mysteries and intrigues that the book offers. The main point of the book, the insights, are not even touched, leaving the viewer to wonder exactly why everyone is making a big deal with them and why they are willing to risk their lives. <br /> <br /> character development is not good at all. No background or personal development leaves the public by not caring at all about what happens to them, and so the action sequences fall flat. <br /> <br /> The search for the manuscripts ends abruptly, and without a real explanation, leaving no sense of satisfaction with what the whole research was for. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst adaptations of a book I've ever seen. It's horrible and a waste of time. If you haven't read the book, skip the movie and read it. If you've read the book, skip the movie and read it again. <br /> <br /> It is almost as if the point of making the film was to discredit the book, this is how badly and ridiculous this film is. It's also a shame, because it could have been good if they had exploited it at the peak of success and they would probably have been able to get a good screenwriter and some good actors. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste time, READ THE BOOK !!!
