Wow, I finally managed, after several attempts, to finish watching this terrible movie, only to know that Rick Sloane and his production team completed a straight sequel to the video this year. <br /> <br /> all the films reviewed by MST3K - and manage to dig from the bottom of the barrel, projecting the bad reputation of "Manos", "Werewolf", "The Incredibly Strange", and the lesser known disasters like "Laserblast "," Zombie Nightmare ", 'and' Time Chasers, '- this surely must be the biggest pile of garbage they have ever shown (which makes it perfect for riffing). Very simple, the film is about a group of gremlins similar to Munchies in freedom, which exploits people's desires for fame, fortune, ability and, of course, sex in ways that end up killing people. But this is the kind of film where the acting is so ridiculous (a test of machismo, for example, is illustrated by two guys who challenge each other in the yard with garden tools), the writing is so forced (like the often described scene of a womb hanging on the arm of a girl who would notice it, if only she had turned her head a quarter to the left ... and this is not the first time in the film this happens), and the story is so ... rarely attention is paid (hence the MST3K riff on a "law in the future in which films must be made by FILMmakers), which in reality the furry puppets are rooted to kill everyone on the screen. The worst movie ... ever.
