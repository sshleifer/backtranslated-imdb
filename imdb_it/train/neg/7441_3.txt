To quote the film, "It is better not to know, better to forget, especially to abandon". Oh, the irony. <br /> <br /> A ghost story with all the technical refinements of a Hollywood horror film, but horribly ugly dialogues after the first quarter of the film, and you feel like you're being preached from the beginning. <br /> <br /> It is as if the cumulative dialogue of the authors' characters could be summarized by the bad policewoman and a Jerry Springer show. Suitable, perhaps, for a film like The Hitcher, not a horror film set in Russia. The result is that a potentially exceptional setting and some potentially gore scenes go to waste and simply become silly, not scary or meaningful.
