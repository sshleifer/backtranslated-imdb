This film about the secret experiments of the secret government and the corrupt use of citizenship by obscure and secret figures had the potential to be a really interesting film. But for me, he failed. I won't dwell much on the rather confusing plot line, but if you're looking for a detailed explanation, the "reluctantpopstar" user comment provides a good description of it. <br /> <br /> But he didn't work for me. I found it slow, which would be fine, but because it didn't seem to go anywhere. The viewer is left unaware of too many things to really be able to handle this film - in some movies, it can be argued that the filmmakers intended to provoke thoughts and leave things ambiguous for this reason. I don't think this is the case here. <br /> <br /> As for the frequent long shots of two buildings that have often been cited by other users ... I see they have a point: they give the viewer time to drink another drink without losing any " action". And I suspect that many viewers will appreciate the opportunity to have several drinks on board to overcome this.
