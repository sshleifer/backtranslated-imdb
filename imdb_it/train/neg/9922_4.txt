Growing up, Joe Strummer was my hero, but I too was left cold by this movie. For better or for worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a "Behind the Music" style documentary. Rather it is a biographical art film, chock-full of interviews, performance films, films for the home, and above all useless animation sketches raised by "Animal Farm". The film is consistent but extended by about half an hour. <br /> <br /> The campfire format, while touching in its thoughts, is actually rather annoying in execution. First of all, without titles, it is difficult to know who half of these respondents are. Secondly, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp and John Cusack licking the hosannas about the man? They were not relevant to Strummer's life and their opinions add nothing to his story. <br /> <br /> This picture is best when Strummer, through recorded interviews and conversations, touches on aspects of his life that most people didn't know about: his elder brother's suicide, coming to terms with death of his parents, the joy of fatherhood. For me, these were very moving because it showed Joe Strummer not like the punk icon we all knew and loved, but like a regular human being who had to face the joys and pains of life that we all have to face. <br /> <br /> There have been better and more direct documentaries on Strummer and The Clash. (Westway, VH1 Legends and MTV Documentary by Kurt Loder from the early 90s come to mind). Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten is for diehards only.
