Having loved "Paris, Je T'aime", I was expecting this film a lot and I admit I had high expectations, but I was deeply disappointed for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> Although I did not expect a reconfiguration of "Paris" in New York I expected the same structure. What I liked about "Paris" was the breaking of neighborhoods. You understood the style of each director and the story they wanted to tell. In "NY", there is no clear separation of stories, at different points in the film, characters from different stories intertwine with each other and this has made me confused about who I was looking at and exactly what was happening. Moreover, the transition to directing was evident but confused because there was no flow. Another thing I liked about the movie "Paris" was the different interpretation of love. It wasn't all romantic. There was love between parents and their children, unrequited love, a lonely, middle-aged woman who craved love, etc., She explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans. "NY" seemed to go only for a sharp, exaggerated sexuality. There were some redeemable short films (the older couple had spent a lifetime together, the Julie Christie short), but overall the "NY" movie didn't excite any emotion for me. I didn't connect to any of the characters like I did with "Paris". I remember looking at "Paris" and feeling a profound sadness, loneliness, desire, hope, wonder ... he only had so much soul. For me, there was no soul in the film 'NY'. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if I had intervened without having "Paris" looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film could have elicited a more favorable response, but as a homonymous summary of "Paris, Je T'aime" , I was deeply disappointed.
