*** May contain spoilers. *** <br /> <br /> If LIVING ON TOKYO TIME were some daring experiments in which real-life actors wishing to be actors received parts of films on condition that they were required to take a combination of powerful anti - anxiety prescribed anti-depressant and anti-psychotic drugs (this is the classic combo of the psychiatric ward that makes patients drooling in zombies) during filming, so this movie would have a lot more interest. Or, if the production of the film was another type of experiment in which all the actors were deprived of sleep before and during filming, then TOKYO TIME could be explained more easily. <br /> <br /> As it is, this film is full of lifeless, low-energy actors. In the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking to his sister, he seemed to have trouble keeping his eyes open. In almost every scene he speaks his lines, sitting down with every part of his immobile body. From beginning to end, his facial expression is best described as "close to sleep". <br /> <br /> Don't worry about the actors talking on each other's lines because these actors can barely finish the lines of dialogue. Everyone speaks in a depressing and monotonous voice. Do not laugh. Not scream. No force No one has enough energy to smile. The result: complete and total boredom. <br /> <br /> And it doesn't help that the management is simple and amateur. <br /> <br /> Avoid this lifeless movie at all costs. Better to look at GREENCARD which has a similar texture and has charm and energy. Or, for an unconventional Japanese love story, take a look at THE LONG VACATION which has a great deal of everything that LIVING ON TOKYO TIME doesn't have.
