the only scenes that made me laugh where those with christopher went in (the crazy movie director) the rest of the film was simply boring. Nothing happens in the first hour. The jokes that should be fun are not and zeta jones douglas is really exaggerated. Julia roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck (yes, right!) In the girl next door (where did i see him before?) the boy.for short.I didn't care what would happen with the main characters. If the cousin really fell into the building in a suicide attempt, the film could have been more interesting to watch.
