This is a horrible movie disaster. From beginning to end, it is full of bad acting and even worse than direction and modification. The only saving parts of the film are some Streisand numbers, because Kristofferson's parts are impossible to watch or listen to. The main problem with this film is that we never see the character of Kristofferson at its peak or the character of Streisand struggling. The first should be seen in decline and the second on the rise. The final issue of Streisand may have been one of the biggest endings in the film, if it was directed and edited correctly. The only framed shot of his face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake. If the band, the audience and the stage shots had been shown, this number could have been dynamic and interesting. This film must have been directed and edited by a dropout from the New York University film school. The only thing worse could be the poor script. The final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film, and this too is completely thwarted by wrong technical decisions.
