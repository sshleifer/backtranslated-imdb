I absolutely hate it when a movie completely falls to pieces towards the end, after you've already invested for an hour. and that's what happened with this movie. I was fascinated by his actors and by the fact that Malamud wrote his original story. I didn't go to read that story, but I can't imagine it ending like this movie. Fortunately, I didn't pay money to see it or rent it because my library had it. ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting (the wife in particular was so perfect). but milo o'shea as a Jew? !!!! now it was fun. I didn't study his way of doing things but he played as if the director had lost his marbles or died 3/4 during the movie. Before that point, a story and characters were developing, there were a number of ordered plot points and there was not too much time lost. but ooh that last half hour - if that wasn't the most depressed and useless failure I've ever witnessed, I don't know what it is. I hate him only when his faith is so destroyed; seems an act of violence.
