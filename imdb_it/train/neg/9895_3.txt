If this book remains faithful to the book, we can only assume that the author was ignorant of history. Mark Anthony has never died of wounds reported in battle as depicted. He died the death of a coward by committing suicide and even then, he asked his slave to do it for him. The slave chose instead to kill himself. In the true story, Mark Anthony was ashamed of the great value of the slave and decided to copy it. But even in death Mark Anthony was a drunken failure and failed in his own suicide attempt. She shouted for Cleopatra and was brought to her, bleeding. He dragged his litter onto the ropes and Mark Anthony died a little later. If you want the story, don't watch this movie. If you want a romantic drivel then you'll probably like it!
