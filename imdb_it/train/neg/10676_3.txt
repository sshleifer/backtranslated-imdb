Photographic work - Why does the camera work in this film so nervous? This is annoying and distracting. Editing: still images flashes were too short. Many of the other scenes were too short too. Flashes. Sound - the background music was too loud and covered the voices. You should not have to rewind and repeat to take what was said. No one controls these things and makes them do it again. Reduce the volume of background music in the future. Is the adjustment of the relative sound level the work of the editor, Julia Wong? The plot has had too many problems. The basic plot had potential. I think the film needs more work. Was he hurried? Maybe they ran out of money. Like many movies, it started out great, but it ran out towards the end. I really don't understand it, you know you have the board before it goes into production, so why not all the things to do are taken into account in the storyboard. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to be so critical.
