* SOILER * It is false! The whole is a fake! There are no ghosts or zombies, Alan is a Lord and his cousin or brother or half-brother or something like that wants the castle and its title for itself. So he invests this SCOOBY-DOO, too complicated and useless, to push Alan to commit suicide. Most of the film is he who picks up the redheads and attacks them. He's not even killing them. She falls asleep and the girl disappears and thinks she has buried them somewhere. If he looked at the so-called Evelyn ghost, he could tell he was wearing gloves! My God, what a waste of time. Don't worry about watching it, renting it and if you bought it and haven't looked at it yet, sell it. Quickly! Do yourself a favor and stay away from NIGHT EVELYN HAS COME OUT OF THE SERIOUS. I give this smelly the CRAP-O-LANTERN.
