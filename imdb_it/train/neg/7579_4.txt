The name "cult movie" is often attributed to films that continue to be shown, or to sell in home movie format, more than a generation after their first publication. Superchick, which was first released in 1973, now enters this category. His cult status is largely due to the continued interest of those women who consider him an early and effective feminist film. <br /> <br /> Despite the connotation "Superwoman", "Superchick" is not a comic book character but a very competent young woman who works as a flight hostess - a career option that was commonly considered in the 70s one of the most fascinating open to any girl, and which also allowed her to emulate the traditional matelot who presumably has a wife in every port. Since she maintains the status of a black belt in karate, she is able to clarify that she is very happy with the existence of a bachelor, and is in no way entrusted to any of her numerous male admirers. This film is a comedy for situations that avoids the generally shorter fascination of farce. His fascination with feminists is also accentuated by the climax in which our heroine uses her karate abilities to avoid a hijacking and save all the other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate. To ensure that this film appeals to men and their partners, the director has wisely assured that it is abundantly sprinkled with eye candy. <br /> <br /> Superchick can be appreciated by those who are not too critical and want a very light and easy to watch comedy that they will forget immediately after watching. It is so forgettable that they will probably find it equally pleasant if looked at again in a year; despite his age he could therefore maintain his status as a cult film for some time to come. However, dialogue and acting would make it difficult to give this film a rating higher than 4/10.
