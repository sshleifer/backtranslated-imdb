I didn't know whether to laugh or cry in the face of this misrepresentation of Canadian history, especially the bad service to the history of the Police on horseback in the Yukon. I leave it to Pierre Berton, he observed historian, born and raised in Dawson City Yukon, and author of the definitive history of the Klondike gold rush, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899 to express my exasperation with this silly film : <br /> <br /> The American idea of ​​a wild frontier, subjugated by individual heroes armed with six cannons, continued in The Far Country, another story of a cowboy from the American west - Wyoming this time - who leads his herd of beef cattle in a land of gold. The image is a nightmare of geographical impossibility, but the real inconsistency is the main assumption on which the plot turns ?? that at the time of the gold rush there was only one policeman on horseback throughout the Canadian Yukon and he could not face lawlessness. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach the Yukon border with their cattle, the customs shed is empty. <br /> <br /> "Where is the policeman? Ask Brennan. <br /> <br />" On the River Pelly. Problems with the Chilkats ", someone replies, he has a really hard job, that policeman who patrols about ten or twenty thousand square miles, sometimes he doesn't come home for two or three months at a time." <br /> <br /> The historical truth is that the Yukon territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state that British North America has ever seen. The Northwest Mounted Police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the Klondike strike. They checked every route in the Yukon and admitted nothing. They collected customs duties, often over the complaints of the new arrivals, made arbitrary laws on the spot regarding river navigation and rejected men if they did not have enough supplies, or if they simply looked bad. In true Canadian fashion, they have established moral laws for the community. To Dawson the Lord's Day Act was strictly observed; it was a crime punishable by a fine for cutting wood on Sunday; and plump young women were arrested for what the stern-faced police called "giving a bold performance in the theater", generally nothing more than suggestively dancing on stage in over-revealing tights. <br /> <br /> In such a community a belt was unthinkable. A well-known bad man from Tombstone who tried to put a weapon on his side was personally disarmed by a young policeman who had just expelled him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loud. The bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman, discovering that he was carrying a gun, told him to deliver it. "No man has taken a gun from me yet," the American said. "Well, I'm taking it," the policeman said kindly and did so, without further resistance. Many revolvers were confiscated from Dawson who were auctioned by the police for a minimum of one dollar and purchased as a souvenir to keep the fireplace. <br /> <br /> In 1898, the great year of the stampede, wasn't it a serious crime there? let alone a murder ?? to Dawson. The contrast with Skagway on the American side, which was a lawless city run by Soapy Smith, Denver's trusted man, was remarkable. But in The Far Country is Dawson seen as a lawless community, as a Skagway character in Soapy Smith? it's called Gannon in the picture ?? can easily check. (In real life, one of Smith's men who attempted to cross the border confiscated all his equipment and was kidnapped again by a mounted police sergeant). <br /> <br /> {in the film the lonely Mountie says} "Yes, I am the law, I represent the law in the territory of the Yukon, about fifty thousand square miles of it." <br /> <br /> "Then why aren't there any more of you?" <br /> <br /> "Because yesterday was a wild nature, we did not expect you to fall into the thousands. Now that you are here, we will protect you." <br /> <br /> "When?" <br /> <br /> "There will be a post set up here in Dawson in early May." <br /> <br /> "What happens between now and May? Will you be here to maintain order? "<br /> <br />" Part of the time. "<br /> <br />" And the rest of the time? "<br /> <br />" Choose a good man ... him in. Make him a marshal ??? <br /> <br /> The movie Mountie leaves and no longer appears in the picture, his amazing suggestion that a marshal of the American city, complete with stars can be sworn by a group of citizens living under British jurisprudence - it is accepted Of course they want to make Jimmy Stewart the marshal, he clearly fits the part, but Stewart plays the role of the Loner who deals with the number one and then another man is elected to get shot. And he does. Others are shot. Walter Brennan is also shot. Eventually Stewart comes to the reluctant conclusion that he has to finish all the shots with some eu filming. He hits the tin star and he and the bully, Gannon, launch each other into the inevitable western climax. <br /> <br /> To anyone with a passing knowledge of northern Canada, this bald tale of history goes beyond rational belief. <br /> <br /> excerpt from Hollywood of Canada, by Pierre Berton, 1975.
