The roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee are kidnapped by a menacing guy while they go shopping one day and are taken back to a remote island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs they visited for the last time when they were ten years old and where it is located a fortune. All of this virtually nullifies a film that is practically a long flashback to the girls' first visit to the island and the subsequent confrontation with a cannibal family. <br /> <br /> This is interpreted in an extremely horrible way by all the actors involved that I started to feel bad for poor Hank Worden who really deserved a lot MUCH better. Although I didn't like "Barracuda" (which is on the same DVD) I have to admit that this movie makes one look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: a pair of tits (they could belong to Kirsten Baker) <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Dark Sky DVD Extra: vintage ads for various drive-in food; and trailer for "Bonnie's Kids", "The central girls", "Part-time wife" (with nudity), "Psychic Killer" and "Eaten Alive". The DVD also comes with "Barracuda" from 1978
