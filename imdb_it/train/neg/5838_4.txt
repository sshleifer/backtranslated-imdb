With an absolutely fantastic cast and crew, this may have been a classic. Instead it is a repetitive paraphrase of all the conspiracy theories existing in 1979 on the assassination of the JFK grafted, rather uselessly, on a vaguely inconsistent plot on the assassination of the fictitious president Kegan in 1960. Many superb actors are wasted because or not given enough to do - Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, for example, or they are asked to go rather conspicuously over the top - John Huston. However, Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins manage to perform very well in their very different ways. <br /> <br /> Photography is wonderful, but it does not justify an hour and a half of your life, or the price of buying DVDs.
