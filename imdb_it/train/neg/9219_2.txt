I didn't even know it was originally a TV movie when I saw it, but I sensed it during the execution time. It has the same faded colors, bland characters and horrible synthesized music that I remember from the 80s, plus a "social platform" that practically shouts "Afterschool special". Anyhoo. <br /> <br /> The labyrinths and monsters by Rona Jaffe (thanks) were made in the golden age of Dungeons & Dragons, a pen and paper role-playing game that has won millions of fanatics around the world. America. I consider myself one of these geeks, although I never played D & D specifically, I dabbled in one of his brothers. M & M was also made in the golden age of the main D&D controversy - which was so compelling that people could lose touch with reality, worship Satan without knowing it, blah blah. I suppose it was a legitimate concern at some point, if extremely rare, but that dates back to this movie horribly. <br /> <br /> We meet 4 young university students, who play Mazes and Monsters correctly, to socialize and have some time away from the social life. Except that the M & M presented are more boring than their trivial lives. The charm of the game is not presented here and Jay Jay's request to bring M & M into the "real world" comes out of nowhere. It's just an excuse to drive one of the characters crazy even from scratch, even if at that point we don't really care. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel should be different, but they are all rich WASPy prats who have problems that nobody really has. <br /> <br /> But things continue, getting worse in more ways than one. The scarce budget comes terribly clear, (I love the 'Entrance' sign and the cardboard cutout to the forbidden caverns) Robbie / Pardu shows why he is not a warrior in the most compelling stabbing scene ever, and the payoff on top of the 'Due Torri is unintentionally funny. Tom Hanks' cry "Jay Jay, what am I doing here?" made me laugh for a few minutes. Definitely the lowest point of his career. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it as a convincing satire, just a ridiculous piece of 80s TV trash, and you'll still have fun. I mean, if you can stay awake. Most of it is mostly boring, but it's worth it for Pardu to break up at the end. At least Tom Hanks has improved. Not that it could be much worse from here.
