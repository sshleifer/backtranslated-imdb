The creators of this show realized that the people who were taken from different parts of the earth, in different eras (Attilla the Hun was not a contemporary of pre-destined Hellenic cultures, nor were they contemporary Vikings to the builders of the Pyramid) speak languages different and can never develop a language so similar to today's English (except for the inflections that "do not use"), which was influenced by Latin, ancient Greek, Danish and French? <br /> <br /> 2 Cultural differences cannot be overcome so easily, trust must be won, yet wherever the team arrives they are greeted without suspicion and begin to order people around as if they were their appointed bosses. .

I really wanted to believe that I had found a decent science fiction show, otherwise I would have closed and cleaned my computer of this refuge after the first five minutes!
