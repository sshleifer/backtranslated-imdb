A terrible film that should be independent. He needed an addiction to something. <br /> <br /> This totally unhappy film is about interactions between the Irish. They were trying to imitate the wonderful movie "Crash?" If so, this movie has crashed completely. <br /> <br /> There is too much to do here that culminated in a little brat running around throwing stones at buses and cars that obviously cause chaos. <br /> <br /> The film is too rough to work. A woman loses her husband after 14 years in another while her younger sister is robbed by a suitor. This causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and go around with clothes not worthy of being believed. Even the older sister becomes embittered, but soon finds the love story. <br /> <br /> So, we have 3 losers who buy masks to rob a bank. Obviously, the theft goes wrong but there seems to be no punishment for criminals. Perhaps the punishment should have been on the writers for not creating a cohesive film.
