***** Warning: may contain SPOILERS ********* My huge problem with this film is how totally self-absorbed and self-absorbed is the adulterous wife !! After spending a night with a slimy psychotic, she is persecuted by him. He calls her constantly and threatens her and even sends a video of their evening together. IT IS OBVIOUSLY crazy and very dangerous. The problem is that she only thinks that it is dangerous for her (and that she exposes her secret). He never thought a moment of concern for her husband! Did he think for a moment about him perhaps in danger from this psychotic? As soon as she realized how mentally she was she should have warned her husband, no matter what the consequences were. Maybe there wouldn't have been a movie then, but in reality there wasn't one so what's the difference.
