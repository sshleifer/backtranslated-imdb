As a fan of the horror film, I try to look at all the significant novelties of this genre, especially those that are the product of my native cinema. And I can say that the "Power of Fear" (or "Vedma" as its Russian title) is one of the weakest films among them. First, it cannot frighten even a small child, it walks so slowly and predictably that there is no place for true horror. Frankly speaking, it's not good at all points: from the silly plot (I don't know why Russian producers / directors decided to turn the classic story of Ukrainian witchcraft into a lame and ridiculous thriller of modern America. The previous reviewer doesn't shudder a bit) and to the work of the terrible and picky actors. All the actors, including the main Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova, who are quite famous in Russia, look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me that they didn't even bother to play, only they pronounced their lines in English without no expression. And in the end I really don't understand why they shot this film in English with Russian actors? I think it was their wrong turn. At least they could cast American or English actors for the main parts to make them more convincing. The same can be said of the so-called "small backgrounds of American cities" that have been shot in Estonia and look similar. The only positive moment I found in "Power of Fear" is the visual effects. They are not excellent but rather good for the Russian film. And the music is OK, at least it doesn't irritate me. That's why I give him two stars. Overall, if you want to see a good horror movie ?? don't waste time and money on this boring movie. And if you're looking for something that claims to be a Russian horror, I suggest you find a copy of "Viy or The Spirit of Evil". It's really the fantasy movie based on the same novel as "Power of Fear" but much, much better.
