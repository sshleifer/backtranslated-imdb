Near the beginning, after it was established that the outlaw John Dillinger (Warren Oates), is an egocentric rapist, another 1930s bandit is stuck in a farmhouse and surrounded by the FBI. The second-in-command Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson), supervises the situations, puts a lit cigar in his mouth, takes two 45-caliber automatisms loaded and heads towards the house far away on his own. Bang bang bang. Purvis emerges from the house alone, taking the female, the dead unbeliever, hostage. All in low heat. <br /> <br /> If you are fascinated by stories like Little Red Riding Hood, this should have considerable appeal. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's as exciting as it is unreasonable. Pretty Boy Floyd meets his death dramatically. Multiple violations of the civic code. Lots of shootings with Tommy pistols and guns. Blood everywhere. <br /> <br /> Like history, it stinks. Few remember Melvin Purvis as an FBI hero, in part, I would say, because of his name. Melvin PURVIS? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover, who fired Melvin Purvis because he was a rival in the quest for public attention. <br /> <br /> The image was written and directed by John Milius. It is the boy who wrote in his contract that, in the event that an animal is killed and killed during one of his productions, it should be the designated shooter. Milius is the boy, a maniac of the complicit gun, who had Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders in the Spanish-American war who shouted quotes from Henry V - "Saint Crispin's Day" and all the rest. <br /> <br /> Exciting, yes, and complete garbage. "I knew I would never have caught him alive, and I didn't try too hard." I mean, kill them all and let God solve them. <br /> <br /> You will like it.
