My friends and I rented it for "Bad Movie Night" with high hopes, but The Brain was a kind of disappointment. The brain itself is glacial, but mostly it sits on its small platform. Who thought it would be nice that the Brain could only munch three people for 94 minutes? At first this film has a number of things, including an Estevez-knockoff gimmick that plays a rebellious genius (we are told that his enormous intellect is misguided in his elaborate jokes and school acrobatics, including Krazy in someone's chair). He also has grandiose lines, an exhilarating and breathless henchman who can barely be anywhere, and, yes, some girl strips. However, the director is in desperate need of a school in the art of rhythm. During the last half things only begin to drag on and on, with at least 3 or 4 scenes of useless and boring pursuits that make up the middle third of the plot. The scenes within the PRI complex are particularly negative. At least 15 minutes of this film are people running up and down the same stairwell. I could have fixed the script to this thing in half an hour - more cheese, more blood, more nakedness, more brain action. If you're about to make a bad horror movie, at least give me something interesting to watch while my superego goes out. Maybe the director was trying to really bring the audience into his film - I started feeling like one of the zombified citizens at the end of this crapfest.
