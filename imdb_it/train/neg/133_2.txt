Well, the reason for seeing him at the cinema was that it was a preview, otherwise I would never have seen this terrible teenage film. I mean, haven't we had enough yet? Scream and Scary Movie at least didn't take them seriously! The plot sucks and acting is the worst I've ever seen. (Only Godzilla can compare, which is also the only film that is the worst I've ever seen in the cinema with this.) <br /> <br /> There are so many holes in the plot, and the girls are so similar , that you don't even do it now who was killed and who wasn't. (And you don't care.) The only one of them I knew before was Denise, and she was the most talented actress I've ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> Stay as far from this film as possible. (2/10)
