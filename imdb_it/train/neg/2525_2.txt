This film was, as Homer Simpson would have said, "more boring than the church". Maybe I don't understand it well enough, and I thought it started pretty well, but later (START OF SPOILER) Hermann Braun was sent to prison and Maria started working / sleeping with her boss who just started to drag herself, and I struggled to stay awake Once again, maybe it symbolizes something, but the explosion eventually seemed very forced and out of place. (END OF SPOILER). In the end, I can't understand why others think it's so big, as I found it extremely boring. By the way, I didn't watch this movie of my own free will, since I was asked to see it for a film class.
