This film was extremely depressing. <br /> <br /> The characters were so cold. The mother, who is the main character, is anything but "motherly". OK, she was unhappy in her marriage and always put her husband and children first. Her husband dies. Then he goes to see his son and meets this hunk who is sleeping with his daughter and ends up sleeping with him. Up to this part, the film is fine. Not excellent, but can be seen. The boy is charming and who can blame her? OK, it's not very maternal to sleep with your daughter's lover, but we blame the shock of losing her husband. <br /> <br /> Become totally obsessed with the boy. I think this is the part where I started not appreciating the film. He's always there to want to please him in an "old-fashioned way" with snacks while he's working at his son's house (I guess it's the only thing I've ever learned to do), like it's the only way he could get his attention. The boy is obviously not very interested (in fact, it seems more like he had thought of sleeping with her in a charitable activity) and instead of being insulted by this, she continues to beg him to go to bed with her and be kind with her when she becomes very violent. "I want to please you," he says desperately as he insults her a lot. <br /> <br /> What offended me in this film is the total lack of self-respect that the mother has for herself. He tells Craig something like "I'm just a shapeless lump" the first time they sleep together. <br /> <br /> This film is an insult to women. If it was me, I would have bought myself a small object that would have brought me the same satisfaction and much less emotional pain ... :)
