I liked Chiba in Street Fighter, and I thought hey, no matter how stupid this movie is, I'll see him at least kicking ass, right? Mistaken. This is a boring, sad mess of a useless conversation, a reckless script and meaningless intrigue. There are few action scenes of any kind, even fewer martial arts scenes, and the few that are shot and edited so badly that you can't even figure out what's going on in the world. The dubbing is also atrocious, and perhaps the idiocy of this film is best illustrated by the fact that it is presumed to be the Italian mafia ... EXCEPT THAT THEY ARE ALL Japanese! Avoid like the plague: you would see better martial arts watching for five minutes through the window of your local preschool karate class.
