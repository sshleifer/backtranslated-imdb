I just watched this movie tonight and I have to say it's a mess. I love Vince Vaughn, but ends up being more boring than fun here and the film is more like a remake of the 80s classic "Santa Claus the movie" but without the field or the bad song by Sheena Easton at the end. .The story is your run to the mill of the black sheep in the family who returns to come to terms with his family for the holidays, but with the North Pole as a scenario. Obviously Fred (Vince Vaughn) is the family that makes a mess and returns home after a series of arrears that include his girlfriend (Rachel Weisz in a cameo) who unloads him, so he goes home to face his parents and his brother more lucky of Santa Claus Claus (Paul Giamatti) and extravagant thick jokes follow with a bit of fraternal rivalry and a little anarchy that threatens all Christmas. Now, if you think you know the end of this movie, I think you'd be right because it's predictable for the hill. As for acting, Vince Vaughn plays the same lovable loser he always plays, but this time ends up being more annoying than pleasant, Miranda Richardson plays Mrs Claus but the role is more of a note than anything, Elizabeth Banks plays the assistant Santa Claus but not much of a character apart from a neurotic joke and poor Kevin Spacey ends up playing practically the same person he plays in the movie "Glengarry Glen Ross", but a little more anal. The only two actors to come out of this film with their intact dignity is Paul Giamatti, who brings true sincerity and warms up in his role as Santa Claus, but seems a bit embarrassing in the film and you can't blame him and Rachel Weisz , who manages to do much more with a very small role than most of the main actors, it's a shame because both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserved much better than what this script gave them. <br /> <br /> To put it briefly, a big disappointment.
