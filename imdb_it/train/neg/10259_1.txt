I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid and I always remember it as my first experience of being robbed of a horrible movie with good publicity. The ad was great, but I found out later that it had every explosion or "special effect" in the whole movie (about 4) and even some that weren't in the movie. There was a kind of alien plot, but the aliens were never actually shown in the film, as far as I can remember. It was clearly the case of someone who earned a cheap movie designed to defraud people. I guess my world of innocence ended that day when I found out that there were bad people out there making bad bad movies.
