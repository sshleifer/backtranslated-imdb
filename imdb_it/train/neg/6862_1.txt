This superior inferiority to the original movie "Blind Dead" is another waste of garbage. So many people have launched on these films that I can't believe what they say. Ever since I was a child I have heard how scary and fantastic these films are, I've seen them all and been disappointed, been drugged since the 1970s or don't know how boring this rude is?
