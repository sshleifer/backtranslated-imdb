This is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made. The theatrical version of A Chorus Line is wonderful. This film misses the mark in almost every way. The casting is also disconcerting. Take Audrey Landers as Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is Val's song. Val's story is that she is a great dancer, but a department of 3 in the look. Yes, find a solution, but in the end is a great dancer. What do the brilliant directors do? They take on an actress who can't dance and is famous for her magnificent appearance. Way to lose the boat. <br /> <br /> Then there's the choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett was turning in his grave. Why didn't they use his choreography? We can't really improve.
