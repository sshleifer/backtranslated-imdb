Mario Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute wrote a definitive definition of 120 pages point by point, a line-by-line refutation of this mendacious film, which should be entitled A CONVENIENT LIE. The address of the website where his debunking report, which is entitled "A SCEPTIVE GUIDE TO AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH" can be found at: www.cei.org. A shorter 10-page version can be found at: www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf Once you have read those demolitions, you will realize that the alleged "global warming" is no more real or dangerous than the Y2K scare of 1999, which Gore also claimed, as did the pseudo-scientific film IL GIORNO DOPOLO DOMANI, which was based on a book written by the alleged UFO attache Whitley Strieber. As James "The Amazing" Randi does for the psychics, and Philip Klass does the UFOs, and Gerald Posner does to the theories of the JFK conspiracy-idiocy, so does Mario Lewis to Al Gore's film and all the "global warming" scam.
