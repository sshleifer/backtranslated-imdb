This movie is pretty funny for Virginia Madsen's excellent performance and the fact that Lindsey Haun is adorable. However, the reason the film is so predictable is that we've seen it all before. I haven't read the book A Mother's Gift but I hope that for Britney and Lynne Spears it's completely different from this movie. Unless you think of ending a film with what is essentially a music video an original idea, the entire film brings to mind the word plagiarized.
