University student Alex Gardner (Nicholas Celozzi) is tormented by the nightmares of a demon from the Alcatraz winery. He dreams of cutting his hand, spitting out a worm, a ghoul that tears open his chest and is roasted over a fire. After his friends saw him levitate "6 feet" on his bed, a helpful teacher obsessed with the occult (Donna Denton) suggests he sneak into Alcatraz to face his fears. Of course they go in the middle of the night when no one is around to help when things get out of hand! <br /> <br /> The group ran aground, Alex's brother, Richard (Tom Reilly), becomes possessed and starts killing everyone. Toni Basil of fame "Mickey Mouse" looks like the useful ghost of Sammy Mitchell, singer of the group "Bodybag". He teaches Alex how to levitate from his body and performs a rock music concert with repeated nightmares to complete the execution time. All the victims present themselves as witty ghosts like the character of Griffin Dunne in UN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. The script is full of holes in the plot, poor dialogues and lame comedy attempts. Good work on FX and good opening credits (both by Ernest D. Farino) are the only things that get some credit. Basil and Devo ("Whip It") make some tracks on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Score: 2 out of 10
