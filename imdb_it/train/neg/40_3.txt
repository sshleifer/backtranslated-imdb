A model named Laura is working in South America when she is kidnapped from her hotel room by a band and taken to the jungle. They demand a huge ransom for his release. Peter is hired to take her home safely and there is a bonus in him for him if he manages to bring back the money as well as the girl. Peter is taken to the jungle by helicopter with his friend Jack. They try to return the fake money to the kidnappers in exchange for Laura, but the plan is horribly wrong and must be released by helicopter. The helicopter is hit and they must also get rid of that (it's not going well so far). Even wandering in the jungles is a devil of sorts. He is actually just a naked black guy with strangely large eyes and a breathing problem. He starts killing some of the kidnappers and Laura only flees to be captured by some primitives. The rest of the film is really a little blurry. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not a big fan of Jess Franco, in fact today this is just his second film I saw, but I can also say that this is not one of his best efforts. The films drag on at a rather slow pace without this happening. The whole thing could have been modified quite easily on a 25-minute television show. There are a lot of too long shots of people walking in the jungle that may have just been pulled out. <br /> <br /> Devil Hunter is poorly lit (in fact I don't think he was enlightened at all), badly nicknamed, poorly acted and slow for some reason he never bored me. I think the main reason for this was that of hilarious scenes. For example, a scene in which Laura is walking down the street was obviously turned into a real street while a crowd of people stops to stare at the camera as if it were turning. Another funny scene has one of the gangs that was killed, hanging from a tree that drips blood while one of his friends is directly below screaming for what seems like a minute. So, for no reason, the man in the tree heads falls and hits the boy below him. It must be seen to be believed. Then, of course, there is the real devil. He is only a nude man who, despite having huge eyes, has a very blurred vision. <br /> <br /> The film was captured by a part of the unpleasant video of the 80s here in the UK and was banned. Now because I had no idea. There is very little blood and it is certainly not a shocking film. Less nudity I would have said that he could get away with almost a PC. The only thing I can think of is that it was never actually seen and that it was added to the original list because of word of mouth. <br /> <br /> There are not many reasons to watch this movie unless you are a great Fan of Jess Franco. There is a lot of nudity to keep you from falling asleep and also some scenes that are so bad that they make you laugh well, but in other ways I would just say pay a ticket to South America and get lost in a jungle. It would probably be more fun. <br /> <br /> 3/10
