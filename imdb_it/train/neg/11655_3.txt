I was very disappointed with this movie. I thought "Scary Movie", although not a great movie, was very good and fun. "Scary Movie 2" on the other hand was boring, not funny, and sometimes just stupid. <br /> <br /> The parody of Exorcist / Amityville was probably the best part of the film. James Woods was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Now, I admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen any films that this parody was different from the first, in which I had practically seen them all. But bad comedy is still a bad comedy. <br /> <br /> Something that really hurt this movie was the timing, which ruined some of what could have been good jokes. Scenes and jokes drag on very long. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the same lines continue to repeat themselves again and again. For example, the talking bird. Ok, it was fun the first and maybe the second time. But he kept repeating to the point of being bored. The routine between the wheelchair-bound boy and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was fun at first, but it kept repeating and ended up being stupid and even insipid. <br /> <br /> Some lines have even been repeated from the first film. For example, the "creaming", I guess you'd call it Cindy (Anna Faris), was fun in "Scary Movie" because Cindy was committed to giving her boyfriend sex for so long, that she essentially had blue hell and it was fun when he "creamed". But this time it was out of place and it's not fun. <br /> <br /> Bathing and sexual humor in general were more fun and well synchronized the first time. Scat humor was excessive and rather pointless in the second film. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling was annoying and didn't really have a place in this movie. <br /> <br /> But I liked Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first movie. The scene with him and the potted plant was one of my favorites from the second movie. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and their humor. This is why this film is so disappointing. . . they have far more comic abilities than endless scat beats.
