First of all, I really loved Henry Fool, who puts me in a small series of movie goers. Parker Posey is one of the best actresses on the screen today. But this film was a real joke. Watching Hartley and the actors talking about the movie in the extras - so full of pride, and making useless analogies with Star Wars - was turning the stomach. This was hype on the part of the producers (HDNET) made to the maximum. A true example of the Emperor and his new clothes. Above all I hear that Hal ruined HENRY FOOL forever. I don't think I can ever see him again in his pure and innocent light. <br /> <br /> Remember Hal, you can SWEET some of the people sometimes ... etc. The director would not be anywhere today if all he did was churn out meaningless junk. Unfortunately, it is a pure example of the lesson taught in the film ADAPTATION. The story must be exciting and active, or its box office hopes are very low. It doesn't matter a decent story. For the actors, it was like trying to act in a straitjacket. <br /> <br /> The score, I believe of Hartley, is insipid. With drum strokes that walk across the dialogue. There was an Apple Soundtrack loop that I recognized that made me smile. <br /> <br /> When I saw the trailer, I thought, oh, they're just trying to win a new audience. But it's really a ridiculous ride. I would be happy to ruin this movie for you, but it was done. It's rotten. The FOOL series is dead. Viva Henry Fool.
