I thought the film was nice in some parts. The start was exciting. The first 30 minutes of the film were good. The camera angles in the first 30 minutes were strange and I didn't like them because they didn't entirely cover the actors. <br /> <br /> I think the last 25 minutes of the film were not so great from which we expect a lot in the case of such films. <br /> <br /> The dialogues made no sense and I don't think they were very funny. <br /> <br /> I felt like they were trying to copy movies like phonebooth in terms of dialogues, but failed miserably. It seemed like they were many of the scenes between the actors were put up for the sake of it and had no sense for the story. <br /> <br /> the whole film presents only the law and the caine. <br /> <br /> I don't think it was a waste of time, it's an OK movie, but not gr8
