INSPECTOR GADGET (1999) ** <br /> <br /> starring: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Andy Dick, Dabney Coleman Director: David Kellogg 80 minutes Rated PG <br /> <br /> Blake French : <br /> <br /> The new Disney movie, "Inspector Gadget" is about a policeman named John who survives a serious accident and is saved by a state-of-the-art experimental operation that turns him into a machine-like robotic agent that has tools and gadgets of all types built into its body for use when it says "Go Go", just to be called an Inspector Gadget! <br /> <br /> The structure of the actual film is very similar to the formation of the body of the Inspector Gadget himself. It's noisy, fragmented, energetic and consists of a bunch of low-hearted gadgets, put together to do something that doesn't have much in common with anything else present. The film is basically a series of bizarre action sequences that are somewhat glued together with characters and an irregular story that only children between 6-9 would like. <br /> <br /> The cop who is dramatically reinvented is played by Matthew Broderick, who, until "Inspector Gadget", has had success with films like "Elections". His character becomes Inspector Gadget after a meeting with the villain of the film, the villain named Claw. It is played by Rupert Everett, who has already experienced the catastrophe this year with the terrible "Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare". <br /> <br /> There is a romantic subplot in this film as well as a large number of scenes involving the extravagant parts of the body and the elements of the Inspector Gadget mechanism. He has Gadget and Claw drooling over the attractive character Brenda, played by Joely Fisher, both for his appearance and for his knowledge of a specific invention made by his late father, who had previously been killed by Claw. The competition evolves into fight scenes and a reason for many of the film's events. Another important character is the Mobil Gadget, a life like the car designed for the Inspector Gadget himself. He is voiced by D.L. Hughly of the sitcom comedy "The Hughly's." <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" is a film that I found rather bad. I know, I'm not exactly a target audience for filmmakers, but even my relative of ten found the film in his hatred. The film is full of distinct flaws and obvious problems. I never found myself interested in the characters. There is no mood development apart from some opening titles, unlike the much worse 1997 film, "Mr. Magoo", which opened using the original cartoon clips. It is too much to ask the same kind of thing in this play, which is rarely fun and almost never convincing. The overall production project is nothing but a mess of incomplete sight gag and consists of a joke: the unbeatable ambush of the Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> In films like this, audiences want boundaries - something to help them understand what can and cannot happen. In "Inspector Gadget" there are no such boundaries. This is truly nothing more than a moment of celebration for the actors, who had a great time. I am reminded of another missing comedy released a few years ago, called "Blankman" which still contained many props and energy, and the actors certainly had fun with all the gadgets and props, but something was needed too for each film: audience participation. <br /> <br /> A character that I found very controversial is Gadgets' daughter, who at the end of the film still has no idea what her name was. It is used only as a plot device, and I wonder how it used to promote the plot. Due to its presence it does not bring anything relevant or productive to the film. We never know his reactions to his father's operations or incidents. So this is someone who may have been completely ruled out and would not have influenced the movie a bit. <br /> <br /> In closing, I would like to say that "Inspector Gadget" is a terrible and insufficient excuse for a children's play. And believe it or not, I find myself comparing this film to the past few years, a violent and very anti-young "Blade" action movie. I am stating once again that I had a lot more than a movie in which nothing happens in which everything happens. "Inspector Gadget" has been so successful at the same time, it has literally made me dizzy. <br /> <br />
