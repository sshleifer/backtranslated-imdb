I'm a big fan of cinema. I like movies of all kinds. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I understand that the book follows closely, which raises the point that not everything should be turned into a movie. Above all because the authenticity of the experiences in the book has been questioned more than once. <br /> <br /> These characters are not bizarre, they are mentally ill. The things that happen are not fun, they are scary; especially considering that they should be true. <br /> <br /> This film had the feeling of The Royal Tenenbaums, another film I hated, only Running With Scissors was even more dysfunctional and less fun. <br /> <br /> I will never go back to those hours. I wanted to wash my brain after seeing.
