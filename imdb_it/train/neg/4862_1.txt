this show is one of the worst shows of ALL TIME! absolutely no original joke and I'm always a year late. as in 2009, they will finally say something about Michael Vick's dog fights. all the cast members are people who wanted to be on SNL but had to go to the lowest of the low, mad TV. it's an hour of crazy magazine jokes that witches are not funny to begin with, told by the terrible John Stewart wants the bees . so if you have any problems tell me that I like to hear the opinion of the 3 people watching this show. the family boy put it right "Osama bin Laden was hiding in a place no one would watch, the cast of the crazy TV. There's a reason why nobody watches the show.
