The film was "OK". Not bad, not good, just OK. If there was anything else in the theater, it would have missed a lot. Unfortunately, Fast and Furious 2 is also stunk, but I'd rather see it than FF2. :) If you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk, this will be a "nice" movie for you. Personally, I would wait for HBO or Blockbuster.
