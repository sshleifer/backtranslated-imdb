But, let me face ... you have a couple of nostalgic sighs on my part. <br /> <br /> The show is so great that it is allowed to have some hiccups. I take a new season, and I'm just living them as if I had 2 days to live. I like the idea of ​​making it, but it was much more than an end of season episode that would explain the following: <br /> <br /> Dr.Cox shouldn't be bald for another couple of episodes, the only explanation that I can think is that they changed the rotation of the episodes or had to repeat the beginning. <br /> <br /> and that my friends, is why the devil is bald. <br /> <br /> However, the show is fantastic ... leads to the seventh season.
