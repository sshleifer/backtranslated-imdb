When childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie; it's a touch and you go if you should see it again. Anyway, I remembered a scary scene involving a homeless and a bad villain played by Jeff Kober. <br /> <br /> "The First Power" is not a very beautiful film, sad to say. It's chock-full of those police clich√©s and a very poor script with holes that a truck could go through (along with countless "twists" that help the story run forward). Lou Diamond Phillips is the ass-insurance cop who confides Kober's serial killer to the gas chamber only to find out that he was a servant of Satan himself and now has the power of resurrection along with the power to possess every weak person that he meets. Through the mix a little realized psychic that helps in the case. <br /> <br /> Ahhh, this is garbage. But fun as such, especially if you have fond memories of it. It scared me as a child and that scene with the homeless is still quite good. As with any kind of logic here; Forget it, almost all scenarios are launched for good measure and end up with a cross between an action movie by Steven Segal and a demonic movie from the 70s. And who the hell thought it was a good idea to launch Lou Diamond Phillips in the head? Needless to say, it's not convincing at all, but it does its best and I never had the problem with the guy that many reviewers seem to have. As for Tracy Griffith as a psychic, much less said, the better. But Kober is pretty good as a murderer; he always liked that actor. <br /> <br /> "The First Power" could be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day's work and a "brain switch-off" is necessary. Most likely the beer will improve the visual experience and I will definitely have a lot next time I give this movie a spin. After all; not a good film but a rather guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily frightened as children. "See you around, friend"!
