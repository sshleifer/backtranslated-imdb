I thought the film was OK but very disappointed that they didn't capture the true image of his life. I was just waiting to see his mother like a real Jamaican, which is driving me crazy. Just watching the beginning of the film told me that the film was not accurate. That I completely lost interest only for a few seconds from the beginning of the film. I'm very disappointed, it's like looking at a biography about Mark Anthony and making Arnold do the part. I don't know what the writer thought about missing a precious piece from the film that I'm sure his mother played a huge role in his life. I will say that the film was OK besides Major Fla !!!!!!
