I saw the movie and got screwed, because the film was silly and boring. I thought that ram gopal varma would justify his work, but unfortunately he failed and the whole movie was ruined and they ruined "sholay". the cast and crew were bad. the whole theater slept while watching the movie, some people ran away in the middle. Amithab Bachan's acting is mediocre, I thought this film will be the biggest hit of the year, but this movie will be the biggest flop of the year, sure. no one has done justice to their work, including Ajay Devagan. this film does not deserve an audience. I bet this movie will be flopped. <br /> <br /> "FINALLY THIS SUCKING FILM"
