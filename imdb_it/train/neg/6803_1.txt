When I come to IMDb tables, I'm always sick of seeing a post "the worst movie ever". After seeing this * movie *, I think I'll soon be creating my post !! <br /> <br /> The opening titles: large, a kind of zoom lame on a gas oven (yes, focus on the fire = explosions = action-packed film !!) <br /> <br /> The actors: I think Ice T is a cool rapper, even a good actor (sometimes, I insist, "sometimes") but Steven Seagal as a cop plays is ... beyond words. The rest of the cast is ... well, I don't know where those actors were hired, but jeez !! I bet my dog ​​would have been a much better actor than them !! <br /> <br /> The plot: Hijacking.original isn't it ?? <br /> <br /> Action sequences: The first shot of the film is an explosion. I said to myself, well, nice !! At least there will be some nice pyrotechnic effects .. The rest of the film is mostly full of low rent stocks taken by the Air Force ... <br /> <br /> The dialogues are hilarious, the music is pure shit , the end is happy (I mean I was happy in the end because the film was finished !!!) <br /> <br /> My cousin who was watching the movie was happy (I'm 22, she 42 ... well) .I was about to take the movie and burn it. Maybe next time I'll watch it ... (who ever said ???)
