Phew - I don't know what to say. This is a movie that could be really cool with lots of stoned viewers. Some of the recitations reminded me of John Waters' first offers. Maybe I should take it back - I don't want to insult Waters as a director / narrator. <br /> <br /> I particularly loved the lawyer who took the "full trust and credibility" clause. By the way, it is "full confidence and credit"! <br /> <br /> This also reminds me of "The Conrad Boys", where the main actor is also the writer, director, editor, etc. Multi-involved companies like that are probably best placed by very experienced film professionals who might have the technical ability (even if a stunt, some might say) to bring out something like that.
