Max had the V-8, Trace (Wheels of Fires last and only hero) has a jet engine on the back of his car that allows him to make involuntary humorous faces as he wanders around the desolate desolate area. Be amazed by the fact that Mad Max 2 (aka The Road Warrior) is dissected and reassembled like a new film, even if it is shot in a lackluster way with bad actors and bad acrobatic works. <br /> <br /> Why is WoF set in a post-apocalyptic desert? Simple, The Road Warrior was! In fact, any question can be answered by: it is so in Road Warrior! Except for the mutant actors outside the work of the original 1960s film The Time Machine who make a cameo to give the audience some non-vehicular action to chew for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> The fashion of the 80s, all the cars driven by bad guys who are hit or jostled explode in a huge floating explosion. Inevitably, all car chases will take place near the comfortable cliff sides and cars will inevitably fall out of them. Along with this wild cinematic run of the 1980s, there is the general unbridled misogyny in this style of economic film. In general, I was waiting for the Trace rocket-propelled car to accelerate and shoot at the flames, so there would be another blow to him that scratched his face as if it were hard, and he came off more while looking constipated. Badly choreographed action and bad acting make this movie a true diver. The value of involuntary humor is even subtle. <br /> <br /> Ratti: Nights of Terror by Bruno Mattei is superior. And this in itself is saying a lot! With this count in 2020 the Texas Gladiators are a cinematic masterpiece compared to Wheels of Fire. A poor Road Warrior puts off that he doesn't have a cheese factor close enough to make the movie watchable. <br /> <br />
