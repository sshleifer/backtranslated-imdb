STRANGER THAN FICTION made me so angry, I signed up on IMDb just to write this review. STRANGER THAN FICTION is a surprisingly complex, touching and stimulating film to the end. Once you suspend multiple logic errors (because Will Ferrell didn't hear Emma Thompson's voice 10 years ago when he started writing his book? "The phone rang." How could he not know what he was calling?.), The movie questions one's thoughts on mortality, destiny and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The brief history of literary themes provided by Dustin Hoffman should in particular entertain former English majors. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is always a pleasure, although Will Ferrell could easily be a murderer like a brave soul. His rapid trust in him is a great leap of faith. <br /> <br /> Ah, but the ending. Until the end, I would have given 9 out of 10 stars to this film. The film as a metaphor for the journey of life, as a tribute to the notion of "true writing", as I remember that great literature is either comedy or tragedy, but not both, is exceptional. The entire film takes the viewer to understand and accept the moment of Will Ferrell's destiny. And no matter how dear a character may have become, we know perfectly well why we will accept the ending. The last act occurs, the screen turns white, the credits roll. A deep and powerful ending for an almost perfect movie. An end that would have been discussed for weeks. <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!! No credit rolled. Say it is not so. Say Hollywood did not tackle another 10 minutes of shit that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the film. Dustin Hoffman understood correctly when he said: "It is no longer a masterpiece, it is OK". An appropriate review of the film. Except for me, it wasn't even OK. I was so offended by the betrayal of "writing real" about the decision to perpetrate the film that I actually burst into tears of anger that explained it during the journey home from the movie. I don't cry often. I could care less about most movies, but I'm still upset about it. <br /> <br /> My questions about Zack Helm, the writer, are these: is the original film finished when the screen has turned white? And have you been forced by the vapid powers of the film-which-to-be to tack on an unfaithful finale at the center of the film? Or have you turned to that end from maudlin on yourself? I read that you are brilliant. I hope your original screenplay closed the movie the first time. <br /> <br /> I know Zack Helm will never see this review, and I couldn't find a contact to ask. But, please, movie-goers, am I the only one who feels this way about STRANGER THAN FICTION? A positive thing came from me seeing this film: I doubly admire LOST IN TRANSLATION now.
