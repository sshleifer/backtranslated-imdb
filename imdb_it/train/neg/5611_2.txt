Personally I found this film terrible, before it was not objective at all, and provided a part of the debate. The only people who were presented as the part that said it existed were a group of people from a Billy Grahm Revival. Secondly he heavily deviated from his alleged argument Jesus existed (Yeshua), talking about how violent Christianity is, and showing scenes of Mel Gibson's "The Passion". In the end, the director with his former principal of a private conservative school is interviewed and tries to trap him in teaching children faith. Oh, and even Techno Music made the movie harder to watch.
