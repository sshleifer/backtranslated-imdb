In the words of the character of Charles Dance in this film, "Bollocks!" No plot, no character development and absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> Full of things that don't happen in the real world (since when did British police inspectors armed with shoulder guns?). Full of mistakes (Bulgarian trains in London?). Full of boring and artificial dialogue. And the direction / editing is horrible - shots of photos taken by hand that don't add anything to the film except a vague feeling of seasickness; confused leaps; no structure. <br /> <br /> The character of Wesley Snipes is totally indifferent: why should we worry about what happens to him? Directly to the video? Directly to the dustbin!
