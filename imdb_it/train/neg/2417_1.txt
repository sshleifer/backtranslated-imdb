This was without a doubt the worst thing I had ever spent money on. I feel sorry for admitting that I rented this "movie" and actually paid some money to see it. This is not even worth the garbage. No no This is the juice that accumulates at the bottom of the industrial bins located in particularly dirty neighborhoods after an extraordinarily wet summer. Calling it junk would degrade garbage everywhere. He was so ugly that I felt I had to sign up for IMDb and hear my fellow man. This character from luvahire says this film is fantastic. Its grip on reality must be questioned. Let's take some of your comments and analyze them. <br /> <br /> "The actor who played Ricky (I forgot his name) did a great job." <br /> <br /> I see. Well, if the director imagined his audience shuddering and wincing at every sentence pronounced by Ricky or alternatively bursting into uncontrollable laughter in moments when most directors would have wanted a darker reaction from their viewers, then yes; Ricky did an exceptional job. <br /> <br /> "I am an aspiring actor who is taking the theater in my school and I had to do a play where I had to cry and it is not easy to be emotional in a scene so I give props to the actors who have to do an emotional scene and can do it. "<br /> <br /> Wow. I also have to give props to actors who can make exciting scenes. Luvahire, you might want to look at another line of work there, man, if you think these pig heads took it off. However, they can help you if you need to practice crying. Watch the film. has. has. has. <br /> <br /> "BRING ON THE SEQUEL" <br /> <br /> If I were your theater teacher at school, I would have missed you based solely on this comment. <br /> <br /> I'm too disgusted to continue. I have to deliver the film to my partner, Mr. Bangla, now. <br /> <br /> Howdy! If you've continued reading up to here, I take it for granted that you've already seen the movie, and now you're looking for one of two things in this comment: 1) Further vitriolic degradation of what you agreed was a movie exceptionally poor. 2) A further vitriolic degradation of what you hear was a good cinematographic effort that needs to defend itself from a slanderous scum like me. Whether you want to help articulate your disgust or your ammunition for a moving response, if I say something good it will only disappoint you - so I assure you, there is little chance of such a disappointment. <br /> <br /> The other negative comments here on IMDb have already listed the particular defects of the film (for example the acting, the soundtrack, the direction, the dialogue, the editing, etc.), however all these defects can be easily forgiven, in and of themselves. Few people will rent a movie called "Hood of the Living Dead" if they require these items to be top notch. The final failure of "Hood", however, is his inability to keep the abundant promise of his name. "Hood of the Living Dead" practically jumps off the shelf of the video store with its implications of monotonous jokes and incredibly creative killings. Here was the chance to mix the gong of the zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto, to blow up the gangstaf zombies on innocent life while doing rocker do-rags, to have undead magnomics driving everyone - lice too deadly in their outlaw rides. The mixture of the two genres could have been fun. Instead, the film is more like watching middle school children timidly delivering lines to a play they are performing, but don't understand. To avoid a feeling of betrayal by the public of their video rental, I suggest the Quiroz brothers to relaunch the film with the following new title: "Hood of the Living Dead: a homemade horror video that we shot on our video camera with some friends last summer because we were bored ". Or maybe they could release it as a documentary. "The Day Creativity Died: an exploration of how a low-budget film can still be perfectly lacking in intelligent or original thought, despite having no connection with an important film studio". <br /> <br /> The potential tenant whose interest has not been repressed should find the following message on the back of the video: "The Quiroz brothers have shown once again that looking at things you can easily do by yourself is not much interesting. "- Mr. Bangla
