So I heard from some people that this movie had led them to cry in the theater. While watching it for the first time, I was expecting another romantic and tear-jerking film by Barbra Streisand; Something like the way we were. I was definitely wrong. The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and his John Howard, was non-existent, making it impossible to cling to the characters. There was nothing romantic about it. Streisand's character fell to an alcoholic drug addict who couldn't sing a single note without me wanting to press the fast forward button. At one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later. There's nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who doesn't seem to realize it until she dies. Parts of the film seemed to go on and on, and I kept wondering when it would end. <br /> <br /> The death of John Howard was completely predictable. There was an obvious premonition of his reckless behavior at the beginning of the film, and when he died I felt no emotion. It was not a tragic accident, he was basically an idiot. Not to mention the whole movie I was distracted by his horrible beard. <br /> <br /> The only parts of this film that are worth seeing are the Streisand songs. The end of the film, when he sings "With One More Look at You / Watch Closely Now", was my reason for giving this movie an incredible 3/10. Those 7 minutes were the only part of the film I actually felt an emotion different from irritation and anger.
