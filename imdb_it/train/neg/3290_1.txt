This movie has been sucked! They took something from my childhood and raped him in an annex! This movie was so bad I wanted to go home and keep my "Dukes" DVDs and cry in the corner. The cast was terrible! It wasn't "The Dukes", it was Stiffler and Jackass driving a car. When was the Hogg boss evil? When was Rosco a tough guy? They have never been! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot. When did you smoke Jesse? He never did it! Now don't get me wrong, I'm very liberal and there's nothing wrong with a little chiba, but there was no place in this movie! The only good thing about this movie was the movie trailers and the credits. It was a waste of time and money. Avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!
