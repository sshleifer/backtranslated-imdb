Dr Tarr's Torture Dungeon is about a journalist who goes to an asylum to write a new technique that they use with their patients. However, the journalist soon discovers that things are not what they appear to be, and the mental hospital is run by patients, and doctors are caged. First of all, some parts of the movie are simply boring and make you want to fall asleep, and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons (A guy who thinks he's a chicken, for example). I must admit that the story is actually pretty good, but the movie itself bombards. The film's music is really weird and like something you'd hear in a crazy comedy, and yes, there's a scene that involves dancing chicken men, which almost made me want to close the screen. Watch this movie at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Vote: R for violence and nudity.
