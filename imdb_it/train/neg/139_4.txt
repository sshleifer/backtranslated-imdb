This film was rented by a friend. His choice is normally good. I read the cover first and expected a good movie. Although <br /> <br /> it was a horror movie. Which I do not prefer. But no horror came to my mind as I watched the film. It was a boring movie, not very funny. The appearance of Denise Richards <br /> <br /> was again a pleasure for the eyes. But it is so. We (the four of us) <br /> <br /> are a little disappointed. But feel free to watch this movie and <br /> <br /> judge it for yourself.
