While the idea is more original than most science fiction films, the execution is, as usual, lacking. While the practical effects of the mummy are not bad, and the character "Gun Nut" is above the top that makes one laugh, the only real attraction is to see Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin gathered on the small screen. I suspect it was the idea forever. They do the best they can with what they have but the "must-see" moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so when Morena's character sported some Tomb Raider style shorts. It is not a cinema with high eyelashes, I know, but you cannot deny the true beauty when you see it !!! And Adam Baldwin, once again, sums it up as the boy you love to hate. If you just want to see a couple of your favorite Firefly characters having fun with some secondary materials, this could be for you. If you want good acting and character development, you may want to look elsewhere.
