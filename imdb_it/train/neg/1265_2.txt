First of all I didn't want to see this film, because the trailer gave me the impression of a common and too expected film ... but recently I had the pleasure of discovering the surprising "Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinité" which was beautifully directed and written by Laurent Tirard (screenwriter of "prête-moi ta main"), I changed my mind and decided to try it, thinking that "Prête-moi ta main" would be as good as "mensonges ..." And it is absolutely No. The script is not bad, but it is not as direct as "Mensonges ...", the actors are not as generous (especially Charlotte, boring as she usually is) like Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac and also honestly, I still don't understand how such crap can have such success, even with a similar casting ... However the story could have been a pretext to create so many interesting plots, but it is not as good as Tirard's "Mensonges ..." even if it is also written by him, easy work, little surprising and lazy. Totally overrated!
