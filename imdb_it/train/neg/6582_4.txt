Geez, another Lifetime movie, but again not exactly the worst movie in the world, but far from the best. I think the main problem is that it is quite obvious who is responsible for what, and is generally quite predictable. Worse, some of the flashbacks ended up confusing and the viewer wondered, "Okay, how much should I worry about?" One thing that I liked is that the film goes to show you that it's never as simple as "the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad", and sometimes it's bad against evil rather than evil. Hadley didn't do what he did out of justice, he did it because he considered himself entitled to a job to be a family, AND to eliminate competition. As for Alicia, it simply shows that a victim is not always a good person. Some of them "make it come", even if "it is" a painful and horrible death. "The Burning Bed" is a great example of this, but the difference is that the disgusting man of "The Burning Bed" got exactly what he deserved. But has Alicia "arrived"? Some will say he did, but others disagree, and the law generally doesn't either. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it's a mixture. Some do a good job, like Mia, but others just came across their roles. They were mostly wooden or simply unconvincing. The music was pretty cool and some scenes are nice and wet, especially if you like girl / girl actions. The film is not shot at all, but given its glaring weaknesses, unfortunately the strengths are in the background. <br /> <br /> I've heard rumors about a sequel, but given the years I doubt it will happen. But I wouldn't be surprised if a sequel suddenly appeared. If Alicia is as bad, conniving and horrible as people say, then I don't think she'll think, "YAY! I woke up from a coma! Oh, Hadley was responsible? Oh! It's all right! And I want the charges to fall!" In any case, Hadley would be in jail for a long time, if he ever does, since no murder actually happened. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's worth a try at least once!
