"Porky's Poor Fish" by Bob Clampett is a cartoon so populated by scary word games and one or two pleasant moments. Set in Porky's Fish Shoppe, "Porky's Poor Fish" occupies an uncomfortable area between a black and white Porky cartoon and one of the Merli Melodies of life-like books that were popular at the time. Typically of many of Porky's early cartoons, Porky is far from the star, appearing only in a rather neat opening musical number and the climax of the film. For the rest of the time the star is a balding cat who sees the fish market as an opportunity for a free meal, but gets more than he expected. Unfortunately, the public gets far less than they expected. As was sometimes the case in the book-of-life series, the spotlight is on punitive signs that could have worked equally well in a non-animated medium. The laughter is scarce and, while the comic is almost saved by Clampett's energy management, there is very little to recommend "Porky's Poor Fish" on any of the other Porky cartoons at the beginning.
