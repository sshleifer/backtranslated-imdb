A scientist (John Carradine - unfortunately) discovers how to bring the dead back to life. However they come back with marble faces. In the end all this leads to disaster. <br /> <br /> Boring and predictable journey of the 40s. This drove me crazy when I was a kid, but now I'm bored. I had to fight to stay awake! With one exception, acting is horrible. Such boring actors without expression! Hopeless. <br /> <br /> There are some positive things about this: Carradine, despite the script, really does offer excellent performances. And there are some mildly gruesome moments involving a ghost of a Great Dane walking through the walls. There is also one of the worst successes in the history of cinema. Nevertheless, none of this is fun enough to sit. To avoid.
