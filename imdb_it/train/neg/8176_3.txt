I watched this movie last night with anticipation, but in reality I was not very impressed. <br /> <br /> With the exception of "Combo", I thought that acting was scarce and narrative limited. He came across a drama made especially for TV. <br /> <br /> I heard that the film was very elaborate. The whole set of hammering in context at the beginning (yes, we realized that this is Britain in the 80s - now you can stop) was tiring, and gave a unilateral view of what life was like in the 1980s Britain: poverty, war juxtaposed to royalty, Margaret Thatcher, yet nothing in between? There were actually middle classes that existed then - just ordinary people, with a decent salary and a mortgage. Also the Falklands clips seemed to be added randomly towards the end, I assume by "dramatic effect". <br /> <br /> The sequence of events seemed somewhat disjointed, as the characters shifted an action from one to the other without seeing how their mentality could have changed so quickly. <br /> <br /> The relationship between "Shaun" and "Smell" was the curvature of the fingers. I couldn't even watch during the snogging scene. I find it very difficult to believe that she would have been attracted to a boy who was not only much younger, but also much younger. I know there were only four years between them, but four years is nothing when you reach your twenties, but it's a huge difference in your teens! In my experience, this type of adolescent difference occurs only when the girl is the youngest, since the girls mature much faster and are more on the wavelength of older boys. Sorry, but I didn't buy it - an unnecessary point in the plot created for the shock value. <br /> <br /> The ending was quite abrupt and again forced. If the flag-throwing episode was to be iconic, then it fell a little short in my eyes. It annoys me that British films are only concerned with the upper classes or with poverty. Don't get me wrong, I love Trainspotting, and Four Weddings has its charm, but can't we Brits invent something different? Why are our films always so hung on the class system? I was born in 1973, so it wasn't very different in age for 'Shaun' it would have been in 1983. I grew up in a single-parent family on a fairly trampled communal estate in a city in England. However, the experiences of my childhood were very different from those portrayed in the film - I don't even remember that racism is a problem (although I'm not saying it didn't exist). 'This is England'? Not in my experience. <br /> <br /> The end result is that I felt that this film lacked substance, and I was completely bored and unimpressed.
