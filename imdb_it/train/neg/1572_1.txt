One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Terrible act, ridiculous "action" (it is clear that cars travel slowly), atrocious script, horribly unsatisfactory ending and incompetent direction make a hash of a film. We know that Judge Reinhold is a good actor, but he should be ashamed of this debris. There is not a lot of tension inside the car and, when the characters stumble in moments of hope, they laugh like inane banshee for some reason, even "high five" when they see the bridge lower! <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the chain of events that lead these people to share the same credibility as the cars. Apparently based on real events, though? If so, the truth is obviously stranger than fiction! Unlucky therefore, that he was portrayed in such an inept manner.
