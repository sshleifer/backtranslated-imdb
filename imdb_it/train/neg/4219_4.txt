This is an amateur film shot on video, not an "electrifying drama", as the DVD lining notes falsely boast. I've seen much better things from college students. Most of the story takes place with a taxi ride all around Jakarta. This film could have been made using a single video camera, but there are some sections where two cameras were used and the content was bounced together later. Assembly is extremely difficult. The final change was probably done with two cameras, bouncing the content back and forth, rather than with an appropriate editor. Maybe they even did the assembly on the taxi? English subtitles were written by someone who does not speak English fluently, eg "Where you go now?" To say that the quality of production is on a par with Blair Witch is generous. If you're not scared yet, this film was an ambitious and creative project, with many fantastic and original images from all over Jakarta.
