The only reason this movie is rated at 1 is that zero is not one of the selection options. With a finer plot than the depression was the cabbage soup, the horrible acting and the special effects that seemed to come out of the "Thunderbirds" TV series, it's incredible that Widmark didn't kill the director for putting this black mark on his resume. Even by 1950s standards, special effects are atrocious, except for a couple of submarine underwater sequences. I can only assume that he was nominated for the best special effects because, with the exception of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and THEM !, there was no one else producing effects. It was certainly not a competition for Disney that year if this was their only competition. I would not recommend the film, even for fans of hard core submarines, since the most realistic submarine scene was limited to a single shot in which seawater can be seen dribbling along the raised periscope. There are other much better subtitles that you can enjoy from this era, like the already mentioned 20,000 leagues or Torpedo Run.
