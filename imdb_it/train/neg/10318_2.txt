Who likes horrible "comic" shows like the small mosque on the prairie? The only two types of people I can think of to those who watch this are: one, Muslims and self-proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so excited that there is a show about Muslims that doesn't even matter if the show is good or fun (which is not). Two, old and people whose idea of ​​comedy is incredibly predictable, poorly written, stale jokes. <br /> <br /> CBC needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is. If they continue to write only comedies for old people, then guess what will happen, their audience will die soon and will no longer remain public. I would be curious who also writes for this show? Do you think they are actually Muslims, or fashionable, funny young people? No, I bet they are old whites who have written the same lines for the same kind of bad CBC shows since 1960. <br /> <br /> When you watch the CBC comedies, there is only Air Farce at the end only removed the air (thank goodness!) but we still have lame ducks like this one now has 22 minutes and Rick Mercer we're paying, not to mention this poor excuse for "comedy" Little Mosque on the prairie. Should it be offensive and fun? Only CBC would think this lame show is completely offensive or funny. Too bad for the CBC to squeeze our show tax dollars, only a few people would worry about watching.
