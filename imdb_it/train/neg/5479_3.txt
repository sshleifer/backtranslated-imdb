I bet none of you knew that the famous Conquistador Hernando Cortes did a preliminary exploration expedition to Mexico before facing the Aztecs. Fortunately he did because he would never know about those T Rex who lived in a particular valley where the locals worshiped them as gods. <br /> <br /> It was understandable. What was not was the casting of Blue Eyed Ian Ziering as Cortes. Even with his blond hair made famous in Beverly Hills 90210 dyed black, Ian looked pretty ridiculous. At least he made no attempt with a Spanish accent. <br /> <br /> The true hero of the tyrannosaurus Azteca is Marco Sanchez also late in a television series with a semi-recurring role in Walker Texas Ranger as detective Sandoval of Dallas PD. Find true love with an Aztec princess and life would be perfect if it weren't for those annoying prehistoric creatures that the natives worship. <br /> <br /> Tyrannosaurus Azteca seems to have used some outtakes of the famous series Sid & Marty Krofft the land of the lost. All that was needed was a little Sleestak to appear. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in discovering this reconnaissance expedition that has absolutely not made the history of the books, take a look at Tyrannosaurus Azteca. So try to sit through your straight face.
