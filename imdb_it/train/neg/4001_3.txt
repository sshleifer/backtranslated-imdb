Having heard so much about the Cracker series of the 90s without having seen anyone, I couldn't wait to do it with enthusiasm. Surely the combination of Jimmie McGovern and Robbie Coltrane could not be wrong. How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> The controversies, supported by frequent, repetitive and violent flashbacks, were oppressive. The production tried to be super-modern, but the flashing boxes and even the childish character became irritated. Robbie Coltrane went through sleep for two hours, arriving with unexplained and unlikely "insights", and the police were portrayed as an idiot idiot idiot. As a result, the tension never built up and the next scene at the end (no details for the fear of spoilers) was really a bad television drama, as I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> No, I don't want to see others, but I'll go back to the DVDs of the 90s series to see if they match their reputation.
