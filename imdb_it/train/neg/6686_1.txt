There isn't a grain of entertainment in this whole movie. There is no scary, funny or even interesting scene in this film. It advertises itself as a horror, then continues to call itself a comedy. It doesn't even tolerate humor. Nor does it try to be scary. <br /> <br /> To not get bored with this film, you should be one of the most easily entertained people on earth. If you like this movie, even a little small you have no standard for what you're looking at. I'm going through a very difficult time to figure out what the filmmakers were trying to do. It's not funny, scary, shocking or intriguing. So it had to be a drama? Because it wasn't really dramatic. <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. Life is too precious to waste 90 minutes watching this.
