I thought that Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was a beautiful horror film. When the body of a terrorist, infected with a stolen chemical, is recovered by the American army, the corpse is then cremated, releasing the virus into the atmosphere on a small island. Soon the infected premises will turn into meat-hungry zombies, and a group of retired soldiers will have to join a group of tourists and embark on an abandoned hotel while trying to fight aggressive living dead. I did not find this film as beautiful as the original film, Zombie Flesh Eaters. But it was still an OK horror film with some good action. I didn't think it was one of the best in the series. 4/10
