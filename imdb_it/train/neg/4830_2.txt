REALLY? REALLY???? I know that if you make a political war movie you'll get noticed but this movie is just rubbish. Horrible in every sense. Terribly inaccurate in so many ways. It is easier for me to believe that the president of the United States has adapted, flying a fighter jet and bringing down the aliens. It is easier to notice the few things that were right. My jaw dropped when I saw someone say that this movie was the best in the last 25 years. It was overcrowded, apparently useless detours of the plot, and sometimes had a questionable picture. <br /> <br /> X-box, YouTube, ACUPAT utility ?? Has anyone verified that these things did not exist in 2004? It's not like I had to do a thorough research, it was only five years before this film came out. I am a veteran of the Iraq war and if you spent a day with an infantry platoon or an EOD team you would have realized how B.S. this movie is. Comparing it to Platoon or Saving Private Ryan is ridiculous. Why don't you also throw Commando and Red Dawn? I think those could be more accurate. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you can see beyond the incredible storyline, historical and factual discrepancies, then this movie could be OK. Nothing more. If you keep hearing "Oscar buzz", and you have to add your pompous review, go ahead. As for me, I write the director to see if I can recover my 131 minutes.
