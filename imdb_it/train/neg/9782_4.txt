This film had such a promise !! What a great idea, a losing paintball team that fights for recognition and personal glory, only to lose speed due to bad dialogues, poor editing and a half-written story. The characters at the beginning were interesting, only to lose their calm halfway to become one-dimensional people who spat out tired jokes. <br /> <br /> Maybe if they had spent a little more time in the story and in the dialogues it would have been a great movie, instead of an almost rethought effort.
