This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Robin Williams joined the part as a rhino would fit into a tutu, even though his performance was still painful. Kurt Russell was more credible but it was still terrible. The plot left a lot to be desired and even the rest of the acting was terrible. The only thing this movie had in store was the trailer, which sucked me into wasting 90 minutes of my life that could have been better spent trying to lick my head. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you have it. Otherwise, be happy not to do it.
