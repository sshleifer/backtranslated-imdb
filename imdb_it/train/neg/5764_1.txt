Scary Movie 3 is so tiring that it's hard to put into words. It makes films like Malibu's Most Wanted as Oscar material, let's just say that. <br /> <br /> The original Scary Movie was a lot of fun, one of the best spoofs of the 90s, coming from a great team that previously shook our world with Dont Be A Menace to South Central while drinking your juice in the hood. But what the hell happened ?! After the Scary Movie 2 tragedy, I thought the cast and crew would be helpful, but it's even worse. <br /> <br /> I smile twice within 20 minutes. Not a laugh, the jokes were recycled and originality was obviously not a factor. The fact that at this point in writing, most people on this site voted, made me feel physically sick. When there are big movies like School of Rock, which actually have jokes that are * funny * funny, anyone wastes their money on tripe like this needs the head examined. <br /> <br /> no stars / ****
