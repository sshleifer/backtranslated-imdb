If asked how I would define the word "Shallow", I would say "Look at a Jerry Bruckheimer production". If asked how I would define the phrase "wasted potential", I would say "Look at a Jerry Bruckheimer production". Bruckheimer's productions are almost always box office shots, but almost always receive critical criticism. Above my head, I can only think of AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and A REVERSE BLACK, achieving many critical acclaim. <br /> <br /> Even CRIMSON TIDE has received some sorrowful critics' success, it is certainly one of Bruckheimer's best films that unfortunately does not say much. The problem I had is the scenario on which the story is based: the Russians are fighting the Chechens and the conflict spread throughout Russia, leading an ultra-nationalist Russian to take possession of a nuclear missile base and threaten the West if it interferes. Perhaps the end of the cold war had everything to do, but I found this setup very unconvincing. It is not helped by some errors in geography such as the French aircraft carrier Foch in the Mediterranean (wouldn't it be the Foch positioned better in the Black Sea?) Or that the exhibition newsreel consists of films familiar with conflicts from the Balkans, the first Gulf War and even Vietnam . Once again the adjective "Very unconvincing" crept into my mind. The story gets a little better when the real story - a battle of wills concerning orders between a nuclear submarine commander and his number two - gets underway. Director Tony Scott does his best as the cast does, but the problem still lies in an unconvincing scenario. The worst thing is that if this had been done in the mid-80s when WW3 was a real possibility - Nay chances - this movie would have terrified me, but after the end of the cold war it had the dangers of nuclear war, which means that CRIMSON TIDE has little impact
