This short parody can be found on Elite's Millennium Edition DVD of "Night of the Living Dead". Fortunately I could never see it. Changing zombies with bread seems like silly and harmless fun on paper. Running is a different matter. This brief didn't even provoke a laugh from me. I never thought of saying this, but "The night of the dawn of the bride's son of the return of the revenge of the terror of the attack of evil, mutant, alien, eaten, chained meat, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D "was a VERY better parody and not nearly as lame or boring. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
