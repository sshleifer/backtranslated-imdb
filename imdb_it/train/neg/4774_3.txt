I'm not sure the filmmakers were following a Saw or 12 Angry Men movie (people putting the facts together to get the truth). Whatever it was, it was hurt and not worth looking at. <br /> <br /> I don't watch films for blood and blood, but since this film had very little to do, it should have shown the actual killing of more. Most were off-screen, minimizing the horror we had to feel for death. <br /> <br /> It also annoyed me that the policeman was among the victims; involuntarily contributed to the innocent young man who went to prison by accepting the planted evidence (provided by MJH) in the evidence room. (And MJH would not be a solicitor, he had access to those evidence - taking it out and putting the wrong evidence back - anyway, so wouldn't he need the cop's help?). The others, although they often did not realize that he was this particular person, were still playing more important roles in his final death. The arms dealer should have known that his guns would be used for evil purposes. The insurance guy rejected an obviously needy person, etc. But the cop's crime seemed minor in comparison since he didn't know exactly what he was doing. The filmmakers could have gone a step further and made him the one who encouraged MJH to put the evidence, which would have made him more guilty. And MJH is screaming that he (the cop) took her in that mess doesn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> It would have been more intriguing if every person died in a way that offered others a clue as to why he / she was there and deserved to die. The insurance guy, for example, could have had the questions he had rejected in his throat, so he choked them; the eastern woman could have had her eyes torn off because it was a false testimony, etc. Yes, more violent than the death of the gun, but more interesting. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was not witty, there were no twists, and the ending was one of the worst (if not the worst) I've ever seen. The final beat three stars from my rating. <br /> <br /> The actors did a decent job, especially considering the garbage lines and the reasons they had to work with. <br /> <br /> Overall, a waste of time.
