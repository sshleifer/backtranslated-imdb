The late 1980s saw an inexplicable eruption of supernatural horror films set in dark penitentiary settings. "Prison", superbly gritty and moody, by Renny Harlin got the fiery hoosegow ball; was immediately followed by "The Chair", clearly inferior, "The house of death" by John Saxon, pleasantly trash, the passable psychic image "Destroyer" and this horribly limpid and lethargic exercise in a hopelessly comatose tedium. <br /> <br /> The usual boring collection of horribly foiled student chowderheads, led by unbearably tormented Alex (the infamous Nicholas Celozzi) goes to Alcatraz Island to investigate the bizarre circumstances surrounding the sudden gruesome death next rock star Sammy Mitchell (blandly played by Toni Basil of "Hey Micky" fame). Alex's brother becomes possessed by the evil demonic spirit of a vicious cannibal cavalry commander of the US Civil War and continues the planned murderous madness, thus forcing poor Alex to overcome his passivity and take a stand against this macabre specter. <br /> <br /> Although dazzlingly photographed by Nicholas Von Sternberg, with some beautiful sets of blood pieces and a quantity of ghostly atmosphere (the film was shot on location in the ruined rusty ruins of Alcatraz Island) , "Slaughterhouse rock" does not cut it as a solid and effective fear characteristic. This is largely due to the cleverly collected and hateful characters of collegiate smartalecks, a cloying and witty group, whose funny antics prove to be rather grotesque than amusing. The flat acting of a decidedly uninterested cast hurts even more, with playtime buddy "Playboy" and the undisputed pretty blonde girl, supreme Hope Marie Carlton, who particularly irritatingly imitating Linnea Quigley as a token oversize nymphomaniac child. Directed by Dimitri Logothetis shows a pinch of eye-catching visual style, but the tone is irregularly hinted between grim seriousness and nonsense, horribly sophomoric silliness, and, more damagingly, the sloppy, inconsistent, overly complicated and ultimately confused script of Ted Landon fails miserably in developing the internal logic necessary to make the far-fetched story even remotely plausible. In other words, this skunk can sadly make 90 minutes look like an atrociously grueling movie prison sentence.
