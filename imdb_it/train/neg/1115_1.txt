We saw it on the shelf of the local video store, I saw "Coppola" in the credits and I got excited. That was the only time this film aroused interest. I could never tell if it was an attempt at a humorous film that failed miserably, or an attempt at a serious film that failed miserably. In general, the entire production seemed incredibly amateur. The sound in particular was absolutely terrible, especially in the scenes shot in the small bar; the dialogue was so trivial in parts that it was incredible. Very disappointing.
