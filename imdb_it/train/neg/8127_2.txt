Currently, this film is listed on IMDb as the 42nd worst movie ever made - and that's exactly why I rented it from NetFlix. However, I am saddened to report that the film, although bad, is not bad enough to deserve to be on the list of the 100 lowest films ever made. I have personally seen at least 100 films worse than this. Hardly a brilliant recognition, but it has not respected the expected level of horribleness to be included in this infamous list. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew on their late honeymoon (by the way they too are married in real life). He is a bat-obsessed doctor and insists on going to a nearby cave. Once there, they behave very, very, very stupidly (a hallmark of a bad movie) and they are soon bitten by a bat. According to this film, bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the United States - both are not real at all. <br /> <br /> Strangely, after being bitten, the man does not even bother going to the hospital !! The first thing on anyone's mind (especially a doctor) is to get medical help immediately, but not this boob. Soon, he is having seizures - yet he IS STILL not interested in seeking help! Once again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in the history of cinema !! <br /> <br /> After a while, he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital. But it's too late and his attacks become more violent and he starts killing people to suck their blood. When it is completely obvious to everyone that the man is a crazy war machine, his wife (who, like her husband, has a grapefruit for a brain) refuses to believe that it is dangerous - even after she attacks people, steals an ambulance and runs off-road police cars !! <br /> <br /> Now most of the time Moss is going through these episodes, his eyes moving back and he looks like a normal person. Strangely, however, a couple of times he developed bat hands and towards the end they used some nice prostheses on him to make him look rather like a bat. If it had been really messed up, the film would have deserved a 1. <br /> <br /> Eventually, in a turn that barely made sense, the wife inexplicably turned into a mad maiden and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff. The way all this was organized was a mystery, as was Moss and McAndrew's belief that this film would somehow help their careers - although both had reasonably long careers on TV playing a few roles from the 1974. <br /> <br /> very stupid The plot is stupid and makes no sense and relies heavily on people who act too stupid to be real. It is not a good film at all, but neither is it one of the worst films of all time. <br /> <br /> NOTE: For some reason, IMDb shows the graphics for the three IT'S ALIVE DVD sets and is two sequels to the web page for THE BAT PEOPLE. While THE BAT PEOPLE was seen with the title "It's Alive", the two films are not at all related. It's easy to see the error - especially since both came out in 1974, but the film I just reviewed was played by Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew and the other film starring John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.
