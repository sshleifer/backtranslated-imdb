I'm a big fan of low budget horror movies like this one, come on! This must be the worst piece of monkey that S @ # t has ever seen! I ignored the reviews posted on this site thinking it would fall in my taste for horror, but I got bored and turned off. Let's see: <br /> <br /> The wardrobe: Made up of cheap cameo dresses and painter dresses from the home depot. The masks were made from what looks like tin foil. <br /> <br /> The Gore: The Gore was pretty good, I have to give it. But the burning moon of Ittenbach was better for a low budget film. <br /> <br /> Acting: it was horrible! I didn't care about dubbing. I find this humorous as in "Premutos" by Ittenbach (excellent film). The fighting and action sequences were poorer. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Don't watch any of Schnaas's films. There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with films of the same blood and material. Check Press, House of Blood, Schramm and the Nekromantik.
