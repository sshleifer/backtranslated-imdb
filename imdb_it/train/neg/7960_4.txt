I rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a child. I arrived downstairs early one morning, I started watching HBO and The Raft (segment 2) terrified me well. This time, I still liked The Raft, although I couldn't say if it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good short. The other two segments were complete garbage. I can't believe that a producer somewhere paid to do this stuff. All I realized looking at this was ruining an extra childhood memory. Creepshow 2 will now join Rad among my list of contaminated childhood classics. 4/10
