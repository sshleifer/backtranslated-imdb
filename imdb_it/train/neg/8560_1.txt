What time we live when someone like this Joe Swan - whatever he is considered a good director ... or even a filmmaker! Where are the new crop of directors with brains AND talent ??? We need them wrong, and to hell with Mumblecore! <br /> <br /> This film is about nothing, just as the characters in the film mean nothing. It is this horrible, the so-called Gen Y, full of bored idiots, some of whom claim to be filmmakers without bothering to learn anything about craftsmanship before shooting. Well, Orson Welles was a director. John Huston was a director. Fellini was a director. Dreyer was a director, etc. Current films such as these show how stupid young people are, the so-called "directors" can be when they think they go out without a script, without direction, without thoughts, without a legitimate "camera" (all shot horribly on DV), no art of editing, nothing at all, means "rebel" or "advanced" film. No, it's called ignorance and laziness or just pure masturbation of the cinema (and in fact there is an in-your-face "gunshot", so be ready). <br /> <br /> Watch the first movies of any independent "indie" director: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee, or Herzog ... no one has made anything boring and aimless like this, however Swan - whatever the hell, he is still going to SXSW every year and hailed as a kind of brave, new talent. It's rubbish! I can't imagine anyone like this, and all that this so-called director has done (everything I saw) is just as bad (the newer things clearly done to attract a more mainstream audience, one of the sitcom calls). Be careful, unless you are a friend or family member of those involved ... come to think of it, if you are a family member or a friend would probably be ashamed to see a family member or friend in such situations compromising. . <br /> <br /> total garbage. This is not art. This is the exact opposite of it.
