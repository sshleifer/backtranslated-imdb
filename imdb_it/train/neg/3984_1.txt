I saw this movie a few years ago, on the BBC, I saw it. Such as? I don't know, this is the way up there in the "so bad and good" charts Kidman, Baldwin and Pullman have to shudder when they see it now. I think Woody Allen would have worked miracles with the extravagant plot, and with Baldwin's part it could have been played with taste by Leslie Nelson.it was up again tonight I tried to watch it again but life is too short. the few minutes I watched was for the beautiful Nicole that was so hot for 93, did Baldwin ever make a good movie? Pullman played with his title in the "cute but dim" character that the F-word came out of his mouth when the lady of "verbal" wrong as a detective accuses him of murders so wrong. feel good away
