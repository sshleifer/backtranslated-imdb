This film is the worst I've seen in the last 5 years. It is surprising how brilliant actors like the two protagonists of this film have agreed to act in such a useless garbage peace. The film is rape / beating and revenge genre. The couple went to party and on the way back they hit a deer and he went out to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys arrives. He didn't go to their car, instead he was kicked and beaten while she tries to run the engine of the car that cheats on her and she was raped by a gang. Then somehow he is in the house of his fathers and one of the villains is near her, so he took the gun and wanted to kill him ... Such a stupid scenario! Bellow Hollywood! She was against that vengeance but "She was raped" "They laugh at her" so she has to kill them all ... But once inside the house she was satisfied by pushing the top of the gun into the anus of the bad guys and she left while he went mad and performed the villain. Personally I think the director ran out of money before finishing this because the film ends before anyone is involved in this rape and group violence which is not a big surprise because the sponsor obviously saw this and wanted to get his money back. LoL This film is not even for people who like to watch rape because they won't see anything they are looking for ... This director should be banned ... It is to upset that this trash peace was made by British cinema that I personally like and this is why I saw it. Don't do it alone, you have better things to do than watch a silly scenario movie ...
