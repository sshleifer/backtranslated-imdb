Ooof! This was a stinker. Certainly does not fall "somewhere between Star Wars and Thriller". In all reality, it falls somewhere in the cracks of a Wham! videos and Captain EO, only with a small budget, and many more close ups of crying teenagers. Simon Le Bon focuses on the front and center, while the rest of the band tries to hide the fact that they stole their entire career from the last 3 Roxy Music albums. Short clips from Barbarella do not add anything. Avoid at all costs. (However, I liked the part when they played "Hungry Like The Wolf" but why was there a tiger lurking in the audience that turned into a woman painted with tiger stripes? I mean, they're not singing "Eye of the Tiger "or 'Hungry as the tiger' is a wolf! Whatever.) A DVD of Duran Duran's 80's videos probably deserves a look for nostalgia
