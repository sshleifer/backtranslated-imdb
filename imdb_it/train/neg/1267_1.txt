Why me? Why should I be subjected to such a mess of what could have made an interesting plot ?! At least if I can warn other people, it will be worth it. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this horrible film for a university course. Otherwise, I would have looked at the synopsis on the back of the thing and I would have been free. The film was slow, had PAINFULLY little character development, and focused on the idea that a creepy little white man can get cool if he crashes with an LA-style token. <br /> <br /> If you want to test the stereotypical feeling of dizzy superficiality LA - watch the movie. Note, however, that this film does not DEPICT what we came to think of as an "LA lifestyle", is a wonderful example of the products that arise from it.
