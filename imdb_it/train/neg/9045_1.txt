This film started with a semblance of plot, then abandoned it for an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story. It was impossible to get engaged to this movie. This film is a bunch of very cynical junk made by some people with animation skills but totally devoid of creativity or narrative skills. It's a terribly bad effort coming from a large studio. Clearly there are problems with morale and motivation at Disney, not to mention a complete lack of supervision and quality control. This management has allowed this film to see the light of day that speaks of their incompetence and despair. This film joins my short list of "the worst movies of all time".
