The only thing that came to my mind after seeing this braggart, I would never have had the time when I looked at this again. If you want to see Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn try and earn what must have been then, payments in advance for a vacation home will stay tuned. The wooden acting, the poor special effects, the only comic highlight was while our alien hero was in the female form and this ended as soon as she made her mandatory nude sex scene in b-movie within 30 minutes in the movie . The opportunity to have done what could have been a decent film disappears when Nicole Eggbert triggers the alien in a bar within 30 seconds, while Joe's policemen, military and public do not notice that the woman he drinks coffee, the cup handle is not used and he wears four jumpers at the same time. It must obviously be from another planet. Just where I want to be when this movie was shot.
