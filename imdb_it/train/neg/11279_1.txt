Words can't really describe how bad this movie is. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least he had good shots and an occasional good chin that caressed the moment here and there to keep you from nodding. This is simply ridiculous! Terrible script, bad direction, horrible acting and you know what? I can't think of one thing to recommend except that it's not too long. If you want 100 minutes of entertainment, book at the dentist and do some work on the canal - much more pleasant and with an excellent quality / price ratio (assuming you need it!). Incidentally, I need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review - PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. IT'S TERRIBLE!
