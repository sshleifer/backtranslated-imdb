I've written reviews for several episodes of MoH, and this is among the worst. An interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned since the end of the credits. If you look at people things that in real life would never entertain you ("let's check the basement!"), Then this is your show. Except it's not funny or fun, it's just annoying. <br /> <br /> The virus extension is never shown. I can very much ignore the fact that it concerns only men, since the resulting situation is very, very frightening. But then things deteriorate when the daughter leaves her father at home unbalanced, and eventually dies by her hand. The woman flees to the north and encounters a few dozen situations. So a kind of spirit or alien or something appears and saves it (things that make you go HUH?). Or something. So, she's curled up in the heat. The end. <br /> <br /> Bad. These directors are sending this tripe in.
