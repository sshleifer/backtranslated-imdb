I missed the beginning of this movie, which could explain why I didn't like it so much. On the other hand, I studied the fall of the Roman republic for years, so I know the story. Also, it could also be the reason I didn't like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has more historical inaccuracies than extras. Although it is so inaccurate that I don't think they made an attempt to make it correct, in which case it can be forgiven. The strange thing is that sometimes they do everything to be historically accurate that ends up getting confused. How to throw Antonio's wedding to Octavia, and then move it to the side two scenes later. Why even pull it up if it's no good for the plot and Octavia is never seen? And how to call Antonius with his real name (Marcus Antonius) in some scenes, and with his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes. <br /> <br /> Although the historical inaccuracies aside, the film may have been a fun watch if it wasn't for the main character. There is not an ounce of dignity in her. It is hysterical, dramatic and completely devoid of control over itself. Instead of being an intelligent and composed queen, Cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad case of premenstrual syndrome. 95% of this comes from poor acting, but 5% also comes from a bad script. Too many stupid and dramatic scenes are written in the script. Sometimes you didn't watch Antonius and Cleopatra, you were watching the immature versions of Dawson and Joey from "Dawson's Creek". <br /> <br /> If you want to see something about this period, look ... anything but this.
