I was a bit interested in this movie like a cannibal junk movie. I was completely disappointed. it was the same kind of disappointment I felt watching "Friday the 13th: Jason takes Manhattan". so much wasted potential! <br /> <br /> the opening scene is a decent catch of attention. then it stops. copious breasts and the egregious fashion of the 80s cannot help this film. the only things they eat near this island of cannibal monks are the piranhas! I'm not asking for the level of "cannibal holocaust" in cold blood, but I was looking for an economic and top notch exploitative gore. I had nothing. <br /> <br /> I found a couple of parts of the intriguing fighting scenes, hence the 2 stars. I don't think it's really worth the time to watch it, though. I could see it showing at a party where nobody cares about what's going on and you just want something in the background. but I wouldn't tell anyone, "oh man, you GOTTA see this movie." it is neither good enough nor bad enough to deserve much attention.
