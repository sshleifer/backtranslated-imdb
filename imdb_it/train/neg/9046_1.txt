Now for the truth, his plot very very weak - for a Walt Disney film his total junk. When robinsons appear, films everywhere, I was shocked at how scarce it was. It is as if "Alice in Wonderland" had gone wrong! They seem to have run out of ideas, some crazy rubbish together to try to get away with it - and they don't. After that, I sat there wishing for the end. My younger brother lost interest in half and was confused by the story. The characters are weak and after the robinons don't appear you don't care about the ending, you just want the movie to end. It is a film to forget and forget quickly. If you have free time, don't waste it.
