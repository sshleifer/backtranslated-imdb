This film is predictable; a pass from Vinnie Testaverdi is more predictable when he takes the ball for the Jets. One saw the finale arrive in the middle of the film. Politics reminds me of when I returned to the east. Many people know when the correction is in. I gave this four because of acting, but the story is lame.
