I was deeply disappointed with this film. I had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations. I expected a drama with a more intense character development. But this never happens in the film. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but it's not as good as some reviewers would have us believe. I thought it repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the film. I would rate his performance 6 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Acting: 6 out of 10 The direction is 5 out of 10. The script is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I canceled the film from my DVR to 70 minutes. in the movie. Very best movies out there ...
