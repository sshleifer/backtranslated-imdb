Forgive me for saying the obvious, but some movies are good and some movies are bad. Of course, there are extremes in these two broad categories. Movies like The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan and Star Wars fit comfortably into the good category. At the other end of the spectrum are those films that simply don't deserve to be mentioned by name. But sometimes someone produces a really painful film. A film that should be identified as a demonstration of how horrible a film can be. A film that is more than bad. One such film is Maiden Voyage. <br /> <br /> In short, Maiden Voyage is the story of a luxurious cruise ship hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil and intriguing ship owner. Of course, on board there is an all-American hero, complete with chiseled jaw and sculpted chest, which saves the day. <br /> <br /> This is a production that scours new depths. Everything is ugly. The acting, the direction and the so-called plot are incredibly rarefied. In short, it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate spectator. Even an American public would be annoyed by its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> I will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that irritated me about this film. However, his stupidest conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you are a bad hijacker and you are in a lifeboat open on a calm sea. You are in the company of the hero who holds a time bomb. Said hero throws the bomb at you and dives overboard. What would you do? I don't know about you, but I'll throw the bomb as far as possible into the sea. Not this guy. Watch our hero walk away and then try to disarm the bomb with unfortunate results (for him). Enough said. Such an end would deserve a mention on the Darwin Awards website and could also be a fittingly fitting conclusion to the lives of the production team.
