Too long a drama that is unable to make any real point. So she became an actress - so what? He has learned to love - a big problem. There is a certain eccentricity between the characters and in dialogues and situations, but the type that is bad for the film, making it often seem absurd. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix, the protagonist, speaks and behaves like a semi-retarded person, so there is no choice but to watch the film as if it were a retarded girl doing it in the theater world - who clearly it was not the intended point. We were told at the beginning (in that "Barry Lyndon" story) that he learned to hide his emotions, which certainly explains his autistic stone face, but the film suffers. In practice he walks like a zombie, and his success as an actress is not credible enough given his lack of emotion. Occasionally, the film had that deaf and sleepy atmosphere of a Dogma 95 movie. Is it one? I wouldn't be surprised at all. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix is ​​the sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the late River Phoenix. Nepotism rarely works. <br /> <br /> If you'd like to see my Hollywood Nepotism List, with over 350 images / voices, contact me by e-mail.
