I saw that movie and I was shocked! Robert Carlyle is not Hitler, he is a man who sadly tries to be Hitler. The film does not reflect the truth. In the scene Hitler hit the boy with his gun. Hitler had never hit anyone, would not have hit people with his fist, but with the fists of soldiers. To understand?? Another thing is: it's too obvious, that Hitler is that evil, he was smarter than shown in this movie. No German would accept him as a leader, because he can see that he is bad. So the real Hitler did not show his evil side to the people. <br /> <br /> Did any of you Yankee see the movie "Der Untergang" or "The Dawnfall"? this is a great movie, with fantastic actors. It's a German film. I think this theme of Nazi Germany should not be realized as a film by people who know nothing about Germany. People! Watch "Der Untergang": <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> <br /> It's a great movie about a very sad time for beings humans around the world.
