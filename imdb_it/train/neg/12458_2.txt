The premise of this film is so simple and obvious that only a Texas millionaire in vogue for the fumes of oil and whiskey would have a problem understanding it if someone had shouted it through the proverbial parking lot. In summary: the oil business is in league with the government (or Gummint if you prefer), the Gummint is in league with the despots of the Middle East, and the CIA is a unique group of double agents (inserting them) who wish to take any line that comes their way. The only people who are finished are the good ones, like Mr Clooney ("Bob"). Oh, and terrorism is the result of the poverty that globalization creates when evil multinationals persecute the world in search of a tasty acquisition or three. This really fits the profiles of the right-thinking perpetrators of 9/11. <br /> <br /> To Syriana this easy fabric of half-political truths and Hollywood holograms is aroused in a repulsive vermicelli of narrative threads that intertwine, turn and turn through the Gloopian convolutions of their own insignificance until the poor viewer is not left to the conclusion that: <br /> <br /> 1. the "director" (good joke) should never again be left near a camera <br /> <br /> 2. people like Clooney and Hurt may know how to behave, but surely they don't know how to choose a script <br /> <br /> 3. if you want to see a movie about corruption in big business and the state, go see "L'ivresse du pouvoir" by Claude Chabrol, who is perceptive, funny and brilliantly acted. <br /> <br /> Piffle sententious, empty, full of dozens, stretched to the ruin of the evening.
