Half Past Dead, starring Steven Seagal in the lead role, was an important B-hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just a direct sequel to the video, an action movie without losing anything but with no ability to win anything. It's less fun than the first: in all respects. But it is also worth a look. If you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; if you also like watching the former WWE stars on the screen or even if you love watching sequels, even if they are directed or not. <br /> <br /> Kurupt did a good job, Bill Goldberg was below average, I think it's not done for the job. Kurupt is a good comedian, I say. The rest did the job, but nothing extraordinary, nothing to say. <br /> <br /> Technical details, well, a production made by Sony can't be great. Cinematography was a disaster but the general direction was acceptable. However, look at it only if you want. If you look, you will lose nothing. But if you don't ... well, you won't lose either.
