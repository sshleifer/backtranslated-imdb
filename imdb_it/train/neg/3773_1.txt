When people ask me what is the worst movie I've ever seen? It's not even close to the MST3k level riff or midnight night vision in a theater, or even as a late-night Disney channel filler. The only time I ever wanted to go to Disney World (or Disney / MGM Studios in this case) was to take Dick Tracey's jacket from the mannequin, tear it to shreds and throw it down the throat of the tour guides saying "Eat this! Eat this ungodly coat of darkness !!!" I've never been so angry with a movie, not even with "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" or "Flash Gordon". Do you want beautiful colors and cinematography? It's not here, honey. Reviewers continue to say "oh, but that sounds like a comic book", well, for me, it's the color of a Gordito after several weeks in the sun. Even fun. Beatty wanders around this landscape by jumping and talking to his watch, himself, and occasionally to other actors, hoping that someone will tell him what time the sequel will begin. To be honest, I've only seen this movie once, but my pain threshold is that of a man, not a God.
