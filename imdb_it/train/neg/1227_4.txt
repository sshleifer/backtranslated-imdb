Although many people here praise this film, I must warn you. It has no logic. I think Basinger does a decent job at acting, but you can't make a thriller if there's a great lack of realism. <br /> <br /> This scene paints a good image for you of the film: while Basinger is chased by assassins thugs and decides to sit down and look at a picture he finds from his pocket. The image is of his daughter and we read "we love you mom". Who does something like that? What the eff? And believe me when I say it's not as stupid as some other scenes in the movie. Someone claimed that this is a "hidden gem". Well, I must disagree, this film has remained hidden for a reason. And it's not a gem. Oh, and please, I don't even want to start commenting on the red toolbox. My brain hurts: D Usually the lack of logic doesn't bother me if it's in small quantities, but this film is basically made possible only because of the lack of logic. But I keep giving him a 4 because, even if he is logically embarrassed, he has a certain mood that kept me looking up to the end. <br /> <br /> So if you choose to watch this, you know you've been warned
