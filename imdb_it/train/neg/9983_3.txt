This film is an impressive yawn that shows that Americans have not learned farce. Even when it's already written for them! The original film "Hodet Over Vannet" is an intelligent comedy of errors that I would rate 8/10. It is not just a linguistic translation, but certain absurd chains of events are skipped completely, depriving the film of its original and original farcical nature and turning it into a farce style "oops and go my pants".
