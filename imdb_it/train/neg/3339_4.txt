Barry, a medical transcriptionist has his mind eroding from his work coupled with memories of an abusive education at the hands of his stepfather, Barry (the original Leatherface Gunnar Hansen). It turns into madness and eventually a serial killer. Good (in the form of a homosexual) and evil (in the form of a bald dumb boy) battle for control of his soul. This film is marred by some scenes of humor and scenes of unintended humor. Not to mention that it's horrible or something else, only it is understood that it is known only for the fact that it is the fierce Bruce Campbell fan (of which I am one) who will probably see something he is involved or involved in some way. <br /> <br /> My Grade: C- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: commentary with Michael Kallio and Bruce Campbell; Second comment by Kallio and Sound designer Joel Newport; 'Hating every minute' a 17-minute documentary; deleted and extended scenes; alternative takes; outtakes, footage of the world premiere; Poster and photo gallery; Bios of talent; and theatrical trailer <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom: Screenplay in .PDF format <br /> <br /> 2 Easter eggs: highlight the eyes for a laughing out (left eye) and a minute of nothing, but a real Easter egg (right eye)
