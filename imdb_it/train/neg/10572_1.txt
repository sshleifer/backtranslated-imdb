*** SLO SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> A 15-year-old hunchback boy kisses a beautiful fifteen-year-old and finally has sex for the first time. After the act, he lays on the bed with her without touching her. The next day he concludes that he doesn't really like sex and doesn't want to try again for at least a few years. <br /> <br /> This is apparently a good start for a teleplay on a boy who discovers his homosexuality, or perhaps a medical drama about a post-pubescent teenager with a severe hormone deficiency. <br /> <br /> However, as the plot develops, a story emerges of a 15-year-old father who is supported and encouraged by his overbearing mother. <br /> <br /> At one point, his mother preaches to his co-workers that they are not as understanding as they could be, "Every step in this, my son was amazing ... I have never been prouder of him ... "<br /> <br /> The elder sister of the young father, who is otherwise cold towards his brother, starts to show pride in his brother," You've been okay this, "while she gives him a warm encouraging embrace. <br /> <br /> The fifteen year old father wants to be a father. He wants to be a parent. <br /> <br /> Why not? We see the "new" child a few minutes after birth: he seems to be a healthy and happy 4 month old child. Just like children were born on TV in the 60s and 70s. <br /> <br /> Once the young father is a parent, he has found happiness. He insists he will change the dirty diaper. We see the genuinely happy 15-year-old father holding his baby while the careful mother of the teenager's body is reaching its climax. Fade to black.
