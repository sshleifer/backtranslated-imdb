** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> This is a BAD movie. Seriously. Acting in an absolutely horrible way, the sound effects are terrible and the plot is terrible. But hey, it's so bad it's fun to watch it! The script is so bad that it's fun! You just have to shudder and laugh at lines like "I guess that's what you call CROCTEASING". while the women flash the crocodile breast. I mean, come on this is fun because it's so bad! He has such horrible jokes that they are funny! But after a while it becomes just how the movie turns into shit. I really started falling asleep. Trust me, though, the plastic foot that treads the leaves and the constant belly of a crockery make you laugh for a long time. Although I must say that he had an interesting part when the croc tore him in half and he hung there for a while to figure out what to do. Heh heh movie without brain, which must be nominated for the MST3K line !!
