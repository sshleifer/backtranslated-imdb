This movie is NOT fun. It takes only the nerd stereotypes of D & D and amplifies them. All the main characters make less than 30k a year, they all live with their parents, they are all socially retarded and have no luck with women. The jokes are horrible and unimaginative, like two of the players being beaten by a black dwarf because one of them had a KKK hood (it was his magician's costume) and the other had a John Rocker warm up (oh how strange , he's a nerd so he doesn't know about sport). You may need to be a high school student to find something fun. The poorly executed mockmuntaries are so painful to look at, but obviously extremely cheap to do. I'm sorry for Kelly Le Brock and Beverly D'Angelo. I guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties beyond their first.
