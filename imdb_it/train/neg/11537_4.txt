I've been following the progress of this movie for a while, so maybe I was expecting a little too much. I consider both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer good at what they do and were interested in seeing what Dan Reed could have invented, but unfortunately it didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> The problem lies in the fact that the film does not really seem to understand the genre in which it is falling and as such fails to impress the dramatic, horror and thriller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well is a little bit of all the crafts and master of none. <br /> <br /> The premise (like most revenge films) is simple, the couple meet and go out, something bad happens and they take their revenge is a simple formula and one that many directors have managed competently During the years. Unfortunately in this case it is as if Dan Reed thought: "It would be nice to do one of those vengeful films that goes a little deeper showing a more human side to all the characters and digging into their mental state in more detail. ... " Mistaken! There are also some key elements missing, in this type of film there is generally some kind of warning. To do this or this could happen element that increases the tension but there is nothing of the kind here. It simply happens, then nothing happens for an hour, then something interesting happens and then it ends. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of very tough competition in this genre and Dan Reed's hat for trying, I have no problem with his directing skills but in terms of writing ... I would say next time he should stick to the formula for the type of film he is making, instead of trying to be too smart and he will have a quality movie on his hands.
