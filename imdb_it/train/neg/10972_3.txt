This was not a Trainspotting or a Guy Ritchie movie. He was a great wannabee. He wanted to be a scratchy, nervous, nervous film that talks about urban life, but it's more of a jerky, messy camera. It is much easier to imitate something else than to create a true story with real characters. From the beginning, I didn't care about the characters or where they were involved. They always hit, pissed or cried each other. Only, there was no substance in what they were doing. The dialogue between characters is thought to be fashionable, revealing, instead it comes out trivial, and one scene after another is predictable. I know there are spectators out there who really enjoyed this movie, so I could be wrong.
