This budget-hungry Italian action / sci-fi hybrid features David Warbeck as a Miami reporter chosen by the ghosts of the Atlantis people (!) To stop an evil businessman (Oscar nominee John Ireland) from use of a telepathic fetus grown using spores from an asteroid to rule the world. Do you have all this? Despite such a foggy plot, this is actually rather boring and the ATLANTIS RAIDERS take it with contempt. Honestly, the most (intentionally) creative thing about this film is the slight reworking of Herbie Hancock's theme BEVERLY HILLS COP for the opening titles. The most unintentionally creative bit concerns a scene in a laboratory that is inexplicably shown twice one after the other. Did the director Alberto De Martino want to put all the vanguard in the twilight of his career? I was going to declare Ireland's worst film on his resume, but then I saw SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS listed there. I would also like to state that I am probably the only person in the history of the world to do a dual function of this and HERTCOCK's VERTIGO.
