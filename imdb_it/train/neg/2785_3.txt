I know that some films (I mean: European films), which are bad films, are considered as great films by certain "critics", just because they are not American. I saw the 8.1 IMDB score for this movie and noticed the fact that this was selected for some big festivals. Don't be fooled! Unless you're one of those people who likes nightmarish movies like this, and who later call it fantastic art, jump! The film contains one hilarious scene after another (a similar Italian film, I appeared in my mind, the terrible I PREFER THE NOISE OF THE SEA (I prefer the sound of the sea)). The problem with these films is that they are not just boring, like some other strangely praised films, but they play almost like a field. I mean, let's face it, the acting is horrible (I mean: soap-opera level), the story has no surprise (this has been done countless times before, linking different plots: SHORT CUTS, MAGNOLIA, PLAYING BY HEART, only much better) , not a realistic character inside (some real observers along the way, they notice the hilarious zombie daughter), and so on and so on. <br /> <br /> What's more, the film is 135 minutes long (count it!) for a long time, and eventually the director opens his box of sentimentality. After a film with dialogues and scenes so hilarious that made the audience at the screening a preview of laughing at so much incompetence, well ... This is an insult to the cinema, and receives only high marks because it happens to be in "another" language , in this case Spanish. Strange world in which we live ... 3/10
