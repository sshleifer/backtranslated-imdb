Tony Scott has never been a great director, but every movie he made after "Crimson Tide" seems to take him one step closer to being the worst irreversible today (Michael Bay could fall into the same category, but at least his great, epic mute and delirious entertain on a primarily perverse level). And like other exaggerated Hollywood biographies ("De-Lovely" and "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind", for example) that tell the story of pretentious, overvalued or overly superficial figures that give an aura of "mysticism" to a prosperous society juicy details behind the scenes, "Domino" is a film that starts with a small potential and downloads that infinitesimal figure before the sign of sixty minutes. With a projection time of 128 minutes, the film feels twice as long and spends time with characters so odiously superficial and forgettable (unlike the superior "Rules of Attraction", Scott's attempts to blur the judgment ironically, thanks to Domino's complacency, the rich voice of self-awareness only draws attention to the incredulity of the film's bat) becomes an act that only masochists might find pleasant. History? Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley, with his cretin and his cheeky appearance) is tired of her beauty, is sick of the superficial lifestyles of the rich and famous in Los Angeles and accuses the big bounty hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez to learn a more exciting profession; along the way, there are double crossings, shootings, media attention (courtesy of an ironic Christopher Walken, who phones in his brand sleazebag), and ridiculous hints of romance. Scott cuts the film together into segments that rarely last more than a few seconds, increasing the resolution to make the film a neon nightmare that is frankly unpleasant to look at - if Scott has the opportunity to frame an image, ghost, or distort it into somehow, it will; but all this sticky stylistic overload overwhelms that little plot, characterization and suspense of the film (not to mention its value, er, "entertainment"). Most of the characters appear to be despicable or stereotyped, often both (note the unbearable segment of several minutes in which an African American introduces a new list of racial categorizations on "Jerry Springer"), and I am surprised to want everyone to get the "queue "end of our protagonist's currency by the end. "Domino" is total and unchanged garbage - any interest in this individual Scott hoped to inspire his audience, gets lost in a sea of ​​neon claims that induce migraine in a few minutes.
