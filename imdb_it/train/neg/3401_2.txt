I rented this movie after hearing about the fact that it was not accepted for an Academy Award, but after seeing it, it's easy to see why it wasn't like that. Despite the beautiful photography, the film is incredibly slow, despite having virtually no storyline. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a guy trying to come to terms with the death of his parents in what he may or may not have had was an accident (the film is never clear on this), and like his grandfather he used to tell him stories. Fairy tales contain the only elements of interest in the plot, but they are very short and do not seem to make any sense. <br /> <br /> The first fairy tale in particular concerns a boy who tries to get a flower to his dying girlfriend to save her life, but the boy delays tasting the flower first to make sure the result in him is not poisonous , being a few seconds late to save his girlfriend, his grandfather declares that the moral is that the boy was too impatient, but it makes no sense because it was the perseverance and the slowness that led to his failure. Perfect metaphor for this movie really. <br /> <br /> The photography of Skye is beautiful, but then Stardust, which was published this year, is another film about fairy tales filmed in Skye and wonderfully photographed - and is infinitely better than this.
