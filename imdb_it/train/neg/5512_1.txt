Put a DVD of this film in a time capsule, and it will certainly illustrate for future generations a perfect example of what guarantees the minimum rating on a scale of 1 to 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Bill Cosby and Ray Romano were the first - on the charts and with tens of millions of earnings per year - with their television series'. Yet everyone has not been successful in the big screen offers. This is also true for other TV personalities - perhaps because many of the stories presented for two hours seem more suited to a 10-minute, or at most, 22 or 23-minute drama during a half-day. time schedule. <br /> <br /> This movie, however, does not have a single element that could take two or three minutes of time on MAD TV, SNL or anywhere else on a screen or a stage. > <br /> The date of origin is listed as 2002, but the release date - only for DVDs - is shown as 2004. It was also shot shortly before the death of Rodney Dangerfield, so its only saving value is probably that has leased a few hundred thousand dollars for his heirs. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of it, but I found it when I turned on my set and frankly I was fascinated. Some films are so terrible as to evaluate a sort of maximum evaluation in reverse - so bad that you can move the dial backwards to 9 or 10. "Plan 9 from Outer Space" is the best example - and Bruce Jenner / Village People's opus, "Can not Stop the Music", is another. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this film is not up to par. Although Rodney's previous works (as well as some of his castmates) were not "Citizen Kane" or "Casablanca", there were many moments of humor and a story that provided at least a minimum of interest.> <Br /> Unfortunately, this presentation does not seem to possess even a minute or two of such material.
