what kind of sh * t is this? Power rangers against Freddy? It was watchable and as good as the first film in the beginning, but on the part where the protagonists become superpowers in their dreams, it started to become childish. This sh * t should have been rated PG or PG-13 rather than R. I expected to see very mature things but it was only 1/3 of the movie. The rest is for small children. It also focuses too much on Christianity. I know that Freddy is a demon but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons. Why must Christianity always be? This is a total orientalism and full of superiority of white / western men. Don't watch it, show it to little kids who love power rangers.
