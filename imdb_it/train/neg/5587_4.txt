In addition to his "Tarzan" series, the prolific Edgar Rice Burroughs has written many other books, although, apart from the popular "At the Earth's Core", some of them have been shot. An exception is the novel entitled "The boy and the lion", brought to the screen as "The Lion Man" (1936), an over-talkative, static, old-fashioned, slow and rather boring film, despite having been filmed in places royals in the desert. In reality "film" is the wrong word. The narrative does not move, but proceeds at a snail's pace in a sudden series of jerks. For example, at least five characters receive elaborate opening scenes and then disappear. Even more frustrating for the avid movie fan, it's the characters that make an impression (like the girl who does Hall with drugged wine) but are staged by players who are not accredited! Accredited actors generally come out worse than strangers. An exception is the Australian actress Finis Barton, who provides a good account of the kidnapped harem girl who saves the young Master Fata. Of course, most of the cast is burdened by a terrible King James dialogue that must be heard to be believed! But the way to interpret this garbage is ironic, a stratagem that seems to have never occurred to anyone of the cast of talentless actors. Perhaps the director J.P. McCarthy scotched that idea. However, it is sad to see the beautiful Kathleen Burke forced to barter with people of the caliber of Richard Carlyle (her father) and Jon Hall (her suitor). Of course, Mr. Hall delivers his lines with a lighter margin of conviction than Mr. Carlyle, but it's not a recommendation.
