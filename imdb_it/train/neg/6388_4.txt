The Brothers Quay brothers are directors, judging by conventional thinking, they should have remained faithful to the short films. I personally really liked their first feature, the Institute Benjamenta, but judging from their second job, The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes, I am willing to agree that they don't come close to matching their past genius to feature films. Piano Tuner is, without a doubt, a wonderful film to watch and often to listen to. Unfortunately, it is painful to face the border with his convulsive narrative and his glacial rhythm. Reading the synopsis of the plot, it seems like a good story. But the Brothers fail miserably to bring him back to life. One thing should be considered to completely avoid in the future: dialogue. My God, it's terrible here. A huge bust.
