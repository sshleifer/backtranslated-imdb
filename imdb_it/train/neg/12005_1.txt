We have all seen some epic without end in our times, but this surpasses them all! The film is so long and so slow that, just to put things in perspective, I felt much older when I left the cinema, which I inserted. At almost 4 hours of duration, it could have been rather transformed into a serial-serial. <br /> <br /> What begins as a promising comedy slowly loses its rhythm. Nikhil Advani has woven the plot around 6 love stories and cannot do justice to any of them ... There is no interconnection between them to start, and the links shown in the last 20 minutes seem to be forced to connect the history. <br /> <br /> The situation is worsened by Silly's dialogues (most of them repeated in Hindi cinema for years) and a stupid photograph. <br /> <br /> Priyanka does not realize that she actually needs to play a role rather than simply looking at the screen ... A total waste of beauty without acting ability. <br /> <br /> And then there is noisy and fun Govinda, my twists and turns better than I am Akshay Khanna who continues to vomit at the top of her lungs to irritate the already tired spectators. <br /> <br /> Only a good part in the film is the love story of John & Vidya and the acting / comedy of Sohail & Isha. But they are so good in their role that only these two couples could justify the film without affecting it with other groups of characters. Their brilliance is lost in the midst of other underlying plot lines. <br /> <br /> My hypothesis: the director was making two separate films (it could be more!) and some novice assistants mixed all the records, beyond a point of ordering them, so the director had no other choice for show everything as a single movie ... <br /> <br /> Look at it only if you want to test your patience !!!
