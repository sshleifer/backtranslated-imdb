I love the slasher movies of the 80s and I remember when "Silent Night / Deadly Night" was taken from our theaters, I was very disappointed, so I was very excited to see some of these on Fear.net. You better watch what I expected from these types of movies. The quality of the special effects was ridiculous by today's standards, the development of the character too long, but all in all it was fun to laugh out loud! <br /> <br /> The scenes in which he loses it because Santa Claus, aka dad, feels his mother and later when the crowd is actually shown as lighting torches - not twisting like in the 80s, but real torches ! - I really tickled my funny bone. However, the scenes in which he was controlling the children in his neighborhood gave me a disturbing feeling of a different nature. I also liked trying to figure out who these character actors were. It took me a while to understand that the protagonist was the adorable Brothers teddy bear.
