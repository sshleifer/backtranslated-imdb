Like all cult TV shows, there is a group of people who love The Twilight Zone so much that they evaluate virtually every episode as if they were the greatest shows EVER. While many of them are truly wonderful classics, the truth is that for every great episode, there were several that were mediocre and at least one that smelled. However, like the dying Trekkies, these Zone lovers insist that all of them are golden. In fact, this is what initially made me review some individual episodes of a couple cult series instead of the films I usually watch. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the worst episode ever made, nor is it among the very worst, it is poor by any reasonable standard. A widow observes a long procession of Civil War soldiers passing her home. In the end, an unexpected turning point is revealed and there is not much excitement or suspense here.
