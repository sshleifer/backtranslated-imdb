Normally I'm not motivated to write reviews. But this film was so atrociously painful that I feel I have to do it. I realized the predictably unpredictable plot, the lame acting and I laughed at moments that had to be tense. In fact, most of the audience seemed rather bored and talkative even in the "tense" moment of the film. Molly Ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production. Even the "twist" in the end was not. I have heard that the film was not taken seriously; but I could find little evidence of this in the film. <br /> <br /> The cut should have been left on the assembly room floor. Do yourself a favor and spend your time and money on something else!
