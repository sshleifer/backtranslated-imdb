First of all, I want to say that this film is more worthy of the four stars I evaluated. I gave him four stars because for me this 86-minute film always seems to be two and a half hours and it's not engaging enough to take it all. However, "The Big Alligator River" (the title my DVD calls it) is better than your average nature does in films. <br /> <br /> A tourist resort in the jungle of south-east Asia is just opening up and employing the natives while trying to manipulate wildlife around. Mother Nature in search of revenge arrives in the form of the god Kroona, a giant alligator. But the creature is not the only thing tourists and main characters (a photographer and resort staff) have to worry about, the natives are massaged in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> This film is a pretty well done horror adventure / story with a good soundtrack and good direction. But the alligator itself, the main attraction of the film, is obviously fake. Some of the close-ups of the jaws are good, but it should be all we need to see. Some of the distant underwater shots make it painfully obvious that what we're really dealing with is a squeaky alligator toy that you can probably find in a zoo gift shop. But the natives are credible, if not authentic. <br /> <br /> Probably not the film that will give you non-stop chills, if there are any, but shot and produced well enough to be mentioned. And like many movie creatures, this ends with an extremely high number of bodies. It also has a lot of beautiful jungle scenery. Acting is below par, but who expected it to be better, eh? <br /> <br /> Much, much better than its recent "Primeival" American counterpart but nothing to compare to "Jaws". But remember that it may not be engaging in some places.
