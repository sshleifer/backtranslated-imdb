You didn't see when harry met Sally, so avoid this. Not only will it make your head hit on the table because you can't make a good remake with Bollywood? but it also annoys you with the so-called funny moments in it. The charm of the film is missing. Ranee looks terrible. Saif tries to behave as if he were an actor devil. Even the plots that have been detected from the original do not seem effective. The part where they both bring their friends and hit a ticket simply doesn't look attractive. What can be more disastrous? you want to waste some money, this is what you can get. If not, put some dollars and look at the original. It's too good to miss it ..
