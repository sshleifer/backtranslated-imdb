Deep SH .. is more like it! Eels have just been drawn in the film. He thinks "The Incredible Mr. Limpet" meets "Leviathan". Very gaudy. <br /> <br /> No character or relationship development. The so-called "romantic" scenes that are very banal and predictable. An interesting idea, but a poorly written script and LOUSY special effects make it absolutely not to be missed!
