I love horror movies. I can also appreciate most of the cheese (face it, 9 out of 10 horror films of these times ARE cheeses), but this was simply ridiculous. A terrible acting, a terrible writing, completely empty and incredible characters (no Meisner actor here!) And a total lack of sufficient number of bodies. I wish I could SAVE the 79 minutes of my life that I just wasted. At least the Crook brothers are rightly called. The only good thing about the whole film was watching the Alicia Silverstone that wants to be punched in the face. How come this arrived at Sundance is completely disconcerting to me. Most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic, even for slasher film standards. I mean, COME! Who would rush out to get a cheap earring 10 seconds after a terrifying stalker just came out of their door? Boring.
