I saw it for the first time when it was chosen as a suggestion from my TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman and thought it might be interesting. Besides that, I'm a fan of Max Fleischer's work, and this started with the look of his 1930s comic book. With both, I thought it would arouse my interest. I was wrong. Only a few minutes and I had the fast forward button. I examined it in about 15 minutes, and thought it was so. <br /> <br /> Then I read some of the other reviews here and thought I wouldn't give them enough of a chance. I recorded it again and looked through it. There are 75 minutes of my life that I don't come back. <br /> <br /> I can't believe there are no more negative reviews. Personally, I think it's because it's difficult to reach the minimum of 10 line comments. How many ways are there to say it's a waste of time? <br /> <br /> The film appears as if it had been created by some middle-high level kids ready to outrage the world and think they could do it with breasts, bad words and make jokes. The characters are flat. The parody of "Swinging the Alphabet" is lame, essentially cobbling on the melody, passing through A - E, striking the obvious vulgarity of an "F", and then having no idea where to go. The journey through the gut to the intended landing does not work the first time, let alone the following. <br /> <br /> On the whole board, the whole movie is what you would expect from someone looking to "out-South Park" Stone and Parker without the ability to determine what is and isn't funny. This could be fun if you are tall. Otherwise, it is not.
