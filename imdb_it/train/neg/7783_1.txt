Hey HULU.com plays Elvira's horror movie in the late evening on their site and this movie is theirs under the name of Monsteroid, very funny to watch Elvira comment on this Crappy movie .... Have fun with bad movies. However this film has very little value except to see how badly the 70s were bad for Bad Effects horror films, Bad Dialog, just bad movies. Avoid this unless you want to mock it. While you're at HULU watch the other movies that are right now there are 10 episodes and some are pretty decent movies with good plots and production and you can see many in 480p if you have a good connection speed.
