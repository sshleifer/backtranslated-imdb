If that's all the Watchowskis have to offer in terms of a Matrix backstory, then I really have to question the claims of all the fans who believe that movies are destined to register at a deeper level. The second renaissance, while visually stunning and beautiful, is stereotyped by the plot and ridiculous. How many times have we heard the story of humans who rely too much on technology, humans too eager to wage war, humans who are basically destroying themselves? There is nothing new here. And I have another question. Considering the plot of the second Renaissance, doesn't this make the machines the good guys ?! The machines have been oppressed for generations by their cruel human submersible masters. They fight, conquer their freedom and try to establish a peaceful harmonious coexistence with humans, who reject them in favor of a total war, which the most intelligent machines naturally win. If this is the background, we shouldn't be rooting for Neo, we should be rooting for cars! The humans were cruel and oppressive, while the machines were brave and expected to be compassionate. Since I don't think Watchowski's intention is for us to favor machines over humans, I have to believe that the Second Renaissance was simply a misleading attempt to create a backstory.
