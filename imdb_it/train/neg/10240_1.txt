I love all kinds of movies, especially horror. That being said, Survival is not up to ANY advertising campaign surrounding it. <br /> <br /> I can't give you any points about originality. There is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes or redoing what others have done. He just became a cop for independent films that take us on a journey through the woods, a crazy killer, and lately, we have thrown ourselves into a crazy family. On these lines I have to compare it with Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn (although the turning point in that is obvious) and others. Survival is shortly reduced compared to comparable films. The plot was not original in any way. Some films manage to get away with a weak (and outdated) storyline with superb acting, special fx or a slew of other factors. Survivial has nothing to spend. If you do, note the following: The acting in the film never took off. I don't beat or blame the actors for this, nor for the director. Dialogue has been mediocre at best, and the actors involved have never shown (not saying NOT TO HAVE) the talent to make it. I mention 2 highlights. The protagonist of this film certainly has the appearance, but I seriously think he should consider more training before he is ready to bring a movie. Even the actor who played Greg had potential, but we never saw any of this (look at the movie to see why, you won't believe it ..). <br /> <br /> The grainy film. Ah yes, that little tid-film that has done magic designed to take us to the glory days of the "Grindhouse" movies. In today's movie, that has become a trick. It works or not. In this case it does not work. There are too many other flaws going on, so it ends up distracting from the movie, not adding it. That said, I think they did a good job adding that grain. This is a good quality grain. I think that with a different script, a better direction and possibly actors, they should try another attempt at "Grindhouse". They will probably do it outside. <br /> <br /> As for the technical aspects, in my opinion, they have never been able to agree with him. A better care could have been taken with audio (it seems to have been input directly into the camera, but there is nothing wrong with that) and for being shot on DV, it was too soft for my taste. <br /> <br /> This is all I have to say about this .....
