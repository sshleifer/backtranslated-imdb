If there is a hell, it contains a screening room where GRAND CANYON is playing again and again on an eternal cycle. It is hoped that the presence of so many wonderful actors - Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker - would help compensate for the presence of Mary McDonnell (whose penitence is to watch her films for eternity) ... But no. Apparently they injected those other actors with a serum made by McDonnell. The whole thing is pretentious, exaggerated, offensive (if you are deaf or know someone who is, prepare to boil your blood at the ridiculous TDD scene). GRAN CANYON is full of hateful and self-involved people, but it never gives us a reason to appreciate / understand / sympathize or even tolerate them. With rare exceptions, they are unbearable losers that the gene pool would be better without it. There is no plot to talk about, no development of the character (these people will NEVER develop), no break-out performance and most of the arched writing you've ever seen in a movie. The best thing about GRAND CANYON? His title. This is a great HOLE of a movie.
