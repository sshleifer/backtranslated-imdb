There are some bad movies out there. Many of them are pretty funny. "Criminally Insane 1" was one of those movies. So bad that it was fun and I had the value again. "Criminally Insane 2" must be one of the worst movies ever made and come from me, that's a lot because I'm not the kind of person who says the worst is the worst. But trust me, this was just terrible and running only 1 hour is too long an hour. <br /> <br /> The film has a rather incoherent plot, but who cares about the story when all you want to see is a big fat woman running around killing people because she isn't fed. Well, you don't see it in this movie, except for all the flashback sequences that come from the first one. The new plot could have been really fun with Ethel being sent to a house halfway and killing everyone there, but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the movie and by then you're already falling asleep. <br /> <br /> Camera work in this film is simply atrocious. This literally reminds me of something I shot with my friends when I was 15. Sound quality is something else, since you can't understand a word that most characters are saying. To give an example of how bad it is, entering a New York subway and trying to figure out what is being said above the speakers, this is what this movie looks like. Not that what they talk about anyway is important because the actors are as dry as a piece of dead wood. <br /> <br /> Now I know that to say that this is the worst movie out there is pretty tough but words can describe how bad this movie is. If you don't believe me, you see it yourself. 1/10
