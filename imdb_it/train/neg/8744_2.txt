I ended up watching this movie. I'm still not sure if I regret it or not. I felt like I was watching the film made by that group of film school students who didn't make the cut. It reproduces every imaginable Hollywood clich√©, while it scourges us with the message "Corporations are extreme evil". The subtlety of this film does not know. As for this, it even manages to provide its own spoilers. <br /> <br /> History seems to be the fantasy world of a computer nerd that has become reality. The protagonist is an attractive teenager with a girlfriend, yet he is a programming genius and an apparent hacker (I think), among many other nerd-fantasy-like-true elements that you will have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Also, I should have known it would be a z movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... it tends to be a good tip. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend one, I'm afraid.
