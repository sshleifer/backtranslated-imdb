Ernst Lubitsch's final film, completed by Otto Preminger after Lubitsch's premature death during production, is a playful act of refinement and stupidity, romanticism and music, fantasy and dramatic costume. In a 19th century castle in south-eastern Europe, a countess falls for her sworn enemy, the head of the Hungarian uprising; she is helped by her ancestor, whose painted image magically takes life. Betty Grable, with a long blonde wig adorned with flowers, has never been more beautiful, and her songs are very pleasant. Unfortunately, this script (by Samson Raphaelson, taken from an operetta by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) is full of different ideas that fail to weave or entertain. The results are good-looking, but not absorbent. * 1/2 from ****
