Amen to Magsel. There was a lot of confusion going on. First of all, how do you know which movie you're buying? Henry Cele is the protagonist of each of them. I bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries ... WHAT IS A LETDOWN !! It would have been a comedy but for the raped girl. David Hasselhoff (spell?) It's OK for popcorn TV, but it wasn't credible in this film (where was his English accent?) AND WHAT IS WITH THE STORY OF LOVE ??? The film was supposed to relate to the rise to military power of a young man - not the captain of the slave ship who stirs with the English girl in search of her father ... <br /> <br /> If I had paid more than $ 7 for this movie, I should call the police - because it would be a crime!
