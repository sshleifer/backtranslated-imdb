I was lucky enough to read the book before seeing the film. It was an epic of adolescence, a dream of summers gone, a great potential indie film or a great economic drama. Somehow he ended up in the hands of a hack, who clearly took notes looking at Boogie Nights and Rushmore without actually learning anything. The script loses the flesh of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and eyebrow gags. I'm sorry for the actors, since the characters in the book were rich and textured, but reduced to embarrassing characters in the film. Mason Gamble is great when given the opportunity, as is Dylan Baker, but the remaining skeleton of the story looks like a villain after special school. Poor people = GOOD, rich people = BAD. <br /> <br /> Although it is worth seeing the Southern California beach where Gary Sinise parks his caravan destined for a bay in Delaware. <br /> <br /> It's a good book, but an embarrassing turn for the first time director Mills Goodloe. <br /> <br /> K.
