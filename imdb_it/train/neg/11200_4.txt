The good friends of the Webster Dictionary define Logophobia as the "fear of words". I could only be Logophobic. For no combination of words scares me more than when at the beginning of a film, the credits contain the words "Product, written and directed by:" and are followed by the name of a single individual. Think about it. There are carpenters, electricians and plumbers, but so few of all trades. Even the most experienced directors like Speilberg and Scorsese rarely take control of their films. But I was there, nestled in my seat at the theater, popcorn in my hand and about to watch the Order when they hurled me like a Nolan Ryan fastball, were the words "Produced, written and directed by Brian Helgeland" . Whoa! <br /> <br /> Being a movie buff, I knew Brian Helgeland. As a writer, his filmography in the last 10 years would have been represented in 1998 as the stock price of a dotcom company. There were as many unwelcome theaters (Assassins, The Postman, The Conspiracy Theory) for critical and award-winning hits (LA Confidential, Mystic River). They seemed to alternate ?? a good one, a bad one, so knowing that his latest film, BloodWork was one of the most wasted efforts in Clint Eastwood's career, I caught my breath and hoped for the best. In retrospect, I should not have exhaled. <br /> <br /> The order sees Heath Ledger (The tale of the knights of Helgeland), as Alex Bernier, a priest in an order known as the Carolingians, who is called to Rome when a priest is killed in circumstances that Arch Bishop considers it curious. Meeting with Father Thomas (also of the Order and wonderfully played by Mark Addy of Still Standings), they lined up to reconstruct the enigma left behind the premature death of the priest. <br /> <br /> Complicating things is a sub-plot involving Mara Sinclair (played by Shannyn Sossamon) who escaped from an institution that was the result of her attempts to kill Alex during an exorcism. Alex has feelings for Mara and for some reason, unbeknownst to the public, they travel together to Rome. <br /> <br /> Nary spends a good sleep and Alex is confronted by William Eden (Benno FÃ¼rmann) who claims to be an old Sin Eater. A Sin Eater, as we are told, are those who eat the sins of a dying individual when the church does not, thus allowing entry into Paradise. William, fortunately, is tired of a lifetime of healing and seeks Alex to take on his role and free him from his worldly duties. Alex is reluctant, but after the death of his new love Mara, Alex uses the Sin Eater ritual to save her and the transformation is complete. Alex then looks for answers to his many questions while Father Thomas reveals the Vatican's plot behind the approval of authority to his fellow investigator. <br /> <br /> The Order is not a terrible film, but it is terribly boring. There were ridiculous special effects and no connection with any of the characters. Even in the most dramatic scene - that of Alex walking on the dying Mara - she is pale and insipid and leaves us with no emotional response to the couple's difficult situation. Everyone seems to be speaking so quietly and emotionally that the flat lines of the film and the stinky salts could have been given to keep me from trying to take a short nap in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> So, Mr. Helgeland, I beg you not to try again. Share your vision with others and let the more experienced ones help you find your way in directions that are not so tight and selfish. Until then, there is nothing that emerges that shows that you are capable of anything more than a negative vote. Two stars. <br /> <br />
