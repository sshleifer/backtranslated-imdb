This film is a 90-minute Ramones concert with short periods of stupidity and utter boredom. What kind of high school is this anyway? <br /> <br /> Unless you are a big Ramones fan, DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT waste your time like I did. This is absolutely unwatchable from start to finish. This film should be called Ramone Fever. They all seem to like them in this film. There is no plot to find in this film. As for teenage comedies, you're scraping the bottom of the cane with this.
