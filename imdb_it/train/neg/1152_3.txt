I understand what he was trying to portray this film. Like the old ones they are often ignored and treated as a nuisance, which means that they end up feeling little appreciated and as if their lives were empty. <br /> <br /> I have no problems with this message, but I feel that it could have been put in a way that is not so painful to watch. I like a good art film, but when a film becomes too artificial (as in this case) the result is often frustrating. Including the shots of a person who slowly fills a suitcase that takes 5 minutes to try to make a point, but end up annoying the public. <br /> <br /> The female characters are very weak and in the end you simply want to tell them to pull it together. This is a film that you think you enjoy or appreciate a lot and certainly have its merits, but I was too frustrated to have ever recommended it to someone else. He could have a deeper message than other Roger Michell films (for example: "Notting Hill"), but at least this was a movie you liked to watch.
