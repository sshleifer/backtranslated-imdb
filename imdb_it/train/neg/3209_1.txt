I also saw this incredibly ugly piece of "anime" at the London Sci-Fi Festival. If you have to look at this thing, do it with a large audience, preferably after a few beers, then you might get some enjoyment from it. <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue exhilarating, presented in my mind is the introduction of Cremator. The entertainment is terrible. It is poorly designed and poorly executed. It may have been a good idea for the producers to have employed at least one person who was not colorblind. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else to say, this film is a failure on all levels.
