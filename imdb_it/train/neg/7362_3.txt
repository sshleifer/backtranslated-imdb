An average quality of TV movies, a story totally made up of religious fanatics (Ron Perlman, which gives the good name "I'm not just the president of 'Psychos R Us', I'm also a client.") Who gets control of a biochemical virus (think of the virus in the movie "The Rock"). Too bad for him that he is stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with bank robbers and government agents trying to stop him (led by Wolf Larson, incredibly delicate and funny, supported by Fred Dryer) along with the standard "in the place wrong at the wrong time "spunky female (the perennial insipid Erika Eleniak) and" lived like a wimp but dead as a last minute "male hero (Brandon Karrer).
