My roommate rented this movie the other night, so we watched it together. <br /> <br /> The first impression is actually positive, because the entire film is shot in this colorful, grainy, post-MTV texture. Fast sequences, cold angles, large camera moves - for the moment it feels like you're about to watch another "Snatch" for the moment .... <br /> <br /> When the plot actually starts at unfold, you start feeling like an overdose amphetamine. things no longer make sense. I hate to spoil the fun of watching it by distributing certain scenes, but then again, the film is so ugly that you're actually better off without looking at it. <br /> <br /> First you think it's a crime story told in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. MISTAKEN. This conversation does not provide any coherent narrative. Rather, Domino's lesbian runs into the character of Lucy Liu during the second part of the film, but throws the audience into further confusion. <br /> <br /> Then I thought that maybe it's a film about a rich girl but a dysfunctional fund that has become a tough bounty hunter. In any case, this is the message transmitted by the opening scenes. But after that the question of Domino's character is completely lost due to the criminal plot. So, in short, NO, this is NOT a film about the Domino character. <br /> <br /> Then I thought, it's probably the story of a robbery. A beautiful and bloody robbery. 10 million have disappeared, bounty hunters chase suspected thieves, the mafia are executed, hands are removed, Domino tries to break because this time they do not receive certificates of size, etc. But soon this impression is dissipated by another U-turn of the plot. <br /> <br /> This time we are faced with a sad story of an obese African-American woman who falsifies driving licenses at the local MVD and at the age of 28 seems to be the youngest grandmother. Lateesha stars in the Jerry Springer show, tries to publicize some new racial racial theory, and at the same time struggles to find the money for her sick granddaughter. <br /> <br /> What does this have to do with the main plot? URgh, well, nobody knows. Except that the director had to explain the audience in which bounty hunters will make their collectors available for 300,000. <br /> <br /> Then at some point you start thinking, "Oh, it's about our society and the way the media distorts things." There's a TV crew actually going around with bounty hunters and shooting violently. Bounty hunters are also stuck with a group of Hollywood actors, who always complain about a broken nose and are dragged around for too many crime scenes. But NO, this is not a media film, they only appear sporadically throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In addition there are many other sub-plots: the crazy Afghan boy who decided to liberate Afghanistan, the love story between Domino and Chocco, the mescaline episode, the operation of surveillance of the FBI ... <br /> <br /> Can all the above mentioned things be packaged in 2-hour films? Judge for yourself, but my conclusion is clear: it's a real mess!
