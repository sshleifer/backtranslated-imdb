The film addresses the public thanks to Ben Stiller's charisma and J. Aniston's notoriety. We seem to have a recipe for a successful title here, but nothing positive in this film. <br /> <br /> Polly is very well played by Aniston, without a doubt. This is the kind of character that fits her perfectly. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller is the same annoying boy as "Meet the parents", but in this film the comic scenes are few compared to the above mentioned title. <br /> <br /> The script is very poor with nothing special. With these two well-paid actors things could go much better, but what can they do when there is such a poor story and script. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
