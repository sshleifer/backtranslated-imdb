Once upon a time there were some evil people who made a film about a guy who was shot in space, presumably to go to Saturn, but actually just for some footage of solar flares, and then he has a bloody nose, and before that you know, he is in a hospital bandaged from head to toe, and then an overweight nurse arrives with an unsuitable uniform that is eaten by the guy, whose alleged dissolution spreads everywhere but never seems to lose any mass, and then NASA, or at least one guy from NASA, gets angry and calls another boy to hunt him down, but the guy who sent to chase the melter must go home and get the soup first, and his strange wife has forgot the crackers, so he can't have crackers, and then he has to go out and find the guy that melts with a geiger counter, and this doesn't really work, so it really only follows the half-eaten traces of corpses, and then there's something on a or sheriff and two ugly old men in a lemon grove and a woman with a cleaver, some kind of industrial plant with unnaturally happy security guards, and since I can't tell you how the films end, all I can say is that Jonathan Demme is in somewhere with a guy with the stupid name of Burr DeBenning, and if there is any justice in the world all those connected with this movie died of a horrible and violent death and were unable to do more film, and the world lived WELL AFTER - THE END!
