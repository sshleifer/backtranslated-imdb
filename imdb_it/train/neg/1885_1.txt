If you are looking for a film that depicts the useless and boring existence of middle-class lives trapped in a network of non-communication and false ideals, then this is the movie for you. If you too are interested in what the film is about, you should probably look elsewhere. There are many movies that do this much better. For example, try some of Bergman's darkest films. The director thought that to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class he would have to subject the viewer to one painful and dull episode after another until the film eventually reached the tortuous and pathetic end. If you value your time, there are better ways to spend two hours, such as cleaning your home.
