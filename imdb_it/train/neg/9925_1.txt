This was the 30th Anniversary DVD for Blazing Saddles, brilliant in itself, but not this one. Nowhere did I see the name of Mel Brook here and I can guess why, it makes more sense not to be associated with this pilot. My dear, who would find it funny. Of course, there may be a race problem, but for me it wasn't fun, because it's just not fun. It's like the writers don't even try to be funny, just to cash in on being tied to Blazing Saddles. Did they expect this show to go on for several seasons when they made this pilot? Dishes, they didn't care. It was a fast-paced cow that thankfully didn't cash. I guess it's only useful for historical purposes, or just to show how Hollywood writers can be stupid and unimaginable.
