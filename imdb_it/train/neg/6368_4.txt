This is the last time I rent a video without checking in to IMDB reviews. The Limey is directed by Steven Soderbergh who also wrote the terrible Nightwatch with Ewan Macgregor and directed a trash film like Out of Sight with anti-talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a good actor and it's a pity he got involved in such a bad movie. There are frequent confusing changes that seem to make a last-minute decision to make up for the lack or the story, the filming and the simple common sense. This film does everything wrong. What were they thinking?
