I'm giving a 1 movie because there are no negative numbers in IMDb's rating system. this movie was horrible. It was played very badly, the story was poorly written, the action was incredible. I doubt that even the Salvation Army could fight as badly as the troops did in this film. I won't even write plot spoilers because the movie isn't good enough for plot spoilers. Writing comments on the plot would be useless. If I had to compare this film, I would have to compare it to Reign of Fire, but even if I didn't like Reign of Fire, at least that movie was better than this. <br /> <br /> Some people in the theater broke up before the film was still halfway. The only reason I didn't do it was that I simply didn't think of doing it. I was hoping for a CGI party and masterfully fighting, but that's not what happened. The martial arts lasted all 30 seconds and this is due to a very disappointing routine of exercises performed during the flashback scene. Even the CGI was not done well. A scene comes to mind. During one of the previous tank battles, the troops shoot at ...... nothing. Someone forgot to mention the animation guys on that piece of film, so the road was totally devoid of bad guys. I'm also thinking that the villain's voice has been dubbed by Imotep's voice-over from The Mummy movies. It had the exact same thing that echoed. (Someone owed some royalties here?) Since I mentioned the fight scene, I tell you it could be considered a spoiler, but only for purists, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Don't go see it, don't buy the DVD when it comes out. You have been warned.
