"Creepshow 2" is little more than a pale imitation of the original, designed with no other purpose than to collect the name of the previous film. It even amplifies the defects of its predecessor, which was often predictable and heavy. Yet, the first time, there were enough chills to compensate for his periodic breaks, which resulted in an irregular but generally quite funny effort. The sequel has few valid moments, so the transparency of the stories is even more evident. From time to time, it offers, but most of the time, it lingers there. <br /> <br /> As in the original, all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and only desserts. A wooden Indian comes to life, sparking revenge against his owner's killers. Teenagers are devoured by a water monster. A hitchhiker returns from the dead to pursue a careless driver. None of these premises is inherently bad in itself, but it lacks inspiration completely. There are few surprises and no fear. This is a textbook example of unmotivated films and numbers. It doesn't help that this economic-looking film suffers from a flat directorial style, although, to be honest, there wasn't much to work with. In the end, the second story turns out to be better, but not by much. <br /> <br /> For the most part, performances are fine at best. George Kennedy, as the unfortunate owner of a department store, does an adequate job, if not particularly inspired. Dorothy Lamour, on the other hand, is quite as good as the driver tormented by guilt, evoking sympathy for her situation despite the predictable redundant material. However, most of the characters are rather thin overall. <br /> <br /> You might think that "Creepshow 2" would have been better. George Romero, who directed the original, returned the script to the pen, based on other stories by Stephen King. The artist of the effects of makeup Tom Savini turns into a good bloody work. So why is the film a disappointment? I guess Romero really didn't want to make a second film, but he was forced to do it for financial reasons. It was a decade of horror sequels, clones, cheats and so on, so this was certainly inevitable. I can imagine the guy writing the script in a hurry, picking up his salary and running away. I believe he had to do what was necessary to finance his projects; we can't blame him. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 (out of ****) <br /> <br /> Issued by New World Pictures
