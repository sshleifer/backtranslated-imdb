If Fassbinder made a worse film, I certainly don't want to see it! Anyone who complains that his films are too chatty and claustrophobic should be forced to see it, to learn to appreciate the freer style that opted for excellent films like "The Bitter Tears Of Petra von Kant". This film gets bogged down with so many artistic, almost symbolic images, it looks like a parody of an "art film". The scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene in which the surfer of Elvira sails for ten minutes are just two of the most striking examples of what makes this film a real test for the observer's resistance. But what really makes me angry is the few scenes that feature only Elvira and her ex-wife and / or daughter. These are the only moments that show real human emotion and show that at the center of this horrible film was an excellent film that struggled to break free. What a waste.
