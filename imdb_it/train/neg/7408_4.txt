I'm not sure why I clicked "contains spoiler", because honestly there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough about what is supposed to ruin it. <br /> <br /> Mostly it offers visually. Well, apart from a few rubber masked monsters from the 1980s. I will say now that before watching this I had never seen the band Lordi, nor did I know anything about them that won the Eurovision. Apparently the monsters of this are members of the band, practically in their characters on stage. Everything. Anyway, I didn't know it while watching. I just thought the monsters / demons were mostly viable. Almost. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure there's a semi-coherent explanation behind what we see on the screen, but it might be better not to know. It would probably have been incredibly lame to come to think of it. The action continues to flow well enough to keep the viewer mostly entertained, even though half the entertainment factor is joking that wtf should happen in this movie exactly. <br /> <br /> I gave him a four mainly because I got a good laugh about it, especially as he basically explains nothing. It had to be the mood I was in, but I found Hella funny for some reason. Then I watch the film on the internet and find that NO ONE knows what the hell it should be. This amused me further, and increased my score by a further half point to a 4/10. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, or particularly coherent, but it's rather beautiful visually and sonically. Overall, far from essential, but watchable. Don't expect too much and don't expect it to make sense and could entertain you if you're in the right mood.
