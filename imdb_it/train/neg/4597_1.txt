Having endured this inaccurate film, I will admit that it is a more modern tale of history than previous versions. However, it is so inaccurate and has been made so politically correct to make me angry after watching it. Davy Crockett was very little represented by Billy Bob, who I thought would probably be the best cast since Sam Houston gave love to men the oratory. I think Dennis Quaid (a real Texan) self-absorbed would have been a perfect Crockett and would have fed on his hungry sense of self-worship. As a Texan and a true supporter of the Texan mentality, I think Davy Crockett was the Texan par excellence even though he wasn't born here. Our unofficial motto is "It's not braggin" if it's a fact "it was done for Crockett. And that last scene at the Alamo where Crockett is the last survivor must be the biggest offense to Davy Crockett ever made. Also only to suggest that this giant of a man and seasoned fighter would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous. Three different accounts of eyewitnesses put him dead among the corpses of a dozen or more Mexican soldiers dead after a fierce melee fight. that lame end of the film which is supposed to depict the battle of San Jacinto as a mutual battle of 600 Texans against 700 Mexican soldiers when there was actually closer to 1,500 regular Mexican regulars.Every Texan child who pays attention in his first lesson of Texas history knows that the battle took the Mexican army by surprise during the siesta and the Mexican army was so confused that it could not form ranks and escape because they were not trained to fight the frontier hand.
