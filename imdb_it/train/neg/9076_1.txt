This is surely the most stupid, cruelest, most repugnant film I've seen in a while. I was tempted to turn off the VCR, but, as in the fascination with a horrible car accident, I found it literally UNMISSABLE in every way imaginable and pulled it out until the end. I'm not at all a prude who opposes the comic portrayal of sexual antics on the screen. Animal House, Porky's, There's Something About Mary, both the American Pie movies, and even the infamous Freddy Got Fingered, I found extremely enjoyable in their own terms. Mamie Van Doren's sponge bath with the udder is the most terrifying aspect of a naked geriatrics since Shining. Ineptly modified and filmed, with incredible performances by Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman, the film ended without the benefit of making me laugh once. The only useful purpose for the film is as a textbook example of how not to make a rough picture. Oh, and it would also serve as a fertilizer for the lawn.
