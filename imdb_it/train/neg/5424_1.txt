Mirror. Mirror (1990) is a flat-blade film. Why did I watch movies like this when I was younger? Who knows? Maybe I was one to punish myself by watching one terrible movie after another. I don't know, I think I need a hobby during my teenage years. An outcast teenager (Rainbow Harvest) seeks comfort in an old mirror. He soon learns of the horrible power of this antique mirror and uses it to strike those who have offended it. Films like these, the power generator has an unpleasant side effect. This changes her inside and out if she likes it or not. <br /> <br /> A mess of a movie that for some reason has been restored on d.v.d. some years ago. I do not know why. They should have left it on the shelf and collected the dust. People love this movie for some reason. If you do, I'd like to know why. Until then I don't like this movie and I have no reason to look at it again. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for everyone.
