After watching the movie, I was really shocked to see such a high grade on IMDb. <br /> <br /> "The Fantastic Mr. Fox" is an adaptation of the beloved children's classic, which portrays the plot of a smooth and smooth movie the protagonist Fox (or "Foxy") while trying a "last" shot to steal from the dreaded Boggins, Bunce and Bean. Exactly, a short one, a fat one, a thin one, or at least it's fine. <br /> <br /> I don't know where to start with my criticisms. <br /> <br /> Well, I In my late teens I was never a Roald Dahl fan, but I like his material pretty well, having read some of his books as a child and seen Matilda, Charlie and the factory of chocolate over and over again. However, this film fights for an audience. Is it for children? Adults? I'm still unsure! Many of the "jokes" would have bored a child, especially when Mr. Fox visits a lawyer for example, or complains of being poor. Furthermore, a public of children (I presume) should sympathize with a character who steals and kills chickens. I'm all for the food chain, but practically you see Mr. Fox biting his neck! Surely it's a bit too much? And also, the plot ... well, it's a little boring. I was left alone with the hope that it would improve, but instead I became increasingly annoyed by Mr. Fox and his son Ash for making stupid decisions. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, humor collapses. I only laughed once or twice, although I particularly recognized the attempts at jokes. I think one part is that acting is so incredibly flat and monotonous. The voice actors do not have a sense of comic time, instead aiming at the subtlety of humor that works only with certain means. George Clooney intends to portray Mr. Fox charming and elegant, but his voice has no character. Meryl Streep shows no emotion, I didn't even imagine that Bill Murray had a role until the end credits, and Ash, 12 year old in fox, sounds like he's about 30 years old. <br /> <br /> I love animation, especially stop motion, but the visual style actually scared me a little. The characters are tall, thin and lacking in design warmth. They move with little fluidity and often the animation is jerky and strange. There is also a distinctive feeling of "mixed medium", as 2D components are added sporadically and without success. The characters look straight at the camera and talk; it was very embarrassing. There were one or two moments when Kylie looked straight at the camera, she didn't move and swirled in his eyes. It really scared me. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Mr. Fox had so much potential. A lot of people still seem to like it - look at the reviews. Maybe it wasn't for me.
