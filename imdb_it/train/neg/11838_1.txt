If your idea of ​​entertainment is to watch a video of people being hit by cars (see a woman passing under the front wheel, being twisted while the car passes over her before going under the rear wheel - and they show her two sometimes in case you missed it the first time) then this is the documentary for you. I admit that I no longer looked at this piece of voyeurism very disturbing, but for me it was enough. Maybe the rest is even better. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long it will take for television networks to start showing silent films. Perhaps the game programs based on self-mutilation could be beautiful. <br /> <br /> I already know that there are disturbed people in the world and that horrible things happen. I don't need to see the evidence on TV disguised as entertainment.
