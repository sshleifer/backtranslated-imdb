This is just a mess of a wonderful story by Edwin Torres. This film does not follow the plot of the book. And there are so many inconsistencies with the original film that one has to wonder if the writer had seen the first film. Al Pacino (the original and still the best Carlito) comes out of prison at the beginning of the original one Here, Carlito retires with his woman to heaven. <br /> <br /> What happened to Gail from Lorain, Ohio? In this episode, she is not mentioned, and Carlito retires with and presumably will marry another girl. <br /> <br /> Also, where is Kleinfeld? I think it was in the first book. I also like how Mr. Guzman plays a completely different character in this movie. It was Pachanga in Pacino's time. Now, it's Nacho Reyes, a murderer from Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reyes had a much more important role in the book. <br /> <br /> It's been a while since I read the book, but where does the character of Sean Comb come from? Also, I think this movie really does monitor the Harlem racial tensions that Torres was writing about. And the crowd doesn't get the treatment they did in the book. They are also wiped out in this film. But, magically, the Pleasant Avenue group is around for the second movie. <br /> <br /> The book tells a great story. This film could have told a great story. This is just a huge disappointment. Read the book. It is a better use of your time.
