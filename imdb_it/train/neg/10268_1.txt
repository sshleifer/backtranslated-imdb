Without a doubt this is one of the worst movies I've ever wasted money on! The plot is, I'm sorry, did I mention that there was a plot? The scariest moment was when ..., nope can't think of one! The best special effect that made me hide under the covers was ... but I can't even think of one. You knew who the murderer was from the beginning. There was nothing disturbing about the whole film, in fact the only two vaguely interesting tunes were when you saw her younger sister, Misty, in the shower and when you saw Nurse Toppan take her shirt. This movie should only be seen to get an idea of ​​how NOT to make a horror movie !!!
