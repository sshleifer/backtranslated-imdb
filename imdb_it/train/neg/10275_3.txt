The premise is incredible and some of the roles, particularly Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, are fascinating ... but this film is unwatchable. The music sounds as if it came from a kind of free online site and from the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap. Most of the singing is off-key. I think they could have turned with the singer and put it under the music ... The dialogue is really stupid and trivial. The film works best when it actually talks about real estate, but unfortunately it often goes away in stupid farcical sub-plots. I found myself checking the clock after the first twenty minutes and after 40 asking myself 'when will it ever end.'
