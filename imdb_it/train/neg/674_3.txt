I have been known to fall asleep during movies, but this is usually due to a combination of things including, really tired, being hot and comfortable out of seven and having just eaten a lot. However on this occasion I fell asleep because the film was rubbish. The development of the plot has been constant. Constantly slow and boring. Things seemed to happen, but without explanation of what was causing them or why. I admit, maybe I lost part of the movie, but I looked at most of it and everything seemed to happen spontaneously without any concern for anything else. I can't recommend this film at all.
