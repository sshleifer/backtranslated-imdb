I don't want to go around here, but ..... this is the worst "movie" I've ever seen. Worse than The Avengers. The incompetent direction, the disjunctive writing and the terrible acting are the only constant elements in everything. Shot on a very cheap video, it looks like a high school project, but without the excitement. Lighting often resembles a single Sun-Gun. The sound is slightly better than a single microphone on the camera, but the rest of this thing is simply awful. The plot goes in strange directions with no subsequent foundation or resolution, the techie elements are clearly absurd and the editing seems worse than a rough cut. It's not even bad enough to be funny. It's just ugly. By the way, the packaging is intentionally misleading. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate owes me $ 4.00.
