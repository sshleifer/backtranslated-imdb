Worst mistake of my life. <br /> <br /> I chose this film for Target for $ 5 because I thought, "Hey, it's Sandler that I can have cheap laughs." I was wrong, completely wrong. In the middle of the film all three of my friends were asleep and I was still suffering. Worst plot, worst screenplay, worst movie I've ever seen. I wanted to hit my head against a wall for an hour, then stop and you know why? Because I felt damn good. After banging my head in I blocked that damn movie in the microwave and saw it burn ... and I felt better than anything else I've ever done. It took American Psycho, Army of Darkness and Kill Bill just to get over that shit. I hate you SANDLER TO REALLY GO THROUGH THIS AND RUDE A WHOLE DAY OF MY LIFE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
