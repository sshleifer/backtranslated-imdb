Honestly, who in the name of God gave this film an 8.1 rating? I imagine that the people who made or played the film were the ones who voted. Otherwise this movie sucks! This film is nothing more than an amateur film, or maybe a student. I'm a movie fanatic and I've seen terrible movies, but here there was literally nothing of redeemer. History and acting were the worst I've ever seen. The props, including the use of airsoft toy guns with terrible special effects, where it is equally ugly of the rest. They're all bad words in movies, but the F-Bomb has been dropped by about a third word and I think we could have a winner for most use of F-Bomb in any EVER movie. The film also appears to have been shot with cheap video cameras and non-real films. I would expect this award to be awarded to an amateur film shown only at public access stations across the country, but does not belong to a DVD. <br /> <br /> Don't buy this movie. Don't rent this movie. All I can say is that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon. This is a precious time that you will NEVER return. Unfortunately for me, that time is lost, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, consider this warning.
