Obviously, I didn't care about the things that came (aka "The Shape of Things to Come") as much as most viewers. This means that there is a good chance that you like it more than me. In any case, you may find it useful to listen to the film described from another point of view. <br /> <br /> Directed by William Cameron Menzies, who had the same experience as a set designer and even more as an art director, this is a film adaptation of HG Wells of his own novel of the same name. In my eyes, it helps to show why a great novelist may not necessarily be a great scriptwriter. <br /> <br /> The film opens in 1940 in an "Everytown" in London. The war is brewing and the citizens of Everytown fear that it will reach them. It does. And it turns into a business of decades that fundamentally destroys civilization. Wells and Menzies continue to leap forward to show us different scenes related to the war and its consequences. We see two pilots, one knocked down, come to terms with the consequences of their fighting. We meet a post-apocalyptic community governed by an aspiring warlord. We meet a man of a thriving futuristic society. Let's see how technology is changing. And finally, we are led to the full realization of that futuristic society around 2036, where leaders are discussing the merits of sending the man to the moon. <br /> <br /> It might seem potentially very exciting, but it just doesn't work like a movie. Structurally, the film is too episodic, with little to tie dramatically. With the third segment, I completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters. I had just been able to solve them in the first couple segments. There is a constant parade of new faces. We learn nothing about any of them. <br /> <br /> It does not help that individual segments, with a couple of exceptions, tend to be clumsily directed and modified. They are also occasionally manipulative - it can almost begin to look like a propaganda film. But perhaps in a contradictory way, the segments are also a bit cold and emotionally dry. <br /> <br /> In fact, too long a section is more like an industrial promotional music video / video. If it comes to building shots of the futuristic city, with lots of large machinery, a lot of welding, and so on. At one point, a guy who looks like an astronaut greets the camera through a kind of futuristic glass. The music for this section is somewhere between the militarist and the exaggerated horror score. I can't say that Things to Come consists of engaging material in terms of drama. <br /> <br /> But the common cry in support of Things to Come is that it is "a film about ideas". It may be true, but there are a couple of problems if looked at that way. One does not yet work like a film, that is, as a visual and sound dramatic art work, and two, there are too many ideas presented here. <br /> <br /> The main idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations. It's nice to shoot a movie. It is also extraordinarily prescient of World War II, as things went was scripted and shot in 1935 (published in 1936). Wells has some interesting things to say about the war, some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film. For example, the ending seems to suggest that another war is breaking out or it will be at any time. The general message seems a bit pessimistic. It seems that Wells shows that war is simply a part of human nature that cannot be eliminated, even if it does not preclude "progress" - indeed, perhaps it fuels progress, at least indirectly. <br /> <br /> This would certainly be enough for a movie. However, there are many more ideas here. The scene between the two pilots is one of the most touching scenes in the film. This is a complex dilemma. One pilot shot the other, but now he's coming to help him. But the pilot who was shot down was carrying a poisonous gas that is now floating across the field. They cannot both breathe the gas without damage. A girl arrives. They have only two gas masks that work together. The pilot who was shot down offers his mask, while he says he is dying anyway. What to do? It is not that this same scene can be extended for a long time, but the ideas - the bizarre complex of helping and trying to hurt each other in the middle of a war - are enough to build a film. <Br /> <br /> Another example. During the scenes with the aspiring warlord, in the post-apocalyptic environment, there is a nasty contagious disease called "wandering disease" that goes around. Turn victims into something like drunken zombies. The usual procedure is to shoot the victims on the spot in an attempt to ward off the disease. This material is treated as an afterthought. It's a great idea and deserves its own film. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Wells presents controversial socialist ideas to future society. It was enough for his film too. It is simply impossible to effectively manage so many things in 100 minutes, especially when it is supposed to be the crux of the film instead of a dramatic attraction. <br /> <br /> However, there are reasons to give things to come at least a vision. If you are a science fiction fan, this is a historically important film. Given the background of Menzies, the production and the sets are interesting, even if the cinematography seems extremely dated. It is also interesting to see how Wells was prescient or retrospectively humorous in his "predictions". I particularly liked the means of propulsion to the moon, which strongly resembled George Méliès's 1902 film A Trip to the Moon (aka Le Voyage dans la lune). Don't expect too much from the things to come.
