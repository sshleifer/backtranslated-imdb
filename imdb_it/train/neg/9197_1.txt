There are some movies that you only know that they will be bad from the first frame. Even if you were totally unaware of Ed Wood's work, take a look at that "Plan 9 from outer space" commentator and you know you won't see the next cinematic masterpiece. That's right, when I saw the first shot of Uwe Bolls' "House of Dead" masterpiece, with that guy sitting in front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to look like he'd just arrived from Sin City, I knew that On a journey from hell. <br /> <br /> So, the film starts like this: first the protagonist says that all the others will die. You know, to make you wander. Then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like "Karma ... thinks it's Foxy Brown" or "Alicia ... my ex .. we broke up recently .. I had to study and she had to fence". No, I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> However, this group of twenty-year-olds who couldn't get out of a wet paper bag went to the "Rave of the century", a rave in question was a few tents, a port-Ã - potty is a poor stage located on a small island in the middle of the Pacific. Our gang lost the ferry, but luckily it will find a way to get there, like a fishing boat run by Kirk (Cpt Kirk? Take? Man, whoever wrote this script is a genius) and his partner who is a bastard son of Simpson's Cpt McAllister and the killer who knows what you did last summer. <br /> <br /> Long story short, the gang arrives on the island, finds no one there except a few bloody shirts and then decide to run away from there. No wait, they don't, actually they are all happy and as if there was free alcohol. <br /> <br /> With that scene the film touches the bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go lower. Some guys in rubber suits start running, there are screams and shootings, our band goes home to meet some other band, they leave the house, they meet Cpt Kirk and some policewomen (who have about 500 pounds of weapons between them) and then he decides to go home. Somewhere along the line they turn into a S.W.A.T. team, get into the Matrix, the guys in rubber suits start to multiply like bacteria and I start to cry because I actually paid to see this. To add insult to injury, every few minutes there are shots of the video game on which this shit is based and there is a nice game scene for some characters when they die. <br /> <br /> I seriously hate this movie. It doesn't even fit into the famous "So bad it's good" category. It's just ugly. The script is ugly, the zombies are horrible, there is no tension, the lines are bad, the actors are bad ... the list goes on. <br /> <br /> You will probably want to see this movie only because of its reputation as being terrible. Do not do it. There are bad movies that deserve to be watched. This is not one of them.
