In Texas, seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate Halloween night before going to a party. Meanwhile, they call the American Nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their most intimate fears. A serial killer, who is listening to their confessions, makes their nightmares come true, killing each of them sadistically. "American Nightmare" is a strange low-budget movie that has a horrible beginning: without a previous explanation, a woman kills two couples in an isolated campground, as if it were Friday 13. So, the story moves into a bar, where seven friends celebrate Halloween. From this moment on, the story has great potential, and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance, showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies, as usual in this type of production C. However, the end of the script does not provide no explanation of the killing instinct and the motivations for the behavior of the nurse Jane Toppan, giving the feeling that the budget has ended before the finalization of the filming. With a better start and conclusion, this strange story would be a good low-budget slasher movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Agony" ("Agony")
