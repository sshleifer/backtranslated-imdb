This film was horrible. The script is FULLY unrealistic and yet it is written to be set in the real world, the effects of editing and lighting are worse than in most early film school projects. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film to anyone: A) knows every detail about the police world or secret operations. B) knows every detail about the making or appreciation of the film. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to the average mind or below average, I think it would be fun if you were an idiot. If you absolutely have to watch this movie, I highly recommend a type of drunkenness <br /> <br /> It is a total waste of that little production value it has.
