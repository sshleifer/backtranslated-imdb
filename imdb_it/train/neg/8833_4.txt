Without any fault for the actors (everyone did great shows), the overall story was not performed very well. The film opens with a great zinger: an old fool forces the car of a young Aboriginal woman off the road. But then, we are forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with a whole new character group ... and we don't know why until the 40 minutes have passed. It turns out that they are the ones who eventually discover the girl's body ... and the story progresses from there. <br /> <br /> As the story resumes at that point, it's not going anywhere. After 2 hours, I asked myself: was there a point in this, or was it just to see the characters struggle with accusations of racism and stupidity of how they handled the discovery? The story was ultimately unsatisfactory and felt unfinished. Although it is well acted, there is no strong enough backbone in the film to justify its recommendation.
