Did anyone else feel betrayed like me? The first hour was pretty solid but the last one. My God. It looked predictable and cheese. It wasn't as grand and epic as the entire series of the show. Most of the reviews they read were brilliant, but I really can't understand why. I had seriously predicted that general ending before, but then I retracted it because I thought "No, they would never do it, it's too sad". I can barely stand it. I feel so dissatisfied. I think I'm about to go out the door to go and sell every season I own. Someone please. Change your mind. I want to love this. So bad. Someone tell me why I'm wrong. Great show. Terrible ending.
