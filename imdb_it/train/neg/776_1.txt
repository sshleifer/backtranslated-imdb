I remember seeing this cartoon when I was 6 or 7 years old. My grandfather took the video for free at the mall. I remember it really sucked. The plot didn't make sense. I hated the fox who became Casper's friend. He was so stupid! Casper cried with his head down if he couldn't find a friend. So? Get over it! The only good part and I don't want to seem petty was when the fox was hit and eventually died. I laughed my head at the reimbursement because this carton sucked so much. The bad news is that the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost. I wish he had been dead. I think I even gave this video to someone because I hated it. No wonder they offered it for free at the mall. If you have a child, don't let them look at him. They will probably agree with me that it sucks.
