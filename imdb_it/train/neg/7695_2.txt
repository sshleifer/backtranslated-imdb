I was so hoping to see an adaptation of a classic story like the Thousand and One Nights. Instead I was disappointed with a film that failed to keep my attention from the start, even though I tried to watch it twice !! <br /> <br /> It was an advantage that Caradine was in this film, but it was not very similar to that of the actors who had no sympathy. For something like Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras it is much better for the action, the comedic moments and the general enjoyment. <br /> <br /> OK, so Son of the Dragon has as many fans as possible, but if you're looking for something amazing in terms of martial arts and plot you don't get it. If you just want children to settle down on a Sunday afternoon, maybe this is all for you along with the 3 ninjas.
