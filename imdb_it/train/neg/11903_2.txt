Wenders was fantastic with Million $ Hotel. I don't know how it came about with this movie! The idea of ​​giving the situation after spt11 and the point of view of the American Society is confident, which makes it 2 out of 10. But this is not a film. It is the best that anyone can do with a great idea (the west-east clash). There are important things going on in the Middle East and it has just come out on the screen of a MAC * with the fingers of an American girl who is actually at the level of stupidity (because he is simply ignorant of the facts). The characters are not well made. And the most important thing is that the idea that comes with religion is somehow fun for me. At the final scene Lana says let it be quiet and try to listen. And the background music says "... I'll make him pray." The thing is not about religion actually. But it ends with this. As you will see the truth if you close your eyes and pray. The lights are already shining on the truth. It's just that nobody wants to see it. ps: "My house is not a place. They are people" The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence. But it's wasted behind this movie. (by the way, as "someone" mentioned below, the best young Americans are not the best, they are only the "poor" and those "hopeless" who join the army that needs a good paycheck that is not provided by the government!)
