Written by the excellent McGovern and directed by Frears, this film was a little disappointed. It seemed too short. He spent too much time creating the atmosphere of Hovis and laughed at the Catholic demands. Then very quickly the fascists and the socialists compete for the attention of the family, and the terrible conclusion. <br /> <br /> My wife still thought Liam was pretty.
