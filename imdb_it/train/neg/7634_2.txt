This is the kind of film that shows the scarcity of French cinema when it comes to thrillers. The director's desire to "look American" is so resounding that you won't be fooled for a minute, unless you've seen a serial killer since then "Peeping Tom". <br /> <br /> Two male policemen (or one and a half, more similar, as you will see), horrible murders, a more complicated plot than a complex one. Charles Berling is not lucky with the genre (see the surprising stupid inconnu de Strasbourg "a couple of years ago). Scenes with his pregnant wife - which should be the counterpart to the noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot - are among the worst ever filmed. Add a smoky love scene between them and a bloody autopsy to get a PG 12 and then to attract the huge teenage audience. A violent and absurd conclusion, followed by a silent epilogue that could make a good advertisement for the French Riviera, is really the silence of the lame.
