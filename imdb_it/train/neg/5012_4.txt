I watched this movie with the motivation that Amber Benson gets nervous and Nick Stahl is usually pretty cool: I imagined that any movie with two actors that I like and respect couldn't be all bad. And in this sense, I was right - considering the engaging dialogue they had given them, both behave quite well. Not well enough to prevent the film from sucking, you understand, but well enough to be able to exceed the 75 minutes of the film (and this is the main sign of a terrible film: when, at 40 minutes, you are already praying why it is over). <br /> <br /> It's hard to know where to start with the problems in "Taboo". Dialogue, as mentioned, is frightening; in wood and completely unnatural. January Jones's acting is incredibly bad, and since he is the character we spend most of our time following the house, this is an unforgivable flaw. The plot manages to be so complicated that it makes no sense to be so predictable at the same time that it is completely predictable (literally, not one of the most important "twists" of this film would surprise anyone but a small child). Some interesting shots aside, the director tries too successfully, too many shots and disturbing photographic work that distracts from that little element of the story. <br /> <br /> Three of the stars in this film are rewarded for the fact that it contains Amber Benson, and the last one is tossed around based on the fact that one of the lines made me giggle a little. I would never recommend this film to anyone, under any circumstances. Avoid at all costs.
