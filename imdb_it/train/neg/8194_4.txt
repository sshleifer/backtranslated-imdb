How hard is it to write a watchable movie with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently VERY hard for writers here. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea how Santa is younger and 20 years older than Vince (who plays his brother BIG). I must have lost that part of the story, but it really didn't matter. Many scenes seemed out of place and invented; the kind of "funny notation" scenes that are drugs out of WAY ​​too far where every sense of comedy is lost. <br /> <br /> The director / producer tried to go "tear-jerky" at the end, which would have been suitable if ANYTHING brought that point was worth following. <br /> <br /> Ugh, big disappointment. I can see how some people might appreciate this OK, since many people will take all the rubbish they are fed, but I would strongly encourage DVD waiting on this. It is NOT worth the $ 23,978 needed to bring your family to the movies these days.
