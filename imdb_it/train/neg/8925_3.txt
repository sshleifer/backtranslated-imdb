I never really liked the movie Myra, although I appreciate how it pushed the Hollywood envelope at the time. Surely Miss Welch's costume has become an iconic image, although I have to ask myself if many people who recognize the image really see the film and know what it is - <br /> <br /> I saw Myra on FMC from a couple of years ago and I didn't think he'd aged better over the years. There is a segment on it in the comics of Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon History, where the just merit was given for putting great stars in what was then an outrageous production. However, IMHO, the film is too bitter to be charming, too foolish to be an exciting, and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform, engage, or entertain ---
