We gave up the point where the character of George Clooney pulled his nails out. We weren't picky: after spending an hour of this tour, we simply knew how it felt. To say that this film was incomprehensible, boring, pretentious twilight would have been an excessive praise! How did people manage to sit through this corner of a confused, slow, depressing and pseudonym movie, let alone name it for an Oscar? Clooney looked as sick as we felt looking at him. What was he thinking? Oh .. and what was there with those subtitles? - Did we just have a dud DVD or was the original film like that - sentences left hanging in mid-air? The film was quite difficult to follow even without this. Too bad for the cast, which obviously did its best with the available material.
