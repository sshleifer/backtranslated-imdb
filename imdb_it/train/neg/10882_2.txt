This film is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. From the first scene, I knew it would be a big accident. It starts with a seemingly bad girl who kills a group of nuns on a mission. Apparently, the people in it were possessed by some random zombies. Well, some years later, some college kids are playing tricks. The horrible recitation goes from the oath to the jock chief. Things like the jock that yelled at him to do stuff in a non-chalonte way, with the oath to react and do too the whole "eager to be a popular role". What really took the cake with this is the final battle. Special effects absolutely HORRIBLE with guns. For example, guns produce a noise without a muzzle flash and vice versa. this is accompanied by stop-animation zombies (the reason why they move in stop motion is a mystery), background music and about 40 guns sprouting from nowhere. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie sucks. Just like many others you can rent for 50 cents at the nearest low-eyed movie rental place.
