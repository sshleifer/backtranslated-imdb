There is little to get excited about "Dan in Real Life". First of all, the whole configuration is incredibly invented. Did you really think that during that long first conversation at the restaurant, Marie wouldn't tell Dan where she was going? And since Dan talked during that conversation, why would she be so attracted to him? Besides, I never understood why Marie was so attracted to Dan throughout the film. He is very narcissistic and does little to convince us that he is really a good guy (for example, he is in Marie's bookstore, he ridicules his brother on his past girlfriends and tries to make Marie jealous with a "blind date"). There's more trick, like that ridiculous bowling scene where Dan and Marie are discovered by the whole family. Yes, how it could really happen. Dan in real life is slow, sloppy and manipulative. Even chick films like The Jane Austen Book Club get higher marks than this predictable "tear-jerker".
