There is no artistic value in this film to deserve any prize. Well, it doesn't even deserve an audience. Ironically, one of the awards is for cinematography, but frankly, camera movements are baffling to say the least. Each frame, you feel that you are receiving the "complete picture", it is as if someone were "cutting your sight" from the edges. History is pathetic. Well, I'll be honest, I couldn't stand to watch the whole movie. The part that most sucked was when I saw the soldiers celebrate in their barracks and one of the soldiers convinced to drink alcohol. These and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of Steven Seagal. Take my advice, stay away from this piece of shit.
