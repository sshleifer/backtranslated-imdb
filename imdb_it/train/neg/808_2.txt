Extremely disappointing film based on the novel by James Michener. <br /> <br /> The worst thing was the performance of Marlon Brando. His southern accent was ridiculous. I found myself laughing when she spoke, she looked like an elderly southern lady who came home to land. Brando, so good in previous films, has been reduced to a lure here. Tyrone Power, in "Proxy Witness", should have been named as best actor in place of Brando. <br /> <br /> The film, addressing racism, addressed the US government's attempt to avoid marriages between US soldiers and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando was with the face of stone throughout the film. His transition from anti-like to professional relationships occurs when he finds love with an Asian woman. His emotions and chatter made it difficult to see how he could marry these new visions. <br /> <br /> Only the gentleman knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki received supporting Oscars for their performances. Nothing of both performances is equally impressive. Umeki's appearance on the screen was short and without much of what was represented by her. A better performance in this film was made by Miiko Taka, who made Brando's love interest well. He showed great emotion as the anti-American who found love with the character of Brando. His face was engraved by the unhappiness he had had for losing his father and brother in World War I. He realized that his dance was not his way out of this existence he was experiencing. <br /> <br /> Martha Scott moved from her Jewish mother Yochobel in "The Ten Commandments" to the bigoted mother of Brando's love interest in the beginning. His performance along with Ricardo Montalban's was wasted. Patricia Owens, like Brando's first love, showed depth and conviction in her performance.
