I had been looking forward to the first screening of this film since it was given to me on DVD at Christmas. Having booked a special slot for last night, I sat down to watch it with my daughter (17 and a Film Studies student), obviously with chocolates, in an impatient wait. We love Jane Austin. <br /> <br /> After only the first two minutes we knew we were sunk. The disturbing shots and camera angles, the general poor cinematography, the direction and the wooden exhibitions had already left us unsatisfied. Discouraged, we saw on. <br /> <br /> Anne, played by Sally Hawkins, seemed strangely and without a specific purpose, directly to the camera on several occasions, breaking our "fantasy of the moment" conquered and engaging us almost directly in an almost "way I'll find you ". <br /> <br /> Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who played Captain Wentworth, did his best with the script and direction, bless him. I hope they paid well, however, as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave that predictably broke the dam, flooding him and his co-actor. They were almost dragged into the open sea. Health and safety would have had a field day! Poor Rupert was allowed to spit sea water to deliver his line. Presumably there was not enough money in the kitty for a new take on this scene. Anyone who made sense would never have experienced it on such a day. <br /> <br /> In addition to Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Krige gave the only convincing performance of Lady Russell, but her efforts were soon offset by those of the bewildering portrait of Anthony Head of the annoying Sir Walter Elliott . <br /> <br /> Towards the long-awaited end of the film, Captain Wentworth appeared strangely to Anna with a visit every two seconds having made great efforts to avoid her for most of the film. It was as if he had developed a memory impediment that made him forget his true reason for being. On the contrary, Anne ran, hyper-ventilating, from one pillar to another, in search of the good captain who, in the meantime, had managed to call almost all of the Bath they told us about, in just three or four minutes, without even sweating. <br /> <br /> We did not find any of Anne's spells crossing the screen. In fact, we were questioned as to which charismatic Captain Wentworth had ever seen in an Antonia without thorns, without ideas and why someone, no one, had said nothing, alando Sir Walter to close the devil. <br /> <br /> The crucial kiss, normally our favorite girly moment, was painfully brought out. As they approached, Anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on the screen to make it look like she was chewing gum before her lips finally met. Eww! <br /> <br /> The funniest thing about last night was the chocolates and the exchange of half-hour views between mother and daughter for how bad the film had been. <br /> <br /> What a pity it spoils such an enchanting and compelling story, filmed in some of England's best scenery. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry Jane.
