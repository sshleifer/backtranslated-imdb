Gritty, dusty western by the director Richard Brooks, who seems completely absorbed by the genre keeping intact all the usual clich√©s. The horse race in the early 1900s attracts a low-profile cowboy (Gene Hackman), a suave gambler (James Coburn), an arrogant kid (Jan Michael Vincent), and even a FEMALE (a surprisingly Candice Bergen game ). Once the preliminaries are out of the way (with predictable arguments about whether or not to participate in a woman), this becomes a pretty compelling voice, although it doesn't create new ground (instead it looks like something from the era of Gary Cooper) . Good looking, if the piece is too long, it has a macho verve and a refined cast, but the plot mechanisms become rather boring rather quickly. ** from ****
