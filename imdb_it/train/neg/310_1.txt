I had never heard of this Adam Sandler film until I saw it on the Blockbuster wall. Being a fan of Adam Sandler, I rented it. I honestly could only watch about 30 minutes. its. It was terrible. Do everything possible to keep it away from the public's hands. I sincerely hope this film will soon go to OOP, and I hope it stays that way!
