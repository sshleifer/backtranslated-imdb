Hollywood's attempt to turn Jack London's life into a "Jack London" adventure film is not a bad idea; certainly, he led an interesting, sometimes adventurous life. This film, however, ends up flat and unsatisfactory. Above all, it lacks integrity. Michael O'Shea (like London) has some London talks; and, it's nice to see his bearded Jack receive "The Call of the Wild" after spending some time alone, in the snowy mountains, with his dog, "Buck". Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very nice. The film draws unfortunate "Yellow Peril" parallels between the life of London and the Second World War, which are both tense and offensive. <br /> <br /> ** Jack London (11/24/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
