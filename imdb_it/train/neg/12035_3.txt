I expected it to be much better. I love Tim Burton's work, so I was really excited to see these short films online. Well, they weren't what I expected at all. <br /> <br /> I don't really know what exactly it is I don't like. I imagine they are simply boring. The sound bothers me and most of the characters, even though I loved Roy the Toxic Boy and Stainboy. <br /> <br /> The Match Girl episode probably bothered me more, although it was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> I also don't like the way some characters die. For example, as a Match Girl she practically set fire to the gas station, or how the girl who looks is dead, in general. Roy's death was fun, surprisingly. Death from a car air freshener. Very original ;-) This made me laugh so much ... <br /> <br /> There are some things that are not appropriate for children. Just a little tongue and blood. This is all I have to say! 3/10
