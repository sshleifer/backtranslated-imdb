I can fondly remember Bo Derek's heyday and the attention of the British press (especially the Sun & News of the World mottoes), all following his small role in "10" with Dudley Moore. Understandably, his photogenic face, crystalline blue eyes and his perfectly formed bouncing breasts have been made a lot of noise. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, acting is, and never was, its forte! I think they should make one of the triple record collections that you always find in DVD packs: Orca, Tarzan the Ape-man and Bolero. All these films could be nominated for "So Bad They Are Great". <br /> <br /> It would be a guilty "must buy" of mine! If you've ever read your press, or this comment, Mrs. Derek, please don't be offended, but you always have a thing for you and there are more important things in the world to worry about than your acting ability. Very Love.x
