I really have to see a good movie soon, because it seems like every other voice or something I despise. However my story speaks, I don't have to tell a lie. Bobby Deerfield and all that sucks big green banana skins. I never thought I'd see a movie so crispy like this. Al Pacino does not play in this film: he is posing. There are many, many scenes of his character, who is a race car driver, simply staring at the camera. It's perfectly awful. Marthe Keller is just as bad. These two should be in a love story, and there is simply no chemistry. Did Sydney Pollack direct this film? There is no trace of the genius behind Tootsie here. Is it the same man that I exulted in Eyes Wide Shut? I can not believe it. Save yourself a horrible cinematic experience. Run, don't walk away from Bobby Deerfield.
