For the domestic public, I can see how they would applaud this film. For outsiders, with no vested interests, it didn't make much sense. The Germans were portrayed as incompetent and the Russians as heroes. The seemingly romantic corner was superfluous and a distraction. As a young woman could "love" the lieutenant by only catching a glimpse of him was an absurdity. How could he, as said at the end of the film, never get married just because this infatuation was beyond me. I mentioned that the Germans were portrayed as idiots and that it was exemplified in hunting in the swamp. Several hundred German troops advanced, pushing the Russians into the swamp. So the Russians hid themselves and the Germans stopped at the edge of the swamp and stayed there to listen. I suppose they didn't want to get their boots wet, but I'm sure an officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men in the water to search in the swamp. But that would have ended the story. Moreover, the Germans entered the stable where the Russians hid in the loft and did not bother to shoot on the roof. In the worst case, some soldiers would have thrown a grenade into the loft and would not have climbed a ladder to peek inside. I saw some reviewers who said they cried at the end. I wonder why? You knew this little band would go broke and they were nothing heartbreaking.
