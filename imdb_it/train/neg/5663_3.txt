This is for Zatoichi's films since the "Star Trek" films were for "Star Trek" - except that in this case each original was more fun and interesting than this great, brilliant remake, and even better done, if the substance it's more important than the surface. If I had never seen them, I would have thought it was beautiful but empty; since I had it, I thought his style was inappropriate and its contents insufficient. The idea of ​​resuscitating the character in a bigger and more multifaceted production had to be played well, but it made no sense, except for the hope of making money; it's just a show, which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the character's world and fails to bring the character anywhere it hasn't already been (even the actor wasn't at his best). I was hoping to see Ichi in an advanced stage of life, in a story that would have seen him go out gracefully and draw some conclusions from his overall experience; this simply redoed pieces from other films, seasoned with more sexual violence and sfx. It is not the same experience.
