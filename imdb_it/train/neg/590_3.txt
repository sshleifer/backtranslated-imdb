I was sadly disappointed with this film due to the fact that he felt fake and that the characters were not strong enough to bring the film to the weakly horror attempt. The basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it was not able to excite, frighten me or really scare me - there was a part in the whole film that I thought was creepy, but even this didn't redeem it. I really liked the character of Kate at the end of the film because it seemed to sweeten and become a little more realistic in the end, the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not actually necessary for this film and I think the director / writer teased with the myriad characters used without purpose, if he had left it to the basic characters making it more of a solo effort by Kate, it might have worked - Jeremy's acting was wooden to say the least and I felt uncomfortable watching the chemistry on the screen bad - or lack of it. What a pity. Disappointing.
