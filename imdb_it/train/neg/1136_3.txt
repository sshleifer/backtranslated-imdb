Every movie from the 1930s is dated, but if you only look at John Ford's films it would seem more dated than if you were watching others. For example, the Grand Hotel is a relatively modern melodrama. With Ford, there is always the revenge of someone's nobility (Abe, The Joads). Always the excessive emphasis of nastiness of a little heavy. Always the poorly packaged, awkward and obvious scripts. This is not an exception. It's just a rather insensitive device to express the feeling. And the feeling is all that is happening. <br /> <br /> What Ford does here does not make me grateful to Lincoln, it just makes me wonder why states have been settled by the population of complete morons depicted here. Ford has continued to make decent films. This is too dated to be anything but bad. It looks completely fake. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda with a fake nose is bizarre. And nobody from Illinois would pronounce the phrase "S", or "Shonuff!"
