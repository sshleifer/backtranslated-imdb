Really an incredible pile of pap! <br /> <br /> A predictable slow-paced film that destroys the soul, which obscures the mind and which, by cutting its wrists with a rusty bread knife, seems ... well, almost necessary. <br /> <br /> the acting is over for the subtle dialogue, each scene is at least twice the time it must be, the intricate details of how this career is collapsing or that the career is on the rise is too sad and trivial for words. The music would be good if you didn't have to sit around the film, but in reality, three good songs are not enough reward for the effort required to watch the film. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie I prayed to God for narcolepsy or someone to shoot me. <br /> <br /> Never, never, never again.
