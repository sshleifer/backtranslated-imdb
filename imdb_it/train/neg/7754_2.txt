Spoilers will be in this. The film could have been better if they had a different CGI script, director and supplier. Aren't you right? The film has a man who starts his theme park ... err ... zoo on a desert island where people can see dinosaurs ... err ... Sabretooths and it's called Jurra ... oops .. Primal Park. I don't mind rip-off, because there are no original ideas for this type of film, but this one slaps you directly in the face, R and p and a t and d i y. There is also the "shadow head of the creature on design" thing. The Sabretooth, which are not sabretooth according to Mr. Primal Park (only ancient killer cats), are rather junky but the crowning glory is what I call "Sloggy". Because, after eliminating a large cat, a hero is relaxing a little because only one remains. Enter the strange boy who says, Nah, we made three, the third is a monster who pulls back with his front feet. Great, fantastic. A group of university students is on the island for a treasure hunt, there they try to enter their brotherhoods or into a group (always thought that a short nickname was needed). Out of those who live, only one has completed their task, so I enjoyed it a lot. Oh yes, the obligatory "Evil Capitalist Must Die" Clique is in effect with anyone but two of them! The death of Mr. Primal Park is the most ridiculous thing you will see in one of these films as the tooth pots of a Sabretooth statue come off (courtesy of Sloggy), shrinks some dimensions and impales man through throat. If only I had gone away so easily. I like "Sabretooth" better than this spin-off.
