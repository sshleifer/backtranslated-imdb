It really shows that the hype is not everything. Show of what is a very bad abhishek actor and is only getting film because of his father and wife. Amitabh as always is solid. Ajay Devgan as always is disgusting and useless and the new guy is a joke. The protagonist is such a waste of actor. A film so pathetic by such a revered director and by such a great industry. With movies as such I have decreased the amount of Bollywood films I watch. <br /> <br /> RGV has been making very poor films for a while. It's time to get different actors. Hrithek anyone? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol. Every other protagonist is a half-naked woman. Pffffft.
