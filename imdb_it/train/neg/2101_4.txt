Bernard Rapp passed away last year and was a highly educated journalist. Cinema was one of his greatest passions (he wrote a vast world-wide film dictionary) and therefore he was obliged to wield a camera at least once in his life. But the films he left collected warm reviews: "Tiré à Part" (1996) although Terence Stamp's sensational performance was very caricatured in depicting the characters, "une Affaire De Goût" (2000) was a brilliant story also if Bernard Giraudeau gave a perverse performance, "Pas Si Grave" (2003) was another disappointing one and "a Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence" is as overwhelming as his predecessors. Its comic potential is exploited in a fragile way. <br /> <br /> And anyway, the starting idea allows us to predict a spiritual and revolving comedy. A couple held by Yvan Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain who invited their friends is in full swing in a lascivious villa. To play with their guests, they pretend to separate from each other. And things do not go as planned because the announcement of their separation does not surprise them. The two lovers begin to reflect on the validity of their couple. <br /> <br /> Despite the lush landscape and promising material he had at his disposal, Rapp's indistinct direction may not be able to bring this game to life with unexpected consequences. The plot follows a worn pattern with characters that have well-known functions and masks that are revealed about who they really are. Verbal or situation comical effects often fall horizontally. A bad modification fades the film a little more with this bad habit from Rapp to cut many sequences abruptly. Even the sincere input of the actors in the company is questionable. They look bored and play their lyrics rather than live them, especially Sandrine Kiberlain. The public is soon caught in a torpor. <br /> <br /> It is regrettable to say: Bernard Rapp's films have never lived up to his intentions as evidenced by "Un piccolo Jeu sans Conséquence".
