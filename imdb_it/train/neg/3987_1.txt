I came out of very few movies before they finish, but I couldn't finish this piece of junk. This was the biggest load of racism that he tried to pass as a legitimate film from "The Birth of a Nation". The characters were little more than cardboard cutouts. I don't see how any actor would like their name associated with this movie. Lee must have better things to do than to spread garbage like this. I know that I and anyone with a brain have better things to do ... like looking at dry paint. I would like someone to make a film about interracial relationships that dealt with the subject realistically. There is much more depth in this topic, the superficial hangover of a bitter director like Lee.
