When I rented this film, I had very low expectations ...... but when I saw it, I realized that the film was less (much less) than I expected. The actors were bad (the doctor's wife was one of the worst), the story was so stupid ... it could work for a Disney movie (except for the murders), but this is not a comedy, it's a laughable masterpiece of stupidity. The title is well chosen except for one thing: they could add a stupid movie after Dead Husbands! I give him 0 and a half out of 5.
