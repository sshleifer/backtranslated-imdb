Loony Tunes has ventured (at least) twice into the future. The first time was with the brilliantly funny "Duck Dodgers". Last time was with this ?? um ?? effort. "Loonatics Unleashed" is not without merit, and could be considered a good product were it not that it does not depend on the quality of Warner Brothers. WB comics are known for their brash humor, which is at least as attractive for adults as it is for children. These episodes of pedestrian superheroes, on the other hand, cannot but convince adults to let them pass. <br /> <br /> The premise of the series is that 6 ordinary individuals (2 bunnies, a Tasmanian devil, a duck, a roadrunner and a coyote) live on the "planet-city" of Acmetropolis and acquire superpowers when a meteorite hits the planet in 2772. What is confusing is that the headlines section presents these individuals with a countdown until 2772 from the 21st century. Cute but disgusting. <br /> <br /> In each episode, the super sextet ?? amidst the amusing but essentially banal jokes ?? fight various super criminals. For the most part, these are the types that appear in every mediocre series of superhero adventures and even some of the best. Like many mediocre superhero series, this takes its villains too seriously for the context. And obviously these guys are the only characters that laugh ?? the usual evil laugh, of course. Why are the bad guys in the predictable adventures of the superheroes always ?? ALWAYS ?? Do you laugh badly at every opportunity? The animated material of this kind seems to leave the laughter exclusively in the province of villains and (occasionally) their servants and / or laborers. <br /> <br /> In fact, the creators of this series have lost their best bets right from the start. Character superpowers are sometimes based on their previous normal abilities, but sometimes not. The problem here is that we don't see enough WB crumb. Lexi and Ace possess generically ordinary biological energy weapons and have practically no personality traits that can be defined as "insect-like". What we have here is basically the silly and shy "Teen Titans", including its overly "modern" animation "look," but with animals. Feh. <br /> <br /> The other flaw of the creators of the program is (or are) the bad guys. As noted before, these are not terribly fanciful and make the evil laugh a little too much. Surprisingly, the writers have totally lost the obvious technique of creating villains from the WB series characters and the protagonists. The addition to the fun could have been, say, Jupiter Sam ?? as well as The Fudd, still chasing wabbits ?? as well as Tech E. Coyote turned into a really neurotic villain ?? and so on. Ah, the sadness of missed opportunities? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all this production ended in too extraordinary (ie a second season). Nevertheless, we can rejoice that there is something new out there for the 14 out of 9 crowd. The rest of us can hope for a third season of Duck Dodgers.
