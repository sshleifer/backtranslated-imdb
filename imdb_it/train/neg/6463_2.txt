I saw Free Money last night and it was the longest 90 minutes of my life. With such an intriguing cast, I really thought it was a surprise, especially since I'm a Brando fan. MISTAKEN! What a waste of talent. It is almost embarrassing to look at times (like the livestock goad scene), and there have been so many missed opportunities for humorous configurations (why didn't they show Charlie Sheen's character about to pick up Brando's truck?) It tries to be a slapstick comedy, but I wasn't really buying it. Skip this. Only for Brando's tough fans. <br /> <br /> I'm giving it 2 out of 10 because I think the worst movie ever made was Skidoo.
