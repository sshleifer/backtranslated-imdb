First of all I would like to point out that Sam Niel is nowhere to be seen in this film. What is a film without Sam Niel. Someone saw Event Horizon. D-Wars had the potential of a movie about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launchers that sounds good but unfortunately it isn't. No, no Sam Niel, no good movie. I recommend taking the $ 5 or so to rent D-Wars and add 10 to five and buy a Sam Niel movie - apparently to present this I must have ten lines of text so here's a list of Sam Niel's films I recommend br /> <br /> - Jurassic park - calm calm - hunt for red October - serene horizon - not jurassic park three <br /> general <br /> D-Wars is a flashlight
