One of my best friends brought this movie for one night with the words "Do you want to see the worst horror movie ever?" I always like to laugh at a bad horror movie and I said yes. I was expecting your typical cheese b-slasher, but this was over B. This is the Z-slasher, the lowest of the bass. Obviously with low budgets, extremely bad acting, terrible lights, no plot, so-called "special effects", flickering video cameras and a horrible soundtrack make films like House of Wax Oscar-winning masterpieces. The only good thing is that about 15 seconds of one of the characters is becoming topless: she has very nice tits. Most of what I said during this film was along the lines of "Wow, actually it is SO BAD", "This is the worst movie ever" and "I'm not drunk enough for that". So in conclusion: don't waste time (or money!).
