<br /> <br /> You would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role, to be a funny movie. This is not the case here. I laughed out loud once during the whole movie, and it wasn't even during the final comedy scene (which would also be the most fun). This is one you can watch when it comes to TV, don't spend any more money to rent it.
