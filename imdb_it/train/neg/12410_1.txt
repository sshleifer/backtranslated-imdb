This film was really terrible. The acting was the worst! It was worse than a student movie. Super cheesy, and I think the worst actor was the old lady. At first I thought to myself, well, it's an old movie. Then I remembered that it's not an excuse! I've seen older movies with better acting and so. <br /> <br /> The music was terrible. It was really rough. The editing was poor (most of the dialog was out of sync). <br /> <br /> Overall, this film does not even deserve a 1. I only looked at it because I was so bored, and the movie barely enjoyed me. It was just ridiculous. My dead grandmother's left little finger could make a better film than this.
