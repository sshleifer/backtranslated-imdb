Much has been written about Purple Rain, the apparent biopic of the quin-essential musician, but I am here to tell you that the film does not deserve its praise. <br /> <br /> First of all let's go for something clear Prince is a great musician and music is the only area where Purple Rain excels. Even the soundtrack is fascinating and if it had been shot exclusively as a concert film it would have been a great experience, unfortunately it is not so and the film has some problems. <br /> <br /> First of all it is the horrendous acting / writing, the character of Prince "The Kid" should come out as a kind of mysterious solitaire of few words, but unfortunately this comes out unbearably. A good solitary character should at least have talkative moments, unfortunately Prince's character rarely has more than a few words of dialogue in the film and it's hard to believe he would get the girl this way. Everything just seems a little out of the way, which is a shame because you can say that this is a character that is terribly in conflict and lives a very complicated live, but we are never allowed to enter it. <br /> <br /> A surprising aspect of this film is how much of this takes place in concert. It seems that the lives of Prince and Morris take second place to performances here, which I think makes sense from a business point of view, but it is exhausting to have a 2-hour movie in which half of it appears to take place on stage, especially when the stories of the character return pushed aside for this. <br /> <br /> So in summary: this is not a great film.
