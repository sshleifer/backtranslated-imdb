Well, I couldn't get into the plot, but this is just for me, maybe. Machine movements sometimes insensitive, however this film has a fascinating vintage quality. The acting is sometimes genuine and fun with the occasional chase sequence that involves poorly dressed women, which was nice. The climax is confused and disjointed, but still ... errant, thanks to Stella Stevens. <br /> <br /> The stunts are interesting, especially for the Las Vegas context of the 70s. In the end there are some freehand jerky movements, which make me think, for a while. But I don't think I have to chase the DVD for now.
