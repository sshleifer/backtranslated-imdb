It was one o'clock at night and I had nothing else to do. Don't judge me ... please. <br /> <br /> We went back in time during the Spanish settlements. A group made its way onto an island. It doesn't take long before they meet a large "reptile", which devours their horse. Soon they are captured by the natives and to obtain freedom they must kill the "reptiles". THE CG sucks; reminds me of the CG of the first video games for consoles. The meetings were lame. The only positive thing I have to say about this was the native hottie running around in a skimpy suit. Otherwise it is only an average effort.
