This sequel is a total rehash of the first movie. A completely useless film. Basically he took every single sceanrio of the first film and reworked it in Omen IV, except with a female antichrist this time. It also ends in the same way as the first! The music is too busy and interfering, and since it's practically a copy of Omen I, it's extremely predictable. It's not a horrible movie, it's not terribly done, there are a lot worse films out there, this simply made absolutely no sense to be done. The 2006 remake of Omen is much worse, even more useless than that, so I guess that's it. If someone put a gun to your head and you had to choose to watch this sequel or the 2006 reamke, I guess I'd choose it.
