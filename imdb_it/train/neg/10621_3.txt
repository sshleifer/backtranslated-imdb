I won't add to the reviews of the plot, it's not very nice. <br /> <br /> Very unlikely orphanage in Bala. <br /> <br /> Cushing and Lee at their height. <br /> <br /> Some beautiful landscapes. <br /> <br /> Good for face spotting, and I quote, "look at the mouth, which is Cassie by Fools and Horses". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, a poor example of the British film industry. <br /> <br /> Fulton MacKay was far better in Fraggle Rock, Keith Barron was better in everything else and Diana Dors did what he did best. <br /> <br /> Redemption features? He was free to watch on the Horror channel before going on to recording. I will not endorse this effort.
