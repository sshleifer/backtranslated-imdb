This is, without a doubt, the most offensive "animation film" I've seen in years, if ever. The writing and the characterizations are so full of stereotypes that the film verges on parody. Before leaving the theater an hour and five minutes after this disaster, we were subjected to the following issues: having a child will solve all your problems, the "types of performers" are miserable messes, and musicians cannot be good mothers except launch their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle. What a waste of a talented cast and some high-impact sets and costumes. When Natasha Richardson told Toni Collette that if she doesn't live a more traditional life, she will end up - shuddering - "alone!", I felt nauseated. I can't believe this movie came to the film version. It's the kind of fare you'd expect from those "female" cable channels that I always spend close to channel surfing. I'm a woman and I'm over 35, so I should be part of the target audience for this movie, but boy, "Evening" misses the target.
