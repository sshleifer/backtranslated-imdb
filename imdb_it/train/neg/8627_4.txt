Although this is generally a cheese jungle adventure movie, it has some highlights: the settings are pretty nice and the pace of the adventure is good. You will not be bored watching it. <br /> <br /> Keith is the most ventilated possible to play the eponymous protagonist, a drunken jungle guide shanghai'd in the rich guy Van Hoffman and his gorgeous wife Doccia on an expedition hunting in the cannibal country. He never takes things seriously. The shower is there as decoration and Keith makes extensive use of her - he doesn't really have to play much. She is not the only female to show her body and the itchy aspects of the film do it approximately at the halfway point of a photo T / A. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this film that can attract the specific attention on it, or away from it. Produced to be shlock, it succeeds without too many stories. A good 2 AM cable programmer.
