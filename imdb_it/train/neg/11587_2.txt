This is just like the sixth movie. The film is really bad. It offers nothing in the department of death. One liners are bad and they are something that should not be in a NOES movie. Freddy comes out like a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing worth it. The characters are extremely underdeveloped. All in all better than the sixth, but still one of the worst films in the series. My vote 2/10
