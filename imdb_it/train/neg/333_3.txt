I remember when THE GOLDEN CHILD came out in 1986 it was universally crushed by the critics, and I'm talking so badly that Eddie Murphy's brilliant career ended more or less so I imagine this film has something to do <br /> Buddhist monks kneel before a child with a blank expression on his face. The bad guys enter the temple <br /> <br /> The children sit with an empty expression <br /> <br /> The bad guys put up the monks <br /> <br /> The children sit with an empty expression <br / > <br /> The bad guys bring out a giant bird cage and attack the child inside that now sits with ... Keep guessing? You get the impression that even if they brought him to a pajama party at Michael Jackson's wonderland ranch, he would still have the same empty expression, this film would be better titled THE WOODEN CHILD <br /> title and, being a film of the 80s, the pop soundtrack is heavy. Obviously this could have been cool and funky at the moment, but now in 2004 it looks very dated. Not only that, but it is completely filled with the rather bloody opening. In fact, this is the main problem (and boy is it serious) with this film - The whole mood seems to change from one scene to another so much that sometimes it's like watching completely different movie scenes together . I blame the director personally, but it should also be emphasized that both the writer and the producer should share the same fault equally. Did anyone know before the shooting started what kind of movie it would be? It's part of the fantasy, part of the martial arts, part of the film, part of the comedy and it's all shit
