When you make a witchcraft thriller, I think you should do everything you can to help the audience stop disbelief to make the movie work. Some images ("Rosemary's Baby", for example) have realized this; others (such as "Necromancy") do not have it and the potentially scary material is trivial and stupid. This film has some atmospheric moments, but about half of the dialogue is hard to understand (sometimes it's poorly recorded, sometimes just incomprehensible) and Orson Welles, who gets the maximum billing, has a role that's so WELL that you have to assume he was desperate for work. Or maybe he was just having fun ..... (* 1/2)
