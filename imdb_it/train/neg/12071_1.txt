Terrible ... just terrible. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And I've seen some pretty bad images over the years. The sound sucks as well as the quality of the image, the direction, the acting ... etc. Etc. The only good shots (in the sense that they are fun, because they are so bad) are the special effects. Altogether there are about 5 minutes of laughter. The rest of the film gives you brain damage.
