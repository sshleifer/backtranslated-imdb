Ah, Lucio Fulci, rest in peace. This notorious Italian is the most famous <br /> for "Zombie" and the absolutely unwatchable "The <br /> <br /> Psychic" and "Manhattan Baby". Well, add it to the list of unsatisfiable <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The plot, so to speak, concerns a nekkid woman wearing a gold mask <br /> <br /> and a G-string. He wants the power of a young nicknamed stallion who has a series of magic arrows and a bow. They are magical <br /> <br /> because they shine. Arrow boy joins a guy with an ugly wig, <br /> <br /> and they spend most of the movie redeeming each other from flat action sequences <br /> <br />. In the end, the nekkid chick is defeated, but not <br /> <br /> before taking off his mask and reminding me why I broke up with my high school girl with <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Fulci bathes every stroke in an orange glow and fills the screen with <br /> <br /> smoke. Nothing like a smoky orange action sequence to make you want Sunny Delight and a cigarette. The special effects are <br /> <br /> ridiculous. In a sequence, our ambiguously gay couple is <br /> <br /> attacked by dozens of arrows that are obviously staples on the movie <br /> <br />. Most of the effects budget must have been spent on Fulci-licious blood, which consists entirely of wounds <br /> <br /> wounds. Hey, we can all use a nice wound that flows once in a <br /> <br /> while, but when you get into the excessive shedding of the wound, it gets boring. <br /> <br /> I kept playing with the brightness setting on my TV anyway <br /> <br /> just to see what the hell was going on. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of talk about giveaways and fulfilling prophecies, so let me <br /> <br /> take a small look at the future ... if you find this movie and watch it, <br /> < br /> you will regret it. The scene on the video box (by Media) does not appear <br /> in the film in any context. "Conquest" is a work with <br /> <br />. What MST3K could have done with this! <br /> <br /> This is assessed (R) for strong physical violence, severe violence, female nudity, brief male nudity and mild sexual content. <br /> <br />
