Really ugly film, the story is too simple and predictable and mediocre acting. <br /> <br /> The story of this vampire hunter is the worst I've seen so far, Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi), travels to Mexico in search of some blood suckers !, he uses some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to Blade), and is he part of Van Helsig's vampire hunter network?, OK, but he works alone. He is assigned to search for a powerful vampire queen who seeks a black crucifix to perform a ritual that will make it invulnerable to sunlight (it's almost a sequel to Vampires (1998), directed by John Carpenter and starring James Woods), Derek begins his search for the queen's quest with some new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, a really bad acting also) an inexperienced teenager, father Rodrigo (Cristian De la Fuente) a Catholic priest, Zoey (Natasha Wagner) a particular vampire and Ray Collins (Darius McCrary) another experienced vampire hunter. So obviously, in this adventure he is not alone. <br /> <br /> You can start to feel how this film would look at its protagonist (Jon Bon Jovi); it's a huge difference in the quality of acting compared to James Woods, and then, if you watch the film (I don't recommend this part), you'll be involved in one of the simplest, totally predictable stories, with terrible recitations, really bad special effects and events inconsistent! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend not to see this movie, rent another movie, see another channel, go out with your friends, etc. <br /> <br /> 3/10
