Johnny Weissmuller's latest film as "King of the Jungle", after 16 years in the role, TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS, is destined to disappoint everyone except the most daring of his fans. At 44, the ex-Olympian, one of Hollywood's most active "party animals", has long outgrown his youth's athleticism, and seemed tired (even though he was in marginally better conditions than his previous one, TARZAN AND THE HUNTRESS). <br /> <br /> Not only did Weissmuller become too old for his role; Johnny Sheffield, the "boy" par excellence, had become an adult (he was 17), so it was written outside the screenplay, under the pretext of being "away from school". Brenda Joyce, at 35, appeared in her fourth of five films as "Jane" (she would have provided the transition when Lex Barker would become the new Tarzan, in 1949, the MAGIC FOUNTAIN of TARZAN) and was still absolutely sexy as ever. > <br /> Produced by Sol Lesser, at the RKO, with a minimum budget, the cast and crew took advantage of the cheapest labor for shooting in Mexico. While the location gave a decidedly Hispanic air to what was presumably the darkest Africa, veteran director Robert Florey used the country extensively, incorporating the cliff and an Aztec temple in history. <br /> <br /> When a young girl from the island (Tyrone The future bride of Power, Linda Christian) is saved in a jungle river by Tarzan, she learns that a local high priest (George Zucco, one of the villains most lasting of the film) had practically enslaved the local population, threatening the remuneration of a living "God" they do not make his orders. The girl had been chosen to become the bride of "God", so she fled. Faster than one might say, "Is it a stupid plot or WHAT?", The girl is kidnapped by the priest's henchmen and returns to the island, and Tarzan, followed by Jane, the colorful Spanish character 'Benjy' (played by John Laurenz, who sings different melodies), and a government commissioner left to hire the divinity and his priest (poor Cheeta remained behind). After a series of discoveries (the "God" is simply a scammer in an Aztec mask, working with the priest to milk the rich pearl beds of the island), a bit of litigious action, comic relief and Benjy songs, everything reaches the expected happy conclusion. <br /> <br /> Extraordinarily, TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS presents a musical score by the brilliant composer of the film, Dimitri Tiomkin, and is far better than what you would expect from this 'B' movie! <br /> <br /> While the film would have provided a less fortunate conclusion to Weissmuller's time in Tarzan's loincloth (he would have immediately played Jungle Jim, a more eloquent variant of the Ape Man, in khaki), the talent involved raised the total product at least a little above the total disorder that could have been. <br /> <br /> Tarzan was about to do a trick and become much sexier ...
