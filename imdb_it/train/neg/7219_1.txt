I still find it difficult to understand that such a bad film could be made in Hollywood. Acting and history are simply pathetic and the direction is terrible. I don't see any logic behind this junk, apart from the fact that the director had nothing good to do. It took me ten minutes to realize that I had wasted my precious thirty rupees. It filled me with dismay that I would lose some time of my life in this shit. I bet the film was made in less than a day. I don't know which category to fall into. Please avoid this movie at all costs, just do anything, even banging your head against the walls, but don't go for this movie.
