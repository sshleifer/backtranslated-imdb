I found this film an interesting study of cause and effect but little more than that. The basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions (deliberate or not) influence the lives of others. The premise of the film is very promising, but I believe it does not keep its promises. He spends too much time telling the public the chaos theory and too little time to show it. As a result, I've never had a real feeling for any of the characters and I've never had a good emotional connection with them. At the end of the film, I had an attitude "so what" about all of them. A stronger direction in character development would have made this film great, but as it is it is just so-so
