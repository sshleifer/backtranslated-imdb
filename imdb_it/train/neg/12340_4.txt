"Transylvania 6-5000" is an insignificant but sometimes funny and fascinating horror parody of the 80s with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of real opportunities to giggle in the script. Two journalists bozo of a tabloid gossip are sent, much against their will, to Transylvania to make a story about the alleged return of the mad scientist Frankenstein. There are some lovely little tricks and details to be discovered on the right and left in the film, such as a small guillotine for boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are used to cream and sugar at the breakfast table. The sound of the film, however, does not have the success that it could and should have been, with too long jokes and parodistic situations. The production of Roger Corman "Transylvania Twist", released four years later, is much more fun and much more recommended. The film parodies especially the classic universal milestones of the 1930s, so make sure you have seen them if you want to capture all the little gags and references. There is an original twist that indicates that the character of Frankenstein behaves like an evil and mad scientist when he enters his laboratory. It is also revealed that it is actually more of a kind of messiah than Father Damien who cares only about the condition of the exiled monsters. Michael Richards, the crazy guy who plays Kramer in Seinfeld, plays the role of a psychotic butler who appears and disappears in the most inappropriate moments. I'm pretty sure the character of John Turturro in "Mr. Deeds" was inspired by the role of Richards here.
