Boring, long, pretentious, repetitive, self-involved ?? this move seemed like a bad date. Worse still, the boring art school direction - with massive use of the swirling blow that becomes so exaggerated almost made me vomit ?? - is constantly screaming to be noticed. Add the thinner, virtually no-dialogue plot, and the film begins to look like a four-hour epic about 30 minutes. It gets worse: instead of dialogue there are sadly written comments and quotes and songs that comment too clearly on the characters. Even really noisy opera music. To blame the director. <br /> <br /> The actors are all pretty good. The main actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is particularly suitable for the celebrity of the cinema. He and the other actors have some tender erotic moments. Even these start to get boring after 5 minutes, however, and one wonders if the director is rehearsing for a Bel Ami porn job. The incredible architecture of the university campus as a location in Mexico City is inspirational. Why are universities in the United States so insignificant (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD on this film. Do you recommend using the fast scan button ?? A lot.
