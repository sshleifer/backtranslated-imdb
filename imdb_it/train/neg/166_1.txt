Ok, first of all, I didn't sit down and watch the first of a "Star Trek" series to see a cowboy fly into space. this is how a normal Enterprise episode works <br /> <br /> 1 Archer finds a nebula or something and wants to take a closer look but it could destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> 2 send a shuttle into the nebula and the shuttle is damaged ... <br /> <br /> in all the episodes I've seen, all the problems are happening because of Archer's stupid mistakes . Oh, did you see the preview of an episode showing Archer's and T'pol's kisses?!?!?!?!?!?!? I was going to watch that episode, but later I finally gave up on Enterprise and turned to TV. Come on!!!! This is Star Trek !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Also what was with the banana snail ?? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana bullet, but he had to leave it for some stupid reason. Okay, you little idiot to bring you the bullet in space but whatever. Ok that was what I thought until they left it on a deserted planet !!!!! A SLUG BANANA CANNOT LEAVE IN A DESERT !!!!!!!!!!!! How stupid these writers are <br /> <br /> In any case, just saying if the Enterprise is active DO NOT WATCH IT !!!!!
