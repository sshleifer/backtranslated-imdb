Debbie Reynolds' toes, tangos and, yes, tap-dance make their way through this normal thriller that has a decidedly 1930s feel. Two ladies, gathered when their children commit a murder, try to start their life by running a tap-dance school for children in Hollywood. The problem is that one of them is afflicted with neurosis. Can you imagine this 10 years before with Robert Aldrich who directed Bette Davis and Joan Crawford ...? Nahh, Bette would never have allowed Joan so much screen time to show off her things, and I can't imagine Bette Davis in the other role, dancing the tap from her heart. This is a piece of purely fake macabre, written by a trembling Henry Farrell (whose idea of ​​a good "shock" is to stage the mass murder of a group of rabbits!). Not an ounce of honest fun in the entire lukewarm package. * 1/2 from ****
