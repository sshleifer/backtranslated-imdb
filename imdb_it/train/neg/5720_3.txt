Some friends of Gorehound have recommended me "Live Feed", and basically I can't really complain because the film certainly provides a plentiful supply of obscenities and buckets full of fiasco, but obviously it's not a great film. More than obviously on the latest trend of horror movies, the so-called Torture Porn, Ryan Nicholson tries to outdo every other film in this subgenre (and which includes role models "Hostel" and "Saw") with his sick & ill effects twisted make-up and carefully depraved blows of tried naked co-editors, suffering and begging for their lives. There is no real plot to describe. Five friends twenty-nine completely without brains make a trip to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but apart from that I really don't know why they opted to travel there instead of Cancun. They are clearly not interested in the culture of the continents and even cause a frantic scene when they see a local slaughterhouse slaughtering a cute little dog on the market. The quintet then dives into the filthy night of life and one of them accidentally insults the head of a criminal clan. A simple excuse is clearly not enough, as the gangster follows them in an adult theater and gradually submits them to vicious torture. A girl has impaled breasts and another poor girl even has a poisonous snake pushed down her throat; yikes. "Live Feed" is surprisingly boring despite all the bloodshed and amateur production values ​​are quite difficult to overlook, even if you're used to watching independent junk fan-movies like this. The fat man depicted on the cover, an oriental executioner of S & M, is certainly pretty cool and is also the most talented of the whole group, because at least he keeps his mouth shut all the time. I wouldn't recommend this pile of dirt exactly, but hey, if you like strong and horrible metal sounds, sickening tortures and losers, go ahead and watch!
