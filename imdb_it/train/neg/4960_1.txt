I'm a big fan of Batman comics and I was disappointed when I couldn't find Batman: The Animated Series on TV anymore. I was excited that there would be a new Batman cartoon on TV. I saw the first episode the day it was previewed and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, the animation is very poor. It looks like a cheap, lousy Japanese anime. Then again, almost all the cartoons of today are like this. <br /> <br /> The characters are even worse. Batman looks more like Birdman, Catwoman looks more like Chihuahuawoman, Bane looks more like a red version of Hulk, Penguin is a Kung-Fu master, Mr. Freeze is an undead thing with an iceberg on his head, and the Riddler is a Gothic look by Marilyn Manson (which is fun because I don't expect people to be obsessed with puzzles and puzzles to be Gothic). <br /> <br /> The worst character design is that of the Joker. They turned him into a monkey / crazy Bob Marley / Kung-Fu fighter! The Joker should be Batman's most lethal enemy, but on this show it does not pose a threat because his crimes are so stupid and useless. In one episode his plan was to put his Joker poison in dog food! Oh, that's bad! Batman is a fascinating and complex character because he is obsessed with the death of his parents, which is why he fights crime. This version of Batman does not seem infested by the death of his parents and is not at all interesting. He's not even a detective, just a fighter. If there is an enemy he cannot defeat, he will not study the enemy to find out his weaknesses like a detective would, he will build a giant combat robot to defeat them. A lot of times this show doesn't even feel like a Batman show, just another mindless soul that is nothing but a meaningless fight. <br /> <br /> What I hate most about this show is what they did to the bad guys. They took away everything that makes them funny and recognizable and turned them into bad bad stereotypes. Man-Bat is the biggest example. In comics, he is a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his deafness. Experimenting on himself, he turns casually into a giant bat creature. In this show, he is a mad scientist who purposely wants to turn himself into a giant bat creature for no apparent reason. Almost all the bad guys are like that; none of them, with the exception of about one or two, has a real reason for their crimes. <br /> <br /> The worst characterization is that of Mr. Freeze. In the comics, Freeze was a mad scientist until the brilliant writer Paul Dini wrote the BTAS episode "Heart of Ice", which gave Freeze a new origin that made him a more tragic, three-dimensional and likable villain. The episode was so popular that the fans accepted it as its true origin and it was even used in comics as its origin. Even that lousy movie that Batman and Robin used as its origin. In this show, he is a small jewel thief before becoming Mr. Freeze. After becoming Mr. Freeze, guess what? IT'S STILL a little jewel thief! Great origin It's no wonder they used it compared to the one created by Dini. <br /> <br /> As a Batman fan, I don't like this show just because it's not like comics because I also liked BTAS, the Batman cartoons that came later, Tim Burton's Batman movies and, of course , the superb films by Christopher Nolan Batman. None of them was 100% loyal to the comics, but they were still very good. The problem with this show is not that it's not exactly like comics or BTAS, it's that it lacks any kind of depth that makes other Batman media so popular. <br /> <br /> I gave this show so many possibilities, but the more I look at it, the more I find it disappoints me. I miss the good old days when Batman cartoons were something that everyone could appreciate.
