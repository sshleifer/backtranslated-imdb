Give this a generous four four out of ten stars, or points or markers, or something. <br /> <br /> There were a total of two very funny scenes in this film. All the scenes with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear !!) moved quite nicely. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the usual traffic of stereotypes, incredible speed, driven by a stupid soundtrack, and "soundtrack" is generous. <br /> <br /> However, the two really funny scenes were about Amy P. She is really hilarious in a certain type of animal. It's a mixture of that asshole they do on SNL and Lucille Ball. <br /> <br /> I hope they (Amy P and Tina Fey) stated that they did this for the money, because if they did they started Sarah Palin's parodies, so I guess we can say, yes, it is it was worth putting the nigger again as the servant, who is really there to help you be more human. <br /> <br /> Blah. 4 out of 10 as I said is generous. <br /> <br /> But no more, girls, OK? Oh, I almost forgot. The mother of "Two and a Half Men" is in this film, and has had some sort of plastic surgery, so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a thirty-year-old, so every scene she's in, it's like trying to reorganize his face, or put it together in my mind, or just answer the question, "No. Wait, wait, did you have plastic surgery?" Because as a spectator, you really don't want her to have plastic surgery.
