Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 is the pinnacle. It has already been said before, this is what you get when half the crew fell asleep at work, unfortunately half of the gameplay did. Don't get me wrong, it's fun, but you get tired of pressing buttons. As for the plot summary, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA ... There is no plot. Defeat that boy at the end and win! Eh, who does it alone anyway?
