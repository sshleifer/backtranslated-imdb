This film is not very good. It's boring, and not much blood for a horror movie. The plot follows and not much happens. And I think the female vampire was so stupid. He had a lot of chances to kill vampire hunters because he shows that he has the lighting as the reflections. But, whenever he has a stuck one, he takes his time and something always happens where he doesn't bite them. No wonder this went straight to the cable. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: It's not even remotely as good as the first vampire movie. You're a HUNTER if you waste time with this.
