The 1963 version of "The Haunting" was for years one of my favorite horror films, so I anticipated the release of this 1999 remake with a good deal of trepidation. It seemed almost impossible that any follow-up could exceed or even match the original masterpiece. Unfortunately my worries were well founded: this film stinks. <br /> <br /> I don't know what the people involved in this film thought. Jan De Bont, who seemed to have had a stroke of luck when he directed the excellent "Speed", does badly (or maybe even worse) as he did with the much acclaimed "Twister" and "Speed ​​2: Cruise Control ". "Hey Jan, follow the cinematography, right? Liam Neeson is adequate in his role as a psychologist who pretends to be a sleeper - I don't think he's capable of turning a really bad performance - but even he can't save a lame script and weak story Catherine Zeta Jones demonstrates once again (as she did in "Entrapment") that she lacks the ability to act above the material that is delivered to her. The female protagonist, who was very good in an episode of "The X- Files, "she seems lost here like Eleanor, an insomniac who is hovering on the brink of sanity. And that blond boy, whoever he is, is more wood than the strange strange statuettes of children carved into woodwork around the house. that changes expression once during the entire movie. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS AHEAD) <br /> <br /> The reason the first movie worked so well is because we were never sure if the the house was really infested a or if the demonstrations were the result of Eleanor's precarious mental state. No spirit is actually seen in the original, leaving little to the imagination - a hallmark of other great horror films like "The Changeling" and "The Blair Witch Project". In this updated version, of course, we receive tons of CGI ghosts, which fundamentally (despite the weak script / plot) make the movie absolutely unlucky. The f / x aren't even that big, considering they were made by ILM. The frozen breath seems particularly false. The effects in the underestimated Peter Jackson film "The Frighteners", which I saw just before this, were much better. The children's wooden sculptures, which should look scary, seem only silly (especially when they scream), and CGI monsters are nothing to write about. Rather than providing relief from bad acting, bad direction and bad writing, the effects only add to this chaos of a movie. <br /> <br /> Some particularly stupid scenes: when the other three characters break into Eleanor's bedroom and none of them seem at all surprised to find a huge frowning demon hovering over the bed. The scene where Eleanor "sees" the former lady of the house hanging from the beams ... acting here is particularly bad. And last but not least, the unintentionally exhilarating piece in which Wooden Blond Guy utters an uninspired cry of what should be anguish, jumps on a piece of furniture and starts cutting the painting of the old, evil man who built the house . In this scene we get some satisfaction, because a few seconds after his attack, Blond Guy is dragged before the fireplace by the ghost of the old man and promptly his head is cut from the chimney. It was the only part of the film that I liked. <br /> <br /> In summary, follow the original "The Haunting" from 1963. 3/10 stars.
