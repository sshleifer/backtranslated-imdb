Recently I was online looking at a site that contained public domain films. In their long list of films there was this film and I thought I had to be hallucinated with such an offensive title and premise. But no, that's just what it was. And since the film was only 27 minutes long, I decided to try it. If it turned out to be a porn movie, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre film I've ever seen. The Danish production crew tried, with a budget of around $ 49, to make a Star Trek-style movie about a crew of very gay men who traveled around the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all women - how they proceeded to do on Earth! And in any case, they were greeted with applause and thanks by the gay men of the planet. <br /> <br /> Thin, it is not. With some of the most obscene and youthful character names I've ever heard, I don't even think I can write them on IMDb without removing my review! However, despite the utter disgust of it all, it was strangely watchable and worthy of a peek. But, as I have already said, because of the raw names and the strange subjects (even if not nudity), it is a movie only for adults. <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie left me 1001 questions about WHO would do it, WHY did it and WHO was the intended audience ?! It may not be the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's probably the strangest and perhaps the most offensive!
