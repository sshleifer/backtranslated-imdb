This was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful but that's where it ends. It seemed like a not brilliant Set It Off meets The West. The plot barely made sense. There were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities. There were also useless things going on that did not relate to the plot and did not further help the story. There were also long empty moments in which the plot could be explored but used for silence or useless conversations. The script should have made more sense as well as the direction. I had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie. But the casting was great in my opinion. If you're just looking at candy, this is the movie for you.
