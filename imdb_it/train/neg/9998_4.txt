Towards the end of the film, I felt he was too technical. I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our Navy rescues at sea. I liked to see that the engines have fire extinguishers. I guess I should have understood that before, but I never thought about it. Using a 747 to carry precious antique paintings with very little security is strange and unrealistic. The acting was pretty good, since they are mostly experienced professionals, but if you're going to stretch so far away from what will most likely happen, it should be more like a fantasy, comic, etc. Everything has been taken too seriously. At least the film had Felix Ungar as a pilot, with Buck Rogers, the night stalker and Dracula also on board. The film was full of familiar faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a little for the drama, but it damages the quality of a film when a serious subject is turned into a caricature. That's why I said it should have been more comical. My gripe in air travel movies is that everyone moves randomly. They walk around with drinks, arranging them and collecting them 5 minutes later, just as if they were in a building or something, and acting as if turbulence didn't exist. Also, I know it's a catastrophic movie, but the suspense doesn't have to include a 30-second stop after hitting something. However, the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak screenplay from being turned into a film that was boxed after its first showing. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to see a psychotic person dressed up ... :)
