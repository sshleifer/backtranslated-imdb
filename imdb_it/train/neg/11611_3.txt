Lady in Cement - Pi spoof with ole Blue Eyes.Frank Sinatra is a shamus on a houseboat in Miami in this rarely funny "comedy". Satisfied by an annoying and repetitive Hugo Montenegro score and a series of wrong jokes, this 1968 film never rises above a bit too obscene to be on TV for the state of a television movie. Dan Blocker is effective in the role of great galoot by Mike Mazurski / Ted De Corsia and Raquel Welch should thank his personal trainer. The only thing that makes the DVD worth seeing is a collection of cheese trailers for Welch films like Bandolero, Fantastic Voyage, Mother, Jugs & Speed ​​and Myra Breckinridge. Even if you get the DVD, skip the predictable movie and go for the trailer library in the special features. Sinatra lisps @ the homosexual owners of the Go-Go venue. A relic that must be put back into the time capsule. D
