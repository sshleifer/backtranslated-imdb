I must prefigure this by saying that I am a great romantic. So I really wanted this movie. So I'm writing my thoughts to save the rest of you from the disappointment I felt watching him. The Leap Years tells the story full of destiny of Li-Ann who falls in love with the sweet Jeremy and they commit themselves to satisfy every leap year. A very romantic premise, based on a great short story and with a cast that doesn't seem to watch another movie by Jack Neo. So why oh, why is it so ugly? First of all, I think the filmmakers thought they were shooting a music video, because they chose to replace the narrative and any real emotion with cheesy montages, predictable actions and clich√© lines. I am at the same time upset and embarrassed to have been one of the first in Singapore to watch The Leap Years, but those of us at the movies would agree that our muffled moans from the worthy performances spoke willingly. My hope was to watch a romantic movie that would surpass Forever Fever, the best Singaporean romantic comedy so far, and The Leap Years doesn't even come close. Some blogs have called it The Crap Years which is tough but ultimately true. Don't waste your money or your emotions like I did. The film will make you surrender to love forever.
