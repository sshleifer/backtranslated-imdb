1 is quite generous here. I really appreciated BOOGEYMAN, even if it's not really the BOOGEYMAN promoted on the DVD cover and we all know it! It scared me. But this movie is something else. To be directed by a guy who has been around a long time and directed a lot of movies, it looks like it was shot on a VHS camera by a 10-year-old child! History and acting are atrocious! David Hess, you disappointed me too. Have you played one of the most dangerous criminals in the history of cinema, have you resorted to this? However, the story and acting could have been forgiven if someone had had time to make the video a bit professional. There are many movies shot on video that do not seem to us, or at least they are not so obvious that it distracts your attention from the film. I can't say it's the worst movie ever, because I couldn't get past the entire movie, but it's certainly close.
