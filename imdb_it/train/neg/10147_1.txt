Usually I don't comment (I read the opinions of others) ... but this, I have to comment ... I was convinced to watch this movie with worlds like action, F-117 and other hi-tech things, but just a few first minutes and I changed my mind ... Lousy acting, lousy script and a great science fiction. <br /> <br /> It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> Simply ... don't disturb ... <br /> <br /> And one more thing, before each film I usually check users' comments and the evaluation on this site ... 3.7 points and I give this film is a test, now I wonder WHO is the evaluation of this film giving it more than 2 points ?? ??????
