In what would be his first script, based on his story "Turn About", William Faulkner offers a bizarre story of loyalty, sacrifice and really strange relationships. The story originally concerned only the characters of Tone, Young and Cooper, but MGM needed to put Joan Crawford in another picture to fulfill his contract, and Faulkner was forced to create a female role. Crawford insisted that his lines were written in the same style as his co-star Young and Tone, leading to an involuntary hilarity as these three communicate in a shorthand similar to a telegraph that looks like a Monty Python (" Wuthering Heights "executed in the traffic light). Seriously, the sentences almost completely devoid of sentences make Ernest Hemingway like Henry James. <br /> <br /> The film also reflects some familiar Faulkner themes, with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister (as can be found in his "Sanctuary" and elsewhere). When Young proposes to Crawford, in the presence of Tone, in place of an engagement ring, ALL THREE exchange the rings engraved with one another. Also the proximity of Tone and Young is remarkable, especially when they go to their fate Thelma & Louise. Frankly, it's creepy. <br /> <br /> Not so scary for this New Yorker, however, as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach, Wellington, which Crawford cheerfully captures (and which is shown to play with his hands - I had to turn my back!) and Young turns into a gladiator. Blech. <br /> <br /> Having said that, there are some nice interpretations. Young is particularly engaging in a scene in which he is involved in the Cooper fighter, and Roscoe Karns is delightful as Cooper's flight companion. Tone, despite his inability to express himself through a realistic dialogue, has a beautiful moment, throwing his furtive tears at the fate of his friend Young. Even Crawford, devoid of significant dialogues, appears mostly as wood or melodramatic, which is rather a balancing act for a role. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes - not surprisingly, for a Howard Hawks movie - is the most exciting part of the whole picture. But not enough. As for me, it is 75 minutes of my life that I will never return.
