Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov are a very unlikely couple in a not very nice film. <br /> <br /> The film promises that Ustinov was released from prison for embezzlement. He persuades Robert Morley to leave so he can assume his identity and start hacking computers in a very elegant company run by Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, another unusual movie duo. <br /> <br /> Morley only plays as he did in 1938 "Marie Antoinette". Maybe he needed to get back to that kind. <br /> <br /> This film is ridiculous at best. Hard to believe that the following year, Maggie Smith totally changed her habits and gave a shocking performance at the Oscar in "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie". <br /> <br /> Ms. Smith is here to be an apparent mute head, but at the end of the film, she is the brain of the dress. Too bad the writing didn't go well with her.
