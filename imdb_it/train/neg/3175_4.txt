"So there is this bride, see, and she is crushed to death by this statue that falls on her on her wedding day. So, take this, a year later, your ex-boyfriend falls in love with a beautiful psychic ?? and then, that beautiful psychic is haunted by the ghost of the unsatisfied dead bride who wants to prevent her from stealing her boyfriend ?? he will be funny! "A polite smile. <br /> <br /> This, I like to imagine, is like Jeff Lowell, the man who dreamed of "Over Her Dead Body", presented his concept to the studio executives over there at New Line Cinema. The big mystery is how those same corporate bigwigs could then turn around and give the green light to the project, allowing Lowell to direct the film and write the script. <br /> <br /> If you think that no film could possibly ever be as bad as this original premise sounds, then clearly you have another thought coming. The only way it could have worked is if the writer had simply gone mad and turned into a satirical farce with no holds barred. Instead, wanting to make sure that they have created a blurry, harmless and warm romantic comedy, Lowell engages in boring half measures at every stage, mitigating the absurdity in favor of the squalid conventionality. In fact, "Over Her Dead Body" is so deeply inept and little fun that it's hard to know where exactly Lowell thought he was going with him. Virtually every set-up, joke and gag seen in the film is flat and poorly executed, with even the same actors apparently aware of their situation. How else to explain the lifeless performances of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles? <br /> <br /> I chose not to blame the actors, some of whom have shown their talent in better vehicles in the past (this is particularly the case with Rudd). But Lowell and those studio managers certainly have a little "shameless" to do.
