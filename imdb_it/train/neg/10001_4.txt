This film lacked something on which I could not point the finger at first: charisma on the part of the leading actress. This inevitably resulted in a lack of chemistry when he shared the screen with his protagonist. Even the romantic scenes were simply actors. It could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors. I do not know. <br /> <br /> But could it have been the script? Just exactly who was the chef in love with? He seemed more in love with his cooking skills and his restaurant, and ultimately himself and his youthful endeavors, rather than anyone else. He never convinced me that he was in love with the princess. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this movie. But, don't forget that he was nominated for an Oscar, so judge yourself.
