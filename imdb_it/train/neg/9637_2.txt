Boy, this was a lousy movie! While I haven't seen all the Burton / Taylor collaborations, I can say with certainty that this is the worst. This rich but sick woman (Taylor, of course) owns this beautiful island in the Mediterranean, reigning over a trained staff when it is suddenly visited by this itinerant poet, who mumbles banality. In fact, the whole movie is just a talk fest, with many of the words meaningless. Even in 1968, no one could make the head or tail of these alleged absurdities, and the passage of time makes it even clearer. If it were not for the beautiful photography and the scenery, it would deserve a negative assessment. The only positive thing about this film is its involuntary laughter at the expense of the stars.
