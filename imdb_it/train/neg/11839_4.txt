"The Cat's Meow" contains some scenes that boast clever dialogues and some beautiful performances, some of which have surprised me. Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected from Chaplin (partly thanks to an excellent hairdresser and makeup work by a talented designer); Joanna Lumley is compelling as a novelist Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst is winning like Marion Davies (although the reason why movies never use her stutter in real life is hard to explain). But these elements do not add up to a successful set. The writer seems to have worked very hard on some scenes - the meetings between Davies and Chaplin are particularly well done - but not so difficult on the big picture. Several minor characters don't need to be there, and they don't behave consistently. The basic plot is full of illogical (for example, why does Thomas Ince think it's a good idea to tell Hearst something he doesn't really want to hear?), And the party scenes are repetitive and boring. I would like to think that a trip on the Hearst yacht was more fun than indicated in the film. Davies is characterized by a standard type of sparkling flapper, which is not very accurate, and the writer's ideas about Chaplin and love are not plausible. <br /> <br /> Strangely, Bogdanovich, who seemed so attached to the Thirties in "Paper Moon", lacks a similar affinity for the 1920s. He insisted that the excellent costume designer used only black and cream, which gives party guests a very artificial appearance and reproduces only the most stereotyped tunes of the period (eg "Yes, we have no bananas"). When Hearst insists on all "Charleston, Charleston!" it seems that the actors had a ten-minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot. <br /> <br /> The lives of silent movie stars can make fascinating films, I'm sure, but not this time.
