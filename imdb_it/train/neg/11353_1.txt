Today I visited an Athenian cinema with my two children (6 and 8 years old), I paid 3 x 12 euros (about 45 dollars total) not to mention gas, popcorn and soda, I was asked to return my special glasses 3d after leaving the theater he was "forced" to look at what could have been a great masterpiece of the 3D movie, but it turned out to be just an evil propaganda film like the "cold war", like no one I've ever seen in last 20 years ... AND THIS HAS BEEN BEING A FILM FOR CHILDREN ... IN THE NAME OF SKY! PS 1: The average Greek working does not make more than 850 euros per month (approximately 1050 US $) <br /> <br /> PS 2 My children liked it ... but then again they are nothing but children > in Greek: blackberry, idiots> like the one who wrote the script and the others who made this "3D dishonor" happen. <br /> <br /> The 3D animation of PS 3 is fantastic but to those who give ....!
