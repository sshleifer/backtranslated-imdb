This insipid mini-operetta with an Eddy-McDonald prototype in a Valentino scenario is so bad that it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes. It is silly from the start, as this brevity opens two soldiers who discuss the lack of manhood in the son of one of the officers. In less than a minute he was expelled to Morocco where he lived a double life as Red Shadow; the head of an Arab tribe who would rather sing than fight. <br /> <br /> Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare have beautiful light opera voices (with little acting ability) and there is also a decent bass, but the acting is such random scenes, so ill-prepared, they give you the impression that they are doing things as they go along. <br /> <br /> This two reel was part of a larger theatrical production that lists six writers. With more room for spoofing and warble the show may have had some entertainment values, but this quickie quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the function to be presented.
