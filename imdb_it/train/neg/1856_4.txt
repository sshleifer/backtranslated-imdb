I'm so happy and surprised that there's so much interest in this movie! Jack Frost was my introduction to the films produced and distributed by A-pix entertainment, and without exception, everything this company deals with is pure shit! First, and this is very important, never look at this film soberly! Why would you want to? Unlike many other bad films, this seems to me to have been intentionally done wrong. I can't understand how false the snowman is, which is why it is always shown only briefly, the way it moves is the best! This film is Waaaaaaaaaaay better than Michael Keaton's piece of shit, because it was also made to be a good movie, and that version is as bad as this.
