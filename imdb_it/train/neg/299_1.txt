This was the third remake of SLEEPING WITH THE ENIEMY After YAARANA (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996) <br /> <br /> AGNISAKSHI was the only one that worked and it was a better film <br /> <br /> DARAAR is directed by Abbas Mustan who unfortunately failed in their attempt here <br /> <br /> the story was good but the handling was not good and the heroine was shown too regressive and even the climax is disappointing state <br /> <br /> Direction is bad Music is good <br /> <br /> Rishi takes up his role as YAARANA (oddly, it was also a remake of SWTE) and seems too fat for command and he's fine Juhi is decent while Arbaaz tries too hard on his debut and manages to relax the audience in many scenes but his voice is terrible, Johny is too loud
