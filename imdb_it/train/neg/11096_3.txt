I had great hopes for this film, because I thought that CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first feature film) was absolutely fantastic, the safest low-cost film I had ever seen. <br /> <br /> But much of CLAIRE DOLAN is absolutely useless and flat. Scenes after scene seem to be randomly thrown into the mix, without thinking too much about fiction or character. Is Claire trying to escape the prostitute or not? Hard to say. Why does he collect makeup at the airport if he wants to escape from that life? Why don't you collect tricks when you need money in Seattle? Why do we have to see her dye her hair for what is practically the same color? Why does Claire accept some johns and not others? The director doesn't seem to know. <br /> <br /> It seems as if everything was improvised (although I understand that it wasn't) and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a real documentary. <br /> <br /> After the screening I saw, Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning film narrative as politically conservative. It seemed a learned rhetoric. I think it was a cop-out. <br /> <br /> I am saddened by the fact that the producer of a film as exciting as CLEAN, SHAVEN would have continued to make such a lame film and then would have defended it with tired old "political" clich√©s.
