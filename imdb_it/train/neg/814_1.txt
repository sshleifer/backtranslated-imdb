This film was simply ugly. Almost all police film clich√©s are present and justified. Is the bad guy leaving? check. Partner? check. Strangely, the clash of personalities with the partner? check. Rookies with something to prove? check. Rookie shows up with a grizzled veteran. check. Regarding the only ones that have not been touched, it was idiots who shot themselves at the feet and retirony but I imagine they are saving those old chestnuts for Dooley's next release. Add the battle of the sexes to Girl Power along with old-fashioned gags and exaggerated trivial material like Dooley's prize machine that is always destroyed and you have the recipe for a really bad movie. Avoid this at all costs.
