Why does every Cleopatra movie, the last phaoroh, bring out the worst in creating a movie? Whatever attraction the woman had to the greatest Roman of them all, Julius Ceasar and his successor, Mark Anthony, never seem to appear on the screen as if not the antics of the over sixty high school students. Despite sumptuous sets and costumes, this film is the worst of any Italian "sandal and toga" of the 1950s. Of course, this kind of showmanship belongs to the big screen, which is why "Il Gladiatore" went very well, but "Il Gladiatore" didn't have the whole sex of the romance novel. <br /> <br /> Miss Varela has a acting talent like Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has talent to spare. It is a pity that he did not clean up the others.
