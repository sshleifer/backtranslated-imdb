Filippo. K. Dickian film. And a decent one for that matter. Better than Paycheck (Woo) and that abomination called Minority Report (Spielberg). But let's face it, the tortuous and shameless ending was a little too much for me. In the middle of the film I have already begun to fear a genre ending, and unfortunately it seemed right. But this does not mean that the film is not worth it. No not at all. The first half (as many have commented here) is fantastic. There are some parts where you start to doubt that the director intended to convey the message that the spectacle is a very important thing in the future (we will do this genre with unlucky things, because we CAN) or simply combining. But paranoia is there and even feel "out of the ordinary". Well.
