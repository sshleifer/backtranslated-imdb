A train lost. A wrong phone number. An extra cup of coffee. What happens to those around you when you make a seemingly harmless decision? Most people don't think about it as they absorb their thoughts and actions. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" tells the story of the interrelations and cause-and-effect of the banal in that it concerns a group of ordinary people from Paris. It has all the components of what passes for contemporary theater, with the cast full of dysfunctional and disillusioned. <br /> <br /> There is a cheating husband, an illegal immigrant, a classic slacker, a pickpocket, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girl, a selfish roommate and a homeless person. Audrey Tautou is the first protagonist (in the sense that she is in the car like anyone else and opens and closes the film) and a normal girl who just can't find the right rhythm in her life. <br /> Learn at the beginning of your day from a stranger on a train what your horoscope holds for you. What happens during the day is told through various characters. Does prediction come true? The concept is good, but storytelling is inconsistent. Connections from one event to the next are weak. There is a better narrative in 15 seconds of the Liberty Mutual insurance commercial where a person sees a good deed and transmits it to another who is not there in two hours of Happenstance. <br /> <br /> If you like Audrey Tautou, then you can certainly sacrifice time for this film, but you'll end up dissatisfied and wondering what this same story might be if it were run by a better producer and director.
