There are a lot of good looking women in this movie. But alas, this film is naked. Grrrrrrrrrrrrr Strike one. <br /> <br /> Ahem. A story in this film takes place in 1971. So why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone? <br /> <br /> As you may know, this film was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it's the most hateful effect I've ever seen. I'm not sure anyone did the wrong job on this, but there was no 3D, only double-vision blurs. I haven't had the same problem with other 3D films from this company, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Of course, even 3D was sucked into those, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. <br /> <br /> This thing is a great ball of nothing. <br /> <br /> And whoever the women were those who played the daughter of the ear-eating lady, yum! I'd like to see more of it. Even in the movies. It looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
