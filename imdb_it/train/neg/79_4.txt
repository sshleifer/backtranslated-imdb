The original book of this book was set in the 1950s, but it won't do it for the TV series because most people look for the style of the 1930s. Ironically, the subway train near the end was a train from the 1950s painted to look like a train from the 1930s, so even the subway can play that game. Hanging the plot on a plot on the Jarrow March was weak, but the 50s version had students who were starting to think about the world around them so I guess making them think of the protesters' poverty is the same thing. All the stuff on Japp that had to provide for itself was weak, but they had to put something to fill the time. This would have made a decent half-hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious that this episode is a victim of style over content.
