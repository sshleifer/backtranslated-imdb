I remember that this show was on television when I was a kid in the early 90s, and there was this rage about kids with silly kung fu doing each other and riding in plastic dinosaurs. It was called Power Rangers. I remember that the kids went around beating each other and then the shirts and the show stuff had been banned in many school districts all over the country because this show taught children how to fight each other in solving their differences. <br /> <br /> I never thought of this as a show, especially when better shows like The Tick were playing on Fox Kids. Most older kids have always looked at power rangers in a ridiculous and contemptuous way, and it's not hard to wonder why. The film is ridiculous at best. The colorful ranger costumes look like things you would like to work with and the dinosaurs look like plastic foolishness. Then you get to acting, and of course those really ridiculous haircuts. All the boys run with earrings, half of them wear mullets of 90, and they always wear the same clothes every day, and then they change into bodysuits wearing power rangers. <br /> <br /> Even the toys are particularly ridiculous and was the joke of many talk show presenters late at night. And obviously two of the worst films ever made, and I want to say that two of the worst films ever made are based on this show, with almost all the critics who ruined both the films and the shows it was based on. <br /> <br /> Power rangers is nothing more than a bad television advertisement for merchandising of particularly poor toys. As an adult, I don't look at him with affection, but rather as another embarrassment for the shows of the 90s, the fashion and the children's earrings.
