The way this film was made with a budget of 70 million dollars and without being completely reorganized is beyond me. The plot and the dialogue are outside of amateurism. The characters say things that no real person would have ever said and almost never react to the things that were said before. No one seems to be rooted in the real world. The acting of the protagonists is fine since the script is a real disaster ... but different actors in supporting roles really drag production. Probably the hero's hair should have had his credit, it was so strangely appealing ... not to mention that it gave one of the best performances in the picture. Finally, for a film on L.A. besieged by giant reptiles, this film is incredibly boring. What a pity! If you see it, your mind will be constantly on the run, thinking about how you could have taken the SFX scenes and build a much better movie around them. Unfortunately, it would not take long.
