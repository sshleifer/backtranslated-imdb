This must be one of the worst directions I've seen. The first floor can be a very powerful shot, but when each scene is composed of nothing but close-ups, it loses all its impact. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott has a beautiful scenery to work with, the depths of Mexico, the cellars, the beautiful estate where Anthony Quinn lives and the dusty cities that Costner crosses on his journey to take revenge. Unfortunately, we only see short glimpses of these places before the camera cuts into an image of a large, giant head. Even the transition scenes in which Costner is driving alone throughout Mexico quickly turn into a close-up. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is too dramatic and intrusive, dictating every emotion we should try. The story itself should have been managed much better. Among other things, too many people come out of nowhere to help Costner - it's just bad writing. <br /> <br /> It is a typical thriller storyline, but many others have taken the same premise and done exceptional things with it. Costner's No Way Out had a fairly similar plot, but it was a much better film. <br /> <br /> The finale was completely anticlimatic and suffered the most melodramatic score of the film. This film would never have been great, but if we had seen more Mexico and less giant heads, this film could have been watchable.
