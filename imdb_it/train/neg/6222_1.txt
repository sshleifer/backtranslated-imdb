I'm not sure that users should be able to review movies after they have only done half the session, but I'm afraid I can't stand another minute. <br /> <br /> If this abject excuse for a movie we won't have the big GP that runs like a wheel in his grave, so I doubt if everything goes well. <br /> <br /> The excellent review above "Not a movie for Parsons fans" sums up most of my feelings. How dare a director (second rate) and a writer try something they are so clearly incapable of providing. What were they thinking? Where to start? <br /> <br /> THE SCRIPT: I thought I would get a slice of bittersweet American. What I got was a poorly executed farce, with no clich√© left valid. Stupid hippy? Check. Stupid fat cop? Check. Horrible plot attitudes? Check. Awkwardly written female characters? Double check Total disregard for the story you're trying to portray? Check it out. <br /> <br /> After a while you realize that what you are looking at is a soap and not very well written. Scene with Knoxville. Scene with Ex girlfriend. Scene with Knoxville that hasn't moved much. Scene with the former girlfriend who was a bit like the last one. And so on ... <br /> <br /> THE MANAGEMENT: My friends and I decided, after some consideration, that watching this was like watching a bad episode of Quincy, or perhaps a particularly poor Duke of Hazzard. That's how bad the direction was. Terrible jump cuts, bad camera work, high and low scenes. God, it was cringeworthy. And then I discovered that the director was an Irishman whose most noteworthy work is a terrible BBC Sunday drama called Monarch of the Glen (believe me, it's the least common denominator TV). And then it all made sense ... <br /> <br /> THE ATTACK: Are we so critical that when a random guy on TV decides to act, if it's not so bad, it stinks, we applaud his efforts? Knoxville JUST ABOUT manages to overcome every scene. Poor Christina A. doesn't have this luck. His performance is a car accident (although what you do with those lines, I don't know). The 'hippy' in the hearse: oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Did we not go to Cheech and Chong? <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think you understood. What I would like to say is that, as other reviews have mentioned, no one on this film clearly gives a boon for The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers or Gram's solo work. They didn't know anything about the American road movie and they certainly give a damn about trying to do anything with an admittedly decent story in rock mythology. This film was superficial, it failed to explore anything and it was incredibly masculine from the beginning of ... oh wait, I didn't really end up. And I suggest you stay away too.
