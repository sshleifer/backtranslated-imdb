This film is like the S.E. Hinton was writing in the 1970s and Copola was adapting to the screen in the early 1980s and, if Trueblood had actually been produced by both, the results could have been much better (especially in the acting department). Instead, we get a rather bad piece of mediocrity ... Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, a former street noise reporter, I suppose it's the accurate description. This was in the days of action movies that used boys in their 40s and 30s and dressed them with nail wires or some sort of more effeminate selection of gang clothes and fought with the music of the years. 80 lousy. Nevertheless, Ray is the solitary guardian of his younger brother, Donny (Chad Lowe in a part where he shouts a lot), who is forced to leave inexplicably a train station when, escaping from the police, he is caught and forced to serve time marines. Flash arrives today and Ray is back in the city and is looking for his brother who has also become part of street gangs, although in a gang that was Ray's opponent and now the old scores have to be violently resolved (and again , the cops must be dodged and this time, a woman's honor defended herself in the sense of the action film) before Ray can continue to live at normal pace with his brother, Donny. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the film is quite ridiculous. For me, most of this has to do with too much exaggeration, even if not from Fahey or Sherlyn Fenn who plays the maid with whom she makes friends. The gang boys and Lowe seem to do a lot of useless exaggerations like the toughs of New York. However, the biggest hang up is recycled weft lines and perhaps a kind of film that was far beyond its first result as a 1989 product.
