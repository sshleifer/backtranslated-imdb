If you try to create tension in a movie, it's always a good idea not to build it beyond the point of total boredom. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the Butcher Brothers still haven't figured it out. > <br /> This movie sucks, unlike most of its characters who (if you have not worked are vampires in the first minutes and then are ashamed) prefer to grab the abundance of 'nobody knows where they are They are cheerleaders and Homosexual dribbles that move comfortably and with a quick bravado, beyond their isolated door. <br /> <br /> The only small piece of originality in the plot is the way these vampires become vampires in the first place, but the rest is ridiculous and sloppy. <br /> <br /> Forced to raise sticks (as opposite poles) on a regular basis due to their inclination to fill their basement with corpses without blood, in reality they are not too bright. If they fed their victims, they could run their small blood farm and reduce the mortality rate, allowing them to settle down and get chintzy. <br /> <br /> Because the producers felt it necessary to introduce the incestuous twins and the older homicidal gay brother I'm not sure. He added zero to the plot, which was unpleasant as there was not a great deal of plot to begin with and had no shock value. <br /> <br /> It was never mentioned why the parents had died, unless, of course, it was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks. Clearly the social worker must have been advised of the family for some reason, but again, it was for the viewer to write their own reason. <br /> <br /> The only well rounded character was the younger brother who emerges looking like Pugsley of the Adams family. In fact it was too round, with the appearance of a child who inadvertently wandered from a class of weight watchers into a bad horror movie. Oh dear, he had. No matter, darling, take another donut with a delicious blood center.
