Not to be confused with the supernatural supernatural "The Sentinel". The Sentinel was a big bore of a movie for me, not offering consistent action, a couple of criticisms promised on the back. It seemed to me that everybody did Halfassing, and just there to make some money, because this seemed like a TV movie. The Sentinel is a remake of many top films, like "In The Line Of Fire", this has no originality in it, and watching Michael Douglas run, I felt a bit silly in my opinion. The main problem, in addition to its originality, had to be the uncertain step. I was often distracted while trying to watch this movie, while watching how much time remained, more than once. Not just the hindrance with Eva Longoria, who could not convince herself that she deserved a lick. <br /> <br /> Performance. Michael Douglas is usually a reliable actor, here he is obviously going through the motions. Not convincing as a man on the run, or a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger was also out. I'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here it's just OK, nothing more. He tries to bump into a gruff, but manages to be more insignificant than anything else, and to be honest, he doesn't seem interested. Eva Longoria Parker is rather mediocre. She is not convinced in her role, and it was pure pleasure for the eyes. Kim Basinger is quite as terrible as the first woman. She looks bored with tears, and her role is a throw away, more than anything else. Martin Donovan has a big part at the end, but not enough to care. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. The Sentinel is still, another political thriller, that bores me to tears. He's too old, too tired, and most importantly, the lack of effort sucked. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
