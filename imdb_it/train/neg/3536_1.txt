I don't think I've ever felt this disappointed in a movie before. After having loved Guy Ritchie's two previous films (I don't consider Swept Away - he was a blind man), I couldn't wait to see him. <br /> <br /> The reviews were poor, then again, I don't trust the press anyway. More worrying was the fact that the buzz of the internet was that this was a bit fake, so it was with some trepidation that I delivered my Â£ 4.80 yesterday afternoon. <br /> <br /> I am not going to try to explain this film, especially since I have no idea what was going on and at one point I was honestly close to getting up and asking if it was just me not to get it! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think Ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife's trap of taking himself too seriously. It seems like it wasn't good enough for him to make movies with good storylines, laughter, snappy dialogues and good characters. It's almost as if he had a list of films he wanted to rip, here are some of the ones I've noticed: <br /> <br /> The Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, The Usual Suspects, Vanilla Sky ... <br /> <br /> I think the most frustrating thing is that the performances of the two main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were actually very good and it was really the self-indulgent story and the editing / directing that allowed movies down. <br /> <br /> So a big, big thumb down from me.
