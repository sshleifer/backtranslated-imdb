A man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 1950s and that he now has the power to ... burst into flames! <br /> <br /> I was really prepared for this film, being directed by the great Toby Hooper and with wild card Brad Dourif. Unfortunately it did not rise above the average individual film with violent powers. The spontaneous combustion has an interesting premise behind, unfortunately it never seems to live up to its potential and prolongs its plot too much. However, the special effects are not bad and help bring the film to the end. <br /> <br /> The cast is not bad, Dourif steals the show. <br /> <br /> All around, no classic but it's not even the worst of its kind. <br /> <br /> ** out of ****
