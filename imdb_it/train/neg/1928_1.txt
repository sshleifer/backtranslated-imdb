Like the Grinch Stole Christmas it was a wonderful little Christmas comic that anyone could easily appreciate, I never saw the reason for a remake. Not to mention a remake made with humans, the comic was just perfect, what is the purpose of this film? But it also seemed a bit strange for Jim Carrey to be the Grinch. I mean he's a great comedian, but is he like the Grinch? It didn't make any sense to me. His performance was a bit exaggerated and involuntarily laughable at times. Not to mention some of the added dialogue was a bit childish and not pleasant. The whole story of Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was over and it wasn't necessary. Actually they just destroyed history, period. <br /> <br /> All those who are in Whoville are preparing for their best Christmas season, but where everything is destined to become perfect. But Cindy Lou-Who is curious and worried about the Grinch who lives above them and who won't spend Christmas like the other. He kicks her out and decides that he doesn't want Christmas this year and that he really should just steal Christmas all together to show who his Christmas version is. But he soon realizes that whoever knows that it is a little more than what is the materialized version of Christmas. <br /> <br /> As the Grinch Stole Christmas was not necessary and was a bit exaggerated. I highly recommend staying with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a rather scary version, at least in my opinion. The make-up and presentation of the entire movie was just over, not to mention the fact that How the Grinch stole Christmas! it was more thought to be a cartoon than a version starring Jim Carry. But at least this version makes you thankful for Boris Karloff's version that is played every Christmas. <br /> <br /> 1/10
