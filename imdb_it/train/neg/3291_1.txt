First let me tell you I'm not a Dukes fan, but after this movie the series looked like Law and Order. The worst thing was the casting of Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg, and even worse was M.C. Gainey as Roscoe, if they had ever seen the show, Roscoe was not a tough cop. It was more a Barney Fife than the role he played in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with the usual mistakes, the machines are torn and continues as if nothing had happened. The worst example is when the general joins Billy Prickett, and the general is run over on a dirt hill that is obviously slowing down to a nearby stop, but continues to win the race.
