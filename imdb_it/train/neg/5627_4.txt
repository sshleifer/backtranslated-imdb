While watching this film, it is interesting to see how black men stand out. The film spends its time showing how powerless the most visible black man in it is (except for a heroic moment). For most of the film, the other black men (and dark-skinned women) in the film are in the background, barely visible. <br /> <br /> The character of Vanessa Williams was strong and understanding. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her. There are also quite visible and three-dimensional supporting characters who have fair skin and some white characters of a certain warmth and dignity. But 99% of black males in this film are nothing but invisible men. Shadows without shadows in the background, without consequences. Such a horrible flaw, but far from unusual in the mainstream media.
