that absurd story, blackmail of murder, accusations of child sex, gay and catholic church ..... the absolute tripe. How is it possible that most UK TV dramas, sitcoms etc. They include gay homosexuals, it's really tiring now. Everyone accepts that there are gay people in society, only that there are other minority groups, but we don't want to run away (I'll pass it over) in every single show. In addition to the above, the drama went from what could have been a small interesting story in a pantomime, the priest was a pedophile and there are gays who run everywhere, oh yes just to be totally PC one of the gay couples was black . I'm surprised I even contemplated it while reading the script.
