Oh dear. I was so disappointed that this film was just a rip off of the Japanese Ringu. Well, I guess the United States also made the version, but at least it was a definitive remake. So, so sad. I really like watching Filipino movies and knowing that great things can come out of such a small country, so I can't believe this should happen. Claudine and Kris are such big names there, surprised to be affiliated with plagiarism. For all the aspiring filmmakers out there in the Philippines: you don't have to drop so much to make money. There are many movie fans who are watching movies that Filipinos put on and enjoying them!
