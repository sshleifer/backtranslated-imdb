It wasn't the most useless animation film experience ever, but it certainly can't be admired as much as it tries to be good. Combining Dreamworks animation and computer graphics, this is the story of a mustang, later called Spirit (Matt Damon, who provides first-person narration) and his journey across the frontiers of the old West. Basically he was born free among all the other horses in the beautiful countryside, then he is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse, he can throw away all those who try to ride him. However when he escapes from his cage, along with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), the two form a friendship, oh, and of course he has a thing for the Little Creek female horse. Finally, after a few more escapes, chased by The Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men, and making a big leap into a gorge, Little Creek lets Spirit go and also releases his female horse, and they run home in their campaign horse mates. Also starring Chopper Bernet as Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Murphy / Railroad Foreman, John Rubano as Soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin as Joe. I expected to see horses talking in this film, but it turns out to be more like a Dumbo thing in all, and Bryan Adams's songs are not the most engaging, but it's not a terrible movie. He was nominated for an Academy Award for best animated film, and was named Golden Globe for Best Song for "Here I Am" by Bryan Adams. All right!
