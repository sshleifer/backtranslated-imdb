"Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned" is the third installment of Gabriel Knight's games, a series of adventure games about the villain / paranormal detective, Gabriel Knight. Gabriel and his partner, Grace, were invited by Prince James of Albany to investigate a series of mysterious attacks by so-called "night visitors". When the son of Prince James is kidnapped, Gabriel chases night visitors to Rennes le Ch창teau, where he begins to put together a mystery relating to the Holy Grail. <br /> <br /> Despite the marketing, this game is not about vampires. Vampires have a symbolic appearance in the game, but they never take command at the center of the scene, as did the voodoo hounfor in "Sins of the Fathers" or the werewolves in "The Beast Within". Gabriel and Grace do not attempt to discover the true nature of vampires, or to research vampire tradition. Although vampires kill three people during the course of the game, their victims are randomly chosen and have nothing to do with the main storyline. <br /> <br /> Much of the charm of the first two Gabriel Knights installments were in the reports that Gabriel had formed with the bad guys. Through these relationships, the player could not help but sympathize with the villain, and so the villain was transformed into a human monster and less. However, in "Blood of the Sacred", Gabriel's only interaction with the villain is through a single cheese interview, which does nothing to fascinate the villain with the player. <br /> <br /> The roles played by Gabriel and Grace in this mystery are quite futile. Gabriel spends his time browsing through the identities of the members of a group of tourists who come to his hotel, but what he discovers is nothing but a red herring. Grace spends her time searching for the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau, but all her research is rendered superfluous by the presence of a perplexed ally who has known the answer to this mystery for centuries. <br /> <br /> The actions of this perplexed ally and its polar opposite - the head of the vampires --- are unbearable. The ally reveals the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau in broad daylight and expects Grace (and not the other treasure hunters of the tour group) to find them. However, he could have revealed the mystery to Grace in its entirety on day 1, instead of putting the kidnapped child at risk for an additional 48 hours. And in the end, he simply tells Grace the whole mystery. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the vampire leader fails to achieve the goals of centuries of intrigue, because he chooses to abstain from the action for two days after the kidnapping of the child. The only reason given for his decision to delay the action is that he wants to savor his victory. <br /> <br /> The game would have been much better if it had been focused on the Holy Grail. The kidnapping and vampires should have been omitted, replaced by a race against the Vatican to discover the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau. Since Gabriel is interpreted more than once with Catholic reluctance, this conflict would have had many opportunities for character development. <br /> <br /> All in all, the game was a disappointing episode of the series, despite an improved interface and the return of Tim Curry as Gabriel Knight's voice.
