It must be the poorest television program on the air. This is probably an escape route for Jim Belushi and all his bad movies. His brother sucked all his younger brother talent. I hope this show is canceled and you never talk about it again except in a negative use. Jim must retire or something. Please let them go. If I'm a joke of that show, I'll vomit and wash my eyes with a toothbrush. Instead of being taken by the devil himself, rather than watching that entire piece of programming for half an hour. I still don't understand why the show is still in the air and running. We all know deep down that we want to shoot our TV screens when we see Jim's face. In conclusion, please no longer.
