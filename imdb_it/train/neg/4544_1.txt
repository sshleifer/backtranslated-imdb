This film is not worth your time. His addiction to New Age mysticism is his only semi-interesting distraction. The plot is the one that has been recycled countless times. <br /> <br /> I was only asked to spend time commenting when I noticed that some have tried to support this nonsense reputation. Their motivation and objectivity are questionable, since they encourage you not to look at the flaws of the film, but at its well-intentioned message of New Age consciousness. <br /> <br /> So would it be good for about twenty or thirty evangelical Christians or Islamic fundamentalists to make positive judgments about films / television that support their opinions? Despite the bad qualities of production, or the lack of truth in any of its alleged historical bases? I hope not. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie, despite the truth.
