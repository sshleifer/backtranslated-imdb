Absolutely one of the worst movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Low production values, terrible idea of ​​script, bad screenplay, dull acting ... and I can't even find a sufficiently descriptive adjective as poor as it is. I know there is a special place in hell for the people who funded this film; prolly just below the level reserved for the maniacs of the genocide of children. <br /> <br /> This film is a shipwreck. <br /> <br /> (Terrible) x (infinity) = Test of the rabbit. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> It's so ugly, it's not even funny how ugly it is.
