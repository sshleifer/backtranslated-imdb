It's not funny - how can someone connect it to Monty Python? This is absolutely ridiculous - there is no laughter. This is not funny. Over the top, but ugly, strange just for the strange taste and it seems to me that these people have always been on something. Unfortunately, something that didn't make them fun. <br /> <br /> Some points should be given for the effort etc. Everything. Actually there seems to be a trail of laughter - or is there one? Hummm .... Since there are almost all laughs that is a questionable question. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm doing injustice - maybe it's kind of an exercise. A sort of art - in that case everything goes, it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> But these boys play women with high voices, turned noses. Come on !!! Not funny. <br /> <br /> There is only one apparent heir to the intellectual intelligence of Monty Pythons and this is Stephen Colbert, and perhaps Jon Stewart.
