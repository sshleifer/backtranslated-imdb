This is the kind of film I fear most. Arrogant and Irresponsible, he presents a sketch of the out-of-tune and stupid Colombian conflict that represents an insult to all Colombians. The representations are godawul, from Grisales (his naked scene is absolutely pitiful), to Bejarano, to Fanny Mickey (who seems to come from a Tim Burton nightmare), to Díaz, who makes a remarkable effort to give life to such a character Three-dimensional, so cliché and so badly written, all he has left to work is a mustache. Not to mention the free ending, such a trivial gore fest that would have made Ed Wood shudder. He fails in all ways, the cinematography, the artistic direction, the costumes, the make-up, the editing and above all the direction, Jorge Alí Triana has always been a bad filmmaker, but at least his previous films had a certain dignity. I can't say anything good about this waste of money, except that I hope Colombian filmmakers learn a lesson about honesty, integrity and responsibility from this petty fiasco.
