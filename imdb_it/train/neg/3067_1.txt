This is simply ugly. Sometimes the remakes, even if they move away from the original, are good on their own. They can bring another point of view and get a certain interpretation that makes them unique and fun. This has been poorly conceived and realized as it can be. This was nothing good, even though he was standing alone. Viggo Mortenson is a leading actor, but some of his selection of roles and projects leave something to be desired. The original "Vanishing Point" was such an exciting psychological adventure; this is not an adventure at all and it's not pleasant or fun. This was done by a number-based approach to making the film, the stuffing in plot points that someone in Hollywood believes might like what they see as today's audiences. Basically, they see us as a group of idiots. It is offensive that someone put it as a film, and even try to redo a cult classic in a sloppy way. The manipulative plot devices, the "make-it-obvious-so-not-me-point-to-point-to-point" aspects, ridiculous dialogues, stereotyped characters, amateur management ... <br /> <br /> This it's plain bad ....
