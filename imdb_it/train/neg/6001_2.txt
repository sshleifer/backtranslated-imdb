This may seem absurd even to people who remember this show ... But I remembered that it is a live-action. I don't think I've ever seen the cardboard. but film? could be. I remember it very clearly. The boy was in a building a bit like a showroom. He even had a red jacket. It was dark and he turned into a red car and there was this guy on the second floor looking at him. The car / guy turned and crashed into the large window of the showroom and stepped out onto the street. And then he proceeded to leave. This is all I remember. I really hope someone else out there also remembers this. If not, maybe I'm still crazy. But I hope I'm not.
