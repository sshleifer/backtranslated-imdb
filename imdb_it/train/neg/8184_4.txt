This is almost like two films: one literal and captivating, the other stupid and clich√©. It is really a pity that all the problems have not been solved by writing, but considering the speed with which most B films have been written and produced, this is not too unusual. It's a shame, though, as this may have been a great movie. <br /> <br /> The beauty first. The film is original and involves the code switches of the Second World War. This is quite fascinating and I enjoyed seeing the leading man (Lee Bowman) go through his steps as a master code-breaker. In fact, the first two thirds of the film were very good. But now for the bad guy, the movie went on for too long and lost steam at about 50 minutes. Moreover, the role of Jean Rogers as "extravagant girlfriend" must be considered one of the worst written and distracting roles in the history of cinema !! For every smart move made by Bowman, the idiot Rogers intervened to ruin things as a kind of "relief from the comedy". If his role had been written intelligently, the overall film would have improved immensely! Instead, looking at it, it's hard to understand how we actually won the Second World War !!
