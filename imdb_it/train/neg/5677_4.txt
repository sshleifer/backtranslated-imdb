"Seed" is porn torture ... there is no doubt. But, strangely enough, Uwe Boll wrote, produced and directed a film that was more polished than anything else he has done in recent memories. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch a Boll movie, I hear that some pages in the movie the script must have disappeared. There are simply huge gaps in history and dialogue. Of course, nothing makes much sense. The films are somewhat surreal in this sense. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> Because the six policemen who go to arrest Seed split up and go their separate ways when they arrive at the obscured residence, unlike the real cops who would come in and free the house as a couple or for three? Why don't cops ever use their radios? How can bodies decay so quickly, a process that would normally take many months? (I know it is time-lapse photography ... but Seed would never have been able to stay in the program by killing people if he always waited for the previous victim to fall to the point shown.) How come Seed gets to wear overalls and a mask while he is waiting on death row instead of the typical prison uniforms? How can Seed enter a maximum security prison, walk around the cell block and then come out again without being stopped or noticed? If almost 80 people (according to some newspaper articles shown in the film) have been murdered, why is there a single investigator working on the case? Why did the investigator suddenly decide to go look for Seed in Seed's house, where he was originally arrested and where he killed his victims? (Didn't think of doing it before?) Why does the police detective go alone, without backup and without even letting the shipment know what he was doing and where he was headed? <br /> <br /> It is particularly frustrating when Boll obviously goes out of his way to make sure we understand why the electric chair is not working properly. Spend several minutes on the screen during the installation, when he might have spent them making other aspects of the film at least a little more logical. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILERS ***** <In short, the film is just a sort of structure for some assorted scenes (maybe Boll could think of these as his "visions") of a brutal death with violent blows, gunshots to the head, execution by electrocution, and skinning of live animals bred for their skins. (The opening scenes of the skinned animals were really useless and disturbing, but I understand their purpose in the context of the film.) The centerpiece is undoubtedly the strident death of a middle-aged woman from Seed who uses an ax. It is obvious that a lot of time has been devoted to this and it vaguely reminds me of the classic scene of "Reservoir Dogs", even if without the soundtrack of Steely Dan. <br /> <br /> Is it a good movie? No. Is it worth seeing? Only if you are a passionate fan of the porn torture genre or if you are absolutely determined to see a tortured porn sample. As I said at the beginning of this review, even though this film is rather disgusting and can be annoying in the points, it is really much more competent than most of Boll's films. Maybe it will continue to improve as a director. I can only hope that it will progress beyond porn torture and continue more in the wake of "Postal".
