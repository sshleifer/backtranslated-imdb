I could not believe my eyes when I saw Nuremberg yesterday on Dutch television. It starts very slowly, the Nuremberg rehearsal backgrounds become clear step by step, the Germans have a funny English accent, but then, suddenly, in the last minutes of the first part of the series, the audience gets to see the most shocking and horrible movies have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is important for people to be able to see these movies (although I absolutely do not agree with people who say that there is no minimum age at which children can be exposed to this type of material ), but in this film it was completely ridiculous. It was designed exclusively to improve the impact of a normal TV series. He had to upset the public, which is very cheap and incredibly easy. Instead of trying to move with well-made scenes, stimulating dialogues or interesting points of view, the public is tortured with horrible images of inmates in the field of skin and bones. It shows no respect for the victims of the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> I am very angry.
