I love Seth Green. His appearances on the THAT 70s Show are always worth looking at, but last night, I heard the show needed to be reviewed. Four young single boys inherit an apartment in New York City so most of us would have died. The grandmother must have been an heir to have this space in the first place. So I felt that the need for realism should have been brought to light. In any case, the plot of the four best friends who got this apartment was not credible. I would have been thrilled if they moved with one of their parents, which would have brought great humor and dysfunction to the way the show was set up. There didn't seem to be much humor. I only look at it because it falls before My Name is Earl participates in a winning Thursday night. I think they should go back, discard this series and start over. We need more series involved in the family. How about Seth and his friends who move with his wacky parents in the suburbs after a fire burned their place. He could have Dabney Coleman play the father and Christine Estabrook, play the mother and dysfunctional brothers. The list of possibilities with someone like Seth Green is endless and the network is blowing it.
