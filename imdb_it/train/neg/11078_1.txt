honestly, where can I start from! It was a low-budget film, acted in a HORRIBLY way, it was so bad that we all burst out laughing at how completely retarded it was! the sword fighting scenes weren't even sword fights, they were playing with some plastic swords they'd bought at the wal-mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try and make it look like they were fighting !! My family and I were in the mood for a really cool action movie someday, so we decided to go to the store and look for one, and it was The Sawtooth Island movie. I mean, it looked so good, but when we saw it at home, I practically died after the first scene. <br /> <br /> Oh and the plot of the movie, the plot, the script, etc. of garbage that I don't even know why the director and the producer have wasted time making it happen !! But if you happen to come across this film ... don't understand it !!!!!
