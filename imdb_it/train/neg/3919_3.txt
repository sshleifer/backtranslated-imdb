This film is not as good as everyone thinks. the actors are low level and the story is very comical. I respect fantasy but Lord of the Rings is fantasy ... Conan ... is fantasy ... THIS IS JUST LONGLY HK-LOWPRICE-ENTERTAINMENT ... Because they have included this Splatter language, it makes everything worse. The only good thing is photography and the work of the cutter.
