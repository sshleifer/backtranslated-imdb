Useless makeover, and cannot come close to capturing the charm of the original. The extreme length causes more than a few yawns that induce parts. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The film lacks style, and for the most part lacks talent, not only for acting, but directing, sets, costumes etc. They are all below par. He has a clear disregard for the details of the period. Vanessa Williams is the only cast member who shows a certain talent, Tyne Daly is not bad. They should have left pretty well alone. The singing is good (Vanessa Williams) to the poor (all the others). Look at the original 1963 version and skip this. Not much to recommend here.
