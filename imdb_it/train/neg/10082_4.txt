I laughed throughout this rotten movie. It is so incredible. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a collapse in front of a real estate office. What happens? The office manager comes out and offers her a job !!! Funny! The next thing you know the two women are going to this. Yes, they are lesbians! Nothing sounds real in this movie "Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do". Clunky dialogues like "I don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I have a chance to be happy and I didn't get it" doesn't help. There is a rich and distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship. A brazen black waitress - incredible that in 2003, a film is made in which there is a brazen black maid. Hattie McDaniel must be filmed in his grave. The woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty kids. Sheesh! No clicks are not taken into consideration.
