If you've ever seen the Dukes of Hazard, you know you've never had to worry about drugs, curses or cruel behavior by children. If you've seen the movie, you know it's no longer the case! This film was HORRIBLE! The main characters who do drugs and think it's fun and cool are certainly not what I call entertainment. They did a wonderful show and turned it into garbage. Daisy who was a bit flirtatious in the original show now looks and behaves as if she were on the street corner to get paid for her services. I was so excited to see this movie before it came out, 15 minutes from the movie I was ready to go. I kept thinking that it had to improve but instead it got worse by the minute. I wish I'd never seen this movie. It ruined a good show and I left nothing but hideous taste in my mouth when I left. Do yourself a favor, go see something that is worth your money, because it is not just a waste of money but a waste of 2 hours of your life that you will never come back!
