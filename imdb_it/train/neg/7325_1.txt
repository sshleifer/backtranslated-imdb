Makes the actors of Hollyoaks the Royal Shakespeare Company. This film leaves you speechless at how scary it is. Turning off the DVD player was not enough. I want to find the people responsible for this disaster and slap them in the face. I will never go back. Never. How is it possible to create a film so banal, boring and soulless? I couldn't think of a course of action that would ease the boredom. Writing the required ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a shameful film. What else can you say rather than reiterating how truly awful the acting is. Please avoid.
