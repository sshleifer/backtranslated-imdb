This Italian film is basically a soap opera with leather. <br /> <br /> The VHS box said it was classified "R", but the inside of the actual ribbon inside said it was "X". The latter makes much more sense because there is a brief scene towards the end that has been shocking. Even in the dark, you could see Dutch actress Marishcka Detmers do all the sex on this guy - and, yes, you could see his penis in his mouth. I read somewhere that this was the first time a "leading actress" had done something similar on the screen. <br /> <br /> Detmers shows off the nude in different scenes but his face is even better than his body. It looked beautiful. Unfortunately, the film is ugly ... a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite Detmers' looks.
