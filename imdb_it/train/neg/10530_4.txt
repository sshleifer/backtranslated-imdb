Margaret Landon's disappointing musical version of "Anna and the King of Siam", also shot in 1946 with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, sees Deborah Kerr as a teacher and widowed mother who travels from England to Siam in 1862 to accept a I work as a tutor for the many children of the King - and perhaps teach the Royal One one or two things in the process! Stagy's photo starts well, but quickly loses energy and concentration. Yul Brynner, taking up the triumph on stage as King, is an imposing presence, but is used as a buffoon, according to the invented story. Kerr maintains his beautiful dignity and the best rates, despite having to synchronize his lips with the voice of Marni Nixon. Perhaps having already played this part until his death, Brynner seems to have nothing left over for the translation of the screen except the bomb. In the second half, with Anna and the ducks staging a musical version of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" is rather ridiculous, and the songs of Rodgers and Hammerstein are mostly heavy. Brynner won an Oscar for best actor, but it's Kist who comes to terms with this ball. Long, heavy and "old style" in the worst sense of the word. ** from ****
