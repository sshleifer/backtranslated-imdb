Shot in documentary style, but you can safely say that the participants had been educated. A newly divorced aspiring filmmaker (Myles Berkowitz) sees the possibility of reviving his love life and entering the world of cinema at the same time. He intends to make a documentary piece on the search for love by turning twenty dates including ramifications. Comedy is questionable at best; the rest is misadventure after the accident. Richard Arlook, Robert McKee and the alluring Elisabeth Wagner also participate. Trying to be credible, Tia Carrere's collection is told in a cameo. This will be enough as a manual on how NOT to get a satisfactory date.
