This film is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go terribly wrong. I was really expecting something from this movie after seeing the add that was fun to die for but the movie wasn't as good. <br /> <br /> The strange part is that the jokes are actually funny, the bad words of the smoking ban, Jo Bole ... etc. they are really good jokes but I don't know who to blame on the flop of this movie. <br /> <br /> The main candidates can be: - 1) The hammers (actors) and hammeresses (actresses) and not even the funny type 2) The director 3) The guy who cast the actors and / or director Anyway if you are really bored and I really want to see this movie, or get a copy of every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh your ass because those will be a lot more fun than the movie. <br /> <br /> ps the only redeeming feature of this film is the mahesh manjrekar and the funny chappu bhai
