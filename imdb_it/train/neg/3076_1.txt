This movie should not be seen unless you are trying to kill yourself. I think this movie could actually cause serious brain damage. The main characters are the plaintive non-hero Kevin, Amy, his impudent and impudent girlfriend, Kyle, a fool in red shorts who loves phone sex, Daphne, a horny horny girl who should be "cool" and doesn't have sense of how to dress, and her oversized boyfriend Nick, an army recruit who can hint at anything. No, I'm not a pervert, it's REALLY the way the movie is. The film itself is a supersaturated rip-off of the 1986 Gremlins, only you will never find a trace of Gizmo. No, these Hobgoblin, unleashed by Wimpy Man (I'm sorry, Kevin), make someone's wildest dreams come true, and then kill the victims. Yes, you guessed it. Eventually, they end up in a strip club, where nerd Amy's biggest dream is revealed: he wants to be a stripper! Look, I watched this movie via MST3K, and also with Mike Nelson, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot, playing tricks on this movie train and bleeding on both eyes. Not really, but I wish I had it. I'm not giving you more plots, because reliving it gives me this great desire to drive a pitchfork through my brain. Moreover, it is not that there is a plot to mention. They should put a general warning of the surgeon on this film.
