There seems to be a bit of a curse out there when it comes to gay cinema. That is to say, the happy endings are not very common. Good thing excluded, gay movies tend to end up in broken relationships or in premature death. And some, like Come Undone, only end ... period. <br /> <br /> The creators of this horrible piece of nonsense have one or two things to learn about plot, direction and timeline. In the first ten minutes of this film, I found myself a bit confused, and even more after the first taste of the Jeremie Elkaim character who had a little psychological session. It seems that this film was accidentally assembled without the slightest attempt at continuity or consistency. There is no real way to tell when you're looking at the present or some kind of ethereal flashback. It could take so long before it became really unattractive. Stephen Holden of the New York Times called this film "... incredibly beautiful and absolutely real". Well, it looks like Stephen has invested in beer glasses before he looks, since he's really far from beautiful. Because of all the praise received by this film, I was expecting something worth watching. Unfortunately, the film lived up to its title. And at the end of the film (which has provided no solution, I might add) it is clear that the writers, the director and the film all have Come Undone.
