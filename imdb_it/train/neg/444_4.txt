(SPOILERS IN THIS) <br /> <br /> "Rosenstraße" is a film about heroic women in the German Nazi period. But it's too long, it's not touching and sometimes even boring! There are too many clichés and not enough good acting. <br /> <br /> Storytelling (plot) is bad. Like in the Titanic by James Cameron, an old woman remembers the events of her life. Well, now we have a point of view. Then there is another woman presented who does the same. Confusing is that both are remembering other people's life events! Come on! This is a lack of knowledge of the basic story ... How does Riemann know about the fate of the girl's mother and her interrogation, for example? <br /> <br /> The scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it happened. For example, the scene in which Riemann proposes to Fabian. When did it happen? The scene seems set in the 1920s ... <br /> <br /> The character of Riemann is obviously a talented pianist, well, he's also a baroness! Wow. His brother returns from the eastern front, he received a "Ritterkreuz" which he is showing in some scenes. So he is a war hero and still a good man who has kept his conscience. And he gained knowledge of the massacres committed by the Germans. He even took pictures! And so on, the cliché after the cliché is piling up and that's why the movie doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Basically von Trotta made a film about something that could have been a decent film. And in the end it's all very simple. Riemann finds a way to bring Goebbels to bed and - ta da! - all are free Which is not a historical fact but pure imagination despite the claim of the "true story" in the beginning. Like "Sass", it is vaguely based on a real event. <br /> <br /> It's sad but true, this is the typical German movie of these times. It's bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
