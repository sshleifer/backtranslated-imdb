Until now, the worst movie I had ever seen was Ben & Arthur. You should really check the reviews for that movie instead of this one. The review statistics for this film have been made positive thanks to an unstoppable and unscrupulous push by some of the people involved in making it, evidence for which it is fairly easy to find out online. At least the people who made Ben & Arthur were honorable enough to let him stay on his own shaky legs instead of promoting him unscrupulously so that suckers like me would buy him. <br /> <br /> Everything about this film is terrible, the script, the story, the casting, the acting, the direction, photography, editing, music ... what else goes in a movie ? Whatever it is, here it is as bad as it gets. If it were not so unpleasant it would be ridiculous. I kept looking at him thinking he should improve, because I had not yet discovered that any of the positive reviews for him is reliable. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take a lot of money to make a great movie, nor does a low budget mean a movie has to be bad. My favorite example of a masterpiece of limited budget is the incredible Mala Noche by Gus Van Sant, but there are many others. Sideline Secrets ?? The Director's Cut or original ?? it's bad not because the people who did it had no money, but because they had gigantic egos and no talent at all except self-promotion.
