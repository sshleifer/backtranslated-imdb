never ever consider looking at this sorry excuse for a movie. the way it is shot, lit up, acted, etc. it does not make sense. it's all so ugly that it's hard to watch. a lot of clips are repeated beyond boredom. it seems that there is not a 'normal' person in the whole film and the existence of the 'external world' is, well, simply does not exist. And why does that bald boy become invincible all of a sudden? this film is beyond stupidity. zero.
