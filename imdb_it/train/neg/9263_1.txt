What was the agreement with the clothes? They were all dressed as something from the late 70s to the early 80s. The machines were even obsolete. The school was obsolete. The nuns' clothing was obsolete and the hospital looked like something from the 1940s, with its wards and wooden stairs and things. Nothing in the film implied that it happened in 1991. My mother was laughing, saying "Geeeee-od! WHEN was this film shot?" When we pressed "INFO BUTTON" on our remote control, we were sure that 1991 should be a typo! Has anyone else noticed it? My FAVORITE part, however, was when the woman told her tall wife's husband, on the phone, the cross turned upside down in the mirror, and she just said "Well, look, I have a congress meeting. You'll talk about it later. "That line was just classic. JUST LIKE A MAN! My mother's favorite part was when they gave "Spawn of the Devil Child" her Rottweiler. My mother said "Just what the Devil's Rampweiler needs." He also appreciated all the people who collapsed in the churches, clutching their chest. His other favorite part was the one at the school parking lot, which he drove for 5 miles per hour, driving directly into the garbage truck / dump truck / front loader. He had about 20 seconds to stop the car ... but he kept going, with a real vacant expression on his face. I mean, how fast can you go in a school parking lot?!?! Everything!
