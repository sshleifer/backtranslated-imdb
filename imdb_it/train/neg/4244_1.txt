Contrary to my principles, allow me to reach a conclusion, because I have just seen this piece of "art", and I am still under strong impressions. The reader is asked to excuse my strongest vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Well, this film is absolutely horrible, and I would never worry about writing a single word about it, if it weren't for the fact that "44 minutes" made me sick to death, which I rarely it happens to me. The fact that I paid for it doesn't make me feel exactly better, as does the fact that the film deserved the high rating of the users here. <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with the movie? It has a fashionable title - "44 minutes". First, we think of "15 minutes", which is still a much better film, but still bad in my book, and in fact the two can be compared to some extent. But, fortunately, the things they share are their worst characteristics. Both play Mr. Oleg Taktarov, who with his strong Russian accent obviously meets popular expectations and prejudices. Its purpose is to appeal to the Cold War mind. Ah, we are missing the good old days. Now, it does not imply that he is a bad actor, I still have to judge his true interpretation, but he is simply not a real individual here, he is more like an archetype. How anyone can still indulge in these things is completely beyond my comprehension. We can recognize the modern American xenophobia here. The point in the film when Taktarov explains to his partner that Romanians are not Germans, and that they are in America is really ridiculous. Should we suppose that the greatest wish of the unfortunate duo is to become "real" Americans? <br /> <br /> So, there's the media problem. Yes, it seems that most of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and journalists. The director should have let us hear the rhythm of the alleged 44 minutes. Instead it bores us with interviews throughout the film like on a low-cost TV show, trying to reinvent the wheel. In 15 minutes the media issue is the central one. The point is presented in a way that a teacher deals with a dull student, but that deserves a separate comment, we are now focusing on 44 minutes. So, I tried to identify the purpose of this film. What is that? To provide a good time for the public? To glorify weapons? To glorify the police? Portray violence? Oh yes, the officer gives the Bible to the delinquent minor. So should it promote peace and understanding after all? I don't think so, but don't ask me. I just know that I didn't like any of this. <br /> <br /> Ah, Michael Madsen. I admit, I'm a big fan. I was hoping it would be a bright spot, but I was wrong. It's not his fault though. <br /> <br /> As a final note, the comparison between "firepower" and "willpower" at the end of the film was one of the worst I've ever heard. <br /> <br /> In summary, on the scale 1-10, I give it a pure, pure adulterate 1.
