America. A land of freedom, hope and dreams. This is the nation that, since its independence, has endeavored to bring democracy, prosperity and peace to the whole world, for the good of all humanity. There are times, however, when one cannot help wishing that Americans simply remain on their side of the Atlantic. <br /> <br /> This "film" (and I use that word with some reservations) evokes these feelings with intense purity. This vision of hell follows the adventures of Calvin, a bizarre jewel thief who was created by attacking Marlon Wayan's severed head on the body of a two-footed dwarf. After inadvertently dropping a large diamond in Vanessa's purse, a career woman who is reluctant to have children, Calvin realizes that to recover the diamond she must curry favor with her. So, like any normal man, Calvin dresses up as a 2-year-old boy and parks himself on the threshold of the poor woman, where he is discovered by Darryl, Vanessa's insecure husband. <br /> <br /> Darryl falls incongruously for Calvin's disguise despite the fact that the "child" has a complete set of teeth, stubble, a tattoo, a knife scar and the sexual desire of an old sixteen year old. Even more absurdly, Vanessa does not see past Calvin's tights and actually tries to breastfeed the diminutive pervert. This miserable assault on the soul of humanity attempts, and fails, to find humor in rape, scatology, sexual aggression and pedophilia, however, in the dishonest attempt to turn into a piece of "family entertainment", the Wayan brothers a disgusting quantity of imperfect sentiment and morality is agitated. <br /> <br /> The brothers attempted a Freudian rehabilitation of their thief rapist revealing to have "a bad father". Repeatedly hitting Darryl in the horse allows Calvin to develop the loving father-son relationship that both he and Darryl have always wanted. As if this wasn't ridiculous enough, Calvin's attempts to sexually assault Vanessa somehow convince her that it is selfish for a woman to give herself a successful career, and that instead she should spend her life playing the role of the little housebound woman, who he spends his time alternately squeezing the children and cooking for her husband. <br /> <br /> In this film the Wayan brothers have mixed their coarse and twisted form of humor with the clich√© sentimentality that has infected much of Hollywood's recent work. Furthermore, they are endemic to the current generation of black comedians who are responsible for transforming African-American humor into a shadow of poor and miserable world of self that indulges excessively in jokes and sexual gags. By right these two should be legally excluded from taking anything, even remotely, like a camera again. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the current artistic and moral bankruptcy of American cinema means that at this point next month they will undoubtedly shoot two sequels and earn millions of dollars on merchandising contracts.
