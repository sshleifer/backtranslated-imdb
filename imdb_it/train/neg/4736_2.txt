The film deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl, (sorry to be biased, I think the beautiful girl is the only highlight of the films), and 0.5 for the fact that she is shorter than Azumi 1. I saw Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seats. I was surprised to be able to sit. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the positive points of the film. The girl. Ueto Aya is cute. That's all there is to save the whole movie. The fact is that, if the main character was male, I'm sure most people (including me) wouldn't have touched the film at all. <br /> <br /> Now let's talk about the negative points. First, it's very draggy, with lots of repeated scenes. The scenes of Nachi and Azumi keep coming back. It looks more like a dramatic way to shoot. Typical Japanese films love flashbacks and this film too. Secondly, the film is too unrealistic in a historical context. I don't care about unrealistic films. But this film is like a poor way of showing creativity, throwing ninjas that act like bears and cobwebs, etc. It reminds me of Shinobi, even though Shinobi is a fantasy-based film. Moreover, to portray "I don't know" what effect, the director films people who die of sprayed blood (literally) all around ... people who don't realize their head have been cut off ... etc. Etc. etc. Too many of them ruin the show. It seems that the influence of souls is strong in this film. Thirdly, the third show is greatly degraded, Azumi should not be a murderer. It looks more like an army of a man to me, just a female. I don't think you see the assassins loading into military camps. The only time I heard that he was acting "killer-loved" was when he killed Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Finally, the plot was thin in both films. It is a linear plot without development and surprises in any way.
