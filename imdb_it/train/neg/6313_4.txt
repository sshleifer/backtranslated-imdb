Well, it's not often that in the UK we have a film about life in the inner city from the point of view of the Afro-Caribbean community, the last example I could remember was the Babylonian Babylon in 1980. So I had great expectations when I heard on Bullet Boy, a film that was advertised as the English version of La Haine! Well, La Haine is not! I agree that the use of dialogue and the environment gives this film an authenticity that has escaped other British films in recent times, but my concern is that this film ends sadly. <br /> <br /> The film intelligently treats the worsening of the problem of black-on-black violence that is woefully common to everyone in London, but it worries me that directors now use the type of casting in the plot rather than in the characters that is equally harmful. Saul Dibb had a great opportunity to make a film that could be both entertaining and challenging for all of us, but unfortunately he missed and created a film that reinforces the idea that being a young black male in London the only future is violence and the tragedy
