A Harlem Renaissance film and one author in particular. It puts him at odds with a modern story of a young black gay artist. <br /> <br /> If this seems vague, it is because the film itself is. It is well directed, fairly well written and (for the most part) well acted. Even the scenes of the past are shot in black and white moody. This is also one of the few films dealing with gay men who DO NOT avoid sex scenes (not so explicit and not frontal). However, mostly I hated this. <br /> <br /> The film runs everywhere, is full of unlikely characters (including the main character) and (this is the killer) moves at a snail's pace. Three times I thought of leaving the theater because I was so deeply bored. But the director was there, so I stayed. <br /> <br /> His talk afterwords shows that this was a labor of love and it took 6 years to complete. I really wish I liked it better (there are MANY few movies that honestly deal with black gays) but I can't. Unless you are very interested in the Harlem Renaissance there is no reason to see it.
