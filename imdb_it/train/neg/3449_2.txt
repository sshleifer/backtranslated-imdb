Fortunately, there is no video of this aspiring western that is a vehicle aboard Big Frank at a time when his career was in ruins. The story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of her big brother gun and who is discharged from the city by the bad guys only to return to gather her elves with a new found courage must have been written by a back-room writer. All in all, this show stinks. History is fundamentally boring, ill-conceived and so naive as to offend your intelligence. I have to start completely from the other reviewer who found him "... undervalued ..." Critics slammed him in that moment and deservedly. You will have to take it during the last show, if you are late and you have an attack of insomnia. But if you can sit down, you have more fortitude than most of my cinema-loving friends.
