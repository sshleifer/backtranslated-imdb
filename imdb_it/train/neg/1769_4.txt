1st watched 29/04/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mick Garris): Stephen King-style film Campy has so many strange and stupid elements that you start laughing for the extreme strangeness of about 3 / 4 in the movie and you wonder if this movie could have a cult following for King's fans. It is the story of a mother and a son who are somnambulists (a kind of feline, meat that eats, that needs life, an almost extinct race of humanoid) that move from one city to another, looking for virgins to feed themselves to maintain themselves in life. They run into normal people of the upper class, except that they are secret lovers and cats that wander around their home, day and night. Cats are deadly to them, so they set traps in their backyard to try to keep the population at bay. We see that they break a couple of times when they attack (which is also the first of my cinematic experience) --- we hope that no real cat has been damaged in the making of the film. The guy is looking for a sweet girl who has a crush on him until he becomes a "sleepwalker" and then he just wants his body. There is so much campy uniqueness in this film that it would have been better if it had been a satirical comedy about the whole suburban life, but the director instead tries to scare you every couple of minutes until you would like it to pass over it and pull out the blood . Eventually it happens and the film ends with the typical Stephen King finale. The film is interesting because King's humor comes more than usual, but his strangeness is also very present and what you have is a film that his fans will probably appreciate and should have in their collection, but as a cinematic experience it is really worth the penalty size.
