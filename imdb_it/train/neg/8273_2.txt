A lot of promises and nothing more. An all-star cast certainly by Hong Kong standards, but the man or man is this stinker. No story? Okay, the action will make up for it like most HK action movies. What? Is the action terrible, trivial and sparse? The Dragon Dynasty publications so far are large and superb and generally considered to be classics of Asian cinema. This is a plague. They managed to hire a couple of Infernal Affairs actors, but they can't bring life to a disconnected script. There are dialogue scenes in which two or three lines are pronounced with a cut between each and no continuity in what the characters are saying. You almost feel like they're giving a running monologue and just ignoring the other characters. Michael Biehn is made of wood, really? Does Sammo Hung use a double? There's no way. Yes, way. Stay away.
