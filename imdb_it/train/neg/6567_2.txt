I went to this film hoping for the best. I like wartime musicals in general. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did a good job with their roles; however, the writers gave them a boring dialogue. The love interest between the two did not really grow; suddenly he was there. I didn't think much about music; the best number was the fragment we heard about Spike Jones with "Der Fuhrer's Face". The only complete number that Spike Jones has made has had little of his great musical comedy; pretty docile stuff, even with the monkey. Bert Lahr's comic skits were endless. <br /> <br /> There were parts to be appreciated: Lucille Ball was a nice look, and there was a good selection of bit players that really deserved more screen time.
