drss1942 really took the words out of my mouth. I loved Segal's first films and I feel the only one that is still true to him. I just saw this movie (ok, I fell asleep by about 90%, so I didn't see the end). When I woke up and saw that I was on the DVD menu, I was grateful that I never went through that movie again and I didn't dare find out what happened at the end. There was something strange about Segal's voice and others. It reminded me of the original Mad Max in which the voice was dubbed, but in the same language (Australlian is English, right? :) Anyway, if I had 10 inches, they would all go for this rye injustice.
