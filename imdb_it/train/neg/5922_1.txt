My mother holds a tape of this film as a general threat to every movie lover who annoys her. Everything about it stinks. <br /> <br /> As such it is a true classic. <br /> <br /> Who gave it 10/10? Were you unwittingly watching a good movie and did you accidentally vote for it? <br /> <br /> Anyone involved in the film making process should be forced to watch at least a small part of this film. It should be an indelible blot on the minds of everything that holds the sacred film and be revered as the tide mark of dramatic cinema.
