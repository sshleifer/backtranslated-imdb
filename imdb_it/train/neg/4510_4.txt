I love the Memoirs of a Geisha, so I read the book twice; it's one of the best books I read last year. I couldn't wait to see the movie and I was afraid that reading the book could ruin the pleasure of watching the movie. I didn't expect the film to be so bad. Some of the best parts of the book have been omitted from the film and the characters were weak with Hatsumomo (Li Gong) was the worst. If I didn't read the book, this film would be a bit confusing and inexplicable. The plot of the film reads "Nitta Sayuri reveals how she transcended her fishing ..." Has anyone seen how or when Sayuri became Nitta Sayuri? Forget the movie and read the book.
