Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: it's me or all the movies that start in Roswell, New Mexico, they suck. Get Alieno mixed with The Thing, mixed with Contact, mixed with all things on the beach, The Andromeda Strain, the scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark class and a launch in a small Stargate to boot. <br /> <br /> The derivative does not even begin to describe this film. Of course, with nothing original plot, do they amplify the right blood and sex? No gore is a blink of an eye and you miss business and sex is all about teasing. (James Spader casually mentions that he needs a shower and the exquisite Leslie Stefanson asks to join him ??. He rejects her. AGGH!) <br /> <br /> In fact, if a film ever needed a scene of shower to liven things up on this is. I mean, if you have incredibly beautiful women in white swimsuits wandering through a research base in Antarctica why not go broke. <br /> <br /> With about 30 seconds of thrill throughout the movie, Alien Hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci-fi adventure. I needed a much better plot to animate it and the way Alien itself is a horribly clich√© device and has virtually no screen time for someone sharing half of the title. <br /> <br /> I also asked while viewing what is with the corn babies in the space motif. (Note that since Jason of the 13th century, Pinhead of Hellraiser and Leprechaun have all traveled into space to kill the maiden teenagers why not the cornfield?) The cornfield characters wore Logan's Run extras and I was just waiting for the stems to become alive and attack them. <br /> <br /> Which in any case would have been exciting and apparently contrary to this alliance for the films. The acting is mostly excellent while Spader resumes the role of Stargate while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest innovations in Antarctic beachwear. But John Lynch read the entire script and behaves like an evil fool before the story indicates it. <br /> <br /> Alien Hunter is a disappointing derivative slogan that makes me a good son of The Corn in Film about space
