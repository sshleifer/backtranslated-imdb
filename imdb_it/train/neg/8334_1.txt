This has the absolute worst performance by Robert Duval who plays just like William Buckley during the entire movie. His melodramatic acting still takes away any dramatic interest. I'm not sure it's a deliberate scene of theft or involuntary, but it's the only thing I can remember from a truly forgettable movie. This image should be shown in every acting class of an example of what not to do. Thank God, Duvall continued to do bigger and better things and stopped trying to get a learned accent. He's a good character actor, but that's all. Klaus is much better. His performance is silent and noteworthy.
