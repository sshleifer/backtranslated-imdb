I always wanted to see it because I love horror films like that and with a title like this I was sure "The Incredible Melting Man" would be a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> It really wasn't. I mean, the acting was incredibly bad, the script contained some classic wrong lines and the special effects looked like someone had sneezed all over the main actor, so I should have loved him. Unfortunately it is really overlooked among these highlights. I decided to watch the last half of the movie while I was filing a tax return. This is how boring this movie is. <br /> <br /> However, if you love bad movies you will enjoy the dramatic release of Fat Nurse and the stellar acting of the boy who plays Dr. Ted. To be honest with the poor man, he must deliver some surprisingly inept lines with a straight face - like the conversation he has with his wife in tracking down the IM Man: <br /> <br /> "I'll find him with a counter geiger. "" Is it radioactive? " "Just a little." <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot has Dr. Ted wandering trying to find a superstrung zombie killing machine armed only with what looks like a mini-Dyson. He is a brave man. Unfortunately his plan fails when he finds a large amount of goop on a tree. "Oh god - it's his ear!" says Dr. Ted to the public. I'm so glad you made it clear. <br /> <br /> I realize that I'm making this movie look funny. It would be if it were only about ten minutes, but unfortunately it will go on and on and the Incredible Melting Dude will just make a sticky mess when it should eat more people in my opinion. I think if you were really stoned you would probably love it, only you don't have pop-tarts during the movie, because the main actor really looks like one near the end.
