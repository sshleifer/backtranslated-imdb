I was so eager to see this one of my favorite TV shows. I saw the Universal brand followed by a title and a song with the theme of new knowledge that still impress me. Computerized animation on some scenarios as a solid title name "The Jetsons" or a dimension view of a spaceship approaching an amusement park and more has made this version splendid and fantastic. Shortly after, until the end ... I could not believe my eyes !!!! How lucky I was to forget everything I had seen. Tiffany's songs and her soundtrack in a new arrangement were in my head. In any case, I would like to see this space family (also The Flintstones and Yogi Bear) in all computer graphics projects like Toy story or Bug's life. The best style for Hanna-Barbera is in my opinion.
