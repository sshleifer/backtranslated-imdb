Being a fan of films like "Fire Sale", "Where's Poppa", "Airplane", I saw this because it was favorably mentioned in the context of real comedies and satires like the aforementioned. Well, WRONG CONCLUSION! <br /> <br /> Not only is it not fun, it makes you angry because it's not bad in slavery, in a nice way but in a really bad way. It's ugly. The script does not contain a single funny line that is rather the way you are trying to entertain the audience with humor. <br /> <br /> Adam Arkin's vocal impediment is probably the most annoying thing in this film. Yet this cruelty of nature does not prevent him from being pleased with the whole film and has difficulty not looking into the camera. This amateur without charisma is perfectly suited to continuous errors of continuity and bumbling throughout history - if you find one. <br /> <br /> Ed McMahon - I had to think about Jay Leno, another late-night talk show person, who always refuses to call himself an actor. Well, I've seen some Leno movies and he's Laurence Olivier compared to McMahon. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Mars is good, though. In the few lines he gave. I'm not easily scared of bad comedies, so I kept watching and searching for quasi-jokes about every 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The movie actually becomes a kind of comedy as soon as Alan Arkin takes over - It literally does: starting at 75 minutes in the movie it's in every scene. But it's too little, too late. <br /> <br /> When movies try to deceive you into believing that their lack of professionalism is the reason why you will like them because they have the right intentions, they remind me of the students I didn't prepare for an exam. In these cases you must remain strict and the grade must be an "F". (But please don't assume that I'm a teacher. It's a profession with respectability somewhere between politician and child molester). <br /> <br /> If you are really looking for a nice horror / scifi movie that is fun to watch and contains lines try "Man with the Screaming Brain" by Bruce Campbell. Or look at Sunshine / Core if you prefer the modern SciFi Schlock. Those are equally funny, even if unintentionally.
