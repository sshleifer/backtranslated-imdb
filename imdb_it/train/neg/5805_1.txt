Anyone who has seen the original should go out and destroy this terrible remake. Alex Baldwin who tries to imitate the late Steve Mcqueen in one word by word remake doesn't work. While Baldwin has done an admirable job, this is a flop from start to finish. McQueen had charisma, never tried to compete with a star. As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw he said enough. McQueen seemed as dangerous, threatening and credible as Doc, the film had excitement and suspense, Baldwin and the company turned it into a comedy, I laughed the only time I saw this miserable movie. And that frightening hairstyle for Michael Madsen who is one of the most exciting and believable actors of today! The make-up people played the part of Michael, what they were thinking. If you want to see the film as it was under the direction of Sam Peckinpah Get the original!
