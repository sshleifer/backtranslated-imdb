I rented a series of Blockbuster movies last night, and this was the first one I saw (it was late on a Saturday night, I wanted a "correction for horror movies") ... Wow, this was horrible, almost embarrassing like that. .. Stupid slasher story I really thought that movies like Scream had put an end to; amateur actors offering insidious and banal dialogues that are hard to believe were actually typed and read a page; and gore scenes that have nothing to get excited about (especially when they occur in a poorly scripted movie). <br /> <br /> But I have always believed that no film was totally 100% worthless. Here are the few positive things I can say about this mess: <br /> <br /> # 1 Bobbie Phillips: love this actress. She is the only cast member who shows any acting talent. The only reason I had the opportunity to rent this is because his name was on the front page. He assumes his presence in this collapse with professionalism, even if at times he seems astonished to act in such a cruel story. <br /> <br /> # 2 Involuntary hilarity: this is the kind of film I remember seeing when there were still house theaters around the country and they included crap like this as the third movie on a triple bill with a prestigious thriller movie that was finally making its way inland. Unfortunately, in this direct-to-video age, most viewers have to endure these turkeys alone now without the common experience of being part of an audience that mocks and throws stuff on the screen because the movie is so terrible. Which leads to-- <br /> <br /> # 3 porn stars trying to act !: Mainly at hand because the producers do not need to cajole or beg with them to strip themselves for extended sex scenes, but this trade-offs usually mean that they actually manage to utter some jokes that should advance a story (other than "ooh yeah baby" or "harder!"). And, with pride, they all skillfully deliver to look silly when they try to act. I would almost exclude Ginger Lynn Allen from this group if his character was not to be an Irish mom and in fact he is trying to accent, which causes smiles to come. <br /> <br /> It's nice to look for the positive in all experiences, and that's what I got from this "Evil Breed" cesspool.
