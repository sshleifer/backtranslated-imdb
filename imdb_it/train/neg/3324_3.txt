I saw him by chance a lazy summer afternoon. He was playing on HBO's family programming channel. At first I was attracted to what I thought was a Disney animation. But then, after a few minutes, I found myself looking for the remote control, so I could find the 'INFO BUTTON', to find out what was in the world on my TV. I have nothing against Harvey F., I enjoy many of his films, but one thing he is not, is a voice-over artist. Sure, it has one of the most unique voices in Hollywood, but it only works as part of a bigger visual package. Attacking his voice to a cute duck made the observation a little difficult. As for the rest of the cast, without inspiration. I suppose working on this film didn't attract the excellent voice on the talent out there. <br /> <br /> So, weak vocal talent, strong animation ... who was this film? Gay teen ducks? I don't understand. Is there really such a lack of role models for young homosexuals, that we have to resort to animated ducks? A cute story, and like the title, this movie that I found difficult to love, just like an ugly duckling.
