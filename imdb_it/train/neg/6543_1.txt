The 90s started having daytime talk shows left and right. Every network had one, and everyone lacked an Originality thing. Ricky Lake was just another show to entertain the mother of the obese trailer park with a Marlboro cigarette hanging out of her mouth as she nursed one of her dozen toothless and illiterate children. The English language and other cornerstones of humanity in which ruined by this shows existence. Titltes ranging from Girl you to Pigeon Head and so on. How could anyone want to see this pure and total garbage? Has our society really become nothing more than a bunch of billy and hill beat? The people that appear on this show were Trash. The people who watched this show were Trash. Anyone who wants to watch this show on air or put it on DVD is TRASH. People wonder why Americans are getting huge piles of lard and too fat even to get a job, having shows like this tells them to be 500 pounds overweight and to have 12-year-old girls acting like prostitutes . Having that waste on TV ruined the moral.
