I would like to be very clear about this film. I didn't see this movie because of the plot, I watch it for sassy sex scenes. That said, this movie is so damn terrible that I happen to go from the pure joy of seeing a divine body of Traci (Mandy Schaffer) and to focus my eyes on the disaster of a plot. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert The first scene of the film had already made me shiver ... you see a woman who paints something by the lake, in pure happiness and serenity, then a beautiful girl approaches and asks if could paint next to her. When they were both finished, they showed what they had done ... and the woman painted A VINEYARD WHEN IT IS IN THE LAKE. What kind of screwball manager would make this kind of mistake ?? And in another scene, Traci gets to kill his teacher's lover by crushing him with the sail rod, and then swims away, and none of the city police suspect her once. I mean HELLOOOOO? MANDY DIDN'T YOU WEAR A GLOVE MADE SHE? HER FINGER PRINTS ARE ALL THE BARS OF GOD OF GOD !! After that, it gets worse, every time Mandy is around, there is the "chilling" sound effect that sounds like a muted cat. It is also a pity that Rosanna Arquette is in this film. I really feel sorry for her having to act in this very low budget, no money movie. The same goes for JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who also has the misfortune of acting in this film. All in all, 2/10.
