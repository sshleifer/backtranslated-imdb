The reviews I read for this movie were pretty decent so I decided to take a look. BAD IDEA! This is another movie about a ghost for revenge against a group of friends. The story is stupid, mixes two parts Ringu with a part Prom Night, a sprinkle of I Know what you did last summer, and add a small dash of Single White Female - now they merge to become completely meaningless. There is nothing new in this plot, and revisiting the clich√©s I am so fond of was not even fun this time. This movie leaps too far to and from the past, and once I understood everything, I realized that it still didn't make much sense. The characters go from healthy to psychopaths in the blink of an eye. Speaking of characters, they're all your favorite stereotypes: the greedy selfish lawyer, the self-centered actress, the baseball star, the voyeur video, the bitter girl, the spooky quiet girl, the prettiest pretty girl, a bizarre black cat ... and I didn't care about any of them. Perhaps a better writer could have made the film work, there were decent scenes, but overall this film was a disaster. I should also mention a certain "video tape" that would have been IMPOSSIBLE to shoot. <br /> <br /> This film is not the worst Asian horror I have to offer, but it's still pretty ugly. If you just want to see some scary pictures in the dark, or just want to laugh out loud in some acting, or just want to scream "you're stupid!" on a movie screen, or simply want to have another Asian horror movie that comes to mind when someone asks you how many you've seen: this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Those looking for a decent story look elsewhere.
