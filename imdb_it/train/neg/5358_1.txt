It is obvious that all the good reviews published so far for this film come from insiders who have been involved in the film or who know someone who knows someone and have therefore seen multiple cuts. Well, I don't know anyone involved, and I saw the final cut, and it's pure garbage. The only thing he has for this is ambition and more cameo from the legends of horror (none on the screen for a long time). It's as if the directors had made this film during a weekend during a horror convention and actors like Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berryman were shooting the scenes during coffee breaks. It is an ultra-cheap wannabe X-Files and video shooter with a terrible acting by a cast of non-actors with more mullets than is acceptable in the 21st century. There is little or no action; it is an explanatory dialogue that tries to explain an unnecessarily twisted plot. Ther computer FX is a joke, but there aren't enough, nor enough actions to make this movie fun in a MST3K way. After about 8 straight scenes of nothing but talking, you'll find yourself reaching for the fast forward button ... and don't let it go. Absolutely useless.
