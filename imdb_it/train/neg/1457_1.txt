I have seen this movie a few times and all I can say is that this is a low-budget garbage that has nothing to do with real facts. The actors' performances are very poor but they are the result of limited chances of acting. Anyone who has watched this movie now probably thinks of Hitler as a crazy and skinny fool who runs with a gun like a Chicago gangster. I can only say that there are much better films about Hitler and Germany in those years and that Rise of Evil is far below average. I can recommend the German film Downfall where you can see the brilliant performance of the Swiss actor Bruno Ganz in a role of Adolf Hitler.
