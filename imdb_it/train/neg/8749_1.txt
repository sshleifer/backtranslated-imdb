A terrible film as everyone has said. What made me laugh was Scott McNealy's cameo appearance, which awarded a prize to one of the murdered programmers facing a wall of SUN logos. McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that practically defines itself for its hatred of Microsoft. They were instrumental in presenting antitrust complaints against Microsoft. So, were they stupid enough to think that this bad movie would fuel that fire? <br /> <br /> There is no public record on Sun's involvement, but clearly the creators of this film know Scott McNealy. An interesting mystery.
