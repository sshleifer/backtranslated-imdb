Only glandular secretions - and please don't ask for further details - young virgins can keep the body and mind in rapid deterioration of the wife of the old, fresh and youthful horticulturist. Since, like most people, with the exception of those who take part in medical experiments, virgins rarely voluntarily abandon their secretions, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) organizes that they are abducted and preserved. It will do the extraction by itself. <br /> <br /> What a great cheese ball from a premise for a low budget horror film. If The Corpse Vanishes turns out not to be the horror item, as a simple limburger leaves an interesting aftertaste. <br /> <br /> Of course, the acting is almost horrible except for the actors lucky enough to play the crazy dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played Il Maestro in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); his crazy brute of a brother, Angel (Frank Moran), who grunts a lot and has a fetish for the virgins' hair; the mad mother of the two (Minerva Urecale); the mad wife (Elizabeth Russell), who sleeps in a luxurious coffin and, of course, the mad doctor (Lugosi). <br /> <br /> A young enterprising reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters) tracks down the doctor because of a strange orchid with a particularly sweet smell that had been worn by the victims. When the doctor and his wife invite Pat to stay the night, a furious storm immediately breaks out. That clue tells us that violent violence is about to explode inside. Since it is known that in Hollywood all young unmarried women were virgins, Pat could have unpleasant surprises to deal with. They include dark passages, a crisp laboratory where a nearby dead virgin is preserved, an underground mausoleum and, later, a direct threat to Patricia's glandular secretions. If he survives, what story should he give to his publisher. <br /> <br /> If you taste this moist slice of Velveeta moldy (and why not? Don't be superior), don't judge Bela Lugosi by the company that holds here. It had a huge impact in Dracula (1931), but my favorite movie is The Black Cat (1934). How Dr. Vitas Werdegast is a sad, ironic, protective man of his two young friends. When he finally takes a scalpel for Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff) and starts skinning the living man, ah, well, it's a great scene.
