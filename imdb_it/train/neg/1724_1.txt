... and it's this movie. I imagine that if there really was a negative afterlife, damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable sofa and forced to watch this film in a continuous cycle for eternity. <br /> <br /> Ok, maybe it's not so bad, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen next to "Manos, the Hands of Fate" ... and I've seen a lot of bad movies, believe me. <br /> <br /> This is just a poor B movie, a bad film production at its best (or is it worse?) The thing that I really didn't like about this movie is the idiot couple who launched for relief comedy . Now, a little relief from the comedy is a good thing, but most of the film is focused on the adventures of these two morons, rather than on the "heroes" of this film, which are actually there for less time than them! <br /> <br /> To be honest, Crown International really destroyed the movie by adding poor music and doing a poor job of editing. But honestly, this was probably a bad movie to start with, so Crown really couldn't have done so much to hurt him. <br /> <br /> This really needs to be on the list of 100 below. I wouldn't want this on my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's my kind of B campy movie. It was bad, but I still liked it, despite my one-star rating.
