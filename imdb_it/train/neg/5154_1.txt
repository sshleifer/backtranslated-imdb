this is the only movie I've ever walked. bad acting - bad plot - bad choice - bad direction - bad cinematography - if they decided to take a bad photo they couldn't have done a better job. I hope they are proud of his turkey. I'm surprised that anyone associated with this film was ever hired back in Hollywood. do not waste time!
