Having just seen this movie, I almost feel like I've wasted 2 hours of my life, but I guess there's something good in everything: <br /> <br /> If I were to evaluate this like any other movie, you can only get 1 or 2 floors, but if I classify it as a low budget ind. film, it could be 3 or 4. A film is supposed to be "complete" and without too long passages of boredom or loss of time. This film is not. But I imagine that many independent films relate to the ability to show films, and considering this, this film has some highlights. If I have to comment on what the directors should bring with them to their next project, I imagine that the distorted sound effects have a certain quality. They also manage to build some characters, but this leads me to what they should leave out in their next project, because character building takes too long, as it is mostly irrelevant to the film's plot. Nor will the long spaces of time dedicated to walking be continued in the next project - what's the point? I imagine that this film tries to be a little bit of everything (to build characters, suspense and a plot), and ends up being nothing (not much) <br /> <br /> This movie tries too much and too hard, and I imagine which should have been cut into a short film. I could easily manage to find an hour of walking or useless dialogue to cut the film. <br /> <br /> There are too many irrelevant things in this film. The story should have been more streamlined. I know there should be a bit of mystery in this film, but a slight surprise for who the killer is, doesn't make a mystery. The story behind the "mystery" hardly receives any attention during the film, which leaves the final "point" as a rapid and unsatisfactory aspect. <br /> <br /> So I would like to say that this film was a nice attempt, but I can't. I hope the directors learn from their mistakes and produce a better product next time. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in learning on the bench from the production of cheap films, you don't need to look at this - I don't even understand why everyone thinks it's bad. <br /> <br /> As others have stated, I'm pretty sure the many 10 assigned to this film come from people somehow involved in the film. This film could not receive a "10" judging from a remote point of view.
