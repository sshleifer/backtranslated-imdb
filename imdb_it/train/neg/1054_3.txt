The rural family drama - with perhaps a nod to "common people" - concerns a boy who retires into himself after mortally wounding his older brother in a shooting accident. Despite the negative theme (given the merciless, wordless treatment of director Christopher Cain), there are some dynamics in this sad story that is worth exploring. Unfortunately, the isolated country atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation make the film a frustrating experience. With Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the film is almost a small-scale meeting of "The Natural". It is a pity that this project did not have the necessary talent behind the camera to create a compelling and memorable image. * 1/2 from ****
