The model Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway) is brutally raped by a teacher (Chris Sarandon) of his sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway). It is processed but becomes totally free. So rapes Kathy! <br /> <br /> Films questionable and sick rape. This film was advertised as a major drama that deals with rape. What it is is a misread and (for the most part) misinterpreted drama. He assumes he is sympathetic to the rape victim but pushes the scene in the face. To be completely honest, however, Hemingway's acting is so ugly in that sequence that it loses every real impact it could have had. The test scenes were boring and predictable. And the film went too far when Mariel was raped for 15 years (fortunately it was not shown). I admit, however, that it led to a fantastic ending when Margaux took a gun and shot Sarandon dead. But seriously - to rape a young girl is just revolting. <br /> <br /> Acting doesn't help. For example, Margaux was not an actress. She was certainly a beautiful woman (and I think she was a real model) but her acting left a lot to be desired. Reduces the movie. Mariel was OK, but this was one of her first films. Sarandon does what he can as the rapist. He wasn't bad but the terrible script worked against him. <br /> <br /> I remember hearing that in a screening of this in 1976 some women stood up and applauded when Sarandon was killed, so maybe this works for some people. I found this boring, simplistic and REALLY sick. A 1 all the way.
