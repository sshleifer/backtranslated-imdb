The original "Cube" is a fantastic B-movie full of paranoia, fleshy characterization and exaggerated performance. It's creepy, cryptic and cool. And it's perfectly fine, alone, without a stupid sequel like "Cube Zero". <br /> <br /> This third film (!) of the Cube series is partly reconstructed (most of the booby traps are sadly recycled), partial aberration. He takes the courageous step of explaining what the cube is - something that was never revealed in the first film - but, given that the explanation is bland, I would prefer it to be kept secret. There are some potentially interesting references to the society that exists outside the cube, but they never develop beyond suggestions about some kind of totalitarian political-religious state. So what small social commentary feels flat and blurry. <br /> <br /> What works? Basically nothing. The acting is a purely amateur hour, the rhythm is slow (how much of this film consists of two nerds watching a screen?), And the effects of blood, while revolting, cannot convince. In short, "Cube Zero" reminded me of a fan-fic "Cube", a sloppy and suffering clone of a good movie that surely didn't need a sequel.
