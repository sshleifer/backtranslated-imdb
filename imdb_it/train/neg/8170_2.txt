A friend and I went through a phase a few years ago of selecting the most demanding horror films in the video library for evening entertainment. For some reason, I ended up buying this (probably v. V. Cheap). <br /> <br /> The low-cost synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre. There are also some very funny scenes. Between them there is a scene in which a man is attacked and defends himself with a number of improbable objects, he made me laugh at that moment (it doesn't seem very funny in retrospect, but you go there). <br /> <br /> Apart from that it is total crap, beware. But it probably deserves a watch if you like movies like "Chopping Mall". Yes, I saw it too.
