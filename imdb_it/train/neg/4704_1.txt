A bad attempt on a young spinal. At least the music in the spinal cord was good. <br /> <br /> This is indeed a very sad case of Hollywood nepotism at its worst. A group of Hollywood executives, musicians and bad producers create a "poopie" show so their children can be in the spotlight. Oh please !!! The pot humor was also bad. I hate this stuff when there are incredibly talented children (musicians, actors and artists) out there who break their ass to succeed and this crap comes. <br /> <br /> Help them all !!!! Why wasn't Gene Simmons? Ameriac's taste in entertainment is going down in the bathroom.
