I was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the New York Times. Furthermore, I am also from Shanghai, so there was more than a passing interest in the subject. However, after looking at it, I was extremely disappointed. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the film was tremendously slow and monotonous. The director lingered on some scenes for too long. There was no passion or chemistry among the lovers. There was hardly any dialogue. Dialogue was necessary to compensate for the lack of acting. At the end of the film, you felt no sympathy for the characters. Everything in this film was missing. The script was weak, the acting was poor and the editing was non-existent. The director tried to emulate certain styles of film noir but failed miserably. A good movie is one in which it catches your attention, keeps it and manages to conclude without you feeling that time has passed. This film never seemed to end. Don't waste your money on this movie.
