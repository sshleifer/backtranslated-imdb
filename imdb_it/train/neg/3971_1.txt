Give me my money back! Give me my life back! Give me some credit. This film was worthy vomit. Useless and time consuming. What a waste of energy and totally useless. Okay, I understand the premise and the idea sounds, but give us a break! Next time give me the money and let me spend it. Lost child, remorse mothers, blamed husband! Clich yes yes! Get a life! Sorry but this film was a total waste of my time, my money and my being. I'd rather watch the eggs cook! No real explanation of why this happened. Prison? Why? Lost? obvious but why? Acting deserves something I'm doing here Oscar and cinematography I'm doing just this for a salary? How much did this film do? Well, this foolish fool has rented a copy. Enough said
