If they could get Ed Asner why didn't they get other actors instead of people going to the same church as the producers? And because the protagonist threw down the wise old character wise when he was never in danger. He forced the old man to mask the wound with pride and so the boy felt guilty leaving him with a disability for life. I guess this is why the main character refuses money and why the old man works like a dog even when he volunteers for an extra job. If the d-bag kid is a bad guy because he is a long distance kid, then why is a soldier better. He has good reason to be jealous, a good reason to take her away from her hometown and from a manipulative and protective father. All the characters that want to be nice are not and all the others are the "bad" boyfriends. How did a wine merchant and a sawmill worker meet anyway?
