The subject that this latest adman-turn-movieman attempts to address in his debut adventure (ad) is a rather old topic of discussion from almost all cultural standards - timeless romanticism (pun intended). <br /> <br /> However, exploration (and exploitation for Desi aud) sadly falls as the usual "pepper, spice and sugar" inclinations on the usual masala mix of b / g score, dialogues, dance, drama , etc. Create a nice package with not much inside. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes of the film, the kitchen scene was repeated at least 8-9 times. Further replicas follow the film (after all the protagonist is a cook). But here is the problem - no story! Hah, no wonder. Someone forgot to write a script. <br /> <br /> Amitabh puts in a Cheeni Jyada (more) quantity of over-acting. Really, when will this guy ever stop? How many 60-year-olds hopping around like that even when they are teased by a single 30-something ??? Mind timeless yes, but surely what about the body not so ageless? And sun? Excuse me, soul? The reasonably good acting of Paresh Rawal who has the only sensible role in the film. The director has no sense of realism that is involved in his new discovery of a new idea. Nowhere are there presented problems or problems of real life that a couple could face, besides getting married which is only the initial obstacle. The sub-plot of a small child with cancer (the first love of the unmarried boy) goes nowhere and any small appearance that this otherwise insipid presentation would have evoked is quickly killed along with the girl's character. <br /> <br /> However, nice try but not yet completely.
