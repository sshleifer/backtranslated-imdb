To my knowledge, the Largo winch was a famous Belgian comic (never read) that related the adventures of a playboy, a sort of James Bond without a spy life! So when I had to choose a film for a 5 year old boy, I took it because the boy was already a big James Bond fan! <br /> <br /> But, immediately after the opening credits, I have some serious doubts: when American films offer an incredible start, here, no action and a torrid sex scene ?? So, does the story get very complicated with financial moves ?? I thought I lost the baby. <br /> <br /> But, strangely, he had been captured by Largo, and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> Was it the excellent interpretation of Tom Sisley? The difficult relationship that Largo has with his father? The multi-box story where friends are the bad guys, the bad guys are friends? The exotic locations of Honk-Kong, Yugoslavia? <br /> <br /> I don't know, but he really cares about Largo ("Will he get up?) and we enjoyed our moment.
