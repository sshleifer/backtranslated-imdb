What has the murky video got to do at the beginning and sporadically during the movie? It's like someone putting muddy water on the camera lens. <br /> <br /> Violence and nudity could make someone lose their head, but, along with mostly bad acting, is what makes a good cult movie, I suppose. /> <br /> My favorite line is delivered by Tarquin the Vampire, "Alas, your race is stupid". Ok, nobody should ever say "alas" in a movie line unless they are English and live in the 18th century. <br /> <br /> The acting of the character of Van Helsing and the bad girl "Rally" is not bad. I also liked Master Little played by Ron Little. Evil martial arts! Don't take it too seriously and you'll like it.
