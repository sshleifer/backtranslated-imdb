This was a film I was hoping to suggest to my American friends. But after 4 attempts to watch the movie to finish, I knew I couldn't even watch that damn thing to shut down. You almost believe that the real war didn't last that long. The others will try to question my patriotism for criticizing a film like this. But don't overdo it, you can't go from Saving Private Ryan to LOC. Forget the budget difference of the film or the public - those do not prevent a director from making an intelligent film. The length of the film is not so serious and the fact that it is repetitive - they continue to attack the same hill but give it different names. I thought the LOC was terrible ground - this hill looked like my backyard. The character development sequences (soilder flashbacks, which look back to their last moments before being implemented) should have been in the film and not just grouped into a long memory. To date, I have yet to see the ending. But there was a much better movie (not saying much) called Border.
