"Black Angel" is a small unit, with June Vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after he was found guilty of killing an old acquaintance. Dan Duryea (the husband of the murdered woman) decides to help Vincent find the real culprit. Peter Lorre has an ungrateful role as a suspect. This film noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer, without ever getting anything special. It's pleasant enough, but then, at some point, it stops making sense and the solution to the mystery causes one of those great "give me a break" reactions. That final alone could have completely sunk the film, but what precedes the conclusion is not very good. Vincent is a disgusting heroine and Duryea has never been good at playing good guys. I love film noir, but this was a real disappointment.
