Typical thriller, it has been done many times in the past. Simple plot scheme; policewoman Liotta becomes obsessed with Russell's wife and tries to clash with good old Kurt to be able to have her. This is beyond the predictable, not even trying to guess, the plot is the plot and there are no thoughts outside the box. I imagine the only reason to see it is to see how it develops, but nothing has been done originally or in an interesting way. There's really nothing to say about this film, it's not particularly bad, but there are no good points either. Russell plays Russell and you know what you'll get when you see him in a movie. Ditto Liotta. Stowe has an annoying cher color voice. I read the plot and could see the film in my head, it was so obvious and essential. I looked at it and it opened up before my eyes exactly as I had imagined. I haven't felt a drop of emotion all the time. I have no sensitivity for this film, it's like I've never looked at it. Given this, it's a pretty useless movie right? Anyway, I'll give it 3/10 for some reason.
