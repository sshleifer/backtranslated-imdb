There are some things I will never understand. Like this movie. And if I had to create a model of Dino and crocodile really cheap and lousy polygon in Maya and then proceed to cut it and paste it into an amateur video clip that makes you scream and is eaten by the same thing? How can anyone believe that a completely false CGI dinocroc that seems completely out of place would affect the events of this film? I know that his level B, his low budget and all the producers, except the producers, could do better than make a piece of shit that no one will ever see or see. It does not make sense. Are people really stupid enough to sit for this? Apparently so. For the laughs? No, this thing is not even worth laughing.
