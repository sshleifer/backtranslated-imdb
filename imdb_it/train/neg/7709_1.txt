I never see this movie. <br /> <br /> Try to be a parody of the scifi / thriller movies of the 50s and 60s, but all that happens is to make you really want so much that you're looking at one of them and not. <br /> <br /> It's very lousy. A parody must have some aspect that has a higher quality than the same. This film does not look like this. <br /> <br /> Save yourself. It's too late for me, but ... don't look at it.
