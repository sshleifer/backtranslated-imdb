This is a Japanese film, but there's also some English here. It's a beautiful film, with beautiful visuals, with the scenic beauty of Hawaii. <br /> <br /> However, this was the only saving quality for me. History was generally boring. Who wants to look at a sullen young woman for 90 percent of the film, why is her "image" husband much older than he advertised? Of course, it could be a fiasco ...... but get over it! <br /> <br /> Only in the last 10 minutes does a turn and become attached to him. At that point, for most spectators, it was too little, too late. We fell asleep by then.
