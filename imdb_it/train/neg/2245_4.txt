This film is NOT the same as the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, and it's a shame because the 1954 version is, in my opinion, much better. I'm not denying Barbra Streisand's talent at all. She is a good actress and a brilliant singer. I don't know the other work by Kris Kristofferson and therefore I can't pronounce it. However, this film leaves a lot to be desired. It's slow pace, has free nudity and vulgar language, and can be very difficult to seduce. <br /> <br /> However, I'm not a big fan of rock music, so it's only natural that I'd like the Judy Garland version better. Watch the 1976 film with Barbra and Kris and judge yourself.
