This type of film has now become an old hat, right? The whole is a nostalgic syrupiness that folds back on itself in a sort of feedback loop. It certainly sounds like a good idea: a fantastic ensemble cast, some nice gags and some human drama about what it could / might have been. Unfortunately, there is no central event that ties them all together, as in "The Big Chill", one of those seminal films that generated films like this script. You end up wanting to see more than one or two people in particular, instead of taking shortcuts for everyone. The superficiality it creates is not only annoying, it is exasperating. The below average script doesn't help.
