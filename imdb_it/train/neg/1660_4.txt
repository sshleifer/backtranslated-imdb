ENDS <br /> <br /> Proportions: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> A woman transforms the tables of an aspiring rapist when assaulting her home , and is forced to decide whether to kill him or inform the police, in which case he could be released and attack her again. <br /> <br /> Fans of exploitation that could expect another nasty 'n' fantasy of rape ready in the style of DAY OF THE WOMAN (1978) will almost certainly be disappointed by EXTREMITIES. True, Farrah Fawcett's character is subjected to two unpleasantly prolonged assaults before taking over his attacker (a suitably slimy James Russo), but screenwriter William Mastrosimone and director Robert M. Young take these unpleasant scenes before unravel the dilemma that informs the moral core of this production. Would their final solution hold up in a court of law? Perhaps ... <br /> <br /> Based on a theatrical performance that reportedly left its actors battered and bruised after each performance, the film makes no attempt to open the narrative and relies instead on an environment limited for the main action. Acing and technical credits are fine, although Fawcett's overly-performing performances will not play effectively to viewers who could trust her to provide an outlet for indignant indignation.
