This film is an embarrassment for the cinema. I can't believe it was even listed as a comedy, it's not funny. Not only was the script atrocious, but the cast people should be shot. Gail O'Grady is just a great actress, but beyond this ...% 99 of the rest of the cast ... ouch. Pretty much everyone else ... wow it's hard even ... wow. Here is the number one rule about the comedy "DON'T TRY TO BE FUN". There are many talented actors in Canada who can do dramas and comedies - none of these have been used in this film. Canadian Nepotism and casting directors are helping to perpetuate the poor film production in Canada. I realize that this is technically an "American" film, but look at the director, the actors, the location, etc. I just saw it on Bravo - they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this movie. Once again, there are a lot of great movies out there that can't get the broadcast time and show this crap.
