Assuming that this will not end with a straight-to-video version, I should say cancel this title at all costs. Unless you are bored by good and well made films, this is it. I saw him last night at AFI Dallas, and I left with 20 minutes remaining, simply because I didn't care anymore (about the plot, not insulting the director ... it's embarrassing). When you can find the goof only 5 minutes into the movie (a crash, a shattered window before shots are fired ... and then the window breaks with the first shot), things will go wrong. Let's just say this is just an indicator of the things that will come ... unfortunately. <br /> <br /> I will spare you all the details, but this is undetectable anyway, even the semi-assed acting of Michael Madsen is disappointing when you expect a recitation from him. And the rape scene ... Christ! "Shut up and take it" should never be used in a rape scene. NEVER. <br /> <br /> 3/10
