My sincere advice to everyone: don't watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't even go near the theater where this movie is being played !! even just a taste of it is bad for your health. serious. no jokes. it's 3.30 am. and I came back from this lousy movie about this universe. FOUR HOURS DAMN !!! I am proud to have survived after all! If it's called survival. <br /> <br /> I am very frustrated. annoyed. disappointed. it was pure waste of time! the money has gone on the run! no plot. I hope to wake up sane tomorrow and without memories of this night !! RUBBISH MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Happy Republic Day to all :)
