Someone else noticed whenever I'm in the car every time the camera takes a new angle that changes direction. As in a scene, it's a residential lane with sidewalks, then I'm on a multi-lane highway with a partition, next to a two-lane road with double yellow lanes. I can understand a low budget but it was just a sloppy job. <br /> <br /> I also read the other reviews and disagree that it was a bad movie. I think if you are a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy you could enjoy this movie. If, however, you find his work / not fun, I would recommend staying away from this.
