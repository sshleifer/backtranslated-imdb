This was one of the most ridiculous and misdirected films I've seen in a long time. I never liked Spike Lee, but I thought I'd try to do this: a bad mistake. The film should show how the real-life murders of Son of Sam hit a neighborhood in the summer of 1977; what he really did was center around the most boring characters that I doubt anyone cared about their drug problems, marital problems and so on, etc. The scenes that describe the murders are just that, and nothing more; a shooting and then back to Saturday Night Fever! What's even more ridiculous is Spike Lee's choice to present himself as a reporter in the film: Spike, trust me, you're not Hitchcock, stay out of the movies, make them even worse. The most stupid scene had to be the dog that spoke with an idiotic voice, which was depicted in a scene before the one in which it should have been shot ??? Spike, what were you thinking when you made this movie? Not thinking at all is my hypothesis. People who think they will see a dramatic crime will follow my advice and not waste time or money on this loser. You're better looking at Jerry Springer in this case! Waste of films, I gave a 1 out of 10: terrible disaster.
