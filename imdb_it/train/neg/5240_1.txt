As soon as it hits a screen, it destroys all intelligent life forms around! But on behalf of its producers I must say that it does not fall into any known cinematographic category, it deserves a new own name! It's a "neurological drama"! It sleeps and depresses every single neuron in a person's brain. <br /> <br /> It's the closest thing you can ever get to a stroke without suffering. It keeps you speechless, all the members become numb, your mouth opens up and stays that way, and the strangest symptom of all is that you make yourself want to go blind and deaf. <br /> <br /> No small business for a sort of "movie". <br /> <br /> The only word that comes to mind only after finishing my ordeal is OUTRAGE !!!!!!
