This film, really, I really mean, it sucks. It has such large plot holes, and a 30-foot dragon can fit through them. Not to mention the dragon itself, which is inevitably the worst computer-generated image ever put on the film. I mean, when you see something like that, you have to think "Wow, someone actually made this movie, then released it. Whoever they are, I'm sure they don't work in the movie business anymore. <br /> <br /> When I took this film, it wasn't on DVD, so (reluctantly) I took it video. The first thing that appeared was a trailer for the Lord of the Rings, for the Two Towers, this was a very smart move, inserting this trailer in the video. It justifies me (reluctantly) by giving the film 1 star, otherwise I would have given zero stars. Perhaps the producers even if the main attraction of Dean Cain (I think this is the way it is written) would attract the crowd ( to the video store that it is). <br /> <br /> Then they used the split screen technique (as in Hulk) to (I assume) compensation for what atrocity is this piece of shit. On the cover of the box we see a picture of our hero and the dragon, the dragon looks exactly like that the Dragonheart or is it just me? However, the dragon in the film looks like a rejection of Gremlins 2, and has the CGI of a villain from the Nintendo video game of the early 1990s (maybe worse). Moreover, not the movement of the Dragons while chasing his victims - is the same monotonous movement as Fking - right leg, left leg, right leg, left leg, Sun, Sun, Sun, Sun, Sun F $ DOOOOOM! This pisses me off. Maybe the filmmakers thought it was thrilling and would have the same effect as Jaws. Why not then have a shot of Dragon POV. However, it was fun, just like watching a Weebl. <br /> <br /> Dean Cain gives many puzzled looks during the film (perhaps his coming to terms with the fact that this film could end his career). Don't expect Superman here. The first time I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it was an add for a PS2 game. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's so ugly, my 5-year-old brother can come up with a better one when he's trying to lie unconvincingly about why he was messing around in my room while I wasn't there. Oh, and did I say that I F @ # KING NOW THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE THIS INCREDIBLY STUPID STUPID CRAP ATROCIOUS FILM? !!!
