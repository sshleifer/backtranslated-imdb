For those who like depressing movies with squalid characters and a sordid plot, this is for you! From the gloomy atmosphere of New York City, which presents itself as an extremely sad and almost hopeless place, to two different main characters without much sense of morality, this film is a real disaster. <br /> <br /> Because he won the Oscar it was because it was so shocking at that moment that Hollywood, its brand new freedom to show all it wanted with all the abandoned moral codes, wanted to celebrate that fact. The directors were like a six-year-old immature with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store. So, Hollywood has given theater viewers (probably for the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, childhood nudity, homelessness and other miracles and sounds so wonderful that only his distorted brain would think it's attractive ... and then rewarded work. <br /> <br /> Also, I was hoping, I'm sure, to upset the mainstream public. Well, he succeeded at that level. The audience was stunned by what they said and listened and the Academy, proud of itself for being able to show filth and making money at the same time, could not help but give honor to this piece of golden garbage. <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, when I was very young, I also found this film fascinating. However, seeing him in the 90s left me with such bad taste in my mouth that I never saw him again. <br /> <br /> The acting was good, but then? Acting is good in many movies. No one ever said that Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight could not act. Hoffman was particularly good in his younger days playing lost people. It was a bit like the Johnny Depp of his era, he played boys like "Ratso Rizzo" in this movie and then he would become the "Rain Man" later. Yes, "Ratso" is a character you will never forget, and "Joe Buck" (Voight) is one you want to forget, but the plot is so sordid that it overwhelms acting. <br /> <br /> This film is not "art" and is not worthy of its numerous awards; he pushed the envelope in style in 1969 and that is why he is remembered with great affection in the hearts of the people and the critics of cinema. They are two hours of vulgarity and ultra-squalid, economic and religious shots, which glorify the extravagant (Andy Warhol also acts - no surprise), and generally despicable people. <br /> <br /> I liked the catchy song, "Everybody's Talking '" which helped make Harry Nilsson famous, but that too was bogus because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better before that Nilsson did it .... and few people have ever heard of Neil (which is their loss). And - as mentioned - the name "Ratso Rizzo" is with you! <br /> <br /> The film is a reference point, but in a negative sense, I fear: this has called it "official" that Hollywood had gone down in the bathroom, and has remained in the sewer since then.
