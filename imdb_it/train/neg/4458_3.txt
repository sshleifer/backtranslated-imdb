Most of the French films I saw - and appreciated - were more talkative than action, but that's okay. I found them interesting, well-photographed and with intriguing actors. (However, at one point I wondered if Gerald Depardieu was in every French film ever made! It looked like this.) <br /> <br /> This film has the same interesting graphics and has had a good opening. But then it became more talk, talk and talk .... which is good for a drama but not for a mystery of murder. After a while, I almost fell asleep watching this. <br /> <br /> Actually, the film was more like a game with almost all the scenes played in a room. So if you love games, you should like them ... but I want a little more for a story of murder.
