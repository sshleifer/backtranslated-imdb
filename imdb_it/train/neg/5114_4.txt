This film was bad. Bad acting, bad direction, bad writing. But it wasn't bad in a fun way. He was ugly in a boring way. I looked at "Surface to Air" because I thought it might be a laugh. It wasn't. Don't make the mistake I made. There are many more fun ways to spend an hour and a half like looking at dried paint or reading the dictionary. Seriously.
