The small Californian town of Diablo is tormented by mysterious deaths after Sheriff Robert Lopez brought an ancient box to light. Legend has it that the box holds the Mexican demon of the sixteenth century called Azar. FBI agent Gil Vega is sent to investigate the murders and join forces with the sheriff's daughters, Dominique and Mary to fight with evil and bloodthirsty demons. "The Legend of Diablo" is a real garbage. The film lacks fear and blood, acting is amateur and the direction is bad. Animation is the only aspect of the film that I enjoyed. I'm a big fan of indie horror movies, for example I loved "Torched", "Live Feed", "Bone Sickness" or "Neighborhood Watch", unfortunately "The Legend of Diablo" is a huge misfire. Definitely one to avoid.
