This guy is pretty bad, but by no means make him the type that surpasses adults and can foil expert thieves at every turn. No, he is not so brat, since he is a child with serious emotional problems. A beautiful couple trying to adopt it becomes rather sucked into adopting it and while the husband is a little more willing to give this child a chance that the mother is not. Through a bizarre character by Michael Richards and the always annoying Gilbert Gottfried and you have a pretty bad movie with a few laughs here and there. Actually I prefer the sequel to this film because I like the fact that they brought back Amy Yasbeck as a different and more sympathetic character as there are one or more characters in this film that are completely unlikely. Even the child is rather annoying at the beginning of this, and they also relax in the sequel. The plot is quite simple even though, like the future parents, they adopt this guy who they think is great from the way the orphanage is organizing a party as they leave, they soon realize they have some hell. Add to this this little hell get in touch with a prisoner of some kind. I'm not sure about this character, at first I thought he was his real father or something. It's not that nice, but I'll pick it in front of that Culkin guy on any day of the week.
