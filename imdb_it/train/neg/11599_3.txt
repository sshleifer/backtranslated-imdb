The only thing that kept this film from being a total disaster was a couple of interesting touches of style. <br /> <br /> (Moderate Spoiler Alert) Death by comic is somewhat derived from a scene in Twilight Zone: The Movie, which carries death in a cartoon. Yet this was handled well, especially looking at the bleeding ink and the color was destroyed. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, there is another good scene with a demonic bike. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I was glad to have found the cheap DVD in a store that no longer sold, because it was really horrible. I bought "Soul Survivors" at the same time and both films were just as annoying with the constant realizations you were watching a dream. However, where "Soul Survivors" has nothing to redeem, or makes sense, it has at least a couple of stylish notes, mentioned above. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the DVD allows you to go to the 8 "nightmares" in which something actually happens, which is the only way to see it. The script between the creative moments of cold blood is rather unbearable. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
