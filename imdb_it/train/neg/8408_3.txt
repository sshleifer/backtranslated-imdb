Wow, this is very unusual from a point of view: usually the first film in a long series of sequels is the best in the group. People are surprised when a sequel is actually better. With Tarzan, I thought this film was the worst in the group, or at least the first six that make up my Tarzan Collection DVD package. I will gladly watch the sequels several times, but I am through this turkey, thanks to different characters. <br /> <br /> Well, let's start with the good news first: <br /> <br /> THE GOOD - A lot of action with a lot of wild animals on display, even if it's just archive footage. See the attacks of lions, crocodiles, hippos, panthers, call it and see different tribes of all kinds, including the pygmies (called "dwarfs" in the film). Since this film was made almost 75 years ago, I can't beat any of the realism because they didn't have it in movies long ago. They do the best they can to endure the actors talking about fake backgrounds. However, Weissmuller did many action scenes and was in great shape. He and O'Sullivan form a beautiful, well-built couple, if ever there was one in those golden years of cinema. <br /> <br /> The film has a historical value (with so many sequels) as it shows how Tarzan acquired Jane and her beginning in learning the English language. <br /> <br /> The BAD - From the moment "Jane Parker" is played by Tarzan almost every scene with her is Maureen O'Sullivan in a hysterical, screaming and screaming scene after the scene. It's enough to give you a headache and ruin the movie. Fortunately, it has calmed down in the sequels, but not in this film. The film does not even favor the image of "The Great White Hunter" as C. Aubrey Smith, who plays Jane's father, and Neil Hamilton, as "Harry Holt", the safari guide, shoots all the animals in sight , if the beasts threaten or not. These people are happy, especially Smith. On another note, it is a pity that there is nothing here to explain how Tarzan arrived in the jungle in the first place. There is no story of him here or of his growing up. It is there only when Jane and the group arrive at some point in Africa.
