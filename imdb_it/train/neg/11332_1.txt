As big as a Texas grassland and just as boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills and Dennis Hopper fail to float on this overflowing boat. Taylor actually LOOKS bad - wrong wardrobe, wrong hair and wrong make-up - a unique achievement in his extraordinary career. Hopper gives the only credible performance, and Dean in the climatic scene shows a remarkable talent as something for which we usually don't remember - a comedian. Rock Hudson is his usual Barbie Doll Ken prototype and it is surprising that Redford could have done with the male lead. There is no recognizable plot that provides any tension until the last twenty minutes, only a pastiche of milestones that have little relationship between them. With the exception of Hopper, there is no development of characters, only a collection of cardboard cut-outs that appear periodically for no reason visible as random targets in a shooting gallery. To his credit, the film addresses racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo, and has SIZE, making it an excellent choice for getting rid of unwanted guests. Those with the DVD version can spare part of the tedium starting from the second disc. You will not miss anything interesting.
