I anticipated the release of the film as much as any Broadway comedy fan. I have been waiting and reading reviews for months about the award winning performances. I mean with the stellar power of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover ... the movie couldn't have been less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? MISTAKEN! I was definitely disappointed with the finished product. The film did not match the advertising given to him and the only redeeming thanks were Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson. <br /> <br /> The performance of Eddie Murphy's James Brownesque saves the film just as it strikes his multiple stops and Jennifer Hudson's performance force you to pay attention whenever it appears on the screen. His performance of "And I'm telling you" was the only time I felt that exaggeration was deserved. You hurt yourself while she didn't beg her to let her stay in the group and in her life. As many reviewers have stated, it steals the film from the most experienced actors and deserves all the accolades it receives for this performance. Even Anika Noni Rose was a strong presence with a great voice and comic talent. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles, on the other hand, went through their performances. Foxx's acting skills for this film seemed to prey on his extraordinary performance of "Ray" and Beyonce Knowles was engaged in a long photo shoot or video recording, posing and shining through the film. His performance wasn't strong enough to make you worry about his character at any point in the film. <br /> <br /> The film was too publicized, 30 minutes and 1 song (Beyonce's "sincere" solo to Jamie Foxx) too long. <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
