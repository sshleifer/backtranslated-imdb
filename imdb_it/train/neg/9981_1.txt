This film was advertised as a comedy and a mystery. It fails badly for both. The only mystery here is why someone should make such a poorly constructed film. The only comedy is the laugh I had when I saw how high the readers classified it. Could there be two films with the same name? The movie I saw played a girl with blue eyes and a plot that wasn't there. <br /> <br />
