There is a big moment in * Surviving Christmas * that almost makes it worth it: James Gandolfini breaks a shovel on Ben Affleck's stupid head. <br /> <br /> This film represents another unfortunate example of James Gandolfini trying out what a great actor he is and at the same time infaming his career by acting in this film. <br /> <br /> A young and wealthy advertising executive, Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was inculcated into believing that one should never be alone at Christmas. (And there, from the beginning, there is the basic problem with our suspension of disbelief in this idiotic film: how many of Drew's social status, in 2004, really cares in one way or another if Is Christmas spent alone or with half of the family or with a fifty-dollar prostitute?) Storyline finds Drew buying a family to spend Christmas with, provided they pretend to be his, senselessly ignoring all indications to the contrary that the his money didn't buy the emotions he was looking for. <br /> <br /> For $ 250,000, a crazy suburban trucker, Tom Valco (James Gandolfini), and his disheveled wife, Christine (Catherine O'Hara), agree to be Drew's ad hoc family, against the their son's protests, Brian (a very one-dimensional Josh Zuckerman) and daughter, Alicia (a very soft-focused Christina attached). Drew then spends the rest of the film apparently resuming his youth or something. The messages of this film are as twisted and illogical as the dry-mouthed plot. Traumatized by explicit psychosis, Drew plots a fake smile on his face and continues to blindly deny any denigration that the Valco family should have bought to avoid. <br /> <br /> Which raises the question: if Drew pays these people to regain a semblance of joyous family emotion, how psychotic must he be to fake happiness between their beards and mental anguish about his presence? It is no coincidence that the Valco family is hiding their true feelings and pretending to be happy while they are out with Drew - three of the four members make it clearly clear that they despise him. Is he so incognito that he can't see that his money isn't buying him the "family" atmosphere in which he was inculcated into believing that it was a truth in the first place? As with all films, this is debatable, one wonders how * four * screenwriters could be so intertwined in their narcissistic dreams to appear in a sequence of credits that will neglect any semblance of plausibility or intelligence. <br /> <br /> Director Mike Mitchell, who was in charge of * Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo *, stops right there. Nuff said. <br /> <br /> Gandolfini and O'Hara somehow manage to shine, demonstrating their courage in this mess. Christina Applegate is lithe and pretty and blonde and fiery in all the right places, sharply cutting Drew into small carcass strips for most of the film, then making a face and falling in love with him because the script tells her. <br /> <br /> And I wouldn't say that Affleck is a bad actor, but John Schneider is better to look over his shoulder. There's a new level of Desoverately Seeking Talent in town.
