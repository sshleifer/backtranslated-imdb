It's a pity that you can't go lower than a star. Before looking at The Wicker Man, I considered Aliens 3 as the only film that really deserved negative stars. In all honesty, The Wicker Man takes nothing away from the enjoyment of a previous film, but the fact remains that my cumulative enjoyment has been reduced by seeing it. <br /> <br /> There is also an economic trick often used in Hollywood when producers are too stingy to hire good writers or in too much of a hurry to allow them to bring a plot to a satisfying conclusion: to slap in a shocking ending and hope that the public will exchange it for something artistic or meaningful. It is a move that rarely succeeds and in this case only succeeds in sketching the embarrassment of a good actor and ridiculing the producers. Even more in the sense that the "carefully elaborated" (or at least questioned) conclusion does not seem to follow logically from the plot (which of course I cannot delve into without introducing spoilers), and instead denies what merit the plot had up to that point. <br /> <br /> It is a film that could logically attract psychopathic, pedophile and perhaps die-hard fans Nicholas Cage, but only a few of the mainstream public. If you really want something in this regard, I highly recommend the village of M. Night Shyamalan. Lacking some kind of memory-clearing pill, I suppose I have to look at something better to force it out of my mind, for example, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or Pee-wee's Big Adventure?
