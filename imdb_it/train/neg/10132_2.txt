STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> The US Army has just launched a new stealth fighter plane that it can evade detection unlike any other. A renegade pilot (Steve Touissant) steals it and plots to keep the US government from redeeming with it. So they are forced to send their witness John Sands (Seagal, who else?) To stop him, in exchange for his freedom from a detention center where his mind had to be erased from all the incriminating information he learned over the years . <br /> <br /> I skipped the Attack Force because I could understand from the cover and all post production tampering that would occur and when all the negative reviews and low user ratings spilled out, I just confirmed what I thought. But I decided to try FOF because Shadow Man (of the same director) was not bad and, what the hell, Seagal was my favorite action star once and maybe, maybe, he could make a great movie again. Oh, how crazy I was. <br /> <br /> Dubbing, horrendous footage of stealth fighter jets, terrible photographic work, low production values, laughable and unconvincing fight scenes that have become Seagal's trademark and a boring, inducing sleep plot that is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Fortunately his next film, Once Upon a Time in the Hood (which I will be skipping), will apparently mark the end of his contract with Sony, which means no more than these terrible films of action with a European objective and his next film, Prince of Pistols, could mark a return to the cinema. Hell, he already did it and Stallone will be able to do it before him (Rocky Balboa.) <br /> <br /> This is not a flight of fury. It's not even a fun flight. It's a flight that can't even take off. *
