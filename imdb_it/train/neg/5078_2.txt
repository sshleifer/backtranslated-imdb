If "Exorcist II: The Heretic" in 1977 didn't do him any favors, it's hard to imagine what an extraordinary extraordinary burlesian he saw in this sad exercise of non-thrill. You've already seen it all: Burton plays a writer who discovered the power of moving inanimate objects through the power of his mind at an early age (and you thought "Carrie" had no impact on Hollywood!). Although adapted from a novel by Peter Van Greenaway, "Medusa" plays as recycled material, although the special effects in the cathedral's finish are solid (if typical). Lee Remick is a bit present as a doctor, but otherwise the supporting cast is extremely weak. Burton is crazy but tired ... not even telekinesis could save him at this point. * 1/2 from ****
