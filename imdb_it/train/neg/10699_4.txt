Yes, I focused on the whole thing, God knows why. <br /> <br /> It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was bitterly cold outside, okay, those are all excuses but they are the only ones I have. <br /> <br /> I gave The Darkling 4 stars from a possible 10 - I have seen worse movies, but this is definitely right there in the old basket of bad filmdom - poor screenplay, bad acting, bad lighting and special effects style. <br /> <br /> The plot, which never made sense, revolves around this simple little family, father, mother and child - which I assume the viewer should be "identifying" with, all three were boring and annoying. You just want the dark side to get each of them. <br /> <br /> Dad is a chef whose car is the hobby. Dad meets a rich man named Rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he bought in the "mysterious" East. Rubin keeps it in a bird cage and refers to it as "The Darkling". <br /> <br /> During the film, the Darkling is explained as about 3 or 4 different things: a shadow without a person, the inner darkness that exists in all of us and the Devil. So choose one of those explanations you like - because believe me, it doesn't really matter. <br /> <br /> Darkling's main problem seems to be that he longs to have a partner - he gets a human companion - and then he is ultimately dissatisfied with being human. This, of course, leads to an immense wealth, followed by a disaster, for the human that connects to The Darkling. <br /> <br /> And for the rest of us - it only leads to a very long boring movie. <br /> <br />
