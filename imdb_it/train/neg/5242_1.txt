Well, I hated to pieces, I despised the 40-year-old virgin, and this little gem is a useless piece of trash film. do yourself a favor and skip it. I admit, I don't like the actors in this movie, and after my 18-year-old son showed me the DVD cover, I thought "I wouldn't like that movie," but with his insistence, I decided to try it out, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> about two minutes after the movie I turned it off, I was so offended. it's just disgusting. any decent person would be offended by the dirt in this movie. call me old-fashioned, but pushing your hand covered with cunt juice on your friend's face so he will know that "you have a little" is beyond the line of decency, in my opinion. yes, this is how this little putrid film begins, and I can only imagine that from there it gets much worse. another real winner for Mr. Rudd. I bet he is as proud as a punch. imagine if only you could get worthless roles like him, would you like to stay in the movies? despite the pay, I wouldn't do it. <br /> <br /> I should have known better; next time I'll do it.
