I went to a screening of this film and while he had a couple of moments that made me laugh, he had some very important flaws. First of all it looks like the humorous deeds of a divorced man from real life trying to find love in Los Angeles. What it transforms into is a depressing, narcissistic and non-entertaining game through the history of love life and the professional life of the director. The jokes wear out quickly and you suddenly find yourself not worrying about how this man's dates progress. The ridicule is that the director simultaneously presents himself as an extremely annoying and heavily imperfect character and therefore expects us to worry.
