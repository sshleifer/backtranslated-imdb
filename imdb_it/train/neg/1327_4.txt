This awesome movie assembles every Asian stereotype you can imagine into one horrible package. The extirpation of money, devious Japanese businessmen send foolish but amiable policeman Pat Morita to recover the trade secrets in Detroit. Here he meets a heel on the ground Jay Leno, who readily refers to a murder victim as Jap and calls Morita Tojo. It's all downhill from there.
