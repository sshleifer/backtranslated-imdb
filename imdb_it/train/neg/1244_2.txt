This is the first for me, the first time I was disappointed with a Tim Burton film. POTA is not a bad movie (big sets, costumes and the strange big performance), but could have been made by an official Hollywood director. The pace was very strange, the last third was just spent waiting for the film to finish, alone and from the cast. Tim Roth was excellent, probably the only pleasure in the film. Return Tim.
