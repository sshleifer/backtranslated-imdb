It's getting worse, the series is in serious decline. The first two sequels were acceptable and since then we've seen a lot of really awful movies. Robert Englund offers another great performance as Freddy, but the rest of the cast can't act. The story is that Alice, after surviving the previous episode of the Nightmare series, finds Freddy Krueger's deadly dreams start again. This time, the provocative killer strikes the sleeping mind of Alice's unborn child. His intention is to "be reborn" in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice release her spirit in time to save her child? Take a look at the first three, skip the next three and then watch the last one.
