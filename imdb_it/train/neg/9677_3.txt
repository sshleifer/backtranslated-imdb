somewhere I read that this film should be a comedy. after seeing it, I would call it everything except. the point of this film escapes me. the dialogue is all extremely superficial and absurd, many of the sets seemed to be second thoughts, and despite all the nudity and implicit sexual content, there is nothing erotic in this film ... everything leaves me to wonder what the hell this story is ! the premise of the title could have been the basis for a funny (if politically incorrect) comedy. instead, we are treated to cheap sketches, depravity and oddities, amateur, unfinished ends in itself. if i want it, i'm going to buy a cd grace jones.
