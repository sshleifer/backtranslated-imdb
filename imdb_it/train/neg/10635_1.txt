There is an observation that one of the heroines was raped by "drunk soldiers" by Russian soldiers, which is completely false. This film should not be shown just because of this. <br /> <br /> There is also a statement from someone, that the KGB has persecuted "Jews, gypsies, etc.", which is "worse than the Nazis". The KGB was looking for the so-called "Zionist" agents, who were (according to the KGB) imperialist agents. This is totally different from targeting Jews as a whole nation, as the Nazis did. The gypsies were never tried. The KGB was a political tool and used politically, but from an internationalist point of view. The communists did not really distinguish between nationalities. <br /> <br /> The whole movie sucks like a fake. The main hero does not speak Russian, the signs in Berlin contain typographical errors, the general of the KGB seems totally false. Some so-called "Russian proverbs" are completely invented, and the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Not recommended to watch - this film is full of lies and fake stuff. Go to "Good Shepherd" instead.
