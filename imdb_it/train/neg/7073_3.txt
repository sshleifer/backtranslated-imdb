We have an average family. Dad is a famous rapper, we have the "rebellious teenage daughter", the adopted white boy, and the cute little boy. And we have a careless waitress, what show did a waitress like that have? Do we have a messy Brady Bunch? Yay! When it first came out, I thought it was really cool, especially because I was young. The music was bad. The raps were so bad and they were too g-rated. All his raps were about his family, his friends and problems. Dad was a kind of "Danny from Full House" dad. I've always given advice. But he wasn't a clean maniac. They had a house keeper for that. Remember? The plots were basically Lil 'Romeo was in trouble of some kind, or ... isn't that. Oh and maybe some preteen drama. Yes, that stuff is good. Not exactly. But it's still a good show for children. But Nikelodean could do better.
