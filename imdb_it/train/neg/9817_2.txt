Wow ... pure brilliance. <br /> <br /> Transforming a thriller / suspense / horror into a comedy. <br /> <br /> After seeing it, I never laughed so much in a horror movie ... a ridiculous storyline with 3 characters that were just madly developed - or not written deep or too deeply. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a horror movie absolutely written with stupid dialogues, messy plot, useless scenes, wasted characters, bad sound and bad general development, then this is what to watch. <br /> <br /> Make sure you stay focused on the classic "food processor" scene and the totally inept police investigation scenes. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkable new low level of performance and screen writing and to sit for the duration it makes you stupid, bold or brave.
