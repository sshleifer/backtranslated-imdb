1/10 and only because I don't go lower with my evaluations. <br /> <br /> Skip this "movie" and wait for the last film of the "Trilogy", don't buy it or rent it. trust me you won't miss anything. the architect has no new information: _ (spoiler) _ there have been more NEOs before him, it is like no.6 or something like that. you could already imagine something like that from the first movie: Agent Smith told us that the first created Matrix didn't work because it was too perfect. Trinity is dead and Neo's love brought her back, where did I see her before? Oh right in the first movie the roles are reversed! like the action scenes nothing new only with more opponents. the action scene (the 20+ ships) in the BIG battle we didn't see (maybe in Revolution?), betrayed by someone (hmmmm, maybe the guy holding the knife he wanted to stab Neo?!) who pushed the Button EGM shortly. <br /> <br /> all in all a shameless ploy to make money (especially those who have gone to see it more than once), which evidently worked like a spell.
