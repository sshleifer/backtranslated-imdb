I only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what I saw was a piece of total shit. The scenes I saw were as bad as those of an Ed Wood movie. No, it was a hundred times WORSE. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever, but it's not true; the idiot who directed this garbage is the worst director ever. <br /> <br /> The American policeman has a German accent! The "police station" was a desk in a warehouse with a "Police Station" sign hanging on the wall. There is a fight in fists where the punches clearly lack about ten feet. <br /> <br /> This policeman pulls the women, hooks them and leads them to a warehouse. He tells his fellow cop to wait in the car. Then he leaves the warehouse with a travel bag. The policeman thinks that maybe something is wrong, that his partner could be a bad cop who is killing these women, but he is not sure if this is what is happening because - he is a moron! The dialogue is totally stupid, the acting is horrible and the characters act in the stupidest way I've ever seen on the screen. It is quite obvious to the comrade of the policewoman who is illegally abducting these women and is slapping and taking them to a warehouse and driving back with a travel bag with a corpse inside, and yet, the partner, who is there all added up, he doesn't know what's going on! <br /> <br /> The director of this film is a total hack. I stopped the movie at 30 minutes because I couldn't take it anymore. It must be one of the worst movies I've ever started watching and I won't waste any more time writing this review. <br /> <br /> Absolutely BENEFIT.
