Italian horror / suspense film about a rich English gentleman who travels to pubs and taverns for red-haired girls just like his late wife Evelyn. You know he must have really loved his wife, because he takes them to his house - a huge rotting castle - and makes them undress and then torture them, whip them and kill them. The most bizarre aspect of this film for me is that, somehow, at the end of the film, we see this guy played by Antonio De Teffe as the HERO of the film. However, soon, under the advice of his fellow uncle Roberto Maldera, De Teffe settles with a girl he meets at his uncle's party. He moves in and strange things start to happen to the fragile mental state of De Teffe. He starts to see and hear his late wife and finally, well, look at the title if you're still curious. Furthermore, family and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions. Poor Aunt Agatha (it seems that she could also be younger than De Teffe and find her in a wheelchair and tries to look old) meets her destiny in a vulgar way. Another man is injected and then buried alive. And of course, there is a complete explanation of why / how Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does some pretty good things: the film's settings are perfect for this film, although they try to make us believe that England is ridiculous at best. None of the actors seem English. Many with dark black hair and Mediterranean complexions and clothes that wear English would not have been discovered dead. Cars drive on the wrong side of the road. Nevertheless, the crypt scene was actually filmed and I also liked the approximate resolution. And of course any film with the sultry and red Erika Blanc is always an advantage. There is a strip of sexual perversion; however, that I found a little terrifying with the idea that torturing women was good and healthy enough to alleviate one of his mental demons. Come on, come on.
