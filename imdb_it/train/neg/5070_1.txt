TV influences society ... just look at the increase in popularity of Capuchin stores after the onset of this small superficial job. Moreover, real people who look as good as these people have no problem. <br /> <br /> Also, does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a pretty Manhattan loft considering what they do for a living? NBC just loves insulting the observer's intelligence, even if it's only around the Gump level. I know a person who earns $ 100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a tiny one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan that costs $ 2,200 a month for rent. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a show called Phriends, where six ugly nobodies are in dead-end jobs, living in a poor neighborhood where sirens constantly scream and someone is robbed every week ... and then the boss at home he takes over the rent. Now that I would look.
