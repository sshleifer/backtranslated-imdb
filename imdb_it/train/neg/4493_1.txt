I tried to remove everything that could be considered a spoiler. I also suppose you've seen the first movie or at least know the general essence, so if you don't have any, it may not make sense. <br /> <br /> Plot: This film beats the audience on the way with tired philosophical ramblings again and again in an attempt to get the theme across. We are continually bombarded with questions of purpose, destiny and choice, and forced to endure the long and tortuous sessions of stalls that contain them. <br /> <br /> Neo, awakened from a dream in the last film, now begins a period of realization about his own existence. There are many revelations in this film, which I will be vague and therefore not seem to be spoilers. <br /> <br /> * If you are still worried, vague references will ruin the film, don 'read the paragraph below. * <br /> <br /> The strength and weakness of faith are revealed. The strengths and weaknesses of love and its temporary nature are also revealed. The interdependence between man and technology and our faith in technology are also revealed. The importance of choice and experience is revealed. Explaining further things that are revealed would go into too much detail, so I will abstain (as the guidelines for writing a comment ask). By the way, to "reveal" I intend to pound through our ears and eyes like nails. <br /> <br /> Plot: So how does Neo and the band come from the end of the last film at the beginning of the next one? In short, they keep the faith and use and abuse excessively stylized actions and bullets as if they were going out of style (and after this demonstration, I hope that both filmmakers and producers will learn to appreciate the subtlety and originality of a little More). More information later. In order not to spoil anything, I will say nothing but promotional material already made: Neo is still trying to understand the Matrix, and is looking for answers as he tries to save the humans, and Zion, while the bad guys chase him and his cohorts. The film resumes practically from where the last one was interrupted. <br /> <br /> Action: While the martial arts action and the shooting punctuated its predecessor in equal parts, this film focuses much more on martial arts than on shooting, adding swords, sais, etc. to the mix. The special effects are so often used and agitated in the face of the public that it becomes really boring. I discussed this film with friends and colleagues, and almost everyone found some of the action sequences - especially the "Smith battle" that we all heard in the movie - being too long and boring. This is a big red flag for action fans, because the end of an action sequence should leave a little more, or completely settle for the suggestion that has just occurred. <br /> <br /> These fighting scenes don't do. They are too stylized, exaggerated, wooden and not very inspired sequences. In the first film, there was a real sense of desperation for some of the actions, the feeling that the fight was for survival, not just for the good looks (which I honestly don't think they can handle in Reloaded) in black and leather . Go watch Drunken Master or Iron Monkey after this movie to remember what the good fighting sequences are - you won't regret it. Also, people with "Matrix skills" in Reloaded are not consistent and what they actually do is not consistent. The first film had its inconsistencies here, but they weren't too obvious - unlike Reloaded. <br /> <br /> The special effects are poured out again and again. Every little thing that someone does, whether jumping, jumping, turning, and in many cases just posing, I'm in slow motion, in bullet time, or overly accentuated by a sort of destruction. It is evident that the W Bros had a lot of money to throw away in this film, and the boy threw them, without any real brake. The Sharp publishers could have really helped him, but the first film was so successful that the free kingdom was obviously given, which leads us to do so. . . <br /> <br /> Character and dialogue: I have already said more or less that the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical banalities. The actors are not able to give much depth to their character when the script and the direction push the audience towards the progression of the character, or neglecting it completely. The public does not at any time receive nuances and substance to be able to contemplate the character alone. <br /> <br /> The performances of Keanu are at their strict maximum. Keanu is good at acting confused, and that's all he does in this movie. It makes a decent attempt to show the passion between Neo and Trinity, but it falls empty. <br /> <br /> Lawrence tries to make Morpheus of everything, from Moses to Henry V, and be cool as a cat. With the script that was provided to him, he makes a noble attempt, but it is also flat. <br /> <br /> Moss isn't even credible. His worried appearance is always the same, very similar to that of Keanu, and chemistry is not there, even if in their very physical scenes they imitate him quite well. <br /> <br /> Hugo once again brought his strange feeling of being an Agent program, but he also suffered from the hand of the script. Actually I find it the most interesting character of the group, but instead of development they make it just an excuse for a huge and pulled out fighting scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film is beyond disappointing if you have good expectations, and alone, like an independent film (which is not how it should be taken), it is still horrible. I don't see The Matrix so deep, but at least I see it as a pleasant scifi fun that has some interesting ideas, a good action, some fun lines, and enough symbolism and moderate avoidance to entertain the attention. Reloaded fails on all these aspects, and I really hope that W Bros will give us a better experience in the 3rd installment. Of course, there is not much left to hope for after this film.
