Christ. A sequel to one of the most cloying movies of all time, this at least has the decency to leave out the songs (bar a revival of the unbearable "Tomorrow") but continues the tradition of being nauseating and little fun. This time, Annie and her friends travel to London and get involved in the Joan Collins plot to blow up Buckingham Palace or something else. The film has a bizarre and syncopated attitude towards its epic character, in contrast to how irritating it is: whenever the little charmer yells "Leapin lizards"! I could feel my teeth grinding into dust. Photographed with sadness, muddy and tiring, the film has only one memorable line ("Forget me, stupid genius!") And the fact that it is not the original to recommend it.
