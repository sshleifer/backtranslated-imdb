Surely no Saturday morning children's television program has ever been so badly done. After all, those producers had to rely on the return of the public. Well, in this horrible offer, they could at least count the money they had saved on the sets. The script could have been a rejection of some long-forgotten space opera serial, with some thin lines added for the cool Gerald Mohr to murmur to Naura Hayden. No director could have done anything decent with such a crazy plot, so the action simply gets boring. The spaceship props are absurd - a Bulova wall clock and a portable typewriter, for example - but the planet's sets must be among the worst in film history. Most are rough designs, and it is all immersed in a red light often badly crafted. Mohr's bare and hairy chest is also used as a support. And it's a bad thing: as thin as the plot. Any spectator who manages to reach the end of this film will hear a message from the Martians and will probably agree completely!
