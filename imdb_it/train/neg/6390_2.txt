I've seen about a thousand horror movies. (my favorite type) This film is among the worst. For me, an idea guides a film. So even a poorly made and inexpensive film can be good. Something Weird is definitely cheap. However, he has little to say. I still don't understand what the karate scene has to do with the film. Something strange has little to offer. Save yourself the pain!
