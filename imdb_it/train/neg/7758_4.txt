this movie had a lot of blood in it when the sabretooth attacked it too i loved it when that guy and the women were having a little fun and then the sabretooth attacked the women and ate her stomach and pulled out her liver. this was the best and the 1ton sabretooth that walks on its front legs is exhilarating to make this movie more effective and less talking if you know what I mean and please also the people who made this film don't make a film like this movie that causes the end was terrible 1 sabretooth alive and I killed those women, in the end this film reminds me of the grudges that always end up remaining 1 enemy! OK, dammit, this movie sucks, I can't believe it, I loved it when my little brother went crazy for stomach attacks and blood
