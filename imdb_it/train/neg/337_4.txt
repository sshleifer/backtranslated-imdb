Well, what is there to say. THE GOLDEN CHILD falls into the "so bad, it's good" category. Eddie Murphy is having fun (and sometimes rather boring) lines, but you're still enjoying it. Chales Dance has never been worse than his role as the villain Sardo Numspa (what's this fucking name ??). <br /> <br /> Who should watch THE GOLDEN CHILD ... hm ... hard to say, but my best guess would be the people who like embarrassing movies and who can be entertained by bad acting, bad plot and an even more embarrassing dialogue. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
