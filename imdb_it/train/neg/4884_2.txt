Criminally Insane 2 is included on the new Satan's Black Wedding / Criminally Insane DVD, and it's also a good thing, because when I've seen a movie and I know there's a sequel (especially something that's dark like this) I'm always curious. Now I have my curiosity satisfied and I will never look at it again. Most of CI2 is nothing more than CI's "flashbacks", and Ethel's filming asleep, which reminds me of good memories, I think. Thanks to Proposition 13 it was released by Napa State (I wonder if he saw The Cramps playing while he was there?) And sent to a halfway house run by a nice old lady that Ethel promptly takes to call "grandma". All this is filmed with a video camera, so the image and the sound are rather pathetic, and it is even complete with a couple of "rolls". Of course Ethel does her thing, which is to send someone between her and the food, especially the guy who witnesses one of his chaos and extorts his dessert. Also, you have to ask yourself about any halfway house for murderers who have a big drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and a rat poison under the kitchen sink. Guess it's all a matter of "trust" wrong. If you liked or disliked Criminally Insane, in both cases there are no good reasons to see it except out of curiosity. One wonders why the producers of this have even bothered. 2 out of 10.
