Caught this yesterday on IFC, and I can't believe the positive reviews! Am I the only one to think that these "women" were anything but? Kate tells Jed she could be fired because she should be a pillar of the community, but she does it for him! Then suddenly they decide to be in love? And she is so devastated by her death, she doesn't go to her funeral, much less, she tells her family the "good news"! By the way, how did an American become the director of a real British school? Janine should have been chased away by force for her unjustifiable abuse of power, but nothing happens! And she ends up pulling out a scam that led to questions! And less on Molly, the better! <br /> <br /> As for the guilt, Janine and Molly feel over Jed, please! It is really the fault of the punk that has turned into roadkill! Where is the fault for poor Gerald, who is vomited? If only I could do the same with the bozos behind this "movie"!
