My son makes better videos than this! I feel robbed of the $ 4.00 spent on renting this thing! There is no date on the video case, apparently designed by Wellspring; and, worse yet, there is no production date for the original film listed in any part of the film! The only date is 2002, which leads an unsuspecting renter to believe he is getting a recent film. <br /> <br /> This film has been so bad from an obsolete and irrelevant point of view for any length of time, but just when it was made, I'm amazed that someone took the time and expense to advertise it as a video. It could be of interest to students studying the counterculture of the 1960s, anti-war, anti-establishment, development, ignition and abandonment culture; but when you read the back of the video case, there is no indication that this is what you are getting. If you make the mistake of hiring it, it is probably best to see it while under the influence of drugs, so that the mind corresponds more closely to the wavelength of the minds of the directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your mood while watching it, I can tell you that it doesn't improve after the first scene; so, knowing it, I'm sure you'll sleep long before the end.
