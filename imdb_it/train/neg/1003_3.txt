OK, I'm not Japanese. I know a little Japanese culture and a little less Japanese pop culture. Besides that, I'm Spanish, I eat paella and I like black humor. <br /> <br /> Well, with that set of points, I can comment on the film: I have no idea how nice it is for the Japanese public, Mamoru Oshii is quite a good director, despite the too pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of Talking Head, and this too was curious and somehow interesting - and I'm surprised it came to this. It might just be one of those cases lost in the translation, I'm afraid it is, but as a European viewer who watches the English subtitled subtitle movie I thought it was horrible. The jokes seemed bad, the script was too cooked - I mean, giving the audience a pause, and silencing a little cursed narrator - to the point of almost making the head explode with an excess of verbal and absurd action. <br /> <br /> However, I thought the animation was really fantastic. The idea is great and is well exploited in those animated scenes. However, the eye-candy ends as soon as the characters are left aside to begin with an endless and non-amusing mumbo-jumbo speech on still images. It just makes you want to go on to the next scene of hysterical cut-out characters. <br /> <br /> I read that Mamoru Oshii is planning a sequel for this. The idea was good but horribly exploited. Perhaps the second part will show the positive parts of this first and will actually make an interesting film, or maybe it will be more and more over-narrated scenes. But hell, if you thought Talking Head was dense, Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters will give you a shot. <br /> <br /> Of course, all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is European. Probably this is totally useless for the Japanese, maybe it was a really funny movie lost in the frontiers and in the cultural translation. Could be.
