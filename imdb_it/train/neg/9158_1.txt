My God. I bought this movie and ... I ... watched ... the ... everything ... what. . . Okay, I'll be fine ... I know I'll be fine in a month or two. Some time soon I hope to get rid of the flashbacks. I was going to eat something after the movie, but I just can't get up the courage to try to keep the food right now. Bad? Yes bad. Very ugly. BAD BAD BAD BAD. Wait, it doesn't seem like the message is getting it right. Hmm ... There's not a word to describe how horrible ... it's not horrible ... Hmm disgustingly thrown / acted / filmed / directed / written. Now I don't know what to do but I throw it out. Maybe burn it, I wouldn't want it to end up in an architectural excavation in a thousand years. The worst movie ever from "Hey Happy"
