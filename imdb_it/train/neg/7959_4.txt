Andy Lau is the protagonist of another incognito cop story. Daniel Wu plays Nick who works for the police and is also near the top of a gang of drug dealers (Lau). The film begins as we watch the police try to make a drug bust just to see it fall apart. Then we are introduced to the young drug addict mother and daughter who live near Nick, his cronies and policemen, and after 45 minutes I close the film and put the news on. Well acted and nice to watch this is a non-addictive film as I've seen for a long time. It is not bad as such it is just that you don't really care. I mean, I didn't care at all. Actually I started doing something else completely forgetting to have on a subtitled movie, that's how much I didn't care. I wish I could hate the movie, but the movie is such a nothingness that it almost didn't have any impression on me (it's not even something I could sleep in it's just something to ignore). Come on the box called it Scarface Chinese, what after he was dead? This is one to avoid.
