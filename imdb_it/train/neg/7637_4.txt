This could have been a great movie, if I was able to see it. The free-hand camera was very lively. From the credits I was worried. Many of us looking at him felt very sick at the end. But we stayed until the end because it was such a fascinating and interesting film, that it gave some idea to the young pop culture in South Africa. The black and white film has improved the artistic feeling of it. The acting seemed very authentic. Some of the dialogues were a bit difficult to understand, but a theater full of non-South Africans seemed to find the most fun. If you have motion sickness, you can seriously consider skipping this movie. It is characteristic, but not nausea.
