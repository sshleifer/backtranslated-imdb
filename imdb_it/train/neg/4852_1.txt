I saw this movie once and thought it was OK. Then my friends at work said "Look again, it's better". So I did. And to my surprise, it was WORST for the second time! There's a word limit, so I'm going to roll the ball here. <br /> <br /> - The bombing scenes were all so stupid. Why on earth did anyone WAIT to trigger the explosion ??? - No character here is even remotely nice. Not the first time, not even the second. <br /> <br /> -Oh, and the last time I checked, a car doesn't explode with a single gunshot, nor can a huge fire be put out with a small fire extinguisher ... the previous 3 / 10 spectators actually saw the film ??? - The camera is so shaky, I can barely tell what's going on. That opening scene with the robot bothered me in the stomach, the rest of the movie wasn't much better. <br /> <br /> - The sniper scene. The McManus brothers (from "The Boondock Saints") turned their eyes, he was so stupid. First of all, why did the boy plant his gun where a person shot himself? Also, why would he spend so much time cleaning up bullets, reloading, aiming and NOT shooting, when there was so much chaos around him? - The SAS CORRONO types instead of staying and fighting back ?????? Huh ????? The soldiers ... are gay ... ??? I didn't want to look homophobic, but honestly, that scene was so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> - Too long for his sake, but too short for the amount of material crammed into it. Bigelow seems to think that the more action the better. It seems to be wrong: the film is full of superfluous action scenes thrown in to distract you from the lack of a central plot. I know Watchmen is longer than 163 minutes, but at least that movie didn't drag. This film, on the other hand, does and for this reason seems longer. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was Renner, which was satisfactory at best. But do yourself a favor, skip this, and don't give in to the hype.
