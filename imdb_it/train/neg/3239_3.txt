Ah, the infamous "Guinea Pig" series ... I honestly have to say that I have been disappointed as a whole by this whole series ("He Never Dies", "Mermaid in a Botola" and "Flower of Flesh and Blood" are the exceptions ... and even those are not exceptional by any means ...), but "the devil's experiment" is simply a blow. There is nothing realistic that is happening here, except the climate (or perhaps anti-climatic, depending on how you see it) scene of eyeball piercing. The victim does not seem to worry about what is happening and barely complains while being subjected to "horrible" (more often "hilarious") torture. "Flower of Flesh and Blood" is a more violent and bloody representation of false "nose" material, but this film also falls flat on the level of realism. I express my applause to the Japanese for pushing the limits and in the last twenty years they have really come a long way to wear the crown in the "extreme" movie, but "Devil's Experiment" doesn't hold water. It's worth a look if you're a tough guy, if only to see what it is, but I can only give this film an extremely generous 3/10 and this is just for the needle through the eye scene .. .
