If this is someone's "favorite" movie, they need serious help. There is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest. I have not seen the original film, this is the remake of (some films of the 50s), but it must simply be better than this new bastardization. <br /> <br /> A large man is thrown out of the army for being a marginal element, and ends up teaching children in a ROTC school. Unfortunately, the major is Daman Wayans ... so children are in a world of annoying, meaningless. Can the Wayans lash these losers? Can they make it a little more human? The film bombs like many Wayans movies do, with only a few sparkling moments. William Hickey gets about a minute of screen, too little. This charming old man (known to me as an actor of "Tales from the Crypt", better known to you as Uncle Louis from "Christmas Vacation") shines every moment that is on the screen, which is not much here. <br /> <br /> Bam Bam Bigelow also makes the appearance of a motorcyclist, who adapts perfectly to him. I wouldn't mind a bit more Bam Bam, but I think he played the role of "biker" as far as can be worn for a military film. <br /> <br /> And then there is the attractive teacher, that someone falls in love with Major Payne even if he treats children badly, has no social skills and it is simply impossible to convert to someone with whom you would like to spend time. It must be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. I'm not sure which one (although it would seem "stupid" since the film makes it clear that it often comes out of the house). <br /> <br /> Wayans had a brilliant moment: a dance sequence in which he performed a series of moves (including a nice "robot") and with the help of the music of 2 Live Crew. This scene was fun but it didn't quite make up for anything else that made this movie dog spit. <br /> <br /> Seriously, avoid this movie. If you want to see a movie, a loser who helps losing children become heroes, rent or buy "Ernest Goes to Camp". At least he is a lovable loser, and actually amusing. Maybe if Major Payne had fought a badger I'd feel better, but he didn't. Forget Payne, forget Wayans ... you can do much better.
