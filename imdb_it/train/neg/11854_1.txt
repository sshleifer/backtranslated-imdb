For the life of me I can't understand the good reviews on this piece of shit. It was useless. Matthew Modine was horribly rude as a prominent gentleman. Gina Gershon, well, others have said it, but I'll tell you again, why the stupid accent? Totally useless. And his acting was just bad. I don't know if it was launched by the accent, or what. There was no chemistry between these two. <br /> <br /> And the girl Modine was in love with, is she suddenly pushing half a head of lettuce into her mouth and behaving stupidly? Where is he from? I think we should feel sorry for her when we saw her marriage to a workaholic begin to crumble, but frankly, I didn't care less about any of these people.
