This is one of those movies that apparently was trying to ride the wave of martial arts. Kind of like Billy Jack, I guess. However, while Billy Jack has had a remarkable martial arts scene there are none in this case, unless he considers himself a bit like gentlemen struggling with weights. We are presented with the star that is described as having learned judo in the marines. I was in the Marines and while they are quite established in boxing, I don't really remember any emphasis on Judo. Consequently the antagonist, James Macarthur, refers to Judo when he offers an excuse to explain why he, a state champion fighter, was defeated so easily. Boring.
