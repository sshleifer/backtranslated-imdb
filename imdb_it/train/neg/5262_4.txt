We had to go to an appointment, so we turned on the DVR to record the ending. After it was over, I looked at my husband and said, "Do you have a clue?" He said no with his head. I said, "So you showed me the end of this movie and I have no idea what just happened." He didn't "build" me, but you know it. <br /> <br /> The body of the film itself was quite good. There was a lot of suspense. It made you wonder. Then the end came. The ending was ... well, it's just finished. You were not involved in what happened or why. Until the credits I kept thinking that something would happen to explain it, but it never happened. So I came here waiting for someone to understand it and I wasn't paying attention. No. Here four years later, they are just as clueless as Tom Sawyer. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea what happened. I'm glad I didn't waste money buying it because I surely would have been crazy. <br /> <br /> OHHHHH! I see! The end of the film is what has disappeared! ROFL
