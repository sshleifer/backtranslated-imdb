A boy sees his mother killed and his father hangs himself. 20 years later he gets a group of friends together to perform an exorcism on himself, so he won't be like his father. All the standard characters are in place: the beautiful couple; the "funny" guy; the hard (but sensitive) hood; the clever girl (she wears glasses - that's how we know); the nerd and two blondes without personality. All this implies a stupid wooden statue that comes to life (don't ask) and kills people. I knew I was in trouble when, after a big opening scene, we jumped 20 years later - ALL bad horror movies do it! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is atrocious, the acting is bad (except for Betsy Palmer - why Betsy?) And the killings are stupid and / or unimaginative. My favorite scene is when two people supposedly have sex and the statue throws the boy out of the bed to show he is fully dressed! A bad incoherent horror movie. Avoid at all costs.
