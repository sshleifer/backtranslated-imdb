Check out the film's website, more time was spent making the script for this film. It couldn't be more offensive. Original story? Original? They must have found the hidden script in the old testament, or dealt with the legal repercussions for that little horn. High-end special effects? Come on, I could do better with an Atari 7600 and a jug of wax. Elegant cinema? Oh yes, the funniest look for home video in America is still a classic. I'm sure they had little money for this title, so obviously the sf is not so beautiful, or a little bad from time to time, or just fun, but it's the story that makes this movie a waste of time and money. 4 stories rolled into one and all parts without brains of first sight and finished ... already.
