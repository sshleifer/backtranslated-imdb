This is pretty much the first Jason Scott Lee movie I've seen. I say a lot, because I also saw Soldier, in whom he plays the bad guy ... but from what I've heard, it's not considered a Jason Scott Lee movie. This, however, is. And if this is an indication of the quality of such films, I will not see any of the others. Lee is basically passable as a martial artist ... as a protagonist, it's horrible. It clashes with characters that are not named at random every few minutes of the film, probably because the writer could not understand how else to lengthen the film to the minimum required for the execution of a film. The villain is the only character with a pinch of personality and, apart from the fact that he is madly believable, he barely seems like a villain. Most of the film is basically Lee chasing the bad guy over time ... or maybe it's the other way around. I can't say for sure ... and I certainly wouldn't look at it again to be sure. The effects are not completely horrible ... but it's close. The title comes from the popular idea of ​​using a time machine to kill Hitler. Somehow, the film has ruined the interesting idea. The plot is too complicated for his own good. The pace is poor. I can't think of a good thing to say about this movie ... I really can't. It is simply too formidable and useless. If only I had a time machine, so I could go back and prevent this film from ever being made ... no, it doesn't matter. I just hope that a few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible. Listen to the negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend it to Lee fans and nobody else. If you're looking for a quality movie ... well, that's not it. Certainly. 1/10
