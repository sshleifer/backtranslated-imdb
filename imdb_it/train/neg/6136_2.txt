Buck's role as The Kahn brings to mind Bob Barker (of The Price is right) who runs a country in the same way that he runs his show. But there is much more to giggle and snort in this turkey. Kurt Thomas as "the hero" with a child's face shows some considerable acrobatic skills, but not just any acting talent. There are some ghostly moments (in the Village of Crazies, mostly) and some slightly impressive martial arts sequences. But every "Ninja" movie will give you a lot more fun and you won't feel so guilty of laughing.
