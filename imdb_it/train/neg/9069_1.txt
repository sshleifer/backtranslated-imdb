(The script by David H. Steinberg) initially seemed to have real clever points that could have made a romantic comedy, BUT BUT MA, oh dear! What ever happened in the way ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> I'll tell you what happened. Originally it is (Animal House - 1978) and (Porky's - 1982). Although it was a long time ago, but those are the pioneers, the godfathers of the new genre: the rude adolescent comedy. Then came the 90s. After important cases that have become successes (the repulsive ones I add) such as (Problem Child - 1990), (Dumb and Dumber - 1994), (The Nutty Professor - 1996), and (There's Something About Mary - 1998) that I Think that strikes are influenced by, there was the maximum of the era and the prophet of the next era, the one and only one: (American Pie - 1999), which is undoubtedly and incomparably the icon of a gender. After that I think that every comedy of this type should be so bold, with praise, to be admired by young people otherwise it could be out of fashion! <br /> <br /> I think (Slackers) had a clever storyline first as a script, so its creators had to add some real stuff: rudeness, filth, oddly brash sex to do - back then - as easy as a cake! How they had to fill every scene with elements as freely as: masturbation, oral sex, urination ... etc., just to look fashionable. They are completely useless elements for the story, but surely they are so necessary to make profits, and to catch the latest fashion in making comedies for boys. The problem lies in how this has already replaced any possible comedy. <br /> <br /> Some of his moments seemed literally horrible and, as you can see, that's the point. It's all inside (the appearance and performance of Jason Schwartzman); memorably disgusting to the fullest. So ambition turned from being that romantic comedy into doing what had not been done before skinned images. Be more like a horror you're asking all the time; what would be uglier? (vomiting, farts, etc.); these are the easiest combination to create a play today. <br /> <br /> Even if you hate it, you have to love something (mainly to be bold), for me it was just the scene of Gina Gershon cameo. In any case, they designed it as a whole to get the outrage out of shame, like a teenage girl's dream. Although most of it was close to someone's nightmare. <br /> <br /> What saddened me was that this at its core was a potential potential job, and not another economic one, another stupid comedy that eventually managed to be. Remember the details of the theft of the exam (the first 2 minutes), then the main plot of the film (weir that tries to reach a girl by blackmailing nice boys) through the model of (boy loves girl, and the girl loves another boy) because, it is nothing but a candid schlock. He dealt with his material the pile of dirty college kids, who had nothing to do but make a sloppy joke out of something, they would do it. It ended up being, and I'm sorry to say, a smile sh * t! <br /> <br /> In the end he said something (you can imagine!) On how the time and the place is even for the imposter or the game to win, totally similar to this comedy itself. It looks like a good ending for a completely different film; that could assure my opinion on this as a smart one .. Once! And it doesn't need much to understand that the producers of this film were the real slackers! Maybe being stupid is a way to be smart in Hollywood, but even if .. The end result here was not at least witty in any sense of the word. <br /> <br /> PS: His screenwriter (David H. Steinberg), who wrote the story of (American Pie 2), has a main page in IMDb, which you will find under "Additional Details" his usual " keywords of the plot "which are: Sex / Vulgarity / Raw humor / ... They just forgot to write Urinating while showering or fucking 70-year-old women!
