I saw this film years ago in a group tradition of the Fast Forward Film Festival, where we decided to rent a group of B films and vote for those who chose the worst. <br /> <br /> The night we saw it, it was voted the best, due to the semblance of plot and funny costumes. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a silly, kitsch movie to watch under the full knowledge that you're looking at low budget fluff. Personally, however, I would not recommend other substances ... this film will leave its mark on you. <br /> <br /> It made quite an impression that I was really trying to get my hands on a copy for a few years. <br /> <br /> A good choice if you are preparing to watch bad movies. This is fun, and I remember bouncy music ...
