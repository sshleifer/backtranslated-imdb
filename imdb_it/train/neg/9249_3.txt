While watching the movie, I'm not sure which direction to take. There is a reason why a writer should not direct his work or even act in it, you cannot do everything. I heard the story really suffered in this film because of the director who wears so many hats. Mrs McTeer is the film. To add to his fantastic talents, his portrait of this woman was the reason I was engaged. Here is a British actress who can do anything. From my point of view, conflict is what makes it dramatic and a great story. I heard that this movie didn't have this. Everything was pretty easy for the characters, there were no real obstacles that prevented the characters from getting what they wanted. Watch the film for sweetness, but above all for the brilliant performance of Mrs McTeer.
