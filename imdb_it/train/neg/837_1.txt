I have seen and really appreciated the first two, really. Especially since the latter is not just an attempt to make another as good as the first. And it's a story by itself. You don't have to know the first movie. I also liked the "Free Willy" movies. <br /> <br /> But ... the third, here is absolutely useless! I tried it with a friend of mine, because we both enjoyed the first two. We decided to stop after a good half hour. The film is ok, there are fun parts in it. But for what? Timon and Pumba were funny creatures in the first two films. What Lion King 1 1/2 is for me is: a tough attempt to get even more fun than the first movie than it already was, as well as telling the story from their point of view. But for what? I would really like to know. You know, the idea of ​​the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one is really beautiful. But what comes next is mostly useless. I imagine that many people like Timon and Pumba, and I really do. Still, for me many parts were very much built with an attempt to be fun. No chance, most of it wasn't fun at all, at least for me. Btw. what was the movie anyway? Was it a) on Timon and Pumba or b) an attempt to get more fun from the first movie? I tend to choose the b option and am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you like to see stories like "the story behind xy", you should see "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" by Tom Stoppard with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. It's really fun and you don't try to get more from Hamlet, so that's it.
