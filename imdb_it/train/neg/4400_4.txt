One of Frances Farmer's first films; at 22, she is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby has a great voice, but the songs are not the best. Martha Raye and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy, probably great in its time, is really trivial today. Roy Rogers also appears in a singing role. In my opinion it is worth watching if you are a fan of Frances Farmer, and possibly a fan of Bing Crosby.
