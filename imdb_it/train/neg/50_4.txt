In three "horror" films with a guy in a board that begged the viewer not to "go out" and (unfortunately) gives us three stories to show why. <br /> <br /> The first story involves a young couple in a car accident that meets with two psychopaths. It leads to two completely predictable twists. Still, it's fast (about 15 minutes), violent, well acted and well done. Predictable but pleasant. <br /> <br /> The second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money. His car breaks down, he is attacked by a dog and he stumbles into a nearby clinic. VERY obvious, badly done and extremely slow. Even at 30 minutes this is too long. Good acting though. <br /> <br /> The third is just a horror story. It involves a beautiful and lonely woman looking for Mr. Right. She has beautiful drawings, a beautiful erotic feeling and a beautiful sex scene. But (again) predictable and nowhere near frightening. <br /> <br /> It ends very stupidly. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's worth looking at the first one, but that's all. Tune in to that then turn it off.
