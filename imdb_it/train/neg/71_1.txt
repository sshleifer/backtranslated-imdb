This film was so relentlessly bad, I couldn't believe I was watching. The direction, editing, production and screenplay all seemed to be made by middle school students who didn't know much about cinema. There was no narrative flow that made any sense. Great emotional moments and culminating moments (like the one between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (as mentioned at the beginning) come completely out of the blue and are not set as they would have been in a more elegant and actually made film way. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any kind of connection with them. The acting, surprisingly, is not entirely negative, but the terrible writing cancels the relatively convincing performances. The film sounds like a terrible T.V. western / epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (real) story he tries to tell. I have read many reviews that defend the film as important to Australians because of the matter. It's all right, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historic icon. DON'T DO THE FILM. No one is saying that the topic is not good, only the quality of the film itself. Pearl Harbor was a very important historical event for Americans, but that doesn't mean I will defend the film and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure all around, even though Heath and Orlando are adorable to watch.
