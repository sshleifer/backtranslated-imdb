Julia Roberts, of course, makes a concerted effort to shake off the pretty woman in cotton cotton with this spurious abuse spouse, but it's hard to imagine that she will end up staging such a powerful and convincing performance (and Oscar winning ) as he did in Erin Brokovich based on the back of this garbage. And doing nothing, it's nothing but a vehicle of Julia Roberts, but unfortunately, her performance isn't the weakest thing about it. <br /> <br /> The plot has all the signs of a for-cable night, and doesn't have the impression that it will offer a vision of the dark world of domestic abuse because the characters are not sufficiently outlined to really make them to interest. <br /> <br /> Ultimately disappointing and unsatisfactory, without the name of Roberts over the title, I'm sure he would have fallen completely, deservedly.
