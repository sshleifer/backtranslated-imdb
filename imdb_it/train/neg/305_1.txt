I'm glad I saw this movie after Mr. Sandler became famous. <br /> <br /> It's bad ... bad, bad, bad. There is no plot. It's like watching a painfully boring home movie. <br /> <br /> I really like his other films ...... but if you're a fan like me ... stay away from this. He could change his mind about Adam. You could never recover from the horror that is this movie ... I had a better time watching the old men playing scrabble in a house .......
