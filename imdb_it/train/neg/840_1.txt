I totally agree with the last commentator, this could be the worst movie ever made. I too had to go fast for most of this movie. Michael Madsen must have made this film as a favor to someone. The image quality is grainy to the core. And what little plot there is, it's just stupid. I give this movie a 1 in 10 if I could give it a lower score. Don't waste your time in this movie or you'll regret it.
