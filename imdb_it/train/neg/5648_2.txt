The Boston lawyer has turned his back and is heading for the barn door and the pig slop he created! When this show first aired for almost four seasons, it was a humorous slap to the legal system that all actors seem proud to portray. It was fun, diverse and to some extent real. The characters portrayed were acceptable and to a real extent in their representations. Comment and sexual activity were limited and amusing. Julie Bowen is and has been as beautiful as in other series she has participated in, but is now being dragged into the lower depths of Media programming of sex and violence. Julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this "production". Rene Adjurdubois He is an excellent actor who has had his own in the entertainment field since the days of "Benson", always showing humor and acting respectful of production. Captain Kirk "is". Candace Bergan is fun and funny and should be admired for her who continues in this production and is a good actress. James Spader, there is no doubt about his acting ability, however he should go back to his XXX origins as "Crash" because he seems to have a lot of talent and inclination in that direction. We ask that this series is trashed as it already is and is really starting to smell!
