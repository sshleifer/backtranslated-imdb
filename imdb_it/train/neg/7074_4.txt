My God, this movie is terribly boring. I'm a big fan of Gina Gershon, when I rented this film I was expecting a romantic drama, and some great Gershon performances. Gershon is as big as ever, but he's not the right actress for this role, he's too good for Rade Serbedzija. The love story between the characters of Gershon and Serbedzija is too unconvincing. And I absolutely hated the character of Serbedzija (a loser organizer), but it's not fascinating in the film. As did Dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon) beyond my understanding. Maybe Sean Connery, Robert DeNiro or Harrison Ford would have done a better job in this role, but they don't have the European look I imagine. Anyway, I was so bored to straighten the film. If you're looking for a good Gina Gershon movie, check out Bound, his best film so far. If you're looking for a romantic movie about a younger woman and an older man, try some Harrison Ford or Sean Connery movies. Gina Gershon is so undervalued, and she deserves better chances than this, I wish her a better choice in the future.
