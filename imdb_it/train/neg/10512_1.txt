I rented this film for a reason, Tom Savini, compared his work but this was a real disappointment, I had horrible clich√©s, half of the film were naked women so called "fallen angels" who ran trying to behave in a scary way, oh and then there were occasional black and white scenes with "Blair Witch" camera scenes. Tom's character was really horrible, horrible script. And you have to love these lines they use. "There's someone there, who's out there, that's not funny" No, but your acting was. I wish I could give this movie a 0! Oh the names of the characters. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but left Anthony outside, The Breakfast Club reunited in the unforgivable acting forest.
