After reading many reviews, I don't know which movie some people were looking at, but clearly it wasn't the same one I saw. <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible. The acting, mainly of Moore, is simply terrible. The woman cannot act. Nice tits, but she can't act. At no point did she come across the real character. Instead, the Hollywood actress who goes to the beach to pretend with the boys was ruined. <br /> <br /> And this is what this movie is all about: the fiction of Hollywood. The training sequences are exaggerated. Politics - over the top. Political correctness - over the top. The fight scenes - you guessed it, over the top. Your mission is to enter and exit without being discovered. So what do you do? Why shoot so many shots and make as much noise as possible, of course. Oh G.I. Jane, you can be my wingman anytime. <br /> <br /> The premise is good, but as soon as Hollywood makes it, we end up with Top Gun with tits. <br /> <br /> What's more to expect from US commercial films? I don't believe much.
