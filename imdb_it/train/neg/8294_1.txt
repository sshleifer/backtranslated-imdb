There may be something poetic about seeing dentists suffer. They suffer, in this gloomy film, really terrible, but they also make the public suffer the pain of the non-dentist variety. If you've ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming children, wattles, sick children, many long, long meaningful looks, an impassive wife and a worried husband: it's all here for you. Boring, too long, it stands out as one of those screaming examples: why? Is there a saving grace? Yes there is. There is a brief scene of Nabucco, with some beautiful singing. Save your money, or if it's on TV or cable, save time. You can always read a book or make an omelette.
