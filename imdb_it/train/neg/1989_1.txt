I would have liked to give this movie a zero but it wasn't an option !! This movie sucks !!! Women cannot act. I should have known he would suck when I saw Bobby Brown. No one in my house could believe that he had not changed channels after the first 15 minutes. the idea of ​​black females as gunslingers in western days is ridiculous. it's not just a matter of race, it's also a genre. the combination of the two is ridiculous. I'm sorry because some of the people in the film aren't bad actors / actresses, but the film itself was terrible. it wasn't as credible as a movie. It could be "fun" for a certain group of people, but I'm not in that group. lol. and using a great line from a great big movie ... "that's all I have to say about this."
