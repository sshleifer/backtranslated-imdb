Stewart Moss plays a scientist on a business trip with his wife, and one has the feeling that he was chosen for this role because of his ability to roll his eyes in his head ... imagine auditions for this ... " ... no, it's not really like that, thanks, later! ". However, he is bitten by a bat, and then, either he is turning into a bat and killing people or ... he is not. For no one else sees his strange transformations, but he himself seems to think that he is changing because his wedding ring comes off when his hands turn into claws, etc. To his credit the film doesn't hold back on whether he's just crazy or if he's actually turning into something until almost the end. This has some good positions and a sort of decent atmosphere at times, but unfortunately none of this can make up for the somewhat limping story and the wonderfully bad acting. A little fun in a "so bad is good" way, but it goes further towards the simple villain. 4 out of 10.
