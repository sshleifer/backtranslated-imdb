Everyone seems to be enthusiastic about the subject, and they don't really notice how the film was made. The deaf, dumb, okay, the underdog wins, okay, the aspect of cricket is fantastic, but the film is in the general average. I think it could be done much better than it is. <br /> <br /> The plot is too predictable for a film that is not based on a real-life event. I'm sure the film could have been made more interesting. The songs were simply inserted and I had to literally forward the scenes where the same thing would be shown from different angles. <br /> <br /> Good acting, however. Watchable.
