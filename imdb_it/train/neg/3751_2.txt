I'm a big fan of David Lynch. This film, however, was a disappointing experience. Apart from the ambient background music? who really puts the atmosphere of the movie ?? almost all the qualities I have come to associate with Lynch's work are lacking. The images are opaque, to put it mildly, and the dialogue is vague and monotonous to be of any interest. <br /> <br /> This seems more like an embarrassing film student trying to make an artistic dogma film than the work of an experienced director. superior. This film lacks almost all artistic qualities. I feel like I'm watching one of Davids's homemade videos, produced during a weekend trip with some friends.
