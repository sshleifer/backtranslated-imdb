What do you get when you have bad acting, bad direction, scenes that are terribly terrible, terrible lights, painful changes and terrible effects? Get Jessica: A Ghost Story It looks like her shot on Betacam, which is fine, but the lighting must compliment this medium. In this case no. There are some CUs in which the person's face is completely in shadow. One scene in particular is the psychiatrist scene. It's a joke if you ask me. Some scenes were so long that they could have been cut in half ... but I imagine they wouldn't have had a feature film. The main character is incredibly flat. He is the LEAD male, so he should have some "hero" elements for his character, but he doesn't. He whines and is afraid of the whole movie. I could go on, but I don't want to waste time. Although the lighting was terrible, I must say that they had a nice camera movement. Too bad the lighting didn't compliment it. The DVD cover is nice, and that's where it ends. Simply terrible
