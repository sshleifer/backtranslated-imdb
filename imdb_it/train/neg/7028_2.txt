Somewhere between Food Court and Zip's, the commercial center of this movie <br /> <br /> has an explosives shop. This is the only place where the title character <br /> <br /> can buy the bomb planting in the mall in the gloomy finale. <br /> <br /> An imaginary city has a new shopping center, built on land this was <br /> <br /> condemned. Cute Girl (I don't understand her name) gets a job as a waitress there. He lost his boyfriend in a fire at the site of the mall <br /> <br />. The evil owner of the mall takes on the arsonist <br /> <br /> responsible for the fire as a security guard after his first security guard <br /> <br /> died. Rob Estes, eons before "Silk Stalkings", is a photojournalist / reporter who tries to find a story. He connects with Cute Girl, <br /> <br /> and their mutual "funny" friend Pauly Shore, and tries to find out if Eric is still alive. He is, living in the basement of the mall (?) And traveling <br /> through the air ducts and offering various people who have upset his ex-girlfriend <br />, including the arsonist. In the end, he kidnaps it <br /> <br /> and the ending involves the bomb and everyone who escapes from the scene <br /> <br /> before the big kablooey. Morgan Fairchild is together for <br /> <br /> tour as mayor ... yes, she is the mayor. <br /> <br /> Of course, you probably didn't need a sketch since the whole story is in the title. Someone by the name of Eric is taking revenge against <br /> <br /> like a ghost of a mall. This also means that there is no suspense of <br /> <br />. We know that Eric is behind this, but we still have to see <br /> <br /> Estes and Cute Girl go through the moves of a silly investigation. <br /> <br /> See how Fairchild, whom we know has been in league with the mall owner all the time, throws a gun at our heroic duo in the middle of a crowded party, yet no one says a word as he drives them at his office <br /> <br />, and his eventual death. The fictitious city is huge, yet a policeman has never been called, everyone relies on the security of the mall for the order. Eric hid after building the mall, but I'm not sure where. It seems to live in a basement, but one might think that some construction workers would have found it. He also <br /> <br /> furnished his love pad well enough, and found some stores, since he has electricity. It could be nicer than your apartment! <br /> <br /> Pauly Shore fans, both, take note. Deceive a security guard <br /> <br /> out of the cabin by illuminating the camera. Yes, stop crawling <br /> <br /> Celebrity Skin and Playgirl, this is where you can see a grainy black and white of Pauly's south shore, even if it's not a weezil. <Br /> <br /> This is just garbage, and the proof is that I'm renting only on anything at the video store to stay in the horror section. This movie <br /> <br /> is not Eric's revenge, it's the director's revenge for me <br/> <br /> being stupid enough to watch it. Here's my revenge: I don't recommend it <br />. This will show it! <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for physical violence, armed violence, cold blood, some swear words, some female nudity, brief male nudity, and some sexual content from <br /> <br />.
