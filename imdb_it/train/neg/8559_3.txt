"It is difficult to describe how exciting it is both how to make a report like drama as with all pornographic scenes launched as in a good measure, and how to arouse counter-how-to and do more like money and similar things." - Ellen , the lost quotation. <br /> <br /> "Kissing, like, up, like, mouth and stuff" is like the best artistic enterprise ever made. Watching as Ellen's hairy arms and like Chris masturbating was like the height of my years of film experience and stuff like that. But before I like to start as the breaking of new US-20-something-to-head records with my "likes", let me just list briefly how the highlights of this visual party: <br /> <br /> 1. Chris does the act with his genitals. And not only that: the way in which the camera (elegantly guided by Ellen and Patrick) rewards the viewer with a full-screen projection of Rick Bianco's fat stomach after he concluded the non-Catholic act - which was really electrifying. I can honestly say that I have never seen such grace. Chris, you should do more scenes like that in your next movies, because that's exactly what we needed as a continuation of what the brilliant and brilliant man, Lars von Trier and his "Idiots 95", started. A quick fuck and then a hairy, fat, white belly: what more could any viewer ask for ?! Needless to say, I can sit all day and watch Chris ejaculate (even though I'm straight) ... That poem in motion. Such elegance, such style. No less than the total, the divine inspiration went to film that sequence - plus a good dose of Zen philosophy. Even Barbra Streisand could not be more spiritual than this. <br /> <br /> 2. Ellen's hairy and thick arms. Close-ups with flickering images, so cleverly photographed by our two directors of photography (I can't stress enough), Ellen and Patrick, have often caused confusion about the correct identification of the sex in question. There were several scenes in which we saw a part of a body (a leg, an arm or a foot), but often it was a game of hypotheses: does that part of the body belong to a man or a woman? Of course, Chris and his fellow artists, Ellen, Patrick and whatsername, expressed themselves on purpose, because their bodies were ideal for creating this gender confusion. Sometimes it was difficult to guess if you see a female or male leg. Patrick is so thin and effeminate in his movements, so hairless and pristine, while Ellen and the other girl are so very muscular, with their legs and arms thick. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> 3. Brilliant - especially the way in which it binds perfectly to the theme of role reversal between the sexes: so absolutely original and amazing. Ellen acts like a man, wants sex all the time, while her ex Patrick wants to talk - like a girl. Spiffing. <br /> <br /> 4. Ellen's quest for a left-wing companion. "He must love" The Simpsons ", which is rather left." I am pleased that the creators of this film have decided to break the long tradition of offering us Intelligent Left. Ellen is such a refreshing and realistic change. The number of "likes" that she and her liberal friends can pronounce in less than 80 minutes is really phenomenal (3.849, to be exact). They have been able to realistically transfer their unreality of real life to the big screen with minimal effort, and I applaud them for that. <br /> <br /> 5. Close-ups of toes. A lot of stuff here for foot fetishists, which I think is a very liberal and highly commendable way to reach sexual minorities. After all, shoe and foot fetishists are offered so little in modern cinema, so it's nice to see someone out there CARES. <br /> <br /> KOTM, or better, KLOTLMAS, offers more than it looks. It is not just a small, modest film about superficial people who engage in empty relationships while giving meaningless conversations. No, it's much more than that. It's about the light that drives all the silly creatures; the guiding light that dominates the futile lives of various aspiring pseudo-artists who have just dropped out of film school, and plan to attack our senses with unpleasant ghosts that hopefully can sound good in pretentious festivals like Sundance and Cannes, allowing them to gain the necessary exposure then some real money for a change, with which they will later hire Sean Penn and George Clooney in promoting the rescue of this planet and the resolution of ALL the political problems that this world has to face. What better way to do it than to do porn in the beginning? <br /> <br /> If Chris and Ellen did the camera here, as is clearly indicated in the credits, who held the camera while the two were in front? They probably hired some passersby and pushed the camera into their hands ... <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and take a look at my "TV & Cinema: 150 worst cases List of "Nepotism".
