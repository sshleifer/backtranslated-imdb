The Three Stooges in a long western-musical feature film? Perhaps "Rockin 'in the Rockies" was to combine the Stooges comedy with the musical western, in a matinee; if so, this was a nice way to break on a Saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (as Rusty) is a handsome young hero; and, Mary Beth Hughes (like the blonde June) and Gladys Blake (like the brunette Betty) are beautiful women. The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group; their songs are quite melodic; however, this is the 1940s, not the 1950s, so the film is not exactly "rock". There are some laughs; but the mark of the Stooges' humor is more subdued than usual. Even the talking horse is underutilized. <br /> <br /> **** Rockin 'in the Rockies (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
