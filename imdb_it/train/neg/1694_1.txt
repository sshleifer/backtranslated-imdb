This movie may sound scary on commercials, but the real movie was a reason to throw up. This is an average lower than average (even lower than that) and has no plot. I mean every house can make you feel scared and safe, a dead Japanese woman could scare your poop, but then? Make a movie that observers like and don't just show pictures of scared people and some hair (dead Japanese woman). Can you say "horrible rip-off of Samara (The Ring)"? Don't let me start with the "dead child". Not even that scary! So? He has a cat and can imitate him, a great deal! Just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential to be damaged by Grudge! 1/10! How disgusting! >. <
