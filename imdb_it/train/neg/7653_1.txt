First of all I would like to say that if I were to honestly evaluate this film from 1 to 10, then I would give a -4. It's not that I'm a tough critic, it's just that this movie is so ugly. Everything from history to directing to editing is terrible. The story isn't even halfway decent to begin with (you can't expect much since it's based on a video game, something I wasn't aware of going into the movie) but the direction and editing made it even worse. The film cuts into embarrassing points and goes to scenes completely extraneous to the previous ones; some, like a fast-paced sex scene in the middle, don't even make sense to be put into the story by seeing how the characters show no feelings towards one another. You could go into this movie waiting to see a bunch of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you'll still be disappointed. Honestly, if you pay to watch this movie, you're wasting your money, and if you don't pay anything, you're still wasting an hour and a half of your life. So do yourself a favor and don't look at it.
