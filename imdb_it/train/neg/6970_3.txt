Now, it would be a sort of clich√© if I started with the title piece, so I'll wait on that. First, this film made me wonder why kids do stupid things like wandering around in the labs and breaking bottles. Then I realized, this is a movie with a message, that message is beaten by children and things like this won't happen. Things like what you ask? Things like a giant insect monster that grows and causes some chaos before dying in the typical way of "killing the monster indirectly". Now, as promised ... Blue Monkey ... has nothing blue in it nor any Simian of any kind. Now it collapses as if you were cheated or something. The image on the cover had a giant insect / crab / idiot / thing on the front that chased screaming nurses. This happened but I wanted monkeys! Having just enjoyed the BIGGEST PRIMATE a few nights before (Cask half drunk and creator of Creame), I was in the mood for more monkeys in the style of the 80s. Not so much. If you like monkeys with snowboards or blue things this movie is not for you. If you like bugs and good reasons to hit children, rent this one.
