"Smithereens" is the kind of worthless film that hangs between cable channels occupying space like a cheap novel in the public library. A useless piece of tripe and the first effort for the mediocre director Seidelman, the film is full of bad acting, bad sound, bad camera and poor quality in all aspects of the film. Many top films never get to the market and because junk movies like what they do and don't seem to go away are one of the great mysteries of life. (D)
