This movie is just another action movie, but it could have been a lot better. When guns come out, they really need help with choreography. Someone like Andy McNabb - who made that brilliant action sequence in Heat while moving along the path of robbery - would have turned the boring action sequences into something special. Because the rest of the film was fine - predictable but watchable - better than you'd expect from this type of film. Then came the final scene, the show-down, what we were waiting for, but it was like watching something from the A-Team in the 80s. They shoot wildly, nothing strikes, and run around a house trying to kill each other - the same old, the same old man.
