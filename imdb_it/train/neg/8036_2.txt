Do you guys want to know a secret? This movie sucks. Well, actually I don't know because if you allow yourself to be seduced by the plagiarized versions of the original films, then maybe you could find this stunning film (this film is a plagiarized copy of I know what you did last summer). The first 30 minutes of the film are based on a typical story setting; a group of so-called young teenagers who enjoy their holidays in Florida and behave very much like the young people they are. The only insight we get at this point is the extent to which the director has managed to illustrate a pretentious sense of adolescent decadence within the characters. The second half hour of the film gains some momentum and begins to illustrate a start to unprecedented and unprecedented killings. The third half hour of the film will surely remain a mystery to me, because I turned it off before I could further delude myself thinking that the film could still have something interesting and original left to show. As for the story, it can be easily explained in a few lines. A group of teenagers goes on vacation to Florida. While they are busy celebrating, slowly (and I mean SLOWLY) they start to be killed because they know a kind of stupid secret. The only common thread to the killings is that all the victims were freshmen of a common high school. One thing that still surprised me about this movie, was how betty (I'm not sure of her name ... the blond character) looks like reese witherspoon. Another thing that surprised me about the movie is that it made me jump from my seat a few times. Does this make it a work of art? absolutely not because my 12-year-old granddaughter dropped me a glass of orange juice because it "whistled" me when I was about to walk through the door of the guest room ... this difference between the director and my 12-year-old niece? ??? <br /> <br /> Want to know a secret ??? I'm not sure you guys, but I don't ...
