A great concept gone wrong. Poor acting, even worse than writing .... After seeing the first two episodes, I wondered why he had ever reached season two. The characters are forgettable, the writing is poor, the sets are OK. The special effects are simply sad - much better was done in the same amount of time - where is the money going for this? The first episode begins interesting, then quickly descends: the precept of the entire show is simply silly. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of science fiction and 'geeks' - but this show just doesn't cut it. As I said at the beginning, I am really surprised that it has arrived at the second season, so much the better it was canceled after only one season (Jake 2.0 for example). This show was just bad.
