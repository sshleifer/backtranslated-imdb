Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. Start with an opening scene that is a fantastic example of absurd comedy. A formal orchestra audience is transformed into a crazy and violent crowd with the mad songs of its singers. Unfortunately it remains absurd all the time without a general narrative that eventually makes it too daunting. Even those from the era should be deactivated. The cryptic dialogue would have made Shakespeare easy in a third year. On a technical level it is better than one might think with a good picture of the future great Vilmos Zsigmond. The stars of the future Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.
