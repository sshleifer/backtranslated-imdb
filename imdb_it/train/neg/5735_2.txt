First of all, this is a low budget movie, so my expectations were incredibly low. I assume that most people who look at the information for this film just want a bloodfest, and basically that's all. <br /> <br /> Plot? There really is nobody. It is basically a saw but in China it is much worse. Cast? There is no one, period. Special effects? Absolutely horrible to me ... there were some cracks and the blood was often completely unbelievable due to quantity, splashes, color, consistency, etc. <br /> <br /> I think the purpose of this film should have been a brutal, shocking movie. Now he had great potential with a bigger budget but poor scripts, poor dialogues, horrible acting, what looked like a video camcorder and simply "incredible" gore, made this movie really terrible. <br /> <br /> are movies that are worth the chance to compare with some reviews, even the "b-rate" films deserve some opportunities (the blood traces, for example, were the most recent ones I saw against reviews which was well worth it), but it was just awful. I hope that people who are considering this film read my comment and decide not to do so. <br /> <br /> I am absolutely brutal and shocking, but the general unrealism and really horrible acting make it a terrible experience. Save time and money and chance something else, you won't be disappointed.
