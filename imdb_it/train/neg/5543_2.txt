Seriously, I love these old movies and their simplicity, but I saw it for the first time last night and it easily fit into my lowest five of all time. Was this supposed to be about romance or zombies ??? This film was so bad that after having mercifully ended all I could do was laugh at how terrible it really was. Fortunately I'm too anal to shoot a movie without seeing the whole thing or I wouldn't be able to brag about looking at it all in one sitting! I like to think that something positive can be said about anything in life, so in tune with this theory I will recognize the most positive good of this film, it was very short for a full length film.
