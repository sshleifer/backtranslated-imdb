Nick Millard, aka Nick Phillips, should have left quite well alone when he did "Criminally Insane" 10 years before the release of this terrible waste of time and effort. The fact that the original "Criminally Insane" lasted less than an hour should have led him to think that he had probably milked this plot for everything he was about to get out of it ... but instead he chose to use TONS of movies from the original even in this, to the point of recycling the original opening credit sequence! Unfortunately, reporting the rapid aging of Priscilla Alden has not saved this. What little original material in this film seems to have been filmed with a rented portable video camera! If this movie cost more than $ 100, I would be very surprised and I would be just as surprised if it did something like this! Avoid this and look at the original instead!
