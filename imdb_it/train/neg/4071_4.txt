A young man kills a young woman for no reason. The man's brother is imprisoned on the charge of being an accomplice, but he soon runs away. After escaping, the apparently innocent man kidnaps three victims and soon starts to tie up his girlfriend on the plot. If this is not bad enough, the situation quickly makes a downward spiral. <br /> <br /> This film has some positive and many bad aspects. His strongest appearance was the lead actress Emily Haack. Setting aside the fact that she is naked in a good part of this film, she presents herself as a decent actress and a very strong character. I see no reason why I can't take this experience and somehow turn it into a career somehow. I was convinced that she was a ruthless person. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the creators of this film have been very daring and have not punched. Graphic nudity (both male and female), coprophagia and extreme anal violence are not removed. I like my horror films to push the boundaries a little, and this has ignored them completely, jumping willingly towards Gomorrah. Maybe it was too much, but I think they reached what they were looking for. <br /> <br /> But now the negative aspects. First and most evident, this film has a very low budget and the quality of the film proves it. I can apologize: the plot was decent, the acting was good and in some scenes the lower quality film actually made the film more disturbing (a more realistic feeling). So, I won't scold them for having low-level equipment. What I will reproach them for is the use of wrong choices in the shots. For no reason can I ascertain (besides filling the film), there is a great deal of footage of a cemetery. I really don't know why, and frankly I started to doze at this point because it was so long and useless. <br /> <br /> I also considered the title. The idea was to trick people into thinking that this movie had some connection with the classic "I Spit on Your Grave". Now, there is a phrase that seems to imply that the protagonist is the woman's daughter in this other film. And the themes are very vaguely the same (a woman who takes revenge on men). But there is no firm connection and the reason this title was chosen was that the customers of the video store thought they were getting a sequel. This was deceptive and dishonest. <br /> <br /> My last complaint is that this plot makes no sense. Not at all. A woman is killed at the beginning for no reason. A person fleeing the prison finds time to kidnap people to torture them, for no reason (why are they wrong with his girlfriend?). The same man goes from good to very bad without explanation. Similarly, the female protagonist (Haack) becomes a normal person for someone who is overly cruel and sadistic, without any reason, and against people who for the most part were only marginally bad with her (a neighbor who offers drugs for sex is wrong, but in no way deserves to be tortured for). <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by this title, nor claim that the film is incredibly shocking. Yes, some scenes were shocking, but the vast majority of the film is boring and makes you want to take a nap. If you see it in video rentals or on Netflix, keep browsing. Or rent it, and we can sit around and let off steam for hours. You have been warned.
