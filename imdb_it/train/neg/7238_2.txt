The interaction between the characters is a moral disaster. You end up not loving most of the characters and you don't particularly like any of them. <br /> <br /> Even the two main characters played by David and Gwen are so badly written that you really don't care a little about them. The film has no plot, no direction and no purpose. The only saving quality of the film was to treat it as a glimpse of the messy lives of some losers - and this is certainly not stimulating even as an afternoon waste.
