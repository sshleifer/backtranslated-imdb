This series gets worse and worse. Poorly written and simply not fun! The premise is excellent, but the writer's inexperience shines through. Trying so hard to offend no one ends up insulting everyone. Now in the second season the desperate cast has stopped waving his arms, and has resorted to that condescending, smug, "Oh, stupid you" style acting that comes with a script without laughter. Roll your eyes and shake each other's heads as if to say, aren't we boring? It's not funny? Well, no, it really isn't. Gum disease is less painful. No wonder, with the exception of Corner Gas, Canadians generally avoid Canadian TV. Come on CBC, suppose you are our leading station to showcase the best of Canadian talent. Pull the plug on this amateur mess.
