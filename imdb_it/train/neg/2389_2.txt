Uma Thurman plays Sissy, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (with incredibly large thumbs) who hitchhikes in the countryside, finally finding her true place among a group of peyote-enlightened cowgirls on a ranch dedicated to the preservation of the Whooping Crane ; Rain (bow) Phoenix is ​​their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy, the thumbs or less. Gus Van Sant directed and adapted Tom Robbins' book, but his satire does not have a primary objective and touches the map, like Sissy (maybe that was his goal, but it does not involve the public). The infamous box office flop was not as fussy as ignored, and one can understand why: it is a series of sketches in search of a plot, and the performances, the directing touches and the cinematography are all variable. Thurman is a point posing along the highway that tries to take a ride, but this pretty much put the kibosh in Phoenix's career. The writer Buck Henry (who didn't write this, but perhaps should have) gives the safest performance of the doctor working on one of those thumbs. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
