Chris, an adopted son of a moral family, a loser working on the school newspaper with Kate (Christine Lakin from the terrible sugary "Step by Step" of the line-up of the now fortunately deceased TGIF TGIF), discovers that he has just inherited a porn empire from its biological parents. He loses the sight of what is true friendship and love and bla bla other nonsense. He also had to fight with an uncle who wants control of family affairs and an elusive lawyer (and aren't they?) A teenage comedy slightly below average that steals from better teen comedies (opening alone is HIGHLY American Pie-esquire), he beats you in the head with morality every time he has the chance, and he wastes the only star talent he has (Wayne Newton, Lin Shaye, and if I'm really stretching the word star, Martin Starr of " Freaks and Geeks ", and Justin Berfield of" Malcolm in the Middle "). Not bad at all, but it's far from good. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: some extras become topless <br /> <br /> My Grade: C- <br /> <br /> Where I am seen: Starz on Demand (available until September 29th)
