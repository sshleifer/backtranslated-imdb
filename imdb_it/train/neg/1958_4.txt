Where to start This film started as something that looked like a "Darkness Falls" rip-off. An old and disfigured woman who lives in the woods, giving children gifts for their teeth. Does it sound familiar? So change. In "Darkness Falls", the tooth fairy only killed you if you saw her. The tooth fairy in this film killed you, no matter what. Why did they need the rocker, his hippie girlfriend or Bubbas and their sister? I think the film would have gone well without them. It seems that the producers sat around and decided that they should have put more people into the film just so that the tooth fairy would have people to kill. Although it's nice to see a beautiful blonde girl not be portrayed as a bubble to change. It's fine for rent, but I wouldn't suggest buying it.
