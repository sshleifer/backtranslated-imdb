... but a lousy movie. As Maltin says, this was Christopher Lee's attempt to make a serious horror film. Well, it's serious ... TOO serious! The plot is stupid and slow (something about the elderly who inhabit the bodies of young children to achieve immortality) ... the film is all about talking, talking, talking, talking, talking, always talking about the same things. I actually dozed off a couple of times! The film is terribly boring! The cast goes through this film with the sole exception of Peter Cushing and Lee ... but this was probably a love job for both (often complaining that horror movies were too violent ... well, this has NO violence !). Avoid at all costs ... unless you have insomnia ... this will put you to sleep!
