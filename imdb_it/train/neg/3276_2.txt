The 1980s TV show, updated with fresh female meat and vulgar language. "The Dukes of Hazzard" surpassed me; it was not repeated every time I was in front of television in New York or California; or, I probably would have watched. However, somewhere (like the clips accompanying the updated 2005 version of this film), I knew it was a fast and orange Dodge Charger - and, the "General Lee" is still ready. <br /> <br /> Hunky cousins ​​Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (like Bo and Luke Duke) are the New Riders of the Orange Sage. The beautiful Jessica Simpson (like Daisy) fills her skimpy well short - but even her exciting pink bikini can't beat the competition of a dorm full of hopping and topless comedians. The plot too stupid involves a Burt Reynolds (like "Boss" Hogg) who threatens to turn Hazzard County into a mine. <br /> <br /> ** The Dukes of Hazzard (07/27/05) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds
