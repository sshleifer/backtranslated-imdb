This elegant and sexy film is not to be missed. Only on more visions can we truly understand the uniqueness of this film. Personally, I like the narrator because of his intelligence, no subject left intact, narrative style. The introduction attracts you immediately and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout the film. It provides a wonderful view of the world of trainables and allows the public to "connect" with the inner horror that this film exhibits. The script itself holds the film together wonderfully. Not only for children, but also the elderly will gain a greater understanding of the educational content and modern understanding they have of the sexual experience. In advance of the times and innovative in cinematography, it definitely defines the word "masterpiece".
