Even more than 20 years later, Ninja Mission stands out as the worst movie in which I ever managed to sit. The scandalous ninja enter silently in a scene, shoot their mythical and unpleasant submarines with wild abandon, and then they go quietly. Wow, how are we gonna find those silent, invisible killers? Follow the cartridges and smoke! Painful dialogue (or was it brilliant and poorly translated?), It is not an Asian in the cast, and a huge total of 3 Asians among the stunts. The plot is ridiculous, the acting practically non-existent - then again, ninja can't act! Saved, avoid looking at all costs!
