SPOILER: The young lover, Jed, is chased by the spinster, Kate (Andie McDowell), because he mistakenly believes that Jed has a relationship with one of his two cat friends. Kate thought she caught them in the act. Kate throws Jed's shoes out the door. Jed reluctantly leaves, and then sits in the middle of the street to put on his shoes. Then he is hit ("Crushed", one of the meanings of the title) by a truck. And he dies. <br /> <br /> "And then he is hit by a truck." Can you imagine a scriptwriter who actually presents a script with this plot element? Until then, it is a comedy that intends to be bubbly, but lacks true effervescence. Everyone except Jed is simply boring. And then they kill Jed, and everyone is sad, until the end, where girls learn to love each other and to be supportive, rather than destructive. I give 2 ugh's.
