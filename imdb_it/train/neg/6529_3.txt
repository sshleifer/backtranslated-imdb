This film is fun and painful at the same time. The "Cinemagic" almost gave me an attack. Despite what they imply, "Cinemagic" is not an innovative technical procedure. It was "developed" as a result of an accident, and they used it because it hid the fact that their "monsters" were so stupid. Also, I don't think it's a coincidence that the writer is Sid "Pink". <br /> <br /> This film is good for a laugh, if you are really looking for a film made in 9 days at $ 200,000. It is funny; at least I can say about it. The bat / rat / spider is the highlight.
