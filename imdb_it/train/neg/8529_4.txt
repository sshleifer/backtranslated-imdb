What boob at MGM thought it would be a good idea to place the scholar Clark Gable in the role of a soldier of the Salvation Army ?? Ironically, another beautiful star of the future, Cary Grant, also played a boy from the Salvation Army just two years later, as SHE DONE HIM WRONG. I imagine that with hindsight it's pretty easy to see the madness of these roles, but I still wonder who thought that the Salvation Army guys are "HOT" and that they could look at these hot men and see them as realistic representations of the parts who have interpreted. A long time ago, I worked for a sister organization of the Salvation Army (the American Volunteers) and I have NEVER seen any scholar working there (and this includes me, unfortunately). Maybe I should have found a job with the Salvation Army! <br /> <br /> So, for the most curious, this is a good movie to watch out for, but for everyone else, it's a bad script, a sloppy dialogue and annoying moralism for a very slow movie.
