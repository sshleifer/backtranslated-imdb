OK, anyone can honestly say that this film was Great or even Good is delusional or knows the director, writer and producer and is trying to increase the buzz of this movie. I saw the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was horrible. I'm an actress and I've worked in the industry for a while in important and even independent films and this film bored me to tears. The reason I'm so tough is because this film was clearly a different way than "Of Mice and Men" and they should sue because it's such a horrible story rip-off. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt ... because someone who takes a classic book and an "Of Mice and Men" movie and destroys it with a new spin hurts so much. The actors, accents, dialogue and direction were amateur and the writing was sad. I mean, if you're going to take a new spin on an existing story, make sure it's as good or better than the original to justify the new spin. I didn't like this movie at all.
