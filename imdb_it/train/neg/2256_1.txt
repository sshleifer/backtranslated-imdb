I have to admit I saw maybe five minutes of "Jerry Springer". I don't consider myself a snob, but I really think I'm above looking at what's on his show. You should try to elevate yourself above that. <br /> <br /> I saw this film as part of a social studies event I was conducting. I was told that this film had very little to do with Springer himself, rather focused on the lives of those who would appear on "Springer". Better managed, this film could have been really a fascinating look at how pathetic these people's lives are. I'll admit it, I felt a bit of empathy for Connie (Molly Hagan). This is all he has in life. How sad that you think you have to go to Jerry's show to solve this. <br /> <br /> I'm really sorry because Molly Hagan appears in this. Did you notice that after this movie, it was relegated mainly to the "B" roles on TV? I'll say this about Hagan. She is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman. I have no doubt that she is very serious in her acting and tries to play her roles with much empathy. The problem is that Hagan cannot bring a scene alone. It doesn't have what it takes to play a leading role. His best work will always be Angel on "Herman's Head" (a show that was not great, but his heart was in the right place) and when he was a guest of "Seinfeld" as his sister Roberta.
