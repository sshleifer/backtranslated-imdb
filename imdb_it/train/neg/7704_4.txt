Well, there isn't a real plot to talk about, it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and free sex (which can sometimes be fun, but it's not in this case). What else can I say about this ...? The action, when it happens, is inventive and there is a beautiful scene in which two characters fall from a skyscraper (one that must be several miles high), but overall there is not much to recommend "Kite". Look at it if you want, but you don't miss much if you skip this ...
