I'm glad I rented this film for a reason: its shortcomings made me want to read Allende's book and get the full story. <br /> <br /> Pros: the film is beautiful, the period is well and consistently represented (as far as I know), and Meryl and Glenn do a good job. <br /> <br /> Cons: This is the worst acting job I've ever seen at Jeremy Irons - I kept wondering if something was wrong with his mouth. (And I hate the terribly English way that says "Transit".) Winona Ryder doesn't do anything credible if it doesn't seem young and idealistic. Most of the other performances are OK, but so few things hang together in the character's arcs and in the development of the relationship that I was frustrated and angry long before the end. <br /> <br /> I am very curious now if this film is typical of Bille August's work. I may have to leave another couple of dollars to rent Smilla's Sense of Snow.
