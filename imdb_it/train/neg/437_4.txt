(Spoiler) <br /> <br /> I was very curious to see this film, after hearing that he was intelligent and witty. I had to stop halfway through the unbearable boredom I felt. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the film would have been acceptable: depicting the way in which the relationship between a man and a woman evolves, through all the problems and difficulties that can live two people living in a big city. What disliked me throughout the film were two things. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film was so concrete that it seemed as if, describing the problems that a couple has to solve on a day-to-day basis, it has become ordinary and boring. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the general sloppiness of production, with dialogues that were barely comprehensible. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
