I really wanted this movie so much. I absolutely love Kenny Hotz, and the spenny rice has a fascinating side to him. Not that I like the spenny at all. Spenny ruins this movie. He should let Kenny and his hot girlfriend make the movie. <br /> <br /> However, it is rather boring apart from a scene with Roger Ebert. There are not too many celebrities in this film, and most don't seem to say more than one line. Overall this film was disappointing. I would suggest you watch it only if you got it on the DVD of season 1 of kenny vs spenny (it's free on the 3rd disc). Regardless of this production, I'm still very excited to take a look at The Papel Chase.
