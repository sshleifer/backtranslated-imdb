Life in some future fascist state or near the fascist state that severely limits personal freedoms is a recurring theme both in modern literature and for directors. These works post warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for; but to be effective they must also be fun. Unfortunately, most books are probably more effective at posting warnings than entertaining enough to actually be read; while with films the problem is usually the opposite. The first work of this kind to become very well known was probably "1984" by George Orwell (first published in 1948), and this is still readily available both as a book and as a film. <br /> <br /> Look or read it: and then, when you feel a little depressed by the inhumanity of man towards man, look for Cinderella 2000. This is a low budget light film comedy based on the same theme it offers a simple vision but without effort; and as in 1984 the calendar has now passed beyond its previous period. Most comedy is done with a trowel, although there are only a few really fun moments. To exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus on the question of whether this film will acquire a new extension of life coming out as a DVD or whether it will eventually disappear into oblivion while existing copies of the tape deteriorate the past redemption. There are many worse movies that appear as DVDs these days, and frankly I don't really care what happens anyway. <br /> <br /> So far the best of this genre film has probably been "The Handmaiden's Tale", but I'd really like to mistake them all for a well-made movie of the huge Jack London novel "The Iron Heel". As ambitious as it would be, it seems incredible that no modern director has ever dared try it (IMDb lists only a silent black and white version made in Russia in 1919).
