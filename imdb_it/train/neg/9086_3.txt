I was aware of Rohmer's admiration for the latest works of what he considered grandiose filmmakers, and that ordinary viewers were generally considered artistic failures (such as the last Renoir or Chaplin films, yes, even the "politique des auteurs" has the its dark side). But with "Les amours d'Astrée et de Céladon", it is as if Rohmer himself wanted, for what could be his last film, to perpetuate this tradition of great directors, who made a last senile film, adapting "L ' astrée of Urfé "", with ridiculous aesthetic codes, the witch seems only a parody of Rosselini's latest films (the ones he made for TV by Descartes or the lives of Marx). <br /> <br /> In his version of "Perceval", Rohmer refused to film real landscapes to give a re-transcription of what may have been a classic representation of middle-aged things.It seems that the director changed his mind when the 17th century was involved and starred in actors , dressed as peasants from the 1600s who recite their text anciently surrounded by trees and contemporary landscapes, but it all seems even more ridiculous than Luchini and his fake trees.It is not that the story itself is stupid, but the way to which Rohmer mesco the naturalism with artifices seems so childish and amateurish that it quickly becomes involuntarily funny (and I don't even mention the annoying pronunciation of the actors, the boring and humorous attempt of humor by Rodolphe Pauly, the ridiculous soft-erotic tone, the poor musical attempts, or the strange fascination for disguise!). <br /> <br /> The radical aesthetic of the film ultimately makes it seem like a joke, which mixes an erotic-soft film made for TV with theological school discussions (sic!). At the beginning of the film, Rohmer teaches us that the original French region of history is now disfigured by modernity, which is why he had to film "L'Astrée" in other parts of the country. However, I'm sure the film would have seemed more modern and interesting, if Rohmer had nevertheless filmed the same story in a modern area with the same narrative codes and artistic decisions. This film may interest some historians, but most film buffs might laugh at the latter and at Rohmer's sad film.
