After counting the use of the word f, oh, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes of the movie, I listened to some really bad actors going on a woman and a horse, and almost acting like 12-year-old boys being bad together , well, we turned it off. Relying on swear words and free humor is a sure sign of a losing Hollywood movie, the product of writers without imagination and without talent. <br /> <br /> We gave him a second chance, thinking that he would definitely improve. No way. Later, my boyfriend missed the rest of the movie in case he improved, still without dice. <br /> <br /> The main character had a nice bike. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature teenagers, or frat boys.
