I was thrilled to see this film expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic "Private Lessons" that portrays the dream of any male teenager. <br /> <br /> "Private Lessons II" has NOTHING to do with the title Mention It is just a normal soft-core Cinemax movie that will not change your life. There's only one hot sex scene in a roof, but that's all. I saw it a long time ago, but believe me, this is just a normal boring soft core movie. <br /> <br /> Women are hot but it's not enough to rent or buy the movie. My advice is to watch it only if it goes on cable.
