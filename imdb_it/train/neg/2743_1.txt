I have to admit that I didn't finish this film because it was incredibly stupid and not worth looking at. I looked at him with a room full of children, who didn't even laugh at the stupid and crude humor. The director, Bob Dolman, seems to be so obsessed with sphincters and genitals that he overwrites the real story I grew up with. THIS IS NOT A GOOD FILM FOR CHILDREN! In addition to the fact that the content is so crude, the film is simply stupid, has a bad flow and has no intelligence behind it. What a waste of a perfectly good story. If you read the book when you were younger and loved it, don't waste time watching a movie that makes it so bad. Buy your children's book instead.
