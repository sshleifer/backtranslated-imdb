When I was 11, Grease 2 was like crack. It was a classless experience, shameful, euphoric and powerfully compelling. My sister and I watched it, rewound it, and looked at it again and again and again until we fainted or became too confused and hostile to support each other. So, if you're an 11-year-old girl, and you've seen this movie as "brilliant" or "funny" or "better than the original Grease", you blame your young teenage hormones and you can be sure that this inflexible will pass the fixation with the garbage. <br /> <br /> If, however, you are not a young girl, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was anything but an embarrassing, artless, embarrassed embarrassment for all those who participated in its production, distribution and / or consumption. <br /> <br /> For the sake of criticism, I will give dignity to the film now, explaining why it blows? <br /> <br /> 1. In a well-performed musical, the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters. In Grease 2, with some questionable exceptions, the music is obscenely useless. Most of the songs seem to relate deception about sex in an excessive and general way ("Score Tonight", "Reproduction", "Do It For Our Country" and "Prowlin") without making a concrete statement about any of the characters or themes of the film . Furthermore, all the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates the cruder appearance of an ability to sing or dance. <br /> <br /> 2. The T birds should be bullshit, and if not at least a little funny, but instead each of them is a boring dj-dufus-loser. In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred T-bird jacket and starts it in the band, Michael should kick it on the ground, spit on it, and lower himself for fervor rubbing any part of his body that was touched by it. But, of course, he accepts it as if it were gold because, despite the fact that they are a group of mummatic spellcasters, there is no greater honor than being one with the birds T. <br /> <br /> 3. From the moment that Michael is handsome, intelligent, kind, resourceful and above average in any case (despite musical impotence), it is possible that Stephanie would hug him at the end when he turns out to be the man behind the mask. Stephanie, on the other hand, is a sprained, open-mouthed mummy, puffing with chewing gum, a dirty sweatshirt she is wearing, an ungraceful and unkempt dingbat. So, besides being pretty (I guess), it doesn't have nice features, so the public has no justification for the depth of Michael's attraction to him. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I didn't want to mention the gross inferiority of his predecessor since there are apparently so many experts out there who seem to believe that this comparison is unfair. Anyway, I'll tell those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for the old time: Grease 2 is a similar experience to relive your first kiss. Only you are now 32 and kiss a 13 year old boy with a snot nose with acne and slobby straps. The magic is gone and you felt dirty and disturbed. Trust me.
