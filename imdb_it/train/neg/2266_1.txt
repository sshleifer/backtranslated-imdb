Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper has recently destroyed my confidence in the art of cinema. First of all, it was created. Secondly, people went to see it. Third, some people voted for the best movie they have ever seen. If a monkey could make a film, I'm 100% sure it would be 1 billion times better. The most disgusting films have their moments (even Godzilla had some interesting special effects) the moment of this film was when I left the theater nauseated. The only thing that could have made this film worse would have been if Jerry Springer were the star. If I want to fix a shit for an hour and a half, I'll take a dump in a can. If someone has not completely despised this film, I pity you, your children and your children's children; however, contrary to Springer's beliefs, I clearly do not allow children to have sex.
