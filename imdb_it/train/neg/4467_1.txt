<br /> <br /> I'm not sure who decides in which category a movie fits, but this movie is NOT a horror movie. As for the story, it was quite interesting, but rather slow. However, I was particularly disappointed with the ending. <br /> <br /> ** spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Tell me why on Earth he runs to his uncle's house (?) Without at least calling the detective or the police first? She knows exactly what is happening at that time, she also has a videotape as proof. Instead, he runs that way and starts to go crazy saying "I know everything, I have proof! You didn't expect the proof, did you ?!" Then she shows surprise when her uncle gets up and starts walking towards her as if he wants to hurt her. Well, DUH! Of course it will hurt you, you idiot, you just told him you know everything and you have the evidence to expose everything. What a stupid ending.
