0.5 / 10. This film has absolutely nothing to do with this movie. Acting is among the worst I've ever seen, what's really amazing is that EVERYONE is horrible, not just a few here and there, everyone. The direction is a joke, the low budget is irremediably evident, the score is terrible, I would not say that the film has been modified, brutally minced would be a more appropriate sentence. Combine serial killings, voodoo and tarot cards. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. It's not scary at all, the special effects are hopelessly lame. ridiculous evil everywhere. The writing was terribly bad. Cinematography is very cheap, sometimes very grainy, and the camera work is terrible. Again, what the film really does is how bad all the actors are. Cheesy.
