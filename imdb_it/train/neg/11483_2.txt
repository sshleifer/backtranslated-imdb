I was completely busy watching this movie. I was waiting a year to be cleaned up here in New Zealand. I shouldn't have invented so much because it was so disappointing and it is without doubt Clark's worst movie. There is so much wrong with this movie. First of all, some performances are great, in particular Nick Stahl in the role of "The Bully" and the girl with curly brown hair (I can't remember her name), but most were so out of the world and incredibly incredible , in particular Leo Fitzpatrick. He is a veteran of the Clark films now and was so brilliant in "Kids", but in "Bully" he invests his lines so solemnly that he virtually transforms his scenes into a parody. The script seemed to have been written by a first-year student. No excuse, a high school student ... one who has never seen a movie before. And I couldn't understand Clark's intentions. Was he trying to point out the insignificant existence of these guys? It certainly didn't stop him from getting into a damn good pervert. I'm not an idiot but I didn't need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still maintain that Clark's best film is "Another Day in Paradise". It's fantastic and I don't think it will ever pass.
