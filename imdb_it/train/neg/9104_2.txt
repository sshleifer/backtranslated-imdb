<br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie last night on Cinemax, I was shocked that it had been made. Cruel Intentions, in my opinion, was one of the best children's films set over the years. This prequel had some incongruous things with the original. (Sebastian's father got married in wealth, so why does he have a rich aunt on Long Island?) <br /> <br /> Then I found out today that it wasn't meant to be a new movie, but rather a television series, Manchester Prep After hearing it, it was logical for me that it wasn't the same thing as the movie, just like Buffy the Vampire Slayer is different in TV form. <br /> <br /> I think Roger Kumble has probably added the end of this film, AFTER the series hasn't been picked up by Fox. It looks like something that could happen too fast (Sebastian becomes the male version of Katharyn) and I don't know where they would go with the next episode, since it wouldn't lead to the 1999 movie (which the most recent end is directed to the right. < br /> <br /> One thing I didn't like is that he suggested that Sebastian and his father got married in wealth, which is generally not considered good in this area of ​​New York and Katharyn's mother was just a adult version of her, it didn't seem like something a woman in her position would do, marry a man who didn't belong to her social class. <br /> <br /> As a prequel, this is rather lame. But I would have been interested to see where it went as a series.
