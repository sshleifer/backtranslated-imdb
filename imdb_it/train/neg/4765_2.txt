While the original titillates the intellect, this economic remake is designed exclusively to shock sensibility. Instead of intricate weaves of plot, this so-called thriller shows only sudden and apparently random changes that serve only to further debase any bizarre development. The worst of all, replacing the original spicy dialogue is an upside-down saltshaker filled with useless four-letter words, leaving behind a raw but uninteresting taste. <br /> <br /> There was the promise: promise not kept. Michael Caine's perspective that brings out a Keller-to-Sullivan degree like Patty Duke is certainly intriguing. Unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor has only tarnished his reputation, first accepting the role in this horrible absurd rewriting and then transforming a performance that seems only competent with respect to Jude Law's amateur cheat. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the classic original, ignore the dated images and expedients. Defeat it, watch it and enjoy a story and a story. As for the remake, this insult passes to the original.
