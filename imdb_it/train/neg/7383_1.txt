I feel lucky to own what is known as the worst Steven Seagal film ever made. I knew I had something special when Steven opened his mouth and someone else's voice came out. Around the middle of the film my eyes started to hurt and I was almost falling off my chair with an uncontrollable laugh. Steven is Steven (with a changing voice) and totally unbelievable in his role (as always). Who the hell makes people with pony mullets with nappy hairs still in the Forces? He has also always identified himself with incredible love interests with women at least 20 years younger. The secondary actors all seem to be shot in the dark - btw, did they shoot this film in the dark with just a flashlight? <br /> <br /> This is truly abominable in every way possible. Invite all your friends around and create a social event out of it - this is really special.
