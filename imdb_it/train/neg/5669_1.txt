The director, staged in chains and in leather, warned the public at the SF Frameline Film Festival on Friday evening that we were about to see an "experiential" film. Experimental? Leave the camera on the back seat of the car, let the tape roll up and change into all the useless desolation of sight. A meandering roadster maniac who doesn't start anywhere and takes the public nowhere. The gratuitous violence that opens the film has led more than one patron from the Castro theater. I too would have left, but my friend-friend needed a ride home and he has this thing to see even the worst good to the end. When the lights got up, the audience thinned considerably. Warm applause Pro forma questions from the director that seemed satisfied with the product. Avoid this movie!
