STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Only the Mark is missing *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br /> <br /> Some plutonium has disappeared and some very unpleasant people now they have the means to develop a bomb capable of total destruction - so Josh McCord (Chuck Norris) and his shaggy young protégé Deke (Judson Mills, an actor different from the previous film) with the help of his adopted daughter of Jennifer Tung) decided to stop them. <br /> <br /> This was another film that dealt with terrorism a year after the events of September 11th. Shot in 2001, Norris himself commented later on how strangely the plot of the film resembled what happened in central New York that day, so there would have been those who would have been in the mood for a movie in which Norris and his kicked some kick asses if nothing else. In addition to this, it is interchangeable like any other Norris has ever been. It makes you wonder what the original was to justify a sequel in the first place, and if this could be made a President's Man 3 could come out soon. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a Norris movie, you've really seen them all and there's really nothing new or unexpected happening with this, but at least you know what you're getting and, as I said, it could to have been just what some needed to let off steam. **
