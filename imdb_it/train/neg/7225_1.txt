I sat through this film and I must say that he only managed to keep my attention. The film would have been a little more bearable if I hadn't had to look at the horrible CGI, for future reference to the industry if you're going to use CGI to watch this so you know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> Apparently this should be a graphic novel for the screen, but all I saw was a bad movie that bears no resemblance to a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> All in all, the story was not as bad as CGI, I was very impressed with the acting and I thought the casting was good and other information about the characters would have been nice because it confused me a bit for the occasion, but it's not surprising as I said, but it only caught my attention, but honestly I wish I'd given this a miss.
