Kurt Russell (as Steven Post) works as a mail-boy for the struggling UBC television station (which is the United Broadcasting Corporation); he's going nowhere at work, offering ridiculous projects like "Abraham Lincoln's Doctor's Dog" to the studio's executives - because Lincoln, the doctors and the dogs are popular. Programming director Joe Flynn (as Francis X. Wilbanks) wisely rejects Mr. Russell's proposals, but has no idea how to choose a successful television program. His secretary Heather North (in the role of Jennifer Scott), who does the double job as Russell's girlfriend, has a chimpanzee that sucks Russell when he wants to watch TV. Turns out, the monkey watches all the popular shows, and can easily choose the shots. Russell discovers the chimpanzee's talent and uses it to advance his career. Understandably, things become MAD for Russell and the cast! <br /> <br /> Raffles the chimpanzee (run by Frank Lamping) performs well; Raffles seems bored and / or distracted during some scenes, when the chimpanzee should seem interested; these may have been corrected with adjustments or modifications. A light satirical touch is present - imagine that a picking of monkeys has hit television programs! And, it's a monkey that gets a beer during commercials (drinking in a Disney movie)! A look through the cast will reveal a lot of fun TV actors to recognize and try to put. You could play a game in which to drink, in honor of the Raffles beer shake, guessing the actors and where you've seen them before. Here's a start - Hey, isn't this "Dr. Bellows" from "I Dream of Jeannie"? Down on the door! <br /> <br /> **** The Barefoot Executive (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
