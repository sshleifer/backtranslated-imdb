This is a simple but very manipulative story. The pathos is lacking because it leaves no room for imagination or personal thought or time to reflect. <br /> <br /> The animation is well done but it seems to me to be too presentative. I would have preferred more images from behind, more space in the background and maybe this wouldn't have seemed so kitsch to me. <br /> <br /> But for a Hollywood-style movie it works OK but it's very much derived from Aardman movies and that bothers me. Perhaps a longer movie will test if this producer can do without the voiceover. <br /> <br /> I think the voiceover is too silly.
