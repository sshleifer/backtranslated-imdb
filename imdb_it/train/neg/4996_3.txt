I really liked the first half hour of this movie but, wow, it has become commonplace, or should I say, "just stupid". This is just another example of obsolete humor. It may have been fun in 1940, but not now ... not even close. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always interesting to see. I particularly liked it when he started to switch from his boyish appearance and the high voice of Busby Berkeley's musicals to where he's mature and plays too. <br /> <br /> He was as good as "Jimmy MacDonald", but the rest the cast only played silly characters, the worst was the boss (Raymond Walburn) of the Maxford House Coffee Company, who did nothing but shout all the time . He was brutal in hearing and it was a big damage to the film.
