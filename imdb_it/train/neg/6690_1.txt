I sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations. My expectations weren't close enough. I honestly didn't know what kind of film this was from watching it, and if it was a comedy, the humor was completely missed. The plot was non-existent and the acting was horrendous. My friends and I managed to watch about 30/40 minutes of this movie before turning it off and we asked the video store to take it back. I do NOT recommend this movie to anyone, unless you are intentionally trying to watch the worst movies of all time. I honestly don't know how this film lasted more than a day in movie theaters and I also can't understand why someone would like to watch it, considering not only its uninteresting title but also the lack of famous cast actors / actresses. This review is not a joke and I honestly think this could be the worst movie ever made. It's definitely the worst movie I've ever had.
