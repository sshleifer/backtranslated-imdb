The whole film should have lasted 45 minutes, maximum. Although it is an interesting concept / theme, in reality it did not develop as a story. Once the initial idea of ​​a brave (stupid?) Bomb disposal expert (cowboy?) Is introduced, and this happens very early in the film, the rest is repetitive. The characters have not been explored, and aspects of the place and politics have been ignored. There was a good view of the terrible difficulties faced by troops in such an alien environment and the difficulties in distinguishing between friends and enemies. But the way the unit operated a tense belief! Individual performance was good and the special effects were adequate, but not enough to overcome the lack of basic content.
