It seems that Salvatores failed to decide what to do with this film: some are a very weak (and I say very, very weak) thriller, in part an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things have been tried with psychological thrillers, but in this case the film fails to hold things together, due to poor, superficial scripts, bad acting and too dark, too boring cinematography. I would say that Salvatores gave the best of other genres and in other contexts, where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. Overall, a B-movie, it's not worth spending your money ... Rate: 4/10
