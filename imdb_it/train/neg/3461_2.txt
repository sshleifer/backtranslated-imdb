Slasher films are often seen as derivatives, repetitive and frankly not original. I happened to be a fan of horror films, but this film was so poor, I miss the words. The script is seriously lacking, the plot is ridiculous, the acting incredibly ugly. Only a stinker in the round that I lost time in my life. This had all the entertainment value of a 15th sequel to a film that was terrible in the first place. <br /> <br /> Who has eclipsed this mess? <br /> <br /> I only liked two things in this movie. The first was the killer mask - which was pretty. The second was the Austrian affinity with vulgar humor. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and avoid this horrible mess.
