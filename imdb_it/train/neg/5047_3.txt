I wasn't really going to comment, but then I thought I had something to say. I saw this movie two days ago and, although I think it's not a complete waste of time (it could have been for the money, for the producers), it's obvious that it has serious problems. He has good cinematography and (little but) beautiful music. Much has been said about Ana Cristina Oliveira but, let's be honest, about what? She is not really an actress and permanently balances herself between over-acting and the absurd under-action. His performance goes on forever because there has never been anyone like Odete in any other film: crazy? sad? child? an impostor? nobody knows, comrades. So it's a bit like dictating the rules here. <br /> <br /> I thought this film was also a good example of the problem that many Portuguese films suffer from: the soundtrack. There is a permanent NO to dubbing and the result is this usual mass of noise that comes out of nowhere. People in other countries might think that Portugal is the noisiest of places. What has thrilled me, however, is that the dialogue has been nicknamed but has not necessarily solved the syndrome. Even the bad dubbing, I must say. It is strange to see a film in which the first thing that strikes me in the first scene, when the first character speaks is: it is nicknamed. And all this to say that the film has technical problems. <br /> <br /> It also has script problems. Try to be classic from the first to the last scene. There was a desperate fear of leaving things hanging and this show. The writer was obviously trying to do everything straight and he does it but ... show !! The whole dialogue is too explanatory and there is not a single piece of speech that looks like a joke in a movie. It's all a little raw and slightly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Not that the film is a total mess, I must stress. I just think the good parts are so obvious that I prefer to focus on the bad ones. <br /> <br /> Directing brings little to the weak screenplay. All the shots are classic and not innovative, but they are beautiful. Great job by Rui Po√ßas, by the way. <br /> <br /> Now, what I think was THE problem, what prevents people from believing this story and they laugh throughout the movie instead of taking it seriously: the guy who plays the guy that DIES is obviously not an actor. In fact, it's a pretty important role and I can't understand why non-actors are chosen for these parts. This boy is neither an actor nor a handsome man. Which means the whole movie rolls down the mountain, since we never believe for a second that this beautiful woman is obsessed with him even if he's gone, and that her hunky lover survives actually hurts to overcome the loss, when all we see of this character is apathy. Sin. The world is full of beautiful people who are also good seductive lovers. The world is full of good actors who are also nice kids and capable of causing obsessions about people after they are gone. The world is full of great movies and even not great films. That's life!
