Two days after seeing this, I'm still in agony to have seen it. It's so ugly, you have to ask yourself how someone can write this tripe, let alone leave it free to the general public. The acting in a dead-end position, an important man who looks like a sleepwalker, and Alison Eastwood who embarrasses herself. The action is indicative of low-budget films, which means that it is painfully bad. The plot? Well, if you were six, you could have written this movie. Simplistic, idealistic and simply lame.
