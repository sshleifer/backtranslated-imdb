Well, what was fun ... except for the fun part. <br /> <br /> It's my second favorite so far, I even thought it was worse than "Lazarus" and "Ghost in the Machine". <Br /> <br /> Let's start with the good. The teaser was incredibly well done and also emotional. Being the great animal lover I am, it was fun to see so many beautiful animals in this episode. <br /> <br /> But then there is all the evil, and believe me there is a lot. It didn't make sense, so those animals were kidnapped by aliens and impregnated? whaaa ??? the dialogue was also rather horrible. There were about one or two quotable lines. <br /> <br /> and worst of all, having practically all those animals that die was very unpleasant for me. In the end ... what's the point? they all practically died. We didn't learn anything, we weren't entertained, and I couldn't even find Sophia's death sad ... just very frustrating. <br /> <br /> * star. pity because the second season was going very well.
