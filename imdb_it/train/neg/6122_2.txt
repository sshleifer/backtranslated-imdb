Certainly one of the most reckless remakes of a classic in the history of cinema - especially since the promise of its tag-line, "The most beautiful woman of our time in the most erotic adventure of all time", is not even properly exploited! Although this film has been regularly shown on TV in my neck of the woods since my childhood, its notoriety (as for the horrible not erotic content, mind you) kept me away from it so far - and I just relaxed because I recently enjoyed Bo Derek previous film, 10 (1979), and watched a lot of fantasy stuff even during the Christmas season. <br /> <br /> The main actress / producer Bo Derek is rather ridiculous in the role of the innocent innocent student (witness the inept banana scene) and, as was to be expected, she was forced to take off the sometimes dressed but, welcome as these scenes, she became much more sensual in 10 than she does here; Richard Harris incessantly chews on the scenery as a father obsessed with Jane's explorer, but John Philip Law barely records his aide who obediently shows an initial interest in Jane herself; The newcomer Miles O'Keeffe has the lead role and only makes his entrance for 45 minutes in the film, he is completely silent in everything except for his famous yodel (which was however removed by Johnny Weissmuller!) And, moreover , it is as inexpressive as one of the trees that hangs at regular intervals during the second half of the film! for the record, he later starred in two films ATOR (or imitators of CONAN) for Joe D'Amato and the set of the era of King Arthur, SWORD OF THE VALIANT (1984). <br /> <br /> When still an actor, director John Derek (who is also his director of photography) had worked with some good directors (Cecil B. De Mille, William Dieterle and Robert Rossen) and some great directors (Otto Preminger, Nicholas Ray and Don Siegel), but he clearly learned from them how his direction of this is an important responsibility: sometimes terribly frightening (witness of the perfectly horrific attack sequence of the python) with an unnecessary excessive use of the technique in slow motion and cheese transitions; this was Derek's seventh film as a director (and the second of four with his wife Bo) and, eventually, he would only get two more. <br /> <br /> The total failure of the film must be measured only by the fact that the Tarzan legend was once again dealt with in the film - in GREYSTOKE: THE LEGEND OF TARZAN, LORD OF THE APES (which, enough surprisingly, I haven't looked at myself yet - just three years later !! Nominated for six Razzie Awards (including John Derek, Richard Harris and Miles O'Keeffe) and a winner for Bo Derek, TARZAN, THE APE MAN was co-scripted by Gary Goddard, the future director of another much awaited transposition but ultimately disappointing to the silver screen of a heroic figure (this time animated), MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE (1987) that I will see again today (yay)! Despite a fascinating credit closure sequence showing Tarzan and Jane playing with an orangutan and a soundtrack that is not bad at all and in fact every so late, late good intentions are defeated by an extremely silly climax that involves the natives who completely paint Bo white and, fatally, the clear disinterest of John Derek for the character of Tarzan himself who makes him a minor secondary character in his eponymous film !!
