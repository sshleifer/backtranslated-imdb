Fans of goremeister Herschell Gordon Lewis should look elsewhere if they are collecting this film for their usual buckets of blood being thrown around, because in this film there is little value on how to shed blood. Instead, Lewis decides to try telling the bizarre story, based on the special effects of the baseline fight on a budget that would probably have been doubled if the cast had revealed their pockets for change one day. Strangely, though cheap and with very bad interpretations (in particular McCabe as Mitchell), the total extravagance of the plot attracts attention everywhere. Imagine how this movie would have been on a decent budget! Overall, tense for champagne tastes on a beer budget.
