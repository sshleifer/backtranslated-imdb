Imagine the scenery: you're in the cinema just because you're in Washington for the weekend and it's raining and you're done with the museums. You think you could go see the Sarah Marshall movie while the trailer looks so-so and you don't have to get involved in your brain. It is out of stock. Options? - The Bank Job, In Bruges, The Leatherheads or Prom night. You've seen the work in the bank (surprisingly good robber movie) and In Bruges (again pretty good), so you're down to two. You don't like to watch Clooney or the friendly guy around the 1930 football uniforms, so go see the dance night right? Mistaken. Get $ 8.50, join a stranger in the street and ask them to punch you in the face for $ 8.50. It would be money better spent. <br /> <br /> Actually it sounds more like a comedy than a horror / thriller or whatever it should be. If I was funding that movie and they showed me that as a final cut I wouldn't know whether to laugh or cry. Probably both. An insult to anyone's intelligence ... my roommate was laughing out loud for most of the film, as well as for acting, they could also have cast (or maybe dogs) in the roles, they would have been more realistic . The detective must be perhaps the worst actor I've ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan (I hate his acting so much that I don't care how to spell his name) you're relieved by the title (i)) <br /> /> So in summary 'not good'
