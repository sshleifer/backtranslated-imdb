Pere is an idiot, but he is aware of it and acts accordingly. His life is totally boring and he doesn't know how to change it. When his last friend, Nicco, dies. He feels totally empty and decides to go out to get drunk. When he returns home, he crashes with a girl who advertises. Even if she ignores him, she falls in love and begins to follow her obsessively. Well, the beginning of the film is a bit slow and can be boring for most people. However, with the beginning of the action, it is a little better (not much!, Perhaps, the best part is the 5 minutes of sex (almost 30 different scenes about it) that you can see in the middle of the film, it's not good for eroticism, but for the fun and unexpected scene, it's probably the best in the film, neither the actors nor the director are good, and the result is a boring film that can be fun for some people (not for me). The whole film is based on absurd situations (idiot, as the film says), which have something interesting about it, I like Ventura Pons, but I have to admit that this is not one of his best films (maybe his worst!), He knows about do it better.
