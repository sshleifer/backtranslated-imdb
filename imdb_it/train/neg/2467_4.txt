This film gets both a 6/10 rating from me and a 9/10. Here's why: as a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd, where action, blood and fears are taken into consideration, this movie will bore you. It's basically a family drama similar to what you'd see on the Lifetime channel, but inserted into a horror universe. History and formula are ancient, reconstructed hundreds of times. If you are looking for originality in the texture of the plot or minimal conflicts, you will be disappointed. Take away the zombies and you'll have something as melodramatic as A Beautiful Mind, stumbling over cheese. This is 6/10. <br /> <br /> However, the synopsis and the basic idea are quite original and exaggerated. It's literally something that you and your friends joke about when you're half-drunk. . . but that joke actually had a theatrical release. The idea gets a 9/10 from me. The only reason it isn't perfect is because they could have taken it even further, but they didn't. <br /> <br /> The mix of both is mixed. I thought it was funny, but like most comedies, it wasn't so funny. I showed my mom and my little sister with me and the jokes we made were more fun than the scripted lines. There were moments of absolute genius, but there were also moments of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope that other films take this kind of risk and original ideas. I can't say it was perfect, or even close, due to the lack of originality of the plot. <br /> <br /> A GREAT film for families. A great movie to watch with a group of boys (or girls). A great movie to watch with anyone. . . but if you look at it alone, it will be a bit boring. Other people make this kind of movie more and more fun and rich. <br /> <br /> 4/10
