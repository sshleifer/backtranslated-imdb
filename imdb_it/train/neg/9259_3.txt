"The Omen 4: The Awakening" is a sequel created for the television of the original film "The Omen". Instead of Satan who owns the body of a little boy, he has the body of a little girl adopted by rich parents, bullied at school and who end up taking revenge on those who make mistakes. The film seems to struggle with any horror factor, and many of the events that happened are simply silly rather than particularly scary, and it's hard to believe that this little girl is Satan, even with all the events surrounding her. I did not find this film very full of suspense or fear, particularly compared to the original.
