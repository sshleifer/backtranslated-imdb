I watched this film, along with all the other adaptations I could get my hands on, including seeing theatrical performances, in preparation for some academic research. Cinematography is very moving, as is music. Unfortunately, all life has been taken from history. I've never seen such a horrible portrait of Mr. Rochester. All his most fundamental traits have disappeared. Where is his spirit? Where is his passion? Scott's Rochester looks more like that of Rochester, St. John, than the novel's character. In fact, the actor who plays St. John in this adaptation has played a passionate St. John while Scott is content to destroy things or simply to fix the ceiling (which he always does). I have no idea what they were thinking. I would like to give this film a slightly higher grade based on wonderful music and cinematography, but I honestly can't stand to see this movie for too long due to George C. Scott's performance.
