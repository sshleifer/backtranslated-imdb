No, you're basically looking at something that doesn't make sense. In order not to ruin the film for people who really want to take a look at the film, I'll explain the story. <br /> <br /> A normal everyday woman is walking down the street, then finds herself driving her car. She follows her and many events take place during that time that includes her and her family. <br /> <br /> I made a specific account to comment on this film, about how horribly it was written. The acting was great, the events were great, but the story didn't get her anywhere - it could be added to tremendous and be turned into a world epidemic. I'm not sure what the writer was trying to get by doing this, usually at the end of the movies most of your questions get answers but this movie asks you, What just happened and 1 hour and 20 minutes just passed for nothing . /> <br /> Spoiler Starts__ <br /> <br /> They had this area between 2 dimensions (ours and behind the glass) that would come into our world and kill us. It was not processed throughout the film, and you never know how it was happening or why it was or when it happened. Nothing is explained during the film. The main character should not even be the main character. At the end of the film, the guy who finally manages to understand everything and runs away (his sister boyfriend) should be the main character, but unfortunately the film ends 20 seconds later. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for $ 10, threw it out right after ... don't waste time. I really hope that nothing like this is done again.
