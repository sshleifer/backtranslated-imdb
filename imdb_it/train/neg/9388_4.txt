The former private security guard abandoned his last buzz and was immediately offered the chance to return to his previous profession. His assignment: to chain a mysterious French woman just arrived in California ... and apparently sought after by charlatans in suits and ties. Unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre, without enough sting or wit (or involving plot dynamics) in the script. The director and co-writer Paul Magwood (who later declared that the photo had been published without his involvement) did not give the impression of having a great respect for the films of the 40s of which his "Chandler" was originally ; his nostalgia is appropriately wrinkled, but also bitter and a little indifferent. The treatment is curiously commendable and Warren Oates is well interpreted as this variant of the '70s on the' private dick 'archetype, but the film has no snapshot. It's nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast - although neither has much to do, and the hot and cold character of Caron is infuriating. Alan Stensvold's cinematic vibe, beautiful location shot, but no boiling. * 1/2 from ****
