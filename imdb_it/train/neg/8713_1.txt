Everything in this film is ugly, the story, the acting, the effects, but it's fun, funny, fun !!! Scott Valentine in the army uniform which is ten dimensions too big is so bad with the permanent attempt of a frown on his face as the head of a special operations group is hilarious! The "terrorists" are as frightening and realistic as the "raptors", this is so fake and bad in everything that tries to laugh. The part where the T-REX giant that somehow sneaked aboard a ship then somehow burst and you see the metal pole sticking to where his head was, the perfect ending. If you are in bad movies, this is the pot of gold, the mona lisa of bb-bad !!!
