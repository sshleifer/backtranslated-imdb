Imagine you are portraying the mask of a lethal assassin and finding Barbara Cartland there ... that's what happens with this movie. <br /> <br /> The opening showed a promise, but soon everything will end up being a thriller (or even an imaginative love story) and the only reason why they made this story becomes abundantly clear: fill a gap in their female observation market creating another remake of "bad boy discontent and sheaf" (Andrei) meets the innocent, extravagant beauty '(Paula). <br /> <br /> Instead of wasting time in creating an original premise, the filmmakers went straight for the stroke of luck: the bad guy is tamed by that extravagant beauty. Following is a series of insincere and heavily cliché love scenes sprinkled with pseudo-philosophical / poetic fluff. Andrei's admission of being (eponymously) a "poet" is exploited to complement the perceived qualities that a Byronic hero should have - but even when we are told in heavy writing and emphasized who and what is, it is still difficult to believe - or attention. <br /> <br /> To make a Byronic hero / anti-hero work, history needs subtlety, style and innovation - which are absolutely absent here. This is not a phantom of today's Opera, it is just what happens when a weak and rather silly woman (with a rubber band in underwear) goes out with a bad man, who, after having met her, looks as dangerous as the rabbit slippers. <br /> <br /> The performances may have saved this film, had they been good: the female protagonist is worried about looking sexy and "otherworldly", no matter how forced or ridiculous; and poor Dougray Scott seems to have been drugged while he takes his share. This is not his best job. The glimmers of interest were brought by Jürgen Prochnow as "Vashon" and Andrew Lee Potts as the young photographer / brother. A better film would have offended her sister and kept her brother.
