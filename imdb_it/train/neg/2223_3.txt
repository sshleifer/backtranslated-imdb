Trite, dialogues and clich√© diagrams (the same kind of things we've seen in all 80s fantasy movies), hockey music and characters with many numbers to paint this out of the circle for all the hardcore fans. <Br /> <br /> What saves this film from the garbage pile is the beautiful crutch of Bakshi's work, rotoscoping, and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught animators how to draw like him. This is Frazetta ... on the move. The violence is spectacular and the artistic direction and animation are different from any other sword and witchcraft film of the period. <br /> <br /> I like to watch this with the sound turned off, instead of playing the soundtrack of the first Conan movie.
