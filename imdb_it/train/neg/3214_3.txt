First of all, I would like to tell you that I deal with comics, anime, animation and things like that. It is true that everyone has their preferences, but you can trust me in this film. I will be objective. To start with the story, that's fine. The comic book plot follows as far as I am familiar with. But the animation ... Well, actually it's not terrible, but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be much better if they did not try to imitate the anime style and adhered to the original comic-style designs. If we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightning we could say that the film was made about 10 years ago and even more. It looks a bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985. Check out Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for example - 4 years ago they made a film that looks much better! Moreover, the talents of the voice do nothing exceptional, the music is nothing special. So all in all - no atmosphere. I looked at it, but I can't say I really liked it. It just doesn't catch you. There is a lot of blood and violence, but this does not impress me at all. It might be shocking for someone who has never seen the most mature animations and sees blood animated for the first time (is there anyone around?), But I don't think this is the audience for this movie. So they could add some nudity and spice to it. The chicks around Lucifer were quite tasty and, hell, we have the same Lady Death! There are few sexy looks, but it's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music I think it would be better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. All in all - the film is not so bad, but if you want something better, take the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, maybe even Fire and Ice or Wizards by Ralph Bakshi. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
