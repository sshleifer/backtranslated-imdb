What a poor image of professional police officers is displayed on television while watching this supposed reality show. One can only hope that the actual reasonable suspicion that leads to a probable cause leading to the totality of the circumstances involved in making a "stop", then the "Pat Down" of the exterior of one's Garment, thus of being able to articulate because the officer went into someone's pocket and recovered the smuggling, he was cut off from the scene, because if he wasn't, stopping in most places would be tossed around if a supervisor were to be passed. A notification of a mandate on the radio does not constitute the actual existence of the mandate, unless the sending person does not have the original mandate in hand. If the dispatcher is reading from a computer print, it is good enough for a shutdown, but it does not necessarily mean that the mandate is still in effect. Since I didn't see a CBS dis-claimer (maybe I lost it), CBS could be in trouble.
