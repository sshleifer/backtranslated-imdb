Race car drivers say that 100 mph looks fast until you've driven 150, and 150 mph looks fast until you've driven 250. <br /> <br /> OK. <br /> <br /> Andalusian dog looks bizarre breathtaking until you've seen Eraserhead, and Eraserhead looks incredibly bizarre until you've seen Begotten. <br /> <br /> And Begotten seems incredibly bizarre until you've seen the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. Racing fans, there is NOTHING in the whole film world like the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. <br /> <br /> The Alabama's Ghost is as close to its films as it is to a coherent plot, and involves only hippies rock concerts, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, magicians, corrupt multinational corporations, elephants and Mystery Gas . And the Fabulous Woodmobile, of course, that runs through the Sunset District in San Francisco. <br /> <br /> What's really surprising is that someone gave him a lot of money to make Alabama's Ghost. There are sets, lights, hundreds of extras, costumes, lots and lots of effects. Somehow this makes Alabama's Ghost so wrong. You look at some terrible cheeseballs like Night of Horror or Plutonium Baby, and at least part of the strangeness is excusable based on the fact that they were obviously pulling the film out of the margin on their Discover cards. But Alabama's Ghost was made on a real budget, and that's BAD. I mean, I have a script of a tribe of cannibals that lives in Thunder Bay, Ontario, that builds a secret temple in the woods of Twizzlers, and nobody beats my door by waving a checkbook - like this guy did to take the funds for FOUR of the most refined films ever made?
