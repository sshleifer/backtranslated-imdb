This was marked by potentially large very short games. <br /> <br /> The opening match was a waste of the Legion of Doom, but I imagine the only way they could have been eliminated from Demolition was a double DQ. Otherwise, Mr. Perfect would have to work overtime. Kerry von Erich, the I-C champion, was wasted here. And this was the third ppv in a row in which Perfect jobbed. Remember, before he never lost a game. <br /> <br /> The second game was very good, perhaps the best of the evening. Ted DiBiase and Undertaker were excellent, while Jim Neidhart had one of his highlights at WWF, which nailed the Honky Tonk Man. Koko B. Ware continued his tradition of being the first to put a new heel on (remember the Big Bossman and Yokozuna?). This was an omen of the career of the singles of Bret Hart, when he returned from two against one and almost survived the game. He and DiBiase set up a wrestling clinic, making us forget that the point of the game was DiBiase's boring feud with Dusty Rhodes. <br /> <br /> Although the Visionaries were the first team to make all its members survive (and only the second from 1987 to have four survivors), this match was not a pumpkin. This was the longest game of the evening, and Jake repeated his '88 performance when he was left alone against four men and dominated. I think he could actually look upset. These days, the game would have ended otherwise. <br /> <br /> One of the shortest SS matches ever was also one of the most surprising. Probably the most undervalued wrestler ever, Tito Santana was the inspirational wrestler of the night, he wore war paint and immobilized Boris Zukhov, Tanaka and even the Warlord in the last survival game. It was so strange to see him put so overwhelmingly, then return to his mediocre career. Sgt. Slaughter also did well, getting rid of Volkoff and Bushwhackers, but it was no surprise. Tito was. <br /> <br /> I think the only point of the survival game was to have Hogan and Warrior win together in the end. <br /> <br /> This show was boring and even the games were short. The Undertaker debut was nice, but Tito Santana is the reason I will remember this.
