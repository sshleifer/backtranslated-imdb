The quality of the video is terrible. The sound quality is pathetic. The acting is horrible. Dialogue is painful. The lighting is dismal. Assembly is ridiculous. I could go on, but it would be useless. Snitch is a third-class amateur video that is broadcast as a movie. This is best left to collect dust in the video archive bin.
