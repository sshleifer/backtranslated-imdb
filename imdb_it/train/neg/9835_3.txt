Before explaining the comment of "Alias" let me say that "The Desert Trail" is negative also for the western standards that set The Three Stooges. In fact, Carmen Laroux is the semi-bad girl Juanita, when you hear her Mexican accent you'll immediately recognize her as Senorita Rita from the classic Stooge short "Saved by the Belle". <br /> <br /> In "The Desert Trail" John Wayne plays the character of Moe Howard and Eddy Chandler plays Curly Howard. Like their Stooge counterparts, a gag that runs throughout the 53-minute movie is Moe hitting Curly. The character of Wayne, a skirt that chases the bully, is not very eye-catching, but should be the good guy. <br /> <br /> In the role of a rodeo cowboy on the road, Wayne raises the rodeo box office under the threat of weapons and takes the prizes he would have won if the proceeds of the presences were good - the other pilots had to settle of 25 cents dollar (actually even less after Wayne robs the box office). No explanation is given for Wayne who rips off the knights and is still considered the hero who gets the girl. <br /> <br /> Things get complicated at this point because the villain (Al Ferguson) and his helper Larry Fine (played by Paul Fix - who would play Sheriff Micah in "The Rifleman") see Wayne steal the box office and then steal the rest of the money and kill the rodeo manager. Moe and Curly are accused. <br /> <br /> So Moe and Curly move to another city to escape from the law and change their names to Smith and Jones. Who they meet before, but their old friend Larry, whose sister becomes the 2nd half of love interest (Senorita Rita is left behind the old city and makes no further appearances in the film). <br /> <br /> Larry's sister is played by a beautiful Mary Kornman (now grown up, but in her younger days she was one of the original casts of Hal Roach's "Our Gang" short films). Kornman is the main reason to watch the mega-western blades and his scenes with Moe and Curly are much better than all the others in the production, as if they used a completely different troupe to film them. <br /> <br /> Also for 1935 the action sequences of this thing are extremely weak and the technical film is incredibly bad. The two chase scenes conclude with archive footage of a knight falling from a horse. Both times the editor cuts a shot of one of the characters rolling on the floor, but there is no horse in the frame, the film is completely different and the character has different clothes than the stuntman's. There is a liberal use of archive material in other places, none of them even remotely convincing. <br /> <br /> One thing to look at is a scene in the middle of the movie where Moe and Curly get on their horses and leave (to the right of the screen) from a cabin while the posse is galloping towards the cabin from left . The cameraman follows the two minions with a slow pan to the right and then whips left to reveal the approaching team. Outside of home movies I've never seen anything like it, not because it's stupid (which it does), but because a competent director would never stage a scene like this. They would have filmed the two runners at the start and then they would have repositioned the camera and filmed the group that was approaching as a separate action. Or if they felt creative, they would stage the sequence so that the camera would show the knights in the foreground and the teams approaching in the background. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
