I saw it in two days before the official opening, and I must say that I was extremely disappointed. And I have to put most of these problems on the decision to sue Claire Danes in the lead role. Depending on what you think of Danes, it was horribly misplaced, or so insane that it should be the first favorite for Razzie for the worst actress of 2007. I think we should be sympathetic to her. Instead, it is completely unlikely. The other "big" actresses do a good job, but they certainly don't light up the screen. Of all the "great" actresses in this film, I would say that the one who did the best job was Natasha Richardson. Streep is barely in the figure and appears only towards the end. <br /> <br /> Even the script is horrible. It comes out more when they read the lines rather than "in the character".
