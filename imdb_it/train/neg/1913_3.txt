"Welcome to Collinwood" is a kind of disaster. Considering the people involved, it should have been better times. <br /> <br /> Watching him, if you're at least a little attached to the confidence that he'll be better, he'll probably make you cry. It is one of those films that have potential, but has been robbed of this potential thanks to a terrible script and bad acting, not to mention the strangely annoying and useless character of George Clooney and the guy who reminds me of Richard Dreyfuss but whose I care so small that I don't even want to know his name. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves is the bizarre conical vocabulary it introduces. I found myself thinking about it over and over as I watched other capers criminals. This is the only reason I gave the film to 3. The plot is boring, the characters are neurotic, needlessly offensive and highly unlikely. I am in a constant state of distressing stress and they are all so irritating that I have celebrated their obstacles. They shout at each other and swear. Dialogue is tasteless at best and insultingly stupid at its least. <br /> <br /> I find that Steven "Traffic" Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney are the cause of this. They should be tried for war crimes, if someone actually remembers this shit long enough to worry.
