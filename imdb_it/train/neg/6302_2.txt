The British film industry is out of control. There is nothing wrong with filming classic novels, but why should they all be filmed by people without talent? This film takes the courage of Orwell's difficult novel, turning it into a harmless and soft romantic comedy. "Aspidistra" may not be Orwell's best work, but no one who reads it can forget its superb representation of poverty. Orwell emphasizes not only cold and hunger, but the humiliation of being poor. In the novel, London is a desolate, gray, cold and ruthless city, and Comstock begs to blow it up from a squadron of bombers. But this film plays down anything that could somehow disturb and instead creates a nostalgic journey to the fascinating London of the 1930s, where everything is illuminated by golden rays, and even the slums of Lambeth are picturesque and full of fresh urchins and happy prostitutes. Comstock's poems about the sharp wind that runs through the trash-strewn streets seem completely out of place in this world of chocolate boxes. The worst thing is the bizarre goodness of the script, the ancient jokes and the clunking dialogue. It's so frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock, and the film is full of great actors. But it's all for nothing. This movie made me so angry! British literary history is something to be proud of for its richness, complexity and power. And what do we do with it? We employ very few people to turn it into a soft, anodyne mess for people who want to hear that they are "acquiring culture" while they drink their horlick and doze silently.
