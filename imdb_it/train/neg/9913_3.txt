This is one of those cheap TV movies where characters seem to lose all sense. The premise of the story, the kidnapping of a child by the boy's father, is very good. But the story seems only a beggar's belief. Whenever the mother is advised not to do anything that you know well, she will. It's a bit far-fetched and not worthy of a vision.
