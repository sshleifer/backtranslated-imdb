As soon as I started seeing posters and heard about this film, I was immediately excited. The Matrix was incredible to see and I was looking forward to seeing the second one, especially after starting to see trailers for other films. However, when I saw it, I left the theater extremely disappointed, as did many other movie goers with me. While the action scenes of the film were incredible as always, there were simply a few. In the first film there were continuous fights, but the second one had a much more (and very unfortunate) point of preaching. To sum up the plot, there was not much to expect. The machines were digging towards Zion with the intention of destroying it (it's not a spoiler, they all saw it in commercials). The dialogue of the film was absolutely horrendous. Unless you are a specialist in psychology, you most likely will not understand much of what is said in the film, and for that it simply will not interest him. It has become a bit of a romantic movie with the projection of events happening in the lives and relationships of Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith, however ugly he was in the first film, seemed to become religious and beloved. Personally, I don't need to hear it or pay to listen to it. The film was a serious waste of my time and I don't think I can watch the first one anymore. The boring and dry dialogue and monologues of virtually all the characters made me lose interest in the film quickly, and the small amount of fighting scenes pushed me closer to the limit, and the ending of the film prompted me immediately. What movie ends with "To Be conclused"? How original those people are. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers had to burn midnight oil to make it up. In conclusion, the film was bad and this is the end.
