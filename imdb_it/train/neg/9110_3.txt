I watched this movie at 3 am, a time when I'm usually very open when it comes to movies. But still I think it was not good, this film was not good at all. The reasons why they are many. <br /> <br /> The acting is not that good, and from time to time the situations that occurred reminded me of a Chevy Chase comedy from the 90s. I mean, come on, like the handcuff situation, and the domestic poker situation ... This film was so obviously very much based on the first, and that's OK. But if I hadn't seen the first one before seeing it, it would have sucked even worse. Like the finale, it came very suddenly, and it seemed to me that I had never closed what ever ... Sebastian suddenly changed, and this film seems made to explain only nr 1, and how no time or effort was used to make anything else good. The score is the same as the first, and it didn't look like a movie at all ... <br /> <br /> They should have handled the situations with more style and class, but they didn't, and therefore, this film turned out to be bad ...
