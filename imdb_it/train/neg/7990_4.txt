'Anita and Me' is a drama about growing up in multi-ethnic Britain, rather like 'Piegalo come Beckham', or more closely, 'Est Ã¨ est', with which it shares a setting from the 70s. The tone is resolutely chirping (despite the severe accents of the Black Country), but the film lacks "East is East's vigor and the result seems rather thin and banal. Moreover, the portrait of the central relationship of the film, between an Asian girl and his white friend is not deep enough to justify the way the film is structured around it.I also got tired of films where heroes are years of a writer, this is of course often something that real writers have experienced , but hardly a cool element in a fantasy story. 'East is east' was fun and sharp, 'Anita and Me' seems obvious and boring by comparison.
