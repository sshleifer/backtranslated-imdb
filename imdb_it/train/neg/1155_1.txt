never before has a film prompted me to write a review, but this was just terrible. I tried to find out what it was this film that pushed him to choose it as his first serious role, but frankly it was a wrong choice. he did a good book but it certainly didn't work for me as a movie. I found it incredible, lacking in atmosphere and I found many of the horribly rigged scenes. A musical master might be but a serious actor not to poke his nose. by Dylan mcdermott and rose byrne was acceptable but not enough to bring a weak plot with a weak dialogue. maybe I just completely lost the point, but for me it didn't fit into any genre, it didn't arouse any empathy with the characters, nor did it create any suspense, in fact I found myself praying for the end and suppressing a deep desire to slap all three the main characters!
