I couldn't wait to see Planet of the Apes, but it was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> Settings and masks are fantastic, but this is the only positive aspect of the film. All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg does not act, he is alone in the film, he looks stupid. The other actors are not very good either. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing of all is history. It's absolutely ridiculous! For example: monkeys are lying on the ground for no reason, but humans don't attack them, no, they wait for it to get up! This is just an example for the stupid story, but it would take too long to tell everyone.
