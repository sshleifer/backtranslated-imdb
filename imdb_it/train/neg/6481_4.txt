Since the Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was a kid, I was curious about its sequel. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid (one) is a classic animated film with all the best quality, great score music and is aimed at a general audience. In contrast, Little Mermaid 2 is aimed primarily at small children, because it is spontaneous, reflects a child's self-perspective, music is strong and less dramatic, and the ending seems like a pause. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid 2 starts when little Melody is introduced to Ariel's family. Abruptly with no visual signal to help the drama, a giant tentacle seizes the child. I laughed, wait a minute is not fun, the child is attacked! Ok, I'll stop laughing. Morgana's crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity takes away the potential drama since it happened so quickly. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Melody looks superhuman, which I defend is like most children imagine themselves. This quality in Melody's character is clearly brought to an end when she fights Morgana without a minimum of fear on her face. <br /> <br /> Like the first film, Melody has many problems with Ariel, except the opposite. Queen Ariel turns out to be like her father limiting her from the ocean, while King Triton limited Ariel from the surface. Ariel and Melody both rebel against their parents. <br /> <br /> Music is more exciting in the first. This sequel has a lot of songs, but not so much orchestral work. It's great for the little ones because it doesn't require an orchestra to impress them. <br /> <br /> The finale of the first film was strong and uplifting. The sequel ends with a bouncing song and everyone plays in the water. It is definitely more aimed at children, because instead of the end is solemn and leaves you speechless, this ending lets you think: "It's withdrawal time!" Ultimately, this movie is fun for kids, so we should let them have fun.
