I'm now looking at pink (Serbia TV station) and I have to say it's crap. Shallow, no acting, too sloppy effects I mean, who made this series? <br /> <br /> This was a stupid attempt by the Studios to make some money for the success of the film. OK. The film was great in 1994 when it came out. But the series? <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can see how stupid the lines are in the character talk. I mean, did they really pay someone to write that, was anyone related to the studio? This is not a SciFi. <br /> <br /> The film was the bomb, the series sucks.
