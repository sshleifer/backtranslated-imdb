Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she hoped for when she goes to a pool party with a nice colleague. When her friend and her friends joke that they belong to a "Murder Club", Maddy takes her seriously and goes straight to "Level 3" by beating a woman's brain in a parking lot (to dent her car!) But is Maddy the one who wears a plastic mask and kills other members of the group or someone else lost it? <br /> <br /> The plot of this film (originally titled MAKE 'EM BLEED) is very little conceived full of holes and spirals completely out of control before a ridiculous twist, left hand out ends. Some of the dialogues are definitely ridiculous. I had no problems with Rochon's performance, but the supporting cast was atrocious. However, I managed to completely sit down with this version of Full Moon. There is a lot of skin and blood and it is the perfect type of shot to sit with a group of friends and choose. Fans of horror can also appreciate the cameos of Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (like Debbie's parents) and Julie Strain (an early victim). <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
