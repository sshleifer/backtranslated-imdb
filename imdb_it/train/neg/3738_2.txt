This is what the title should be, however. <br /> <br /> This film combines guns, explosives and mindless kills to make a flop of an "action" movie. Allow me to express my point on a series of questions: business-like answers. <br /> <br /> What happens in the film? People die. <br /> <br /> Is that so? Yes. <br /> <br /> What is the plot about? What plot? <br /> <br /> What is the point the film is trying to make? Killing is the only solution. <br /> <br /> How are the characters? Extremely imperfect and contradictory towards their personalities. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this movie? Yes. I'm sure they used some nice Panavision cameras to film it. <br /> <br /> If you like continuous killing and greed, then watch the movie. If you are rejected by such a little standard "entertainment", then "Made Men" is not for you. <br /> <br /> To summarize, the plot stinks, the characters are not worth it, the plot is completely resilient and nothing fits. <br /> <br /> This shows one thing: the actors, directors and anyone who has contributed to making this film are certainly not "Made".
