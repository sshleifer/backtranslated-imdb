In short, the film had a slight first act with some forced acting and a somewhat disjointed rhythm and rhythm, a bit of a decent act that managed to create a little tension and intrigue despite some inconsistencies and some performances lower than the cast and the 3rd act ... there was practically no third act! <br /> <br /> As for the 3rd act, the film ends abruptly. There is no resolution and no way out of the 2nd act climax, so there has not been much of a third act. The bad guys just die; the roll of credits. There is nothing to show what happens to the protagonist and the supporting characters and so on. The public would probably have left the theater after the film, asking "is this so?" A real disappointment. <br /> <br /> The music was composed by David Bell who worked well enough to serve the film most of the time, but it is certainly nothing exceptional. It's just functional, but it gets it simply being generic and derivative. It is also evident that the score is VERY dated with the use of eardrums synthesized for some of the percussion. What less impressed me about the score is that some moments of tension announce musical signals as if they had been taken from James Horner by "48 HRS". and "Commando", in particular the brass. <br /> <br /> In general, the film had potential as the basic story is good, but the performance was poor with mediocre direction, weak acting and a rather inconsistent rhythm. <br /> <br /> There was practically no third act to correctly terminate the story, and this omission is important and unforgivable as it does not allow the film to finish satisfactorily. This could be the script or, perhaps, the production had to cut the footage or change the third act in the finished film due to budget constraints (but I'm speculating as to why there is no third act). Whatever the reason, the abrupt ending really hurts the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> This is good for a view if you are curious and you can get the movie for VERY cheap as well as discover why WHY you need to have the 3 acts (start, middle, end) if you write scripts and do movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise you may not want to waste time unless you can get the MST3K version to get at least some laugh.
