What is * bliep * with this movie? Couldn't they bother a better script? All in all a 'beautiful' movie, but ... it was done more than once ... Until the end I thought it was ok, but ... the return to the previous part ... * barf * SO HAPPY .. I was waiting for the fairy mother god to appear ... but wow, it didn't happen ... which is good. <br /> <br /> I loved Big with Tom Hanks, but to see a movie like that in a new form with another guy who wanted to be older / older; it's just so pas√© <br /> <br /> Just watch until it shows on TV. Don't get me wrong, but that's not all
