The concept of Sarafina seems to be a sound, apart from the musical perspective. Try to combine cheerful African music with a story that describes the atrocious conditions and the atmosphere that blacks were forced to endure when the film was set. The contradictions of each of the two elements are too obvious and the film never justifies such rapid changes between jubilation and terror. If it were simply a drama that reflected these conditions, it could have been a good movie, but the scenes of school-age children killed by soldiers are not placed exactly next to the songs. <br /> <br /> In addition to the premise, the acting is not the best, Goldberg offers a mediocre performance like the rest of the cast. Overall a disappointment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
