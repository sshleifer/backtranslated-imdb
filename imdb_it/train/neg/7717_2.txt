When I heard the plot of this movie I simply had to see it, I mean whole cities wiped out by killer tomatoes! Unfortunately the title is as funny as it is. <br /> <br /> Led by Detective Dick Mason, a special team of military and scientists (including Greg Colburn who never takes off his SCUBA outfit and the Lt. Finletter that is never in the picture without his parachute behind ) "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes" is a parody of B-Movies, especially Japanese horror films from the 1950s. The film starts with a standard-sized tomato that is discovered by a woman who washes herself in her kitchen before we find ourselves in the middle of a crime scene, since the tomato has supposedly killed this lady, and let me tell you that doesn't get any saner while the movie progresses! To be honest there are a couple of funny moments, for example every time the Japanese scientist Dr Nokitofa talks about his voice being dubbed into an American accent, or when the disguise expert Sam Smith infiltrates the tomatoes' hey, someone can you please pass on ketchup? ' . In the same way this film was probably a lot more fun in 1978 with all its so good concept. Unfortunately for the 'Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes' spy movies like the 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun' series have been released and made this kind of comedy a lot better since then. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious; there is no continuity in the editing and it seems really slow and lacking in energy. To make a parody work, you need a lot of things at once, a gag after the end. The singing in the film seems pointless and the advertisements for the flashing furniture store are damn bizarre, even for this movie. In the end, however, you can understand why this film is a cult one; I can't see many people being indifferent to it. Unfortunately, the way I would like to summarize would be terrible.
